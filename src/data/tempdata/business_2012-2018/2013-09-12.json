      "bodyText": "Vodafone is to take control of Germany's largest cable company after Kabel Deutschland shareholders voted in favour of a buyout. The \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.5bn) acquisition is a milestone in Vodafone's strategy to counter declining revenues by selling mobile phone subscriptions alongside television, home telephone and broadband services. Vodafone said that the required minimum of 75% of Kabel shareholders had voted to accept its \u20ac87 per share offer, which includes a \u20ac2.50 dividend payment. In a statement, Vodafone said: \"The 75% minimum acceptance condition has been met.\" They added that a definitive tally of shareholders who had not accepted its terms would be published on Monday. Concerns were raised that Vodafone's bid would fall at the final hurdle after hedge funds piled into Kabel's stock hoping to squeeze a higher price from the British company. The hedge fund Elliott Capital Advisors doubled its stake in the German group to 10.9% last week, but Vodafone warned that it would not lower the threshold for acceptances or sweeten its offer. The deal gives Vodafone, the largest mobile network in Germany with 32m subscribers, access to 7.6m cable subscribers. Kabel's television service includes 32 free-to-air television channels, 100 digital TV channels and an array of radio channels, sold via individual contracts with customers or collective deals with apartment block landlords and housing corporations. Following the $130 (\u00a384bn) sale of its 45% stake in America's largest mobile phone network, Verizon Wireless, which will see 71% of the proceeds returned to shareholders, Vodafone will have a \u00a330bn war chest with which to pay down debt, improve its networks and fund further takeover deals. The company has committed \u00a36bn over the coming three years to Project Spring, pushing out 4G network coverage to 90% of the population in its five main European markets by 2017. Vodafone has extended the deadline for acceptances for Kabel shareholders still holding out against its offer. Hedge funds occasionally choose to remain minority shareholders in a takeover, gambling that the buyer will offer a higher price for the final few shares in order to take full control. Minority Kabel shareholders have until midnight on 30 September to hand over their shares. The deal must also be approved by European commission regulators. The announcement came as Vodafone's German mobile business sought to reassure customers after a hacker stole the names, addresses and bank account numbers of two million customers. Vodafone warned customers the details could be used to obtain further information with which bank accounts could be hacked, and that the data must have been obtained by individuals working at the company. \"This attack was only possible with the utmost criminal energy as well as insider knowledge and happened deep within the IT infrastructure of the company,\" Vodafone said. The investigation was reportedly looking into a person who was working for a sub-contractor for Vodafone's administration system. Vodafone's revenues in Europe have been sliding as economic woes take their toll on its Italian, Spanish and Greek businesses. Cuts to call costs, both for the price of calling a mobile from a landline and for making calls while travelling within the European Union has reduced revenues even in resilient markets like the UK and Germany. With mobile phone ownership now at saturation point in Western markets, networks are looking for new sources of growth. In the UK, Vodafone has already acquired the British assets of Cable &amp; Wireless, which add miles of fiber-optic cables with which to connect mobile phones to the internet, and a telecoms business selling services to corporate and public sector clients. Colao's strategy At first glance Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao's strategy is a head scratcher. He has sold an immensely valuable investment in Verizon Wireless, the largest mobile phone company in the world's richest market, only to spend the money buying up assets in recession-hit Europe.

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail staff set to strike after ministers unveil plans for \u00a33bn sell-off", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail staff are set to disrupt postal services in a rolling programme of strikes after ministers unveiled plans for a \u00a33bn privatisation of the postal service within six weeks. As the government embarked on a state sell-off, confirming the sale of at least half of Britain's 497-year-old postal service, the Communications Workers Union warned it was planning a series of strikes that could paralyse deliveries nationwide. Billy Hayes, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said Royal Mail's 150,000 workers would not stand by and watch \"people in the City and the board make a killing\" from a privatisation that threatens frontline workers' pay and conditions. He added: \"This isn't about what's best for the Royal Mail, it's about vested interests of government ministers' mates in the City.\" Hayes also warned that strike action \"now looks more likely than ever\". Bankers, lawyers, accountants and PR firms are set to collect up to \u00a320m in fees from advising on the sale. Hayes said 96% of Royal Mail staff opposed the sell-off, which \"not even Thatcher dared do\", even though 10% of the shares, worth up to \u00a32,000 each, have been set aside as free awards for Royal Mail workers in one of the biggest employee share schemes. Staff would also share a further \u00a313.3m \u2013 about \u00a390 each \u2013 in dividend payments in the first year, and more in following years. Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". Lord Heseltine and Lord Mandelson both subsequently tried but failed to sell the company, in the face of intense opposition from MPs. The sale was approved by parliament in the 2011 Postal Services Act. Postal staff booed and jeered Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, as she pleaded with them to pull back from the first nationwide strike since 2009. They will be balloted for strike action within the next couple of weeks, and a series of rolling strikes could begin before the end of October. A union source said strikes would be planned to cause maximum disruption, with drivers, sorting office workers and delivery staff taking action on consecutive days causing a week of nationwide chaos. The source said strikes \u2013 which would be officially over pay and conditions as they cannot legally strike over privatisation \u2013 were all but certain, and pointed out that previous strike ballots were backed by more than 90% of members. Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the sale, warned the union that strike action would not derail the sale. He said Royal Mail must be sold so that it can borrow private money and not compete against schools and hospitals for public funds. Fallon attacked the union for pressing ahead with plans for strike action when staff have been offered a 8.6% pay rise over three years. \"Teachers and nurses are only getting 1%,\" he said. The union dismissed the pay offer as \"misleading and unacceptable\" sweetener designed to win over support for the privatisation. Greene told union representatives at a heated meeting in Birmingham that a strike \"makes no sense\" and could mean the Royal Mail loses business: \"It is because our customers trust us and value the service we provide, that there should not be a strike at this crucial time. If businesses can't rely on us, they will look elsewhere to protect their own business.\" The company warned potential investors that it expects the union to take industrial action next month but said it has \"contingency plans in place and will also consider its legal options\". In its official \"intention to float\" document filed with the London Stock Exchange the government revealed that it intends to float at least half of the company \u2013 a much bigger stake than anticipated, which means the state would lose control of the service. It means Royal Mail could fall into foreign hands because the government is now prevented, by the European Union, from holding a \"golden share\" preventing an overseas takeover. The exact size of the flotation will depend on investor appetite, but at least 41% will be sold on top of the 10% handed to postal workers. The public will be able to buy shares via stockbrokers or directly from the government via postal or online applications. Members of the public will have to buy at least \u00a3750 worth of stock, while Royal Mail employees will have preferential access to more shares if they spend at least \u00a3500. Fallon said he hoped millions of people would buy into Royal Mail, and said the government will launch a low-key version of the \"Tell Sid\" promotion for the 1986 privatisation of British Gas. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, attacked the government for \"pushing ahead with this politically motivated fire sale of Royal Mail to fill the hole left by George Osborne's failed plan\". Mario Dunn, campaign director of Save Our Royal Mail, said: \"This might be good news for the bankers but it is bad news for Royal Mail customers. The elderly, people in rural areas and small businesses will be particularly hard hit by the inevitable price rises and service reductions that will follow this privatisation. \"Royal Mail is a successful public sector enterprise. This is an unnecessary and ultimately political privatisation.\" Fallon promised that sale will not affect Royal Mail's universal service obligation to deliver to 29m addresses, Monday to Saturday for the same price. However, the union warns that private owners will campaign to end the expensive obligation. The Institute of Directors said the government was \"absolutely right\" to privatise. Simon Walker, the IoD's director general, said: \"Royal Mail employees should see this as a great opportunity, not only to own a stake in their company, but also to give it the best chance to succeed in a competitive delivery market. \"The unions must acknowledge that strike action is not in the best interests of the business or their members.\"",

He added: \"This isn't about what's best for the Royal Mail, it's about vested interests of government ministers' mates in the City.\" Hayes also warned that strike action \"now looks more likely than ever\".</p> <p>Bankers, lawyers, accountants and PR firms are set to collect up to \u00a320m in fees from advising on the sale.</p> <p>Hayes said 96% of Royal Mail staff opposed the sell-off, which \"not even Thatcher dared do\", even though 10% of the shares, worth up to \u00a32,000 each, have been set aside as free awards for Royal Mail workers in one of the biggest employee share schemes. Staff would also share a further \u00a313.3m \u2013 about \u00a390 each \u2013 in dividend payments in the first year, and more in following years.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". Lord Heseltine and Lord Mandelson both subsequently tried but failed to sell the company, in the face of intense opposition from MPs. The sale was approved by parliament in the 2011 Postal Services Act.</p> <p>Postal staff booed and jeered Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, as she pleaded with them to pull back from the first nationwide strike since 2009. They will be balloted for strike action within the next couple of weeks, and a series of rolling strikes could begin before the end of October.</p> <p>A union source said strikes would be planned to cause maximum disruption, with drivers, sorting office workers and delivery staff taking action on consecutive days causing a week of nationwide chaos. The source said strikes \u2013 which would be officially over pay and conditions as they cannot legally strike over privatisation \u2013 were all but certain, and pointed out that previous strike ballots were backed by more than 90% of members.</p> <p>Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the sale, warned the union that strike action would not derail the sale. He said Royal Mail must be sold so that it can borrow private money and not compete against schools and hospitals for public funds. Fallon attacked the union for pressing ahead with plans for strike action when staff have been offered a 8.6% pay rise over three years. \"Teachers and nurses are only getting 1%,\" he said.</p> <p>The union dismissed the pay offer as \"misleading and unacceptable\" sweetener designed to win over support for the privatisation.</p> <p>Greene told union representatives at a heated meeting in Birmingham that a strike \"makes no sense\" and could mean the Royal Mail loses business: \"It is because our customers trust us and value the service we provide, that there should not be a strike at this crucial time. If businesses can't rely on us, they will look elsewhere to protect their own business.\"</p> <p>The company warned potential investors that it expects the union to take industrial action next month but said it has \"contingency plans in place and will also consider its legal options\". In its official \"intention to float\" document filed with the London Stock Exchange the government revealed that it intends to float at least half of the company \u2013 a much bigger stake than anticipated, which means the state would lose control of the service.</p> <p>It means Royal Mail could fall into foreign hands because the government is now prevented, by the European Union, from holding a \"golden share\" preventing an overseas takeover.</p> <p>The exact size of the flotation will depend on investor appetite, but at least 41% will be sold on top of the 10% handed to postal workers.</p> <p>The public will be able to buy shares via stockbrokers or directly from the government via postal or online applications. Members of the public will have to buy at least \u00a3750 worth of stock, while Royal Mail employees will have preferential access to more shares if they spend at least \u00a3500.</p> <p>Fallon said he hoped millions of people would buy into Royal Mail, and said the government will launch a low-key version of the \"Tell Sid\" promotion for the 1986 privatisation of British Gas.</p> <p>Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, attacked the government for \"pushing ahead with this politically motivated fire sale of Royal Mail to fill the hole left by George Osborne's failed plan\".</p> <p>Mario Dunn, campaign director of Save Our Royal Mail, said: \"This might be good news for the bankers but it is bad news for Royal Mail customers. The elderly, people in rural areas and small businesses will be particularly hard hit by the inevitable price rises and service reductions that will follow this privatisation.</p> <p>\"Royal Mail is a successful public sector enterprise. This is an unnecessary and ultimately political privatisation.\"</p> <p>Fallon promised that sale will not affect Royal Mail's universal service obligation to deliver to 29m addresses, Monday to Saturday for the same price.</p> <p>However, the union warns that private owners will campaign to end the expensive obligation.</p> <p>The Institute of Directors said the government was \"absolutely right\" to privatise. Simon Walker, the IoD's director general, said: \"Royal Mail employees should see this as a great opportunity, not only to own a stake in their company, but also to give it the best chance to succeed in a competitive delivery market.</p> <p>\"The unions must acknowledge that strike action is not in the best interests of the business or their members.\"</p>",

At the last balance sheet date, the company owed \u00a3973m and was paying an average interest rate of 8.8%. But this included a \u00a3473m slug of debt akin to a payment-in-kind note, a device commonly found in leveraged buyouts.

Talk of a ballot for industrial action makes no sense when there is a significant three-year deal on the table and negotiations are ongoing. </p> <p>I understand our people's concern that they should have protections in place as Royal Mail is privatised, which is why we have proposed a ground-breaking three-year, legally-binding agreement including a highly competitive pay offer of 8.6%. </p> <p>But the company and our customers need protections too. We want to ensure that, in future, any disputes are settled through dialogue, mediation and arbitration. </p> <p>It is because our customers trust us and value the service we provide, that there should not be a strike at this crucial time. If businesses can't rely on us, they will look elsewhere to protect their own business. </p> <p>The CWU recognises the need for us to access capital. In government ownership we have had to compete with the NHS, schools, roads and defence. </p> <p>We will also pay less interest on our company debt in the private sector than we do in the public sector. Access to private capital and a successful company is the best way to ensure secure employment for our people, who will be given a meaningful stake in the business. </p> <p>We have done a lot for the people and our company, through a better more collaborative relationship. We need to build on that. At the end of the day, the most durable protection for everyone who works in this business is a successful Royal Mail trusted for reliability by the people whom we serve.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/statuses/378161306932903936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Moya Greene, Royal Mail boss, says ballot for strike &#39;makes no sense&#39;</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@ITVLauraK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/statuses/378161306932903936\">September 12, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5231c1afe4b0c9a06407dbfb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-12T13:48:49.695Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-00786655-fa9b-4bad-b00d-38ca2522f4c8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378993581396/93af7f07-6b68-4404-acda-7034b0f0967b-460x243.png\" alt=\"Pat McFadden MP\" width=\"460\" height=\"243\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: BBC News 24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in parliament, Labour's <strong><a href=\"http://www.patmcfadden.com/\">Pat McFadden</a></strong> has been ruing the day that the previous government abandoned its plans to partially privatise Royal Mail.</p> <p>That day was <strong>1 July 2009</strong>, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/01/royal-mail-mandelson-part-privatisation\">Peter Mandelson admitted defeat</a> over a bill that would have sold a stake in Royal Mail to a private buyer but left the taxpayer with a majority stake.</p> <p>McFadden says the lesson is that if you don't reform when you have the chance, someone else will do it for you.</p> <p>He told BBC News 24:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there was an opportunity lost then, which we warned about at the time.</p> </blockquote> <p>McFadden said that union opposition to the plan helped to sink it, but also cited Labour's struggle to find a buyer who would pay enough for a minority stake.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also pulled out because we didn't believe we could get a good deal for the taxpayer.

      "bodyText": "Time for a round-up of today's Royal Mail news. \u2022 The UK government is preparing to take the historic step of privatising the Royal Mail in the face of union opposition and likely industrial action. This morning's announcement of a stock market flotation \"in the coming weeks\" received an angry response from workers, who refused to be swayed by chief executive Moya Greene today. Ballot papers on whether to strike for a better deal on pay, conditions and job protection will be sent out next week. Strikes could begin before November, despite staff bring promised around \u00a32,000 worth of free shares each. \u2022 Business minister Michael Fallon spent most of the day insisting that privatisation will benefit Royal Mail, its customers and staff. Fallon told parliament that the universal service obligation -- guaranteeing six-day deliveries across the UK -- would remain under parliament's control. Stamp prices would still be regulated by Ofcom, he said. \u2022 Still, a series of opposition MPs criticised the plans. Labour accused the government of a firesale, to patch up the country's finances, and claimed the sale would lead to a deteriorating service. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna was scathing, saying the government has 'nationalised the losses' of Royal Mail, but was now 'privatising the profits'. MPs also feared that the company could end up in the hands of a foreign firm, with some harking back to the 1980s privatisations. Highlights of the debate start at 12.08pm.... Here are some of the best quotes from the debate. \u2022 Union members showed solid opposition to the plan, booing and jeering Moya Greene at a meeting in Birmingham. Details here. Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, summed up the mood - saying the Government was selling off the family silver. He added: This move is being driven by blinkered right-wing dogma that has ridden roughshod over public opinion which is strongly opposed to the sell-off of this national institution \u2022 City analysts, though, expect strong demand for Royal Mail shares -- especially as Labour is not committing to reversing the privatisation. \u2022 Business leaders have welcomed the move, with the Institute of Directors calling it a \"great opportunity\". \u2022 Our financial editor Nils Pratley analysis the float here \u2022 Rupert Neate explains how City firms will share \u00a320m of fees \u2022 Our Q&amp;A on the float explains how it will work \u2022 And here's our full news story on the plans: Royal Mail sell-off 'within weeks' We'll have more coverage of the float on www.theGuardian.com through the evening, and in tomorrow's newspaper. Goodnight! With 1,200 votes cast in our poll so far, two-thirds of readers say they are not planning to subscribe for shares in the Royal Mail flotation: You can still vote here. The Royal Mail float means a multi-million pound payday for the City. Around 20m has been set aside to pay the cost of the IPO, and investment bankers will walks away with most of the cash. Goldman Sachs and UBS will collect the vast majority of the advisory fees. Rupert Neate flags up that the payouts could have been even bigger, but the government demanded that the banks took on the work at a discounted rate. More here: Royal Mail flotation: banks to collect millions for advisory role Royal Mail is no longer the ailing, loss-making service of a few years ago. That means the flotation looks inevitable, despite union opposition. So argues writes my colleague Nils Pratley tonight. He also explains exactly why Royal Mail is able to cut its borrowing costs through new loans and credit facilities with commercial banks, rather than borrowing from the Business department. It's a bit rich for trade minister Michael Fallon to argue that the Royal Mail must be privatised because the business needs to be spared an annual competition for capital with schools and hospitals. The reality is that the government has been lending to Royal Mail on terms that would almost make a New York hedge fund blanch. Royal Mail's latest annual report gives the details. At the last balance sheet date, the company owed \u00a3973m and was paying an average interest rate of 8.8%. But this included a \u00a3473m slug of debt akin to a payment-in-kind note, a device commonly found in leveraged buyouts. Interest on that loan was rolling up at 12% \u2013 a nice little earner for a government that can still borrow for 10 years at 3%. Not surprisingly, the Royal Mail said on Thursday that refinancing with banks would lead to \"a significant reduction\" in its cost of debt. You bet. More here: Royal Mail privatisation looks inevitable - but the commercial case is weak The CBI has just thrown its support behind the flotation. Katja Hall, its chief policy director, said: Businesses across the country rely on postal services so this decision will ensure that the Royal Mail has the money it needs, from private capital, to invest and stay competitive in the years ahead. With the Institute of Directors swiftly backing the IPO this morning, the traditional battle lines between the unions and management are being drawn... And here's ITV News's take: Royal Mail strike action set for delay The word from the unions tonight is that a strike can't come as early as October 10, as first thought. Paperwork issues need to be resolved -- to do with the CWU's membership list. That means ballot papers probably won't be posted until some next week, not tomorrow as initially planned. That has a knock-on effect on the timetable for industrial action. The CWU needs to make sure it keeps safely within the law with any strike action -- otherwise it could give Royal Mail management the opportunity to block the walkout. Back in May 2010, a strike vote at British Airways was ruled unlawful because the Unite union had not informed its members about the vote (although a judge later overturned this ruling) A couple of other articles to flag up... Observer economics editor Heather Stewart warns that Mark Carney could be losing his lustre, following the Bank of England governor's appearance at the Treasury Committee this morning. She writes: After two gruelling hours, it was painfully clear that [interest rate] forward guidance, far from increasing clarity, has cluttered up the Bank's intellectual furniture with knockouts, staging posts and all the rest \u2013 while giving Britain's ever-ready consumers just the excuse they don't need to go shopping. MPs seemed noticeably less charmed by the \u00a3872,000-a-year governor than at his last outing. Like every rock star at some point in his career, Carney looks in danger of falling out of fashion. More here: Mark Carney loses his cool as forward guidance fails to convince MPs Interestingly, committee chairman Andrew Tyrie also appears unimpressed with Carney: Elsewhere, economics professor Barry Eichengreen has warned that the eurozone faces a 'hard landing', even though the euro is more secure than last year. The problem -- its troubled banking sector. The banks remain weak. Now that the European Banking Authority has finally issued new prudential rules, they can get about the business of raising the capital they need as a buffer against losses. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has moved in this direction, but few other banks have followed so far. So long as European banks remain undercapitalised and overleveraged, a sustainable recovery supported by robust bank lending is unlikely. More here: Eurozone collapse has been avoided but a hard landing is still possible The Save the Royal Mail campaign are calling today \"A good day for bankers \u2013 a bad day for customers\", and claiming that the universal postal service is at risk. Mario Dunn, its campaign director, said: People in rural areas, small businesses and the elderly are all particularly vulnerable to what will be the inevitable price rises and rural service reductions. Privatising Royal Mail fires the starting gun on the race to end the universal postal service as we know it. A privately owned Royal Mail will not want to maintain loss making rural deliveries. The 2011 Postal Services Act allows it to opt out delivering loss making services. With price caps removed the consumer protections in place are extremely flimsy. It will not be long before we begin to see the worst excesses we have come to associate with other sectors such as banking. Save Our Royal Mail also says that 70% of the public oppose the sale of Royal Mail. Michael Fallon conceded as much in parliament, earlier, blaming it on confusion and misinformation (see 12.47pm). And here's a photo from outside the Communications Workers Union meeting in Birmingham today: The Press Association has pulled together some of the best quotes from this lunchtime's statement on the Royal Mail flotation. Conservative Robert Halfon (Harlow) raised concerns over the prospect of massive salaries being paid to Royal Mail's directors coupled with price hikes for consumers. He said: \"I welcome the transfer of shares from Royal Mail to the Royal Mail workers but can you reassure my constituents that we won't go the way of the water companies, where the directors pay themselves huge wages and increase prices for consumers, and can you set out the consumer protection that there will be?\" Mr Fallon replied: \"There are no deal bonuses as part of this share sale, let me just absolutely reassure you about that, there are no deal bonuses for the senior management. \"But the protection for the consumer has been laid down by this House in the statute in the Postal Services Act 2011 which you will recall two years ago. \"The regulation has been set out and the price of the stamp will continue to be capped by the regulator. Veteran Labour backbencher Dennis Skinner said: \"Do you recall that in the late eighties we had a wholesale privatisation of almost all the public utilities with the exception of this one? \"And it was under what Mrs Thatcher called the 'share-owning democracy', it's almost like I can hear the same words from the Despatch Box today. \"And what happened to that shareholding democracy? Almost without exception every single public utility is now owned abroad and ripping the British consumer off. \"The only difference between now and then those lick-spittle Lib Dems have joined the Tories to privatise it. What an utter disgrace.\" Labour former minister Peter Hain said the obligation on Royal Mail to deliver to every house in the country mean it will be disadvantaged against competitors who do not have the same obligation. He said: \"Why aren't you imposing the same obligations on competitors to the Royal Mail, like TNT, to deliver to every house in the land, that the Royal Mail has, which is very, very costly for the Royal Mail while they cream off the most profitable business?\" Labour frontbencher David Hanson said the sale amounted to a transfer of assets to the richest as the less well-off would not be able to afford \u00a3750 in shares. The shadow home affairs minister said: \"Given the minimum purchase of shares is \u00a3750 could you explain to me how my low-paid constituents, those on pensions, those unemployed, are going to retain a stake in what they already own? \"Is this not just a transfer from all of us to the richest in society?\" Mr Fallon said it was \"standard\" to set a minimum threshold and that it \"reflects standard practice\". He said: \"We do hope that here will be sufficient opportunity for retail participation in this, those members of the public that want to subscribe I would not like to see them miss out.\" Shadow culture minister Clive Efford warned that people may end up having to collect their post rather than having it delivered. He said: \"The Government can't have it both ways. It can't have a regulatory regime that allows services to be cherry-picked where they are profitable by the jackals that will buy the Royal Mail and then say it's going to protect the universal service. \"We all know it's going to be broken up. Can you say at the Despatch Box does your description of the universal service include one that requires people to collect their mail at a central collection point rather than it being delivered door-to-door?\" Mr Fallon said the requirement to deliver was in the USO and could only be changed by Parliament. We've heard a lot from Michael Fallon already...but here's a video clip of the business minister explaining how privatising Royal Mail will lead to more investment in services: David Cameron's tweet about protecting the Royal Mail \"for hard working people\" (see 11.40am) didn't impress everyone: Both the Conservatives and Labour are targetting the nation's toilers and strivers. George Osborne used the #hardworking hashtag after spending a few hours with night shift workers in July, while Labour also made its pitch for hard working types at the TUC conference this week. Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene continues to argue against a strike, despite receiving a rough reception from staff in Birmingham this morning. I've taken the quotes from PA: The Government has initiated the process for Royal Mail's privatisation and has dispelled any doubt over the future ownership of the business. It is now time for Royal Mail and the CWU to come to a new agreement for our people going forward. Talk of a ballot for industrial action makes no sense when there is a significant three-year deal on the table and negotiations are ongoing. I understand our people's concern that they should have protections in place as Royal Mail is privatised, which is why we have proposed a ground-breaking three-year, legally-binding agreement including a highly competitive pay offer of 8.6%. But the company and our customers need protections too. We want to ensure that, in future, any disputes are settled through dialogue, mediation and arbitration. It is because our customers trust us and value the service we provide, that there should not be a strike at this crucial time. If businesses can't rely on us, they will look elsewhere to protect their own business. The CWU recognises the need for us to access capital. In government ownership we have had to compete with the NHS, schools, roads and defence. We will also pay less interest on our company debt in the private sector than we do in the public sector. Access to private capital and a successful company is the best way to ensure secure employment for our people, who will be given a meaningful stake in the business. We have done a lot for the people and our company, through a better more collaborative relationship. We need to build on that. At the end of the day, the most durable protection for everyone who works in this business is a successful Royal Mail trusted for reliability by the people whom we serve. Back in parliament, Labour's Pat McFadden has been ruing the day that the previous government abandoned its plans to partially privatise Royal Mail. That day was 1 July 2009, when Peter Mandelson admitted defeat over a bill that would have sold a stake in Royal Mail to a private buyer but left the taxpayer with a majority stake. McFadden says the lesson is that if you don't reform when you have the chance, someone else will do it for you. He told BBC News 24: I think there was an opportunity lost then, which we warned about at the time. McFadden said that union opposition to the plan helped to sink it, but also cited Labour's struggle to find a buyer who would pay enough for a minority stake. We also pulled out because we didn't believe we could get a good deal for the taxpayer. The question now is that whether the government can get a good deal. Today, though, Royal Mail's pension deficit has been placed on the government's books, and the business is now generating a healthy profits (with an operating profit margin of 4.4% this year). Royal Mail insiders confirm that CEO Moya Greene was booed by staff in Birmingham this morning. I guess we shouldn't be surprised, given the union's seemingly resolute opposition to privatisation. Greene can't be accused of wilfully ignoring workers, since joining Royal Mail in 2010. For starters, she's attended the CWU's annual conference in the past to make her case and hear from the union. Ralph Ferrett, of the Plymouth and East Cornwall branch of the CWU, reports that that Moya Greene failed to sway workers in Birmingham this morning: The CWU's South Wales / South West Division echoes this sentiment: Rightly or wrongly, it looks like industrial action remains a real possibility. Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene has apparently been booed by workers, at a meeting between management and workers today. That's according to a member of the Communications Workers Union, who attended the private event in Birmingham this morning. Kye Dudd, from the Bristol &amp; District branch of the CWU, has tweeted that Greene was booed when she arrived on stage, and again when she finished explaining the plan. Apparently the hall rang to chants of \"Royal Mail not for sale\" as her appearance ended. In between, she was apparently \"laughed at\" when she told staff that she didn't understand why they were considering strike action. The media weren't allowed in, alas, but Dudd has tweeted several photos from Birmingham. And that's the end of business minister Michael Fallon's statement (scroll back to 12.08pm for full highlights). The key points: \u2022 Fallon insists that the flotation will help Royal Mail invest in its services. It will mean higher prices for consumers, and the Universal Service Obligation remains in parliament's control. \"Scare stories\" about a worse service for the Armed Forces, or the blind, are untrue, he said. \u2022 Fallon also claims that the Royal Mail and the Post Office will keep working closely together. He pointed to the 10-year deal signed in 2012, arguing that the two entities will always benefit from close links. \u2022 Fallon hopes that a strike can be avoided, if unions accept the 'enhanced' pledges being offered by Royal Mail management. \u2022 Opposition MPs have deep reservations about the sale, though. Shadow minister Ian Murray argued that in the long-term, a privately owned Royal Mail could force concessions from the government. Many MPs aren't convinced that prices will not rise, despite Ofcom's control over stamp prices. And finally, Labour's Stephen Timms says Fallon's promises will be little comfort to consumers looking at their \"regulated energy bills\". Fallon repeats that the price of a second class stamp is fixed, and a first class stamp must remain affordable - in the view of Ofcom. Asked about the prospect of job losses, Fallon says that 50,000 positions have been cut in the last decade. Won't Royal Mail staff simply sell their free shares? Fallon says no - there's a three-year lock-in. And they'll get dividends over that period. Glenda Jackson says that taxpayers will lose out because the flotation will be priced too cheaply, to ensure the shares are sold. Fallon replies that the government is determined to get \"maximum value\" Fallon is asked why TNT, the private delivery firm, criticised the plan. Fallon suggests TNT is \"a little nervous\" about the prospect of competition. Will Royal Mail be sold to a private firm? Fallon says it will have multiple owners, including its staff. Millions of owners. The government has decided not to sell to a foreign owner. Why don't the public support the privatisation? Fallon replies that there are some members of the public who \"don't understand\" how the postal system has been separated. Some have been influenced by untrue scare stories. But there's no support for nationalising electricity or water networks, he says. Asked to commit that there will be no changes to the six-day deliveries, or collections from post boxes, Fallon says such issues are covered by existing licencing. Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne, reminds Fallon that she used to work for Ofcom, where she learned that privatisation only works if you have competition at the supply point. Are we really going to have \"multiple posties\" on UK streets? Fallon says we already have competition in the postal market. Conservative MP Andrew Percy claims that Labour rivals use a commercial rival to the Royal Mail when they send out campaign literature. Fallon replies that Labour need to lay out whether they would reverse the flotation. Fallon claims that \"several unfortunate scare stories\" have emerged recently (in answer to a question about the Safe Our Royal Mail campaign). There is absolutely no threat to the current arrangements to the blind, to the armed forces... They are not being changed by this announcement. Several MPs are asking for reassurances on future prices. On stamps, Fallon says that the price of a second class stamp is fixed by Ofcom, while a 1st class stamp must remain \"affordable\" under the rules. Julian Smith, Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripton, congratulates Michael Fallon for succeeding where the Prince of Darkness failed. That's Peter Mandelson, of course. The agreement that ensures Armed Forces get cheaper postal services will continue after the flotation, said Fallon. Only Parliament can make significant changes to the Universal Service Obligations, Fallon reiterates. Could the Universal Service Obligation be diluted to make people collect their mail at their local Post Office? No, Fallon says. Conservative MP Richard Graham, who chairs the all-party group on postal issues, says privatisation isn't always best, so he welcomes the news that the Post Office is safe. He backs the flotation of Royal Mail. Green MP Caroline Green says this is an ideological sale. How can we guarantee that the sale will benefit the many, not the few? Fallon says he hopes that millions of people will benefit, by buying shares. Managers will not get bonus payouts through the flotation, Fallon says. Dennis Skinner says it's a repeat to Thatcher's share-owning democracy. We sold off out firms in the 1980s, and what happened? They are now owned by foreign firms. Consumers will suffer from this flotation, he adds. Michael Fallon says he doesn't want to return to the days where the state owns car companies, and water and energy firms. The price of stamps will still be set by the regulator -- so the public can't suffer higher prices through this deal. Asked about the union's opposition, Fallon says he hopes that they will not strike and support the IPO. He also asks how many workers will reject their offer of free shares. Michael Fallon points out that Deutsche Post is investing \u00a3600m per year in its services. Royal Mail needs to be able to do the same. Sir Edward Leigh points out that the Royal Mail privatisation has been an idea for two decades. It's the longest fire sale in history. Onto Questions. Katy Clark asks whether Royal Mail workers will suffer worse working conditions after privatisation. Fallon replies that there is already competition in the market, with parcels forms such as TNT. He adds that the Royal Mail is offering new guarantees to the unions. Fallon responds. The Universal Service Obligation is laid down in statute. Only a vote in parliament could change it, and we have no plans to do so. He adds that the details of the USO could be changed through secondary legislation, but there are no plans. The price of stamps is safe too. And the Royal Mail and Post Office have a 10-year deal to work together. Finally, Fallon criticises Murray for saying it is a fire sale - as Labour planned, and failed, with a partial privatisation when it was last in office. Labour needs to say what it would do about Royal Mail if it returned to office, he conludes. Murray asks whether the universal service obligation is protected by primary, or secondary legislation. Could the minimum and maximum service levels change? How firm is the alliance between Royal Mail and the Post Office? And when will the IPO take place? The government is playing politics with the Queen's head, he concludes. Murray rejects Fallon's claim that the universal service obligation is safe. What will happen if a future privatised Royal Mail asks for new legislation to loosen the terms of the USO, arguing that it is financially unsustainable? And how can we be sure that the Royal Mail won't target its \u00a3380m annual contract with the Post Office networks to cut its costs? Ian Murray, the shadow business, innovation and skills minister, replies for the opposition. He begins by expressing thanks to Royal Mail staff for working through the uncertainty of recent months. This is a politically motivated firesale, to patch up black holes in George Osborne's budget, he claims. Any suggestions that the privatisation of Royal Mail will lead to changes in the universal service obligation are completely unfounded, business minister Michael Fallon. And the Post Office is not for sale. It remains a separate company There will be no repeat of the closure programme conducted by the previous Labour government, says Fallon. Instead, the government will continue to invest in post offices. Fallon says that he and Royal Mail both understand the \"apprehension\" that staff feel about the plan. The float, though,will not impact staff terms and conditions. Royal Mail is offering staff \"enhanced\" three-year pledges on how the company will run, including no new outsourcing. Michael Fallon is giving a statement in Parliament on the Royal Mail privatisation now. He's running through the statement released this morning - confirming that staff will get free shares, that the IPO will begin in coming weeks, and that the government intends to sell a majority of the Royal Mail. The Save Our Royal Mail campaign is warning that rural services are going to suffer: Mario Dunn, campaign director of Save Our Royal Mail, said: This might be good news for the bankers but it is bad news for Royal Mail customers. The elderly, people in rural areas and small businesses will be particularly hard hit by the inevitable price rises and service reductions that will follow this privatisation. Royal Mail is a successful public sector enterprise. This is an unnecessary and ultimately political privatisation. A bit more from Mark Carney's testimony at Parliament (full live coverage here) 1) The Bank of England governor has insisted that he's not afraid to raise interest rates, pointing out that he's the only boss of a G7 central bank who's actually hiked borrowing costs (in Canada). 2) Carney declined to contrast his pledge that interest rates will remain low for some time with the UK government's declaration that the economy is healing. While there's been a \"welcome\" change in the pace of activity in the economy, the Bank wants to reinforce this through its monetary policy stance. He's proving a tricky customer for the Treasury committee to pin down.... Prime minister David Cameron tweets that the Royal Mail selloff is good news for the public, particularly 'for hard working people'. The British Chambers of Commerce is more cautious than the IoD. It says that it's essential that the universal service obligation is protected after Royal Mail is floated. Dr Adam Marshall, the BCC's director of Policy and External Affairs, said it is \"crucial\" that the group doesn't drop its focus on UK firms. He's not opposed to privatisation, but nor is he hailing it as a guaranteed winner. Marshall said: An efficient, effective postal service is a critical part of Britain\u2019s business infrastructure. Regardless of Royal Mail\u2019s future ownership structure, services that support British business must remain at the heart of the company\u2019s mission and obligations. Many public services, including the post, can be delivered well by private companies. The key to a successful flotation is to ensure that the universal service obligation, both to businesses and individuals, is guaranteed. Ofcom will continue to act as the Royal Mail's regulator after privatisation, which means guaranteeing \"a financially sustainable universal postal service in the UK\". While unions and opposition politicians cry foul, the plan to float the Royal Mail on the stock market has been cheered by UK bosses. Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, argues that a privatised Royal Mail will be able to improve service delivery by borrowing to invest. Walker also urged staff to embrace the privatisation, rather than launching industial action. He said: The Royal Mail is a vital service that businesses depend on, and Michael Fallon is absolutely right that now is the time to allow it to access to the capital markets, enabling it to invest in its future. We welcome the news that shares will be offered for sale to institutions and the public before the end of the financial year. Royal Mail employees should see this as a great opportunity, not only to own a stake in their company, but also to give it the best chance to succeed in a competitive delivery market. The unions must acknowledge that strike action is not in the best interests of the business or their members. The experience of European mail services shows that privatisation can improve the experience for customers. Can any European readers comment on this? There's been more heat than light in Westminster, where Bank of England governor Mark Carney's appearance before MPs has been bogged down in arguments over his new forward guidance on interest rates (no rate rise until the unemployment rate drops to 7%). Carney has been refusing to say whether the pledge is a loosening, or a tightening, or monetary policy. Or neither. Andrew Sparrow has the key exchange in his Live Blog. Carney has just told Andrew Tyrie that Tyrie did not correctly summarise his view, because he focused on long-term rates, not the shape of the yield curve. Q: Overall, have you loosened monetary policy? Carney says his announcement has reinforced the recovery. Q: Has it tightened or loosened policy? Carney says it has made it more effective. It has made it \"more stimulative at the margins\". Q: So you have loosened it? Carney says it has made it more effective. Tyrie says he has never heard a central bank governor saying he has made policy less effective. Eventually Carney says that, if Tyrie wants, he can describe it as loosening. Tyrie says it is going to be hard \"down the Dog and Duck\" deciding whether monetary policy has been loosened. (Do they ever talk about monetary policy down the Dog and Duck? I doubt it.) Business minister Michael Fallon will make a statement to the House of Commons on the Royal Mail IPO, at 12.30pm BST. Details here. Confirmation that the Scottish Nationalist Party also opposes the Royal Mail IPO. Mike Weir, SNP MP, argued it was another example of London-centric politicians ignoring rural communities: This is a deeply flawed Westminster decision, which threatens to have particularly harmful consequences for Scotland where so many of our rural communities and so much of our rural economy rely on our existing Royal Mail service. The UK Government are refusing to heed the real and genuine concerns that privatisation will mean a reduction in rural services as companies cherry-pick and compete in the larger urban areas. Given our experience of previous privatisations no one believes that the regulator will provide real protection to consumers on either prices or services. The Scottish Government has invested heavily in a scheme to bring fibre optic broadband to 95% of the population by 2017. That gives a real opportunity to grow rural businesses, but it requires an efficient, comprehensive and reasonably priced mail service to back it up. A privatised service will not deliver that for rural Scotland. Royal Mail must be viewed as part of our national infrastructure not just as another business. The Communications Workers Union will make the Royal Mail privatisation a key issue at the Labour Party annual conference in Brighton, the week after next. Billy Hayes, CWU general secretary, wants Ed Miliband to promise to nationalise Royal Mail again -- something that shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna refused to pledge at 9.12am this morning. There could be fireworks. Here's Hayes' full statement: This isn\u2019t about what\u2019s best for the Royal Mail, it\u2019s about vested interests of government ministers\u2019 mates in the City. Privatisation is the worst way to access to capital as it\u2019s more expensive than borrowing under public ownership. There\u2019s no competition with money for schools and hospitals as the government would have you believe \u2013 look at Network Rail which has borrowed billions on private markets at cheaper rates under an arrangement which doesn\u2019t affect public debt. This is simply about dogma from old-fashioned Tories wedded to privatisation. We remain convinced that privatisation is the wrong decision for Royal Mail. It would be bad for customers, bad for staff and bad for the industry. Privatisation would put jobs and services at risk and lead to higher prices for customers. We\u2019ve seen it happen time and again in other industries. We\u2019re taking this to Labour Party Conference and we want a commitment that a Labour government would renationalise Royal Mail if privatised. Privatisation is an old-fashioned idea and a breach of the public\u2019s trust. It would destroy a centuries-old public service. It's business as usual at the Royal Mail this morning, with staff cracking on with the job of moving letters and parcels around the UK, as this photo from Bethnal Green sorting office shows: Royal Mail is unlikely to end up in the FTSE 100 index, home of blue-chip giants, after privatisation. It will probably have to rough it in the second-tier FTSE 250 index. Companies are added, and removed, from the FTSE 100 on a quarterly basis, depending on how their value has changed. Without any pricing details, analysts are estimating that Royal Mail will be valued at close to \u00a33bn. Conveniently, a quarterly review took place yesterday, and Wood Group (market capitalisation \u00a32.9bn) is getting the boot. Sports Direct (\u00a34.3bn) is in. A \u00a33bn valuation means Royal Mail is worth just a quarter of Cambridge chip firm ARM, whose semiconductors are found in many of the world's smartphones. A reminder of how digital communications have superceded the old business of physically transporting information. The Royal Mail sale has now been condemned by the UNI Global Union, which was particularly disappointed that the Liberal Democrat party didn't use their influence in the coalition to stop it. Its general secretary, Phillip Jennings, says: This is catastrophic for the postal service. It is politically driven and I find it stunning that the Liberal Democrats should cave-in. It is a disaster for small business and communities up and down the country. It spells good-bye to universal services, to affordable prices and to decent work. It is an open invitation to the vultures of private equity who will enjoy their chance to strip the assets. Bad economic news from the eurozone this morning has undermined hopes of a recovery in the European economy - which is key market for the Royal Mail's GLS division. First, industrial production fell by 1.5% in July compared with June, which is much worse than City economists had expected - Secondly, Greek unemployment has hit yet another record high, of 27.9% in June, from 27.6% in May. Proof that Greece's population continue to experience misery as its six-year slump continues. Most markets are in the red this morning, although the FTSE 100 is only down 20 points. The government must be watching the markets a little nervously, as any autumn rout could sink the Royal Mail sale. Here's the latest details: We'd love to know whether you're considering taking part in the Royal Mail flotation, so please vote in our poll. Will you buy shares in Royal Mail? Heads-up: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is about to testify at the Treasury select committee. He'll be discussing the Bank's most recent quarterly inflation report, his pledge to keep UK interest rates at record lows until unemployment falls, and (probably) fears that a house price bubble is being created. It will be streamed live here: Monetary Policy Committee August 2013 Inflation Report My colleague Andrew Sparrow will be live-blogging the whole session here: Mark Carney gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee: Politics live blog This graphic shows how most of the Royal Mail's revenues come from its parcels and letters divisions, although its European parcels business, GLS, makes a decent contribution (with revenue of \u00a31.5m, out of a total pie of over \u00a39bn. More details here. As part of today's deal, the Royal Mail has also refinanced its debt. In City jargon it has agreed \u00a3600m worth of term loan facilities and an \u00a3800m revolving credit facility, to replace the loans currently provided by the government. These new new debt facilities will mean a \"a significant reduction in the Group's overall cost of debt\", it says -- in other words, it will be able to borrow from commercial banks at a cheaper rate than from the Department for Business. Good news for Royal Mail, but presumably a loss of revenue for the taxpayer (Robert Peston reckons it's paying an interest rate of 8.8% - roughly three times as much as the government can borrow for 10 years) The BBC's Robert Peston is also intrigued by the prospect of Royal Mail floating on the stock market in the midst of a strike action: I can certainly never remember any business being sold on the stock market at a time when it had been brought to a grinding halt by a strike. But that does not mean a flotation in those circumstances can't and won't happen. There is the very real, or perhaps surreal, prospect, of postal workers simultaneously downing tools (parking their trolleys) and subscribing a few hundred quid for Royal Mail shares. Business minister Michael Fallon suggested on Radio 4 this morning that industrial action is unlikely (our political correspondent Rowena Mason flags up) Speaking on the Today programme, Fallon acknowledged that staff have \"concerns\" about the future of Royal Mail but said he did not expect a proposed strike to go ahead. Echoing some of the points he made on Sky News (see 7.36am), Fallon said: I don\u2019t think the strike is necessary...There's a very generous pay off on the table. They've been offered 8.6% over three years, and I think the rest of the public sector is only getting 1% a year. It\u2019s a very generous pay-off, there are free shares on offer as well, so I don\u2019t see any reason for a strike. But as I mentioned up at 8.07am, this morning's announcement clearly warns prospective investors that Royal Mail anticipates strike action on or after 10 October.... Rafael Behr, political editor of the New Statesman, reckons the sale could prove a hot potato for Labour if it can't promise to renationalise the Royal Mail service. It's not too late to stop the selloff, Umunna concludes - pointing out that unions will be meeting with the Royal Mail CEO Moya Greene later today. Chuka Umunna also dismissed the idea that members of the public will dash to buy Royal Mail shares, given the minimum allocation of \u00a3750 (or \u00a3500 for staff who want more than their \u00a32,000 free allocation). If you're earning a lot of money in the Cabinet, that's not a lot of money, but it's a lot to the man on the street, he says. Umunna reiterates his point from this morning that the government is now privatising the Royal Mail's profits, having nationalised its losses by putting its pension deficit on the public books. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, is on BBC News 24 now, criticising the selloff: He warns that there's no guarantee in the long-term that a privatised Royal Mail won't sell off sorting offices and other operations in prime city locations, which could hurt customers. This is bad for consumers, and bad in particular for small businesses. But will Labour reverse the sale? Umunna says he can't make any commitments to renationalising Royal Mail in the future. It would be like writing a blank cheque. City firm ETX Capital reckons that the IPO will be priced \"very attractively\", to avoid the embarrassment of some shares being left unsold. Joe Rundle, head of trading, says: We expect it to be priced very attractively by the government in order to garner the demand to deem this IPO as a success given the importance surrounding it. The Financial Times also flags up that even Margaret Thatcher couldn't face selling off the Royal Mail, pointing out that at least 41% of the company will be offered to City institutions and the public, on top of the 10% handed to staff. Our full news story about the Royal Mail privatisation is now live, by Rupert Neate. Here's a flavour: The sell-off of the 497-year-old postal service is the most contentious privatisation since British Rail two decades ago, and is forcefully opposed by the unions, who are meeting with the Royal Mail chief executive, Moya Greene, on Thursday morning to once again voice their anger at the \"great British flog-off\". The Communication Workers Union (CWU) plans to disrupt the sale process by holding a strike ballot on 20 September, which could lead to a nationwide strike by 10 October. It would be the first nationwide postal strike since 2009. The union is also pushing for a better pay deal, after rejecting a 8.6% pay rise over three years. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, said 96% of Royal Mail staff oppose the sell-off, which \"not even Thatcher dared do\". Margaret Thatcher, who privatised British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, famously refused to countenance a sale of Royal Mail, saying she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". Government to float Royal Mail on stock exchange 'in the coming weeks' The privatisation has also been criticised by Paul Wheelhouse MSP, a member of the Scottish Nationalist Party in the Scottish Parliament. He fears it will lead to deteriorating services in rural areas It's all the European Union's fault, according to UKIP's Nigel Farage: That's a reference to the EU's Postal Directive, which aims to create a Single Market for postal services. The EU has denied in the past, though, that it is responsible for the closure of rural post offices (there's a rebuttal online here), saying that its laws 'enshrine' the universal service obligation. The government helped to pave the way for the sale last year by transferring the Royal Mail pension fund (and its historic deficit of over \u00a39bn) onto the public books. This makes the business rather more attractive to private buyers, as Labour's Chuka Umunna tweets: On page 15 of today's Announcement, the government warns potential investors that members of the Communications Workers Union will probably go on strike next month, possibly as early as 10 October. That strike action is over pay, pension reforms, the impact privatisation will have on staff, and the Royal Mail future strategy. Here's the key section: \u2022 Negotiations between Royal Mail and the CWU are continuing and Royal Mail remains committed to reaching an agreement with the CWU and averting industrial action. However, there can be no guarantee that negotiations will lead to a successful outcome or the aversion of industrial action. \u2022 Royal Mail currently believes that the relevant members of the CWU will vote for national industrial action and that national industrial action and other forms of industrial action are therefore expected to take place across the whole of UKPIL's activities on or after 10 October 2013. In the event of national industrial action, the Group has contingency plans in place and will also consider its legal options Could the government push through the Royal Mail selloff before unions have the chance to strike? ITV's Laura Kuenssberg reckons so, writing that \"the race is on\" to get the share sale out of the door before October 10 - the earliest possible day for a strike action. That sounds potentially risky -- will investors really want to snap up shares in a company whose staff are poised to walk out?.... George Thomson, general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, has also heavily criticised the plan: I am extremely disappointed and concerned that the Government is pressing ahead with a plan that will undoubtedly jeopardise the future of thousands of post offices. We simply have not had the promised new Government work that needs to be delivered before the sale of Royal Mail and which would safeguard the future survival of an independent Post Office. Thomson has called for the government to \"halt the sale\" until this new work is forthcoming -- unlikely, I suspect, given Michael Fallon's obvious enthusiasm on Sky News a few minutes ago. He also wants the government to hold a significant share of the company after privatisation, to give the public some control over their postal service (today's announcement simply says the government \"intends to dispose of a majority of Royal Mail\u2019s issued share capital\"). The Labour party has blasted the decision to begin floating Royal Mail on the stock market. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, says there's a \"huge coalition\" against the plan, but ministers are \"ploughing on regardless\". Here's his full reaction: Ministers are pushing ahead with this politically-motivated fire sale of Royal Mail to fill the hole left by George Osborne\u2019s failed plan. This is taking place despite opposition from a huge coalition including the Conservative Bow Group, the Countryside Alliance, the National Federation of Subpostmasters, the cross party BIS Select Committee as well as Royal Mail employees themselves. The Government has not addressed the huge concerns which remain on the impact the Royal Mail sale will have on consumers, businesses and communities, but ministers are ploughing on regardless. Will Royal Mail staff suffer once the company is in private hands? Michael Fallon denies it, saying terms and conditions will be absolutely the same after privatisation. Asked about the looming strike action (see 7.36am), the business and enterprise minister argues that staff have little to complain about. They're being offered an 8.6% pay rise over three years*, and free shares too, at a time when nurses and teachers are only getting 1% per year, he points out, adding: That sounds like a pretty generous offer. \u2022 - The unions, though, are pushing for a better pay deal, and have rejected the offer of an 8.6% pay rise over three years. Michael Fallon, Minister of State for Business and Enterprise, is defending the Royal Mail selloff on Sky News now. Fallon says it's a \"hugely exciting day\" for Royal Mail, and that the flotation will allow it to access private capital through the City to fund expansion plans. He denies that the sale will lead to heavy job losses, pointing out that 50,000 positions have been cut over the last decade as \"ministers dithered\". Here's the statement which the government issued to the City this morning. Royal Mail: Announcement of Intention to Float Unions will fight hard against the Royal Mail privatisation, with a strike ballot expected on 20 September. That could be followed by a strike as early as 10 October - which would be the first nationwide postal strike since 2009. So how does the Royal Mail privatisation work? Here's five key points from this morning's announcement: \u2022 It's coming soon. The government announcement says \" the IPO expected to take place in the coming weeks\". \u2022 The government hasn't announced exactly how much of Royal Mail is being sold. It says that it will \"retain flexibility\" until it sees investor demand and market conditions \u2022 Royal Mail staff are getting free shares. 10% of the flotation will be set aside for 150,000 \"eligible UK-based Royal Mail employees\" \u2022 Anyone in the UK can take part in the sale, with the government hoping for a return to the \"Tell Sid\" spirit of the 1980s. Members of the public must bid for at least \u00a3750 of shares (this minimum application size is reduced to \u00a3500 for staff) \u2022 Shareholders are being promised chunky returns. The statement says the Royal Mail intends to pursue a \"progressive dividend policy\" - City code for a decent-sized slice of the company's profits. It expects to hand back \u00a3133m in the first year (it would be \u00a3200m if the company had been listed for a full 12 months). Vince Cable, business secretary, declares that the selloff is the final stage of the government's plan to reform Royal Mail: By announcing today that we intend to move ahead with a sale of shares in Royal Mail, we are completing the third and final part of the reforms agreed by Parliament two years ago. This delivers on the commitment in the Coalition Agreement to give Royal Mail access to private capital, including opportunities for employee ownership. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Breaking News to kick off the day: The UK government has announced plans to begin the privatisation of Royal Mail. The news, which broke last night, will see the business floated on the London Stock Market \"in the coming weeks\". It could raise up to \u00a33bn for the Treasury, but the sell-off is already being attacked by unions who fear it will lead to job losses and a worse service for parts of the UK. Full details and reaction to follow. The other big event coming up this morning is in Westminster. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, will locks horns with MPs on the Treasury committee this morning to discuss last month's quarterly inflation report. The hearing begins at 10am BST. Carney will have to defend his bold pledge to peg UK interest rates to their current record low of 7% until unemployment rate has dropped to 7%, sometime in 2016 by the Bank's reckoning. With the UK economy showing encouraging signs of growth, and the jobless rate falling to 7.7% yesterday, MPs may question the wisdom of this forward guidance. He may also be asked for his views on today's Guardian front page story, about the surge in employment at estate agents.... I'll be tracking all the events through the day as usual....",

Waitrose sales rose 7.8% while John Lewis department store sales climbed 6.6% despite the tough economic climate. The partnership had to pay out \u00a340m to employees after the group discovered it had miscalculated holiday pay over several years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday defended his plan to keep interest rates low for up to three years as MPs voiced concerns that it may be confusing the public and had failed to convince investors. Carney said the central bank's policy of forward guidance was supporting the recovery and encouraging consumers and businesses to spend. Under tough questioning from MPs on the Treasury select committee the new governor said the pace of growth was picking up, but remained in its early stages and could be knocked off course. The fragile nature of the recovery, he said, meant there was no reason to bring forward interest rate rises, which have remained at 0.5% for the last four years. He insisted: \"Overall, my view is that the announcement has reinforced recovery. It's made policy more effective, and more effective policy is stimulative at the margin.\" Last month the BoE's monetary policy committee said that so long as inflation stayed under control it would only consider pushing interest rates to more normal levels once unemployment fell to 7%. The MPC forecast that unemployment would remain above the new target until the second half of 2016. In a speech in Nottingham last month Carney said the target was a trigger point to discuss a rise in rates rather than a threshold that would immediately force a rate rise. He also outlined how three \"knockouts\", including a jump in inflation beyond 2.5%, would force the MPC to reconsider its low interest rate policy. Several MPs said it remained unclear how the MPC will react to improvements in the economy. Some City analysts predict the unemployment rate will fall to 7% at least a year earlier than forecast by the MPC. Andrew Tyrie, the committee's Tory chairman, complained that Carney's account of the Bank's new approach would be difficult to explain \"down the Dog and Duck\". After the meeting he said: \"Credibility in monetary policy is hard won and easily lost. The new framework \u2013 with its target, threshold and 3 'knockouts' \u2013 is more complex to explain than its predecessor. Rightly, the Bank is now engaged in bolstering credibility in its new framework with detailed explanations.\" He added: \"Confidence in monetary policy will be enhanced where those detailed explanations provide greater certainty about the likely responses of the Bank as circumstances change.\" Andrea Leadsom MP said she was concerned that the MPC had \"watered down\" its inflation target. \"I am still slightly bemused how the inflation target ranks alongside the new unemployment target,\" she said. Asked about the plight of savers, whose savings are being eroded by inflation with interest rates at rock bottom, the governor said he had \"great sympathy\", but the best thing the Bank could do to help was to generate a sustainable economic recovery. \"Our job is to make sure that that's not another false dawn, and ensure that this economy reaches, as soon as possible, a speed of escape velocity, so that it can sustain higher interest rates.\" Carney stressed that despite the MPC's expectation that rates will remain on hold for up to three years, he would be ready to push up borrowing costs if necessary. \"I'm not afraid to raise interest rates,\" he said, pointing out that he is the only serving central bank governor among the G7 countries to have increased rates \u2013 in his previous post, in Canada. City investors have pushed up long-term borrowing costs in financial markets sharply since the MPC announced its three-year pledge to leave borrowing costs unchanged at 0.5%. But Carney, who was handpicked by George Osborne to kickstart recovery and took over in Threadneedle Street at the start of July, said the recent increase in rates, which sent 10-year government bond yields through 3% last week for the first time in more than two years, was a result of the recovery and \"benign\". He also repeatedly refused to be drawn on whether the new approach represented a loosening of policy \u2013 equivalent to a reduction in interest rates \u2013 in itself. He said forward guidance made the current stimulus of low rates and \u00a3375bn of quantiative easing more effective.",

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Washington DC has bowed to pressure from Walmart and vetoed minimum-wage legislation that would have hampered the supermarket giant's push into urban America. Vincent Gray said the legislation, which would have forced large retailers to pay staff at least $12.50 an hour, would drive away employers and threaten 4,000 jobs in the city. His intervention angered campaigners who had hoped that a Large Retailer Accountability Act passed by DC's city council would protect unionised shop-workers and act as a bulwark against the spread of low-cost retailers into US inner cities. Walmart, which has largely saturated suburban and rural markets in the US, had threatened to scrap three planned stores in poorer areas of DC and threatened three other sites already under construction if the legislation was enacted. The highly-targeted law required all companies with more than $1bn in global sales and operating in spaces larger than 75,000 square feet to pay at least $12.50, rather than the standard minimum wage of $8.25, unless they had collective bargaining agreements. But Gray, who has been a vocal supporter of Walmart's plans for six new megastores, said the bill was a \"job killer\" that would also drive away companies such as Target, Home Depot, Wegmans, Lowe's, Walgreens, Harris Teeter, AutoZone and Macy's. \"I am vetoing this legislation precisely because I believe in providing a living wage to as many District residents as possible \u2013 and this bill is not a true living-wage measure,\" said Gray. \"While the intentions of its supporters were good, this bill is simply a woefully inadequate and flawed vehicle for achieving the goal we all share.\" His intervention echoes a similar fight in Chicago seven years ago, when a mininum wage bill passed by the city council was vetoed by the mayor, Richard Daley. It could also pave the way for Walmart to expand into other eastern cities, such as New York and Boston, where it has faced fierce resistance. Last year, Walmart battled its way into downtown Los Angeles; it is not yet established in central San Francisco or Seattle. Gray's decision was widely expected, but it prompted an angry response from union-led campaigners. Reverend Graylan Hagler, of Plymouth United Congregational Church of Christ and Faith Strategies: said: \"Unfortunately, the Mayor's decision is hardly surprising because this is exactly what Walmart's lobbyists said would happen. The Mayor's office and Walmart have been working together to defeat this bill from the start. \"If we cannot demand higher wages and good jobs from the nation's and world's largest corporations, DC will not be able to remain a diverse and vibrant city. We strongly urge the city council to override this misguided veto.\" In a company statement a Walmart spokesman, Steven Restivo, praised Gray for choosing \"jobs, economic development and common sense over special interests\". \"Now that this discriminatory legislation is behind us, we will move forward on our first stores in our nation's capital,\" Restivo says. \"We look forward to finishing the work we started in the city almost three years ago: a plan to bring more jobs, shopping options and fresh food choices to Washington DC residents.\"",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone UK chief executive Guy Laurence is leaving after a decade at the British mobile network to run Canadian telecoms group Rogers Communications, and will be replaced by internal candidate Jeroen Hoencamp. Laurence will quit Vodafone in November after six years at the helm of the UK business, where he managed the acquisition of Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide and last month launched Vodafone's 4G service. Hoencamp was chief executive of Vodafone Ireland for two-and-a-half years and in January became enterprise director in the UK, managing Cable &amp; Wireless and relationships with corporate customers. Vodafone group chief Vittorio Colao said in a note to staff: \"I met Guy when he joined Vodafone 13 years ago and have worked closely with him in all his roles. We have all appreciated his energy, his change management mentality and his extraordinary ability to engage and motivate.\" Colao added that Jeroen would bring \"deep knowledge of commercial management\" and \"vast international experience\" to the UK. Laurence's task at Rogers will be to manage a relations with a federal governement determined to increase competition in Canada, where Rogers is one of two dominant players and mobile customers pay some of the highest prices worldwide for a connection. Rogers owns Canada's largest mobile network and one of the country's biggest cable television, broadband and telephone businesses. \"Rogers is an iconic and well respected company in a great country and I'm looking forward to joining,\" said Laurence, who will will succeed the company's retiring chief executive, Nadir Mohamed. \"Its unique mix of wireless, cable and media assets offer a brilliant platform to provide innovative service to Canadians. I intend to build on the strong foundation established under Nadir's leadership to compete and win in the market.\" Manchester-born Laurence will be remembered at Vodafone's Newbury campus for abolishing offices and personal desks for employees. To enforce the policy, staff were armed with a laptop, a mobile phone and a locker, and cleaners instructed to incinerate any items left on desks overnight. Prior to joining Vodafone in 2000, he worked at entertainment companies including Chrysalis Records, the now defunct British television venture ONdigital, UCI Cinemas and MGM Studios. He spent 12 years in marketing and sales at Vodafone Netherlands before returning to the UK. Vodafone's British network is the third largest in the UK after EE and O2. With a \u00a35bn turnover, it is the company's second largest business in Europe by revenues after Germany. Rogers has nearly $13bn (\u00a38.2bn) in revenues annually and is listed in Toronto and New York, but controlled by a trust belonging to the founding family. \"Guy brings an entrepreneurial edge, a fiercely competitive spirit and a sharp focus on both operational excellence and the customer experience,\" said Edward Rogers, chair of the Rogers Control Trust.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Mark Carney loses his cool as forward guidance fails to convince MPs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Mark Carney appeared before MPs on the Treasury select committee last November, he was slick and polished, with just a hint of humility \u2013 every bit the \"rock star central banker\" of his nickname back at home in Canada. But at Thursday's grilling, while the sharp tailoring was still in place, the Bank of England governor's air of affable calm at times appeared to desert him. It's hardly surprising: Carney may have won over the other eight members of the Bank's monetary policy committee to his approach of forward guidance, after what he told MPs were \"fulsome and detailed discussions\"; but the promise to keep rates lower, for longer, has been less than enthusiastically embraced elsewhere. MPs articulated a number of worries that have been well aired among economists and City investors since the policy was announced last month. First, isn't the new framework, with its \"staging post\" of 7% unemployment, and \"knockouts\", of rising inflation expectations, or inflation well above target, a bit complicated \u2013 or as Andrew Tyrie, who was once a fellow at Carney's Oxford alma mater Nuffield College, put it, hard to explain \"down the Dog and Duck\"? No, said Carney, as testily as an exasperated teacher: forward guidance gives extra clarity about the MPC's \"reaction function\", and as such, in itself makes monetary policy more effective. Second, isn't there a risk that the public let rip with their credit cards and flock back to estate agents' windows in the happy expectation of being able to continue borrowing at rockbottom rates? Here, the governor went for the soothing tone of the financial adviser. Don't panic, he said, household finances have improved since the crisis; a housing boom looks a long way off; but we're \"vigilant\", and if a bubble appears, we'll use other tools to prick it. That would be more reassuring if the great house-buying public had a clear understanding of what the Bank can do to take away the property punchbowl. But the new so-called \"macroprudential tools\", which could make it more costly for banks to offer high loan-to-value mortgages, for example, are untested, and will be exercised by a brand new, and equally untested branch of the Bank, the financial policy committee. There must be a risk that shoppers and homebuyers just take away the new governor's central message \u2013 that rates will be lower, for longer. And third, hasn't the net effect of forward guidance actually been a tightening of policy \u2013 the equivalent to an increase in borrowing costs \u2013 because alarmed City investors have pushed up long-term rates, fearing that inflation may run out of control? Here, Carney flatly refused to say whether policy had tightened or loosened; and insisted, somewhat bafflingly, that the rise in long-term rates was \"benign\", because it represented a \"normalisation\" in financial markets, and might actually prompt the banks to lend more. After two gruelling hours, it was painfully clear that forward guidance, far from increasing clarity, has cluttered up the Bank's intellectual furniture with knockouts, staging posts and all the rest \u2013 while giving Britain's ever-ready consumers just the excuse they don't need to go shopping. MPs seemed noticeably less charmed by the \u00a3872,000-a-year governor than at his last outing. Like every rock star at some point in his career, Carney looks in danger of falling out of fashion.",

      "body": "<p>When Mark Carney appeared before MPs on the Treasury select committee last November, he was slick and polished, with just a hint of humility \u2013 every bit the \"rock star central banker\" of his nickname back at home in Canada.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/12/bank-of-england-mark-carney-mps\" title=\"\">at Thursday's grilling</a>, while the sharp tailoring was still in place, the Bank of England governor's air of affable calm at times appeared to desert him.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising: Carney may have won over the other eight members of the Bank's monetary policy committee to his approach of forward guidance, after what he told MPs were \"fulsome and detailed discussions\"; but the promise to keep rates lower, for longer, has been less than enthusiastically embraced elsewhere.</p> <p>MPs articulated a number of worries that have been well aired among economists and City investors since the policy was announced last month.</p> <p>First, isn't the new framework, with its \"staging post\" of 7% unemployment, and \"knockouts\", of rising inflation expectations, or inflation well above target, a bit complicated \u2013 or as Andrew Tyrie, who was once a fellow at Carney's Oxford alma mater Nuffield College, put it, hard to explain \"down the Dog and Duck\"?</p> <p>No, said Carney, as testily as an exasperated teacher: forward guidance gives extra clarity about the MPC's \"reaction function\", and as such, in itself makes monetary policy more effective.</p> <p>Second, isn't there a risk that the public let rip with their credit cards and flock back to estate agents' windows in the happy expectation of being able to continue borrowing at rockbottom rates? Here, the governor went for the soothing tone of the financial adviser. Don't panic, he said, household finances have improved since the crisis; a housing boom looks a long way off; but we're \"vigilant\", and if a bubble appears, we'll use other tools to prick it.</p> <p>That would be more reassuring if the great house-buying public had a clear understanding of what the Bank can do to take away the property punchbowl. But the new so-called \"macroprudential tools\", which could make it more costly for banks to offer high loan-to-value mortgages, for example, are untested, and will be exercised by a brand new, and equally untested branch of the Bank, the financial policy committee.</p> <p>There must be a risk that shoppers and homebuyers just take away the new governor's central message \u2013 that rates will be lower, for longer.</p> <p>And third, hasn't the net effect of forward guidance actually been a tightening of policy \u2013 the equivalent to an increase in borrowing costs \u2013 because alarmed City investors have pushed up long-term rates, fearing that inflation may run out of control?</p> <p>Here, Carney flatly refused to say whether policy had tightened or loosened; and insisted, somewhat bafflingly, that the rise in long-term rates was \"benign\", because it represented a \"normalisation\" in financial markets, and might actually prompt the banks to lend more.</p> <p>After two gruelling hours, it was painfully clear that forward guidance, far from increasing clarity, has cluttered up the Bank's intellectual furniture with knockouts, staging posts and all the rest \u2013 while giving Britain's ever-ready consumers just the excuse they don't need to go shopping. MPs seemed noticeably less charmed by the \u00a3872,000-a-year governor than at his last outing. Like every rock star at some point in his career, Carney looks in danger of falling out of fashion.</p>",

He <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/business/sunday/election_special_transcript_joe_WTnafcZV4jxVyOOPuQb4cI\">said</a>: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll sit down with the Treasury and go through their methodology; I\u2019ll test that methodology and even use external people to help me to test it to see how robust it is.\u201d</p> <p>I hereby volunteer to do the job of external auditor. I propose to do it for half the cost anyone else will, and I promise to deliver him a 128-page report by the end of the week \u2013 heck, by close of business today.</p> <p>What I\u2019ll do is get some senior people in the economic and financial worlds to oversee the entire process. For a start, I\u2019ll get the chair of <a href=\"http://www.accesscapitaladvisers.com.au/\">Access Capital Advisers,&#xa0;</a> Dr&#xa0;David&#xa0;Chessell, to head the review. I\u2019ll also bring on board <a href=\"http://www.bca.com.au/Content/100831.aspx\">Peter Crone</a>, the chief economist and director of policy for the Business Council of Australia; <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/people/ag-fin-system.html\">Malcolm Edey</a>, the RBA\u2019s assistant governor (financial systems); and <a href=\"http://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/about/board\">Dr Lynne Williams</a>, who is on the Business and Economics Board of the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>I can promise Hockey that the report will come up with 11 recommendations and conclude that \u201cover the past two decades, Treasury\u2019s macroeconomic forecasting performance is comparable with that of other domestic forecasters\u201d.</p> <p>And that, \u201cTreasury approaches the forecasting task in a very professional manner and the forecasts it generates are broadly as accurate as those generated by comparable agencies in countries with similar institutional arrangements as Australia.\u201d</p> <p>I can also promise Hockey that the secretary of the Treasury, Dr Martin Parkinson, will not be satisfied with that result. Indeed, I will get him to <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Speeches/2013/Budgeting-in-Challenging-Times\">say in a speech</a>: \u201cWhile this sounds like a pass mark for us, we don't see it that way \u2013&#xa0;our objective is to do better than this benchmark and, historically, we have.\u201d</p> <p>How can I promise all this? Because a major review of Treasury\u2019s forecasts with external people to test the robustness of their methodology was done just 10 months ago, in December 2012, and <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Publications/2013/Forecasting-review\">released publicly in February this year</a>.</p> <p>And this was no small thing. The \u201cReview of Treasury Macroeconomic and Revenue Forecasting\u201d was only the third such review in the past 20 years (the others were done in 1995 and 2005). It\u2019s bizarre that it slipped his mind.</p> <p>I guess he was too busy 10 months ago ranting on about budget emergencies.</p> <p>The review found that, while Treasury\u2019s forecasts were as accurate as anyone else\u2019s, as a rule they took an overly conservative line \u2013 underestimating growth during economic upswings and overestimating growth during economic downturns.</p> <p>In recent times, the biggest problem has been estimating company tax revenue. One way to show how tricky it has been of late is to look at corporate profits (which feed into company tax and capital gains tax and the minerals resource rent tax). In the national accounts, company profitability is measured by the \u201ccorporations gross operating surplus\u201d (GOS). From the December 2011 quarter through to the December 2012 quarter the GOS fell five quarters in a row. How often has that happened going back to 1959 when the measure was first counted?</p> <p>Not once.</p> <p>Before this, it had never even fallen more than three quarters in a row.</p> <p>So, even though in the 2012-13 budget the Treasury was pessimistic about the GOS, it not surprisingly didn\u2019t predict a once-in-54-year event:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-615fcd3a-a668-4524-9192-8f8cb0912e71\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378967071527/4648a332-abf1-47bf-a447-8e1fe286088f-460x246.png\" alt=\"Gross operating surplus\" width=\"460\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gross operating surplus:&nbsp;even though the Treasury was pessimistic about the GOS, it didn&rsquo;t predict a once-in-54-year event. Source: Treasury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other big dilemma has been the disconnection between the terms of trade (what we pay for our exports compared to our imports) and the value of our dollar.</p> <p>We can see this when we use the Reserve Bank\u2019s index of the prices of non-rural commodities (i.e. minerals and LNG):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-241278f0-e080-44bf-a3e8-520a647c71d8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378967186261/999242f8-4524-474f-8b5a-956443a3e287-460x290.jpeg\" alt=\"Commodity prices and TWI\" width=\"460\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commodity prices and TWI: Until May this year the value of our exchange rate (trade weighted index) did not fall at all. Photograph: RBA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since March 2011, the value of non-rural commodities has fallen by about 28%, and yet until May of this year the value of our exchange rate (trade weighted index) did not fall at all. The big correction in May and June saw the value of our dollar fall by 11.5% in 3 months \u2013 the biggest such drop in the past 25 years, aside from during the GFC.</p> <p>Clearly, we live in unusual times. When this results in things turning out better than expected, you never hear too many calls for forecasts to be audited. But during the entire first mining boom, Treasury continually underestimated the increase in export prices. Similarly, the 2009-10 budget forecast a recession that didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Hockey has spent the past three years trying his best to undermine voters\u2019 confidence in the economic and financial institutions of this country in order to have people think Labor has lost control of the budget and the economy.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a good thing Joe Hockey is so against waste because I have a proposal that will help him save a bit of money. On Sunday morning, the incoming Coalition treasurer announced to Channel Nine that he was going to audit the Treasury\u2019s forecasts. He said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll sit down with the Treasury and go through their methodology; I\u2019ll test that methodology and even use external people to help me to test it to see how robust it is.\u201d I hereby volunteer to do the job of external auditor. I propose to do it for half the cost anyone else will, and I promise to deliver him a 128-page report by the end of the week \u2013 heck, by close of business today. What I\u2019ll do is get some senior people in the economic and financial worlds to oversee the entire process. For a start, I\u2019ll get the chair of Access Capital Advisers, Dr David Chessell, to head the review. I\u2019ll also bring on board Peter Crone, the chief economist and director of policy for the Business Council of Australia; Malcolm Edey, the RBA\u2019s assistant governor (financial systems); and Dr Lynne Williams, who is on the Business and Economics Board of the University of Melbourne. I can promise Hockey that the report will come up with 11 recommendations and conclude that \u201cover the past two decades, Treasury\u2019s macroeconomic forecasting performance is comparable with that of other domestic forecasters\u201d. And that, \u201cTreasury approaches the forecasting task in a very professional manner and the forecasts it generates are broadly as accurate as those generated by comparable agencies in countries with similar institutional arrangements as Australia.\u201d I can also promise Hockey that the secretary of the Treasury, Dr Martin Parkinson, will not be satisfied with that result. Indeed, I will get him to say in a speech: \u201cWhile this sounds like a pass mark for us, we don't see it that way \u2013 our objective is to do better than this benchmark and, historically, we have.\u201d How can I promise all this? Because a major review of Treasury\u2019s forecasts with external people to test the robustness of their methodology was done just 10 months ago, in December 2012, and released publicly in February this year. And this was no small thing. The \u201cReview of Treasury Macroeconomic and Revenue Forecasting\u201d was only the third such review in the past 20 years (the others were done in 1995 and 2005). It\u2019s bizarre that it slipped his mind. I guess he was too busy 10 months ago ranting on about budget emergencies. The review found that, while Treasury\u2019s forecasts were as accurate as anyone else\u2019s, as a rule they took an overly conservative line \u2013 underestimating growth during economic upswings and overestimating growth during economic downturns. In recent times, the biggest problem has been estimating company tax revenue. One way to show how tricky it has been of late is to look at corporate profits (which feed into company tax and capital gains tax and the minerals resource rent tax). In the national accounts, company profitability is measured by the \u201ccorporations gross operating surplus\u201d (GOS). From the December 2011 quarter through to the December 2012 quarter the GOS fell five quarters in a row. How often has that happened going back to 1959 when the measure was first counted? Not once. Before this, it had never even fallen more than three quarters in a row. So, even though in the 2012-13 budget the Treasury was pessimistic about the GOS, it not surprisingly didn\u2019t predict a once-in-54-year event: The other big dilemma has been the disconnection between the terms of trade (what we pay for our exports compared to our imports) and the value of our dollar. We can see this when we use the Reserve Bank\u2019s index of the prices of non-rural commodities (i.e. minerals and LNG): Since March 2011, the value of non-rural commodities has fallen by about 28%, and yet until May of this year the value of our exchange rate (trade weighted index) did not fall at all. The big correction in May and June saw the value of our dollar fall by 11.5% in 3 months \u2013 the biggest such drop in the past 25 years, aside from during the GFC. Clearly, we live in unusual times. When this results in things turning out better than expected, you never hear too many calls for forecasts to be audited. But during the entire first mining boom, Treasury continually underestimated the increase in export prices. Similarly, the 2009-10 budget forecast a recession that didn\u2019t happen. Hockey has spent the past three years trying his best to undermine voters\u2019 confidence in the economic and financial institutions of this country in order to have people think Labor has lost control of the budget and the economy. As Treasurer, it is time he realised that his words now carry weight. No longer will they be dismissed as the ranting of a man willing to say anything to get into office. Treasurers\u2019 words move markets. The Tresasury\u2019s forecasts are also relied upon by many organisations to frame their own budgets \u2013 from charities and unions looking at expected levels of unemployment to commercial organisations looking ahead to the economic environment in which they are thinking about investing. They are serious things and they are taken very seriously by Treasury. For Hockey to brazenly claim they need to be audited, with seemingly no comprehension that a full review of the forecasts has just been completed, suggests he has yet to make the switch from opposition to government. Given his responsibility, let\u2019s hope he makes the transition soon.",

      "bodyText": "Europe faces a \"lost decade\", with the number of people trapped in poverty across the continent set to rise by up to 25 million by 2025 unless austerity policies are reversed, according to a damning new report from aid agency Oxfam. The charity, which is better known for delivering relief programmes in developing countries, says the damage being inflicted on many European societies is reminiscent of the devastation wrought by the strict \"structural adjustment\" programmes imposed on poor countries by the International Monetary Fund over the past 25 years. Countries in Latin America and Asia that turned to the IMF for help in the 1980s and 1990s were often forced to slash public spending and liberalise their markets in exchange for rescue loans. \"These policies were a failure: a medicine that sought to cure the disease by killing the patient. They cannot be allowed to happen again\", says the strongly-worded report, to be published on Thursday. Max Lawson, Oxfam's head of advocacy, said: \"We were founded in 1942 because of the famine in Greece; no one would have believed we would be here more than 70 years later, saying, Greece is in a terrible state.\" Using research carried out by thinktank the Institute of Fiscal Studies into the likely impact of austerity on poverty levels in the UK, and extrapolating it across all 27 European Union member-states, Oxfam predicts that relative poverty, defined as the number of people living below 80% of median income, could be set to rise by anything from 15 to 25 million people by 2025. \"The European model is under attack from ill-conceived austerity policies sold to the public as the cost of a stable, growing economy, for which all are being asked to pay. Left unchecked, these measures will undermine Europe's social gains, creating divided countries and a divided continent, and entrenching poverty for a generation,\" says the report. With the EU's finance ministers due to gather in Vilnius, Lithuania on Friday, Oxfam is calling for them to adopt a radical new agenda of more progressive taxation, to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share towards the cost of public services; rising investment; and protection from spending cuts for vital public services such as health and education. The sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone has seen a series of countries, including Greece and Portugal, accept swingeing public spending cuts, mass privatisations and drastic market reforms, as the price of receiving bailouts from the IMF and their European neighbours. Financial markets have been relatively calm in recent months, but a number of senior European officials, including German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, have conceded that Greece is likely to need a new rescue package, worth up to \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.5bn). Negotiations over a third bailout, against the background of a fragile political coalition in Athens, will reignite tensions over whether the package of measures imposed on Europe's peripheral economies have exacerbated their plight. Unemployment is more than 27% in Greece, and 16.5% in Portugal. Lawson said: \"The only people benefiting from austerity are the richest 10% who have seen their share of income rise whilst poorest have seen their share fall. The UK, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain \u2013 countries that are most aggressively pursuing austerity measures - will soon rank amongst the most unequal in the world if their leaders don't change course.\"",
