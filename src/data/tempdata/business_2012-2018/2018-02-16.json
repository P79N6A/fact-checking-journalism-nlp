      "bodyText": "The US commerce department has recommended that Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other nations ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas, according to proposals released on Friday. The long-awaited proposals would fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign promise to protect the US steel industry from foreign competition, particularly from China. They are also likely to spark threats of retaliation. The reviews suggest imposing tariff options of at least 24% on all steel products from all countries, and at least 7.7% on all aluminum products from all countries. Brazil, China, Russia, South Korea, South Africa and Vietnam were among the countries specifically mentioned in the review. The reviews were presented to Trump last month after complaints by US producers that foreign dumping of the two metals was shutting them out of business. Trump authorized the probes under a 1962 trade law that has not been invoked since 2001. The US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross emphasized that Trump would have the final say, including on whether to exempt certain countries, such as Nato allies, from any actions. Trump has until April 11 to announce his decision on steel import curbs and by April 20 to decide on aluminum restrictions. \u201cThe president has the discretion to modify any of these or to come with something totally different,\u201d he told reporters. Steel stocks soared on the recommendations. Ross said he would not be surprised if countries challenged the measures at the World Trade Organization. He said \u201cthere has been no dialing back\u201d of the recommendations due to objections from industries that use steel and aluminum. \u201cThe objective of both reports is to get the production up to a level which will result, in our judgment, in the long term viability of each industry,\u201d Ross said, adding that he did not believe that the recommendations would lead to significant price hikes. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he hoped the proposals \u201care the beginning of efforts by this administration to finally get tough on China\u201d. Some US companies will be able to request exclusions for specific products if the US lacks sufficient domestic capacity or for national security considerations, Ross added. Trump met with a bipartisan group of US senators and congresspeople at the White House last week, signaling he would take at least some action to restrict imports of the two metals. Some US lawmakers and steel and aluminum users have urged caution in any restrictions to avoid disruptions or price spikes in the raw materials, used in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction.",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich is preparing for a London court battle with two other billionaire Russian oligarchs over control of Russia\u2019s biggest mining company. Abramovich is being taken to court by Oleg Deripaska to prevent the Chelsea owner from selling his minority stake in mining firm Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) to Deripaska\u2019s rival Vladimir Potanin. Deripaska, who has an estimated \u00a36bn (\u00a34bn) fortune and entertained George Osborne and Lord Mandelson on his 73m Queen K superyacht, and Potanin, who is worth an estimated $20bn, have been battling for control of Nornickel for years. The dispute was temporarily resolved in 2012 when Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened and installed Abramovich as a \u201cwhite knight\u201d minority shareholder to keep the peace between the other billionaires, who hold stakes of about 30% each via companies they control. The deal saw Abramovich\u2019s investment vehicle Crispian Investment control 5% of Nornickel, worth about \u00a31.5bn. The five-year peacemaker deal expired in December 2017 and Abramovich is reportedly trying to sell his stake to Potanin. Deripaska\u2019s aluminium company Rusal went to the high court in London on Friday seeking an injunction to prevent Abramovich\u2019s investment firm selling its stake to Whiteleave. Rusal is struggling under vast debts and might not have enough money to fight for Abramovich\u2019s stake, which if it were sold to Whiteleave would give Potanin control of Nornickel. Potanin, who is Nornickel\u2019s chief executive, was represented in court on Friday by Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney general. Goldsmith has reportedly charged other Russian billionaires \u00a3960 an hour for his services. Judge Stephen Phillips delayed the injunction hearing until 5 March, and said a trial would likely begin before June. The case is the latest in a series of high profile battles Russian billionaires have chosen to fight in London, turning many City lawyers into millionaires. Abramovich won a \u00a33bn battle against exiled oligarch Boris Berezovsky in 2012, who was found dead at his multi-million pound home near Ascot the following year. Abramovich\u2019s barrister Jonathan Sumption QC was said to have earned more than \u00a31m representing the Chelsea owner.",

      "bodyText": "French state-owned energy firm EDF reported falling profits, including a downturn in the UK due to falling prices for nuclear power, improved energy efficiency among its household customers and the slide in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote. Profits in the UK division, which includes EDF Energy, slumped by a third to \u20ac1.035 (\u00a3920m) as sales dwindled by \u20ac579m to \u20ac8.68bn, partly because UK customers pay their bills in pounds but the company reports its results in euros. EDF said the decline of the pound against the euro had cost it \u20ac608m. The company has faced criticism over delays and the cost of its \u00a320bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant. However, it has blamed a 12% fall in nuclear energy prices in the UK, where it is the market leader. Revenues were depressed by lower home energy consumption among customers, with usage falling 1.9% due to \u201cmilder weather and rising energy efficiency\u201d. EDF, which is majority-owned by the French government, reported a 2.2% decline in overall revenues to \u20ac69.6bn, with profits down 16% to \u20ac13.7bn, excluding the impact of asset sales. It said group results had declined due to lower prices in almost all of the regions where it operates and an exodus of nearly 1 million customers. It was also affected by lower nuclear and hydroelectric output in its domestic market, where it is the dominant supplier with more than 85% market share. Last year the company had unplanned outages at some of its 58 French nuclear plants, where reactors had to be shut down for safety reasons. It lost 960,000 customers, shaving \u20ac341m off profits, blaming the exodus on heightened competition, including in the UK. Chief executive and chairman Jean-Bernard Levy said the group\u2019s profitability in the face of a \u201cdifficult market context\u201d was evidence of EDF\u2019s financial strength, adding that he expects a \u201crebound\u201d in 2018. He said the company would launch an \u201cunprecedented\u201d ramp-up of renewable energy this year, as France looks to reduce nuclear\u2019s share of power generation from 75% to 50% by 2025.",

      "bodyText": "The travel group Tui has the largest gender pay gap reported to date by a major UK company, with its male employees paid more than double the female staff. Women at the group\u2019s Tui Airways UK unit earn on average 56.9% less in hourly pay than men, according to data filed under a new government scheme intended to highlight the gender pay gap and encourage employers to address the disparity. Tui\u2019s median pay gap is 47.3%. The company said the gap stemmed from low representation of women in highly paid roles such as pilots, engineering, technology and senior management. All private and public sector organisations and charities with more than 250 employees are required to submit their pay figures to the government by April under a new scheme intended to reveal differences in average pay for men and women. About 1,000 have filed figures so far, but the legislation is expected to affect about 9,000 companies, which collectively employ more than 15 million people. The gender pay gap refers to the difference between what men and women working for an organisation earn regardless of their roles, rather than men and women in the same role. The Co-operative Bank, easyJet and Virgin Money are among those that have revealed a double-digit gap in their mean hourly pay rates between male and female workers. \u201cWe know that our gender pay gap is not an equal pay issue, rather a lack of representation in specific roles,\u201d Tui said in its gender pay gap report for its UK &amp; Ireland business. Tui Airways UK, which was known as Thomson Airways until October, employs 870 pilots earning an average of \u00a3111,683, of whom 95% are men. In contrast nearly 80% of its cabin crew, who are paid an average of \u00a326,272, are women. But even at its head office Tui revealed a pay gap. Although 62% of its 3,308 head office staff are women, men are more likely to hold the better-paid roles in senior management, engineering or technology. Tui said it was seeking an \u201cinclusive and diverse workforce in all areas of our business\u201d and would try and find answers both internally and with the rest of the airline industry. \u201cWe remain committed to raising awareness within the retail and airline industry on all aspects of diversity and inclusion, as well as effecting change in our own business,\u201d a TUI spokesman said. Tui\u2019s efforts come after the easyJet chief executive, Johan Lundgren, voluntarily took a \u00a334,000 pay cut to match the salary of his predecessor, Carolyn McCall, as he said he was \u201ccommitted to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men\u201d. The FTSE 100 company has a large gender pay gap, with women paid 51.7% less than men \u2013 a median pay gap of 45.5%. This is because the vast majority \u2013 94% \u2013 of its pilots are men. Only 4% of commercial pilots in the industry worldwide are female. EasyJet has set itself a target that a fifth of all new pilots recruited should be female by 2020, up from 6% in 2015 and 13% now. Last year it recruited 49 female pilots. Of the 1,000 companies that have reported only Phase Eight, the fashion retailer, has a larger gender pay gap than Tui when looking at the mean. This measures average pay by taking the total paid to each gender and dividing it by the number of employees of that gender. Women are paid nearly 65% less on average (54.5% median) at the clothing business despite making up 97.5% of the workforce. Of just 44 men working in the company, 39 are employed at the head office, including the chief executive. More than half of the senior leadership team are men. The figures also indicate a difficult environment for women to get ahead, as a far larger proportion of men have been promotedthan women. Despite men accounting for 2.5% of the Phase Eight workforce, 12% of promotions were of male staff. In its gender pay gap report, Phase Eight said it was confident that women and men were paid equally for doing equivalent jobs and was offering additional training and development and promoting flexible working to encourage women to apply for corporate jobs. This article was amended on 29 March 2018 to add the median pay gap figures.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite hopes of a pick-up in high street spending after a poor December, UK retail sales came in weaker than expected in January. Sales of gym wear improved but food sales fell, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile the boss of the British Chambers of Commerce has warned that UK companies face a recruitment crisis. In the US, housing starts were higher than expected in January, as were import prices, a further sign of growing inflationary pressures. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. After five days of rises, US markets have edged higher at the start of the week\u2019s final trading day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 35 points or 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 is 0.03% better and the Nasdaq Composite 0.04% higher. The US housing and import price data and some mixed company results - Kraft Heinz missed expectations, Coca-Cola bettered them - has push the futures into the red. Reversing earlier gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now expected to open around 13 points lower. Meanwhile US import prices climbed by more than expected in January, adding to the signs of increasing inflationary pressures. With increases in the cost of imported petrol and other goods, import prices climbed by 1% last month, compared to a 0.1% rise in December and expectations of a 0.6% increase. More signs of strength in the US housing market. Housing starts in January came in at 1.326m units, up from a revised December figure of 1.209m and higher than the expected 1.234. December\u2019s figure was initially given as 1.192m units. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls for the US markets: US markets are expected to open higher again, with the futures suggesting a 74 point initial rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: US equity markets could end the week with a full house of gains as long as indices manage to hold onto the small gains being seen in futures ahead of the open. This would also bring an end to two shocking weeks for equity markets that saw more than 10% quickly wiped off indices, the first time we\u2019ve seen such a move since the start of 2016. While the prospect of higher yields and interest rates, combined with a surge in volatility, have been blamed for the decline, the rebound we\u2019re now seeing reaffirms the belief that fundamentals are still strong which should prevent the situation deteriorating further. The head of the British Chambers of Commerce has warned companies are facing a recruitment crisis and urged the government to act, in an article for the Guardian: British companies are facing a recruitment crisis, with labour shortages hitting critical levels in some sectors, according to a business leader who has urged the government to produce details on a post-Brexit immigration system. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the lack of candidates for some jobs was biting hard, and he warned ministers against bringing forward a \u201cdraconian and damaging\u201d visa or work permit system. Surveys by the BCC showed that nearly three-quarters of firms trying to recruit had been experiencing difficulties \u201cat or near the highest levels since [BCC] records began over 25 years ago\u201d, he said. Here is our full report: And here is Marshall\u2019s opinion piece: Here\u2019s our full story on the UK retail sales. Sarah Butler writes: January was a tough month for high street retailers as sales rose just 0.1%, far below City expectations, as higher prices continued to deter shoppers from spending. City analysts had expected a recovery of around 0.5% last month, after the unexpectedly sharp fall of 1.4% in December. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicate a pick up in year-on-year growth to 1.6% in January, from 1.5% in December, but analysts had hoped for a bigger turnaround after a very disappointing end to last year. Food sales fell again \u2013 down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u2013 but that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u2019s toys. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, said: \u201cRetail sales growth was broadly flat at the beginning of the new year with the longer-term picture showing a continued slowdown in the sector. This can partly be attributed to a background of generally rising prices.\u201d She said there had been a 0.9% decline in the volume of food compared with January 2017 while non-food rose 2.6%, led by sports equipment, games and toys. An uplift in sales of gym kit as consumers resolved to get fit and lose weight contributed to a year-on-year rise. It was the sixth consecutive month of decline in the volume of food sold. Read more here: Sterling has slipped into negative territory against the dollar, as investors mull over the weaker than expected retail sales. The pound is down 0.18% at $1.4070 having earlier been as high as $1.4144. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.06% at \u20ac1.1264. Commenting on the retail sales figures, Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, said: The squeeze on consumer spending created by high inflation and a weakened pound continues. Over the three months covering the Christmas and New Year period (November to January), the volume of retail sales was just 0.1 percent up on the previous three months - the weakest growth we have seen on this measure for nearly a year. While inflation continues to run ahead of pay increases, it is not surprising that consumers are cautious and retail sales growth is sluggish. Looking ahead, we should expect the squeeze on consumer spending from high inflation to ease as we progress through this year. But the economic benefits of lower inflation are unlikely to be felt until the second half of 2018 at the earliest. The first half of this year will continue to be a difficult environment for retailers and other consumer-facing sectors. The silver lining to these consumer spending clouds is that the global economy is still performing strongly, as we saw from very positive figures for growth in our EU partners released yesterday. So disappointing performance in retailing and other consumer sectors is being offset by a positive uplift from strong growth elsewhere in Europe and across the global economy. UK economic growth should be around 1.5 percent this year - disappointing in comparison with other major economies, but strong enough to prevent a significant rise in unemployment. And the UK research director at Global Data Retail: Here\u2019s the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Here\u2019s breakdown of non-food sales, showing the growth in sports equipment: Following the disappointing retail sales, economist James Smith at ING Bank is not optimistic about the outlook for the sector. But he believes the Bank of England could still raise rates in May : After what was a particularly tough Christmas trading period for retailers, consumers continued to keep the foot on the brakes through January. Retail sales barely increased in the first month of the year (0.1% rise), suggesting that shoppers were reluctant to heavily participate in the traditional January sales, backing-up separate findings from Visa. For now, we see few catalysts for a sustained rebound in spending over coming months. Consumer confidence remains depressed (despite some recent improvement) and disposable incomes look set to remain under pressure. True, wage growth has been performing better recently, giving the Bank of England increased confidence that the tight labour market is prompting firms to offer more generous pay packets. That said, it\u2019s still early days and we think there remains a risk that some firms take a more cautious stance, amidst slower economic momentum and elevated uncertainty. At the same time, food and fuel costs are continuing to rise, even though in general consumer prices have largely adjusted to the post-Brexit weakening in the pound. When it comes to the outlook for interest rates though, it\u2019s worth remembering that the Bank of England has already factored much of this weakness into their assessment of UK growth. Assuming the next couple of wage growth readings continue to paint an improved picture, we think policymakers will have enough confidence to hike rates in May - although of course, this remains heavily contingent on progress in the Brexit negotiations. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Hopes for a rebound on December\u2019s poor UK retail sales results failed to materialise after today\u2019s data revealed sluggish growth in January. UK shoppers continued the theme of keeping their money in their pockets post-Christmas, and weaker than expected data could now have an adverse effect on the pound, which has been heading for its best weekly performance since September. Positive Brexit negotiations and the \u2018glass half-full mentality\u2019 surrounding talks could start to rub off on the market and consumers might take heart from this, but the market is currently volatile and retail sales growth could be unpredictable for the next few months. The bigger picture still shows that consumer price inflation sits at 3% and wage growth is continuing to languish, so before we see any movement on both fronts, there could be a glass ceiling in place for any retail sales growth. Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, comments: Who\u2019d be a retailer right now? The ONS sees the longer-term picture for the retail sector as in a \u201ccontinued slowdown\u201d and the average British consumer is looking at real wage declines, higher borrowing costs, and record levels of consumer deb. The average Brit has spent the past few years living the mantra \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go shopping\u201d but January\u2019s retail sales number shows that UK consumer spending is not as hardy as it once was and this represents a real risk to Q1 GDP already. Here\u2019s Societe Generale\u2019s Kit Juckes: The weaker than expected retail sales numbers have taken the shine off sterling. The pound is now up just 0.1% against the dollar at $1.4108, having earlier climbed as high as $1.4144. Rhian Murphy, Office for National Statistics Senior Statistician said: Retail sales growth was broadly flat at the beginning of the New Year with the longer-term picture showing a continued slowdown in the sector. This can partly be attributed to a background of generally rising prices. Growth in the quantity of sporting equipment, games and toys being bought was offset by falling food sales when compared with the same month a year earlier. Sporting equipment sales have grown more than usual in January 2018, following an increased uptake for gym wear. It seems the retail figures were boosted by people deciding to get fit after possibly overindulging at Christmas. The ONS said: The main contribution to the year-on-year growth came from non-food stores, with sports equipment, games and toys increasing sales in the quantity bought in this sector by 10.9%. Feedback from retailers suggested that New Year\u2019s resolutions to \u201cget fit and lose weight\u201d contributed to this increase of sales when compared with the previous year. As for food sales: The year-on-year growth rate for quantity bought in food stores showed a decline for the sixth consecutive month at negative 0.9%, due largely to a continued rise in food store prices. High street sales has dropped sharply in December as shoppers brought forward sales into November to take advantage of discounts including the Black Friday sales. Taking the three months from November to January, sales edged up just 0.1% after climbing 0.5% in the three months to December. British shoppers kept their money in their pockets in January, with retail sales coming in sharply lower than forecast. Overall retail sales volumes rose 0.1% month on month, compared to expectations of an increase of around 0.5%. Year on year growth was 1.6%, the highest since August but at the bottom end of expectations of around 2.4%. Bigger than usual spending on gym wear was offset by a fall in food sales, said the Office for National Statistics. The pound is heading for its best weekly performance since September, buoyed by a weaker dollar, the expectation of rising interest rates from a more hawkish Bank of England, and hopes that Brexit talks will progress. Of course, that is before the UK retail sales figures, which could have an influence one way or the other. Ahead of the UK retail sales figures, here is economist Rupert Seggins: After four weeks of falls - including a 4.7% decline last week - the FTSE 100 is on track for a positive five days of trading. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite a week that\u2019s been chock full of hawkish data, the markets continued to mount a comeback this Friday, extending the gains made on Thursday hit it a slew of 7 day-plus highs. The FTSE rose a further half a percent after the bell, allowing the index to tickle 7275. That is the index\u2019s best price in around 10 days, with the FTSE finding a way to co-exist with cable\u2019s own climb. Against the dollar sterling jumped 0.3%, lifting the pound towards $1.413 for the first time since last Monday. The currency has had less success against the euro, with its current \u20ac1.127 levels at the bottom end of the pound\u2019s recent range. Sterling is presumably feeling chipper not just because of the dollar\u2019s sustained, hawk-ignoring weakness, but the fact the UK should a solid retail sales reading this Friday. Analysts are expecting January\u2019s figure to come in at 0.5%, a colossal improvement on December\u2019s disappointing -1.5%. Elsewhere the Eurozone was just as perky as the UK this morning. The DAX rose 0.4%, leaving it a handful of points from 12400, while the CAC was up half a percent, sitting just the wrong side of 5250. The region has nothing to deal with this Friday, so any movement will be dictated by the wider macro-sentiment. Markets are holding on to their gains ahead of the UK retail sales figures. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, said: Where Wall Street goes, other markets follow, and this bounce back from last week\u2019s lows is no different. Traders are quickly getting used to higher bond yields, higher inflation and another round of hikes in global interest rates that will follow, so much so that US stocks are recovering twice as fast as in London. Markets will remain volatile, for sure, but we\u2019ve just found out that big investors can\u2019t stay out of this market for long, and demand for equities typically picks up in the weeks before tax year-end. With Wall Street and Asian markets continuing their recovery after the early February slump, European share prices are off to a good start in early trading. The FTSE 100 is 44 points or 0.6% better , while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.49% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.55%. Balfour Beatty is trying to shake off the cloud of Carillion, the collapsed UK contractor, and today it has announced a joint venture contract win in the US. It has been awarded a $1.95bn (\u00a31.4bn) deal to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the \u2018Automated People Mover\u2019 at Los Angeles International Airport. Balfour\u2019s share amounts to around \u00a3420m. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said: Good news for Balfour Beatty with a major contract award that should help the stock shrug off the cloud of the Carillion mess that has left the shares down more than 10% in the last month... Despite some setbacks in the share price following the collapse of Carillion, this is yet another sign of the solid progress being made under Leo Quinn and the Build to Last strategy. It\u2019s the first major public-private partnership contract win in the US civil infrastructure market \u2013 one that could grow significantly in the coming years, particularly if we consider the shape of proposed infrastructure plans. The hope is that Donald Trump\u2019s infrastructure spending plan will produce more such contracts for Balfour. Existing heavy US exposure means it is well placed to benefit, although it remains unclear exactly what the spending plan will eventually look like. [Its] shares have taken a bit of a whipping since Carillion went under... as investors have bolted for cover from the sector. But aside from the around \u00a340m one-off hit from its joint venture with Carillion, you have to ask what else are investors assuming? There are lots of encouraging signs for Balfour that should probably override such fears. US exposure is key in tapping growth and in insulating from UK market and this latest contract is a positive sign. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets continue to recover some of the ground lost during the early February rout, despite further signs yesterday of rising inflation, one of the key factors behind the slump. The concerns about price increases led to a jump in bond yields, and there seems little sign of that ending. So, as Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, put it: The fact that stock markets appear to have recovered their equilibrium when rates are now higher than when markets first sold off, does make you question why the sell-off happened in the first place. With Wall Street up 306 points or 1.2% and the Nikkei 225 climbing 1% overnight, European markets are expected to continue the trend: The UK market\u2019s positivity comes despite a rise in the pound, which usually puts the dampeners on the FTSE 100\u2019s overseas earners. Sterling - which is benefiting from the weaker dollar as well as renewed optimism about the outcome of the Brexit talks - is currently up 0.27% to $1.4135 and could go higher if today\u2019s UK retail sales figures live up to expectations. The month on month figure for January is expected to rise to 0.6% after December\u2019s 1.5% decline. The year on year number is forecast to rise from 1.3% to 2.4%. CMC\u2019s Hewson again: The UK had a pretty rotten month in December, with a slump of 1.5%, though that was largely as a result of bumper November number of 1.1% which had been boosted by Black Friday sales spending. Recent retail sales numbers from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG earlier this month appeared to show that while some retailers were struggling we did see a pickup in January, as consumers started to re-open their wallets after a slow December. The recent cold weather in January may well have also prompted an increase in demand for coats and gloves, with an expectation that we could see a rise of 0.6%. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: The pound wasted little time capitalising on the weaker dollar and continued to charge higher passing $1.41 overnight. Investors will now turn their attention towards UK retail sales due this morning at 09:30 GMT. Analysts are expecting retail sales to have increased 2.4% year on year in January, up from 1.3% in December. Given the hawkish tone from the Bank of England earlier this month, in addition to the higher than forecast CPI data, a higher reading in retail sales could see the pound target its previous high of $1.4375. The agenda: 9.30 GMT: UK retail sales 13.00 GMT: US housing starts We\u2019ll be following all the developments during the day.",

Over the three months covering the Christmas and New Year period (November to January), the volume of retail sales was just 0.1 percent up on the previous three months - the weakest growth we have seen on this measure for nearly a year. While inflation continues to run ahead of pay increases, it is not surprising that consumers are cautious and retail sales growth is sluggish.</p> <p>Looking ahead, we should expect the squeeze on consumer spending from high inflation to ease as we progress through this year. But the economic benefits of lower inflation are unlikely to be felt until the second half of 2018 at the earliest. The first half of this year will continue to be a difficult environment for retailers and other consumer-facing sectors.</p> <p>The silver lining to these consumer spending clouds is that the global economy is still performing strongly, as we saw from very positive figures for growth in our EU partners released yesterday. So disappointing performance in retailing and other consumer sectors is being offset by a positive uplift from strong growth elsewhere in Europe and across the global economy.

But he believes the Bank of England could still raise rates in May :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After what was a particularly tough Christmas trading period for retailers, consumers continued to keep the foot on the brakes through January. Retail sales barely increased in the first month of the year (0.1% rise), suggesting that shoppers were reluctant to heavily participate in the traditional January sales, backing-up separate findings from Visa. For now, we see few catalysts for a sustained rebound in spending over coming months.</p> <p>Consumer confidence remains depressed (despite some recent improvement) and disposable incomes look set to remain under pressure. True, wage growth has been performing better recently, giving the Bank of England increased confidence that the tight labour market is prompting firms to offer more generous pay packets. That said, it\u2019s still early days and we think there remains a risk that some firms take a more cautious stance, amidst slower economic momentum and elevated uncertainty. At the same time, food and fuel costs are continuing to rise, even though in general consumer prices have largely adjusted to the post-Brexit weakening in the pound.</p> <p>When it comes to the outlook for interest rates though, it\u2019s worth remembering that the Bank of England has already factored much of this weakness into their assessment of UK growth. Assuming the next couple of wage growth readings continue to paint an improved picture, we think policymakers will have enough confidence to hike rates in May - although of course, this remains heavily contingent on progress in the Brexit negotiations.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2af4d9339408156ad742a63ae2e846a4d3c7c322\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2af4d9339408156ad742a63ae2e846a4d3c7c322/0_0_1063_834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"retsales1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hopes for a rebound on December\u2019s poor UK retail sales results failed to materialise after today\u2019s data revealed sluggish growth in January.</p> <p>UK shoppers continued the theme of keeping their money in their pockets post-Christmas, and weaker than expected data could now have an adverse effect on the pound, which has been heading for its best weekly performance since September.</p> <p>Positive Brexit negotiations and the \u2018glass half-full mentality\u2019 surrounding talks could start to rub off on the market and consumers might take heart from this, but the market is currently volatile and retail sales growth could be unpredictable for the next few months.</p> <p>The bigger picture still shows that consumer price inflation sits at 3% and wage growth is continuing to languish, so before we see any movement on both fronts, there could be a glass ceiling in place for any retail sales growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Who\u2019d be a retailer right now?

The recent cold weather in January may well have also prompted an increase in demand for coats and gloves, with an expectation that we could see a rise of 0.6%. </p> </blockquote> <p>Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound wasted little time capitalising on the weaker dollar and continued to charge higher passing $1.41 overnight. Investors will now turn their attention towards UK retail sales due this morning at 09:30 GMT. Analysts are expecting retail sales to have increased 2.4% year on year in January, up from 1.3% in December. Given the hawkish tone from the Bank of England earlier this month, in addition to the higher than forecast CPI data, a higher reading in retail sales could see the pound target its previous high of $1.4375.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.30 GMT: UK retail sales</p> <p>13.00 GMT: US housing starts</p> <p><em>We\u2019ll be following all the developments during the day.</em></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "January was a tough month for high street retailers as sales rose just 0.1%, far below City expectations, as higher prices continued to deter shoppers from spending. City analysts had expected a recovery of around 0.5% last month, after the unexpectedly sharp fall of 1.4% in December. The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicate a pick up in year-on-year growth to 1.6% in January, from 1.5% in December, but analysts had hoped for a bigger turnaround after a very disappointing end to last year. Food sales fell again \u2013 down 0.9% in volume terms on December \u2013 but that was offset by a rise in sales of gym kit and children\u2019s toys. Rhian Murphy, ONS senior statistician, said: \u201cRetail sales growth was broadly flat at the beginning of the new year with the longer-term picture showing a continued slowdown in the sector. This can partly be attributed to a background of generally rising prices.\u201d She said there had been a 0.9% decline in the volume of food compared with January 2017 while non-food rose 2.6%, led by sports equipment, games and toys. An uplift in sales of gym kit as consumers resolved to get fit and lose weight contributed to a year-on-year rise. It was the sixth consecutive month of decline in the volume of food sold. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, said: \u201cWho\u2019d be a retailer right now? The ONS sees the longer-term picture for the retail sector as in a \u201ccontinued slowdown and the average British consumer is looking at real wage declines, higher borrowing costs, and record levels of consumer debt.\u201d Keith Richardson, managing director of the retail sector at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: \u201cConsumers were already tightening their belts at the end of 2017 by bringing most of their Christmas shopping forward to Black Friday to make the most of the sales. Now it looks like they\u2019ve started 2018 in cautious mood with subdued spending.\u201d Retailers are suffering as households have seen their spending power squeezed by rising inflation as a result of the drop in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote. The rising cost of goods has outstripped wage inflation despite high levels of employment. Economists are expecting inflation to ease towards the second half of this year but official data earlier this week showed it remained high at 3% in January, just off November\u2019s near six-year high of 3.1%. The official figures on sales volumes tell a different story to retailers\u2019 sales figures. Food price inflation has driven a pick-up in the value of sales at the major grocers with sales rising 3.4% in the three months to the end of January compared to the same period a year before according to analysts Kantar Worldpanel. In contrast, non-food retailers are being squeezed by lacklustre demand and rising costs. The pressure is driving major chains including Debenhams, New Look and House of Fraser to consider closing stores while some weaker chains including furniture retailers Warren Evans, MultiYork and Feather &amp; Black have called in administrators. Toys R Us is also facing financial difficulties as it plans to close stores under an insolvency deal. The British Retail Consortium\u2019s Rachel Lund said the ONS figures represent \u201cwhat is likely to become the norm\u201d over the coming year. \u201cThe fact is that consumers\u2019 incomes simply aren\u2019t increasing fast enough to support levels of sales growth that we\u2019d become used to. Last year, households were able to dip into reserves to support purchasing levels, despite the pressures on household incomes. \u201cHowever with household saving rates reaching new lows, that is no longer an option, so we\u2019re likely to see sales move much more closely in line with earnings. \u201cAll of this signals another challenging year for retailers. With greater competition for households\u2019 increasingly precious discretionary spending, retailers will have to be savvier than ever in offering great products and great value to consumers.\u201d",

Workers in London are battling an 81-minute commute, the longest in the country and equivalent to 38 working days a year. Meanwhile nearly 3.7m of us spend two hours a day travelling to and from work. So if commuting can\u2019t be avoided, how do you make the most of it? Work offline I once heard of someone who took a train from Manchester to Southampton just to have four solid hours of uninterrupted time to get some work done. Do you have a \u201cuseful reading\u201d pile on the desk which never gets read? If you have a long train journey, don\u2019t waste time with flaky wifi or dodgy mobile signals. Take advantage of the blackout zone and crack on with that piece of work that requires more focus and less connectivity. Whether it\u2019s a report your colleague asked you to review, documents circulated for an upcoming meeting, or wider industry updates to help you stay ahead, save it for your commute. Recharge your brain Do you find yourself going on standby when you\u2019re commuting \u2013 not switched on, but not switched off either? Why not use the time to recharge instead? Sleep enhances productivity, and doing something that actively encourages your brain to switch off from work can be good for your creativity and your wellbeing. Take a nap \u2013 as long as you\u2019re not driving of course \u2013 and make sure you have an alarm set for when you reach your stop. As well as sleeping, the usual remedies for the tedium of being in transit, such as reading a novel, listening to music or watching a movie or TV drama, are great for switching your brain off. Think big At the office, everything and everyone beckons \u2013 the emails, the meetings, the colleagues at your desk, and, of course, the work that needs to be done. It\u2019s easy to get drawn into reactive mode. We all know the benefits of planning, organising and thinking ahead, but making that actually happen in the office is a different story. So use your commute to review your priorities and get your head clear. Also, you could think about what big project or new idea you have lurking on your to-do list. A decision, a problem, an idea to explore \u2013 we often think better on the move, so use your commute as time to reflect. Get away from it all Being stuck in a crowded carriage bumping along the tracks with a bunch of strangers isn\u2019t the most obvious time to meditate, but perhaps that\u2019s precisely when some zen could be useful. For guided meditation, try an app like Headspace or Calm. You could also use noise-cancellation headphones to tune out that crying child, the woman talking loudly on her phone or the guy who\u2019s munching crisps right next to you.
