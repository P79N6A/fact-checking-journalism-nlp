      "bodyText": "The number of homes on the market fell to a 37-year low in June, helping send prices surging by 1.7% in a month and prompting warnings they will be pushed to ever more unaffordable levels. As surveyors said the number of homes listed for sale with each of its members was at its lowest level since records began in 1978, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, Halifax, said that the average UK house price had broken through the \u00a3200,000 barrier for the first time on its measure, following an unexpected 1.7% surge in June. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that at 49.5, the average number of homes for sale with each member had fallen from 61 in June last year and was down from a peak of 148 in 1996. It said the reasons behind the drought of homes on the market varied around the country \u2013 in expensive areas it blamed the high cost of stamp duty and other fees making renovation and extensions more financially appealing than moving. It added that lack of stock was self-perpetuating as people were put off selling because there was little choice of homes to move to. Demand for homes increased in every area except the south-east, and Rics said its members were more positive about a rise in the number of sales than at any point since April 2014. The mismatch between demand and supply appeared to be keeping prices buoyant and Rics said the number of members reporting price rises had hit an 11-month high. In total, 41% more surveyors said they expected house prices to rise over the next three months - the highest proportion in more than a year. Rics chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said: \u201cThere had been some hope that the removal of political uncertainty following the general election would encourage more properties onto the market but the initial indications are that this is not proving to be the case. \u201cAdditionally, the recent flat pattern of appraisals by respondents to the survey suggests this is not about to change anytime soon. As a result, it is hardly surprising that prices across much of the country are continuing to be squeezed higher with property set to become ever more unaffordable.\u201d Halifax\u2019s monthly snapshot of the market, which is based on mortgages it has approved during the month, showed prices had risen for a fourth month running, and were now higher than the previous pre-crisis peak. Over the quarter they were up by 3.3% \u2013 the biggest three-month increase since November 2009. The bank said the average UK property price had now reached \u00a3200,280 \u2013 the first time it had gone past \u00a3200,000 since it started recording prices in 1983. Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax, said short supply of homes for sale had been driving up prices. \u201cThis shortage has been a key factor maintaining house price growth at a robust pace so far in 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cEconomic growth, higher employment, increasing real earnings growth and very low mortgage rates are all supporting housing demand, with signs of a recent modest pick-up in demand.\u201d The sudden sharp June increase has resulted in a marked increase in the annual rate of inflation to 9.6% compared with 8.6% just a month earlier. It puts annual house growth back up to where it was in September 2014 and has caused some economists to rethink their forecasts. \u201cOur current forecast is for house prices to rise by 6% over 2015, but the Halifax data at least suggests that this may be too conservative a projection,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, who described the lender\u2019s latest report as \u201ca bit of a stunner\u201d. However, Archer cautioned that data from the Halifax has been more volatile than other house price measures in recent months and that no one should pin too much weight on one particular house price survey or measure. Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics, said the stage was set for further house price gains over the course of the year. However, he added: \u201cWe doubt prices will be able to continue to rise at this breakneck pace.\u201d Pointon said mortgage lending was unlikely to relax significantly and the Bank of England\u2019s recent warning over buy-to-let \u201cshould prevent a surge in active housing demand, and keep house price gains to around 6% this year\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "As the New York stock exchange entered a second hour of non-trading on Wednesday, an increasing numbers of traders emerged to take in air or enjoy a quick cigarette break. The NYSE, a regal building on Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, is the embodiment of American capitalism, draped in a huge American flag. Tourists snap selfies and family portraits nearby but the building remains inaccessible, the traders who work on its floors separated from the public by metal barricades. The exchange has claimed at least a 10ft-wide sidewalk, where traders can smoke in peace. And smoke they did on Wednesday. There was little else to do. About an hour after the trading halted, one walked out. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d two photographers standing nearby asked. He shrugged: \u201cThe system crashed.\u201d Another trader told reporters that trading being halted wasn\u2019t scary, but them asking questions was. It wasn\u2019t until an options trader, who only gave his name as Chris, came out to puff away on his e-cigarette that reporters finally got some of their questions answered. \u201cBefore [the exchange] opened, before the bell opened, there was an issue saying that they are having a problem with 220 symbols throughout the floor,\u201d Chris explained. \u201cOnce those 220 couldn\u2019t be resolved, it seemed like they stopped everything to be safe.\u201d According to Chris, the traders were told that trading was halted due to a technical issue and that the exchange was working on it. \u201cWe need better technology,\u201d Chris said, adding that in his 16 years of working on the New York stock exchange, nothing like this has taken place. It makes me worried that they are trying to make this a fully automated exchange. What they are doing, they are slowing things down on purpose, saying: \u2018We don\u2019t need people. If we had different technology and we didn\u2019t have people running certain things, we wouldn\u2019t have this problem.\u2019 They are trying to make everything electronic. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d So does the exchange need people? \u201cThey don\u2019t need human beings,\u201d he said. But could today\u2019s technical difficulties be a sign that the exchange does need people? \u201cHopefully it will help,\u201d Chris said, dragging his hands over his face. \u201cWho knows when it comes to technology? I have no idea.\u201d There is a reason the NYSE is feeling pressure to modernize: the other guys are doing it. On Monday a number of buying pits owned by CME Group in New York and Chicago went silent as they were closed for good in favor of electronic trading. Among the remaining pits are those where Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 stocks, futures and options are traded, as well as the floor for stocks listed on the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange. As for whether Wednesday\u2019s three-hour break was due to a hack or really was just an technical issue, Chris couldn\u2019t say. \u201cI am just reading headlines as you are so I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s a hack or whatnot. I don\u2019t believe it is [a hack],\u201d he told the press gathered outside the stock exchange.",

    "webTitle": "Stock trading closed on NYSE after glitch caused major outage \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close our coverage of the stock market outage for the day with a quick summary of what happened and what we do and don\u2019t know. The New York Stock Exchange abruptly shut down at 11.32am local time and did not resume trading until about 3.10pm. NYSE president Thomas Farley said that the outage was caused by technical \u201cconfiguration problem\u201d that was \u201cfixed\u201d, but he did not describe what exactly went wrong and forced the midday shutdown. He said an investigation would begin on Wednesday night. Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson said that there was no indication the outage was linked to \u201cnefarious\u201d actors or a cyberattack, but law enforcement, SEC and Treasury officials said that although were in close communication with Wall Street nonetheless. Stocks closed down on the day by about 1.5%, but without any apparent panic over the technical failures of the US\u2019s premier stock exchange. Chinese markets continued a free fall on the other hand, and with debt fears in Europe rattled the market. The outage revives questions about the automation of Wall Street, with some traders raising concerns about the dependency on machines, unintended consequences and having recovery systems in the case of a true disaster. Officials said there was no reason to believe the technical problem was linked to coincidental problems in United Airlines computer systems or at the Wall Street Journal. The outage was caused by a \u201cconfiguration problem in our system that needed fixing,\u201d NYSE president Tom Farley has told CNBC, but adds: \u201cwhether that came up as a result of an update is premature\u201d to say. \u201cWe found what was wrong and we fixed what was wrong and we have no evidence whatsoever to suspect that it was external. \u201cTonight and overnight starts the investigation of what exactly we need to change. Do we need to change those protocols? Absolutely. Exactly what those changes are I\u2019m\u2019 not prepared to say.\u201d Farley argues that suspending trading on the floor was actually the lesser of two evils compared to shifting trading to the emergency recovery center in Chicago. \u201cIt was never really an option for us to go to the disaster recovery,\u201d he says. The NYSE would have shifted to Chicago only in the event of a \u201ccatastrophe, a hurricane\u201d or something similar, he adds. \u201cWe have a playbook that we follow, and that involves making a decision like I did today,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the important concepts or precepts of our plan is to choose the least disruptive option to customers wherever possible.\u201d \u201cUltimately while we think of the cloud and the ether and the internet, ultimately you\u2019re connecting to a place \u2026 so in order to go to a disaster recovery system you need to point to that place.\u201d Finally he adds that the NYSE was in \u201cnear constant communication, not just today\u201d with government and security agencies. No matter how bad a day today was for the tech developers at the NYSE, traders in China had a worse day as their stock market continued its three-week nosedive. They\u2019ve also had a bit of fun at New York\u2019s expense. Buzzfeed has collected and translated some of the better quips: \u201cIn order to set an example of trading halt for China\u2019s stock markets, NYSE did its best1\u201d \u201cIs it because NYSE traders bought Chinese stocks?\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s done by our men.\u201d You can read the set here. The bells sound and the traders clap: it\u2019s closing time on Wall Street after a three and a half hour outage blamed on technical problems. Although the NYSE was closed for half the day, trading continued through other venues, and the day of decline continued as concerns about the Chinese market and Greek debt influenced the market. All in all, the Dow was down about 260pts (1.47%), the S&amp;P down 35pts (1.67%) and the Nasdaq down 87pts (1.75%) \u2013 not a great day for Wall Street, though nothing like the free fall and panic from the day in China. Need more dystopia in your day of Wall Street semi-shutdowns? Molly Crabapple has your apocalyptic vision over at Comment is Free. Outside, I take in the scene: street preachers denouncing Gnosticism, a lone banker trying to garrote himself with ticket tape, and the Bull \u2013 that gold, beautiful bull \u2013 running through the streets like Zeus. I chase after it for a quote, but, like the dubious financial transactions powered by super-compressors, it is too quick. Smoke. Weeping. Screams. I hire now-former JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon as my local fixer. \u201cTell me the ways of your people, caught as they are between the present and the ancient past,\u201d I demand, offering him half a hotdog as payment. Instead, he weeps. He tried to seek shelter at the dungeon of his favorite pro domme, he tells me, but when his black card bounced she slammed the door in his face. In Zuccotti Park, once the home of Occupy, the ex-Goldman Sachs boys have built a squatters city out of Herm\u00e8s gift boxes that were meant for their mistresses. They communicate only by wiggling their fingers. No cops try to roust them. Behind us, Tiffany\u2019s burns. Then we hear the chanting. Dear god. The chanting. Dimon and I run towards it. You can read the full piece \u2013 eldritch offerings, taurine testicles and all \u2013 here. Four hours later and less than half an hour before closing time, the New York Stock Exchange announces that it\u2019s back to business as usual. Market outages are neither uncommon nor much of a problem for investors, according to the Wall Street Journal, which has published a story about closures not long after the newspaper\u2019s own site went down on Wednesday. No exchange has exclusive rights to trade any stock or exchange-traded fund, except during the opening and closing of trading. Apart from those brief periods, trading takes place at any of a dozen exchanges and more than 40 private trading venues, known as dark pools. Outages could hurt traders and investors if they have orders sitting on the order book of an exchange that has a problem. So if an institution has an offer at an exchange to buy 1,000 shares of Apple Inc at a certain price, and the market stops trading, it can cause uncertainty. The institution might not be able to find out whether its order traded, and it could have trouble canceling the order. The NYSE said in a note to traders that all open orders had been canceled except the long-term requests to buy or sell put in by institutions that are known as \u201cgood-till-cancel\u201d orders. \u201cOutages have hit the markets every few months in recent years,\u201d the Journal continues, adding that the real problem would have been the prevention of closing auctions when most trading takes place. Those final auctions also \u201cset the closing price for NYSE-listed stocks\u201d and set the markets in place for businesses and investors to take stock (sorry) of the day. Many firms use those final prices to mark the value of their portfolios and set risk parameters. Without those closing prices, they might be forced to use less-accurate prices, and that could affect other trading decisions. There is some precedent for resolving problems with the closing auctions. In November 2012, technical issues forced the NYSE to find an alternative when it couldn\u2019t hold closing auctions for 216 stocks, according to a note put out by Credit Suisse trading researchers Wednesday afternoon. In that case, the NYSE determined a closing price by monitoring transactions at other venues. As the machines once again match bids and quotes, the stock exchange tweets its official blessing upon the markets. There\u2019s no fanfare on the floor \u2013 just numbers gradually starting to change again on monitors and a little more activity among the traders. The New York Stock Exchange has returned to business after more than three and a half hours of an unexpected closure, which officials blamed on technical problems. The exchange closed at 11.32am ET and re-opened just under an hour before the close of markets at 4pm ET. The secretary of the Department of Homeland Security said that there\u2019s no indication the abrupt stoppage was linked to \u201cnefarious\u201d actors. NYSE president Thomas Farley said that the technical problem was \u201cidentified\u201d and \u201caddressed\u201d but did not describe what happened. Officials said there was no reason believe that the NYSE glitch is at all linked to coincidental technical problems at United Airlines and the Wall Street Journal. Although trading continued apparently on other open exchanges apparently unperturbed by the outage, the Dow is currently more than 200 points down. \u201cIt was a mess from the open,\u201d a broker has told Reuters, which runs down what happened this morning and the importance of closing time on Wall Street. Some of the internet ports to the NYSE would not connect, or would unexpectedly disconnect, and this was happening from before market opened until the halt, the broker said. The exchange does a lot of its business at the close of trading, and if it\u2019s still down then, the problems could increase. \u201cThat could be a major problem,\u201d said Peter Costa, president of boutique trading firm Empire Executions Inc. \u201cThe bigger issue is that there are unfilled orders that would likely not get filled at the closing price.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t need human beings,\u201d an options trader opines on the tech woes of Wall Street, in video shot by my colleague Jana Kasperkevic. Officials at the NYSE have just announced that they have a plan, CNBC reports. Officials have said they\u2019re going to try to open the American Stock Exchange at 3.05pm ET and the New York Stock Exchange at 3.10pm ET, leaving just under an hour of trading if the gates re-open without a hitch. Does the automation of the stock market mean many more days of glitches, breaks and malfunctions interrupting the rivers of cash moving around the world? At least one trader foresees problems in the rise of the machines \u2013 but says that doesn\u2019t mean the markets need people per se. My colleague Jana Kasperkevic (@kasperka) reports from outside the NYSE. Hours into the unexpected break in trading, an options trader who gave his name as Chris stepped outside to puff away on his e-cigarette, and eventually relented to questions about the hours-long break in trading. \u201cWe need better technology. I mean, this hasn\u2019t happened ever on the New York Stock exchange, for what they say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in options. I am not on the equity floor. I have never seen this happen on the New York Stock exchange ever, where all symbols halt at the same time. \u201cIt makes me worried that they are trying to make this a fully automated exchange, and what they are doing, they are slowing things down on purpose, saying \u2018we don\u2019t need people.\u2019 \u201cIf we had different technology and we didn\u2019t have people running certain things, we wouldn\u2019t have this problem. They are trying to make everything electronic. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d But does the exchange need people? \u201cThey don\u2019t need human beings.\u201d Fortune Magazine has also postulated that a problem in a software update is what brought the NYSE to its knees \u2013 or at least froze it in place, since stocks are trading in other venues. (via @nicflatow). Eric Scott Hunsader, an expert in Wall Street trading systems who heads market data firm Nanex, said that it appears that a faulty system upgrade brought trading on the exchange to a halt. The NYSE has reportedly also told floor traders the exchange had to suspend trading due to an error with a systems upgrade that was rolled out before the market opened on Wednesday. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Thielman has a couple follow-up questions. Farley projected the NYSE to resume trading within the hour, which would give the exchange roughly an hour of running normally before the daily \u201cclose\u201d of 4pm ET. Meanwhile the New York Times\u2019 Nathaniel Popper reports that the NYSE had to manually cancel some 700,000 existing orders so that it could restart the exchange, citing a trader on the floor. The NYSE will be up and running again before close today, president Thomas Farley has just told CNBC. \u201cWe identified the issue and we have that addressed,\u201d he says, estimating between a return to business around 2.45-3pm. He adds that it\u2019s \u201cpremature\u201d to say what the actual issue is. \u201cOur system is more than just software, the network connectivity, the various external internal sources, and the actual hardware. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good day and I don\u2019t feel good for our customers who continue to deal with the fallout.\u201d Farley adds: \u201cI wanted my team to take their time and get it right, be open for the close.\u201d He says that he does not believe there\u2019s any connection between the glitches that occurred today at different organizations, and that if there had been a \u201ccatastrophic issue\u201d then there is a disaster recovery plan in place. \u201cYou need to have absolute resiliency.\u201d Guardian editors weigh in. Tech support from national security editor Spencer Ackerman. The usual suspects, courtesy business editor Dominic Rushe. And a fear of time itself from live editor Paul Owen. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s unclear what kind of impact this particular glitch will have,\u201d adds Earnest, to whom Guardian DC bureau chief Dan Roberts was also listening. Earnest says it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to offer an assessment [on any economic impact]\u201d but said the Treasury department and Securities and Exchange Commission were closely monitoring the situation. The NYSE has not given any indication as to its timeline for resolving the problem, and trading continues on other exchanges. On Wall Street life goes on. President Barack Obama was briefed this morning on the suspension on Wall Street, White House press secretary Josh Earnest has just said during a press briefing. Earnest\u2019s message (paraphrased): don\u2019t panic. \u201cThe officials at the stock exchange are working feverishly, as you would expect.\u201d Earnest said that \u201cthere is no indication that malicious actors are involved in these technology issues\u201d and that NYSE officials \u201chad been in close touch with the Department of Homeland Security, with the [SEC] as well as the Treasury Department.\u201d Earnest goes on to say that more generally, the government is \u201ckeenly aware of the risk in cyberspace that exists right now\u201d and wants to \u201cimprove communication between the private sector and the federal government.\u201d China and Russia have been recently blamed for massive data breaches and cyber attacks against the US government, including on data of people with security clearances and on the White House email system. \u201cOur security posture is continually evolving,\u201d Earnest says. Two hours into the stoppage, the apparent electronic glitch is not inspiring Wall Street about the quality of the exchange, Guardian US business editor Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) reports: Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said he initially worried that China\u2019s woes had spread to the US when he heard the news and was relieved that it appeared to be a technical glitch. \u201cThat said it doesn\u2019t add a lot of confidence in the markets when investors don\u2019t have a lot to begin with,\u201d he said. China\u2019s stock markets have fallen more than 30% in the last three weeks after massive gains in the last year. At CNBC, journalists and investors are avidly discussing the foibles and flaws of one of the most important stock exchanges in the world. \u201cAt the NYSE this is a manual process,\u201d said Sal Arnuk, a principal at Themis Trading. \u201cIs the NYSE technologically the most (robust) exchange in the world? No. The fact of the matter is the different exchange operators have diverse standards, different architecture. Some of them are more legacy than others. This is to be expected from time to time.\u201d Meanwhile a trader has told the New York Times on condition of anonymity that after trading stopped, they were told \u201cthat the problem was related to updated software that was rolled out before markets opened\u201d. According to the trader, the exchange said that the new software caused problems soon after trading began on Wednesday and the exchange decided to shut down trading all together to fix the problem. The exchange has been closed for more than an hour and a half now, since 11.32am. The longer it goes the more traders emerge to smoke, notes my colleague Jana Kasperkevic \u2013 but the traders are pretty insouciant about the break, at least so far. At about 1 pm \u2013 an hour and a half after the trading halted at 11.32am, one of the traders walked over to the barricades. He had been standing a few feet away in the comfortable shade of the building he works at. After a reporter beckoned him, he strolled over and other reporters flocked to him. \u201cWhat? Do you want my autograph now?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can\u2019t comment,\u201d he said. When asked if the trading being halted for more than hour and a half, he smiled: \u201cWhat\u2019s scary is you asking me all these questions.\u201d Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson is delivering a speech on cybersecurity in Washington, and opened by saying the stoppage is not due to \u201cnefarious actions\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs is listening in. My colleague Jana Kasperkevic is on Wall Street, where the exchange looms up over the sidewalk. She reports: The New York State Exchange stand regal in the downtown Manhattan, one side of it draped in huge American flag. Even as tourists snap selfies and family portraits nearby, the building remains inaccessible as the traders who work on its floors are separated from the public by metal barricades. The exchange has claimed at least a ten-feet wide sidewalk, where traders can smoke in peace. And smoke they did on Wednesday. About an hour after the trading halted, one walked out. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d two photographers standing nearby asked. He shrugged, \u201cthe system crashed.\u201d A US official has told the Guardian that there is no indication anything that happened today was the result of any malicious actor, cyber attack, etc. The day is apparently full of coincidences of a technically glitchy nature, however. United Airlines grounded all US flights over computer issues earlier on Wednesday, telling my colleague Amanda Holpuch (@holpuch) the major delays were due to a \u201cnetwork connectivity issue\u201d. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s website also briefly shut down around midday. Meanwhile in Washington FBI director James Comey warned senators about the dangers of commercial encryption and urged them to allow \u201cbackdoor\u201d access into encryption software. Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson is scheduled to give a speech on cybersecurity later today. For the more conspiracy-minded readers out there, hacker collective Anonymous has the tweet for you, sent late last night. The NYSE has elaborated a bit on the closure, saying it was caused by \u201can internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach\u201d. A spokesperson for the NYSE released this statement: \u201c\u201cWe\u2019re currently experiencing a technical issue that we\u2019re working to resolve as quickly as possible. We will be providing further updates as soon as we can, and are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution, communicate thoroughly and transparently, and ensure a timely and orderly market re-open.\u201d Even should the NYSE resolve its technical issue promptly, the Intercontinental Exchange that owns it will inevitably face questions as to why it apparently gave no forewarning that it would shut down trading in the middle of an otherwise normal workday. The New York Stock Exchange unexpectedly stopped all trading at about 11.30am ET on Wednesday after a \u201cmajor technical issue\u201d. The NYSE\u2019s website only reads: \u201cAdditional information will follow as soon as possible.\u201d Other exchanges such as the Nasdaq remain open and functioning, and although law enforcement agencies have said they are investigating, the Department of Homeland Security said there was no sign of suspicious activity. The largest stock exchange in the US has suffered from technical problems before, though never of such duration or scale. The apparent technical issue coincides with sharp falls in the Chinese stock market and fears in Europe over the Greek debt crisis. We\u2019ll include updates on the NYSE, markets and other developments here, assisted by my colleague Jana Kasperkevic (@kasperka) on Wall Street, and Dan Roberts (@robertsdan) and Ben Jacobs (@bencjacobs) will report on any developments on Washington about the stoppage.",

The NYSE said in a note to traders that all open orders had been canceled except the long-term requests to buy or sell put in by institutions that are known as \u201cgood-till-cancel\u201d orders.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cOutages have hit the markets every few months in recent years,\u201d the Journal continues, adding that the real problem would have been the prevention of closing auctions when most trading takes place.</p> <p>Those final auctions also \u201cset the closing price for NYSE-listed stocks\u201d and set the markets in place for businesses and investors to take stock (sorry) of the day.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many firms use those final prices to mark the value of their portfolios and set risk parameters. Without those closing prices, they might be forced to use less-accurate prices, and that could affect other trading decisions.</p> <p>There is some precedent for resolving problems with the closing auctions. In November 2012, technical issues forced the NYSE to find an alternative when it couldn\u2019t hold closing auctions for 216 stocks, according to a note put out by Credit Suisse trading researchers Wednesday afternoon. In that case, the NYSE determined a closing price by monitoring transactions at other venues.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559d76c1e4b0c514f96c673d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-08T19:17:34.080Z\">8.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the machines once again match bids and quotes, the stock exchange tweets its official blessing upon the markets. </p> <p>There\u2019s no fanfare on the floor \u2013 just numbers gradually starting to change again on monitors and a little more activity among the traders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NYSE/statuses/618860510835048449\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"sv\" dir=\"ltr\">Trading on NYSE and NYSE MKT has resumed</p>&mdash; NYSE (@NYSE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYSE/status/618860510835048449\">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559d7058e4b0c514f96c6735\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-08T19:11:50.128Z\">8.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stock exchange resumes trading</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The New York Stock Exchange has returned to business after more than three and a half hours of an unexpected closure, which officials blamed on technical problems.</p> <p>The exchange closed at 11.32am ET and re-opened just under an hour before the close of markets at 4pm ET.</p> <p>The secretary of the Department of Homeland Security said that there\u2019s no indication the abrupt stoppage was linked to \u201cnefarious\u201d actors.

      "bodyText": "The New York stock exchange reopened on Wednesday afternoon after a more than three-and-a-half-hour shutdown caused by a still unexplained \u201cinternal technical issue\u201d. Trading restarted at 3.10pm local time after all NYSE-listed stocks, worth a combined $28tn, were suspended at 11.32am because of technical problem which the authorities said was not a cyber-attack or the result of criminal activity. The suspension is just one of seven NYSE closures since the founding of a predecessor exchange in 1817. The other closures were due to major world events, including the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865, the September 11 attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Tom Farley, president of NYSE, admitted that \u201cit\u2019s not a good day\u201d, but still failed to explain what caused the problem beyond ruling out a cyber-attack. The outage was caused by a \u201cconfiguration problem in our system that needed fixing\u201d, Farley told CNBC. \u201cWe found what was wrong and we fixed what was wrong and we have no evidence whatsoever to suspect that it was external,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight and overnight starts the investigation of what exactly we need to change. Do we need to change those protocols? Absolutely. Exactly what those changes are I\u2019m not prepared to say.\u201d President Barack Obama had been briefed on the situation by Department of Homeland Security, which ruled out a cyber terrorism attack, the prospect of which has long worried politicians, regulators and traders. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there was \u201cno indication that malicious actors were involved\u201d. The FBI said there were no signs of suspicious activity and no law enforcement action was needed, but the NYSE had as of Wednesday night still not explained the cause of the shutdown. \u201cWe\u2019re currently experiencing a technical issue that we\u2019re working to resolve as quickly as possible,\u201d a NYSE spokesman said. \u201cWe are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution, communicate thoroughly and transparently, and ensure a timely and orderly market re-open.\u201d The NYSE updated traders about the halt in a series of tweets. \u201cThe issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach,\u201d the Twitter feed said. \u201cWe chose to suspend trading on NYSE to avoid problems arising from our technical issue. NYSE-listed securities continue to trade unaffected on other market centers.\u201d Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the regulator was \u201cin contact with NYSE and are closely monitoring the situation and trading in NYSE-listed stocks\u201d. Traders at the exchange said they had been told the problem was caused by an overnight software update. \u201cThey told us they did some software updates overnight and tested it without problems, but this morning something happened,\u201d Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions, told the Wall Street Journal. Costa, a floor trader, said NYSE executives had promised that trading would \u201csoon\u201d be restored. The exchange did not respond to requests for comment on the source of the technical problem. Rich Barry, the floor governor of the NYSE, said: \u201cWe have our best and smartest on the issue and hope that it is resolved ASAP.\u201d As trading reopened at 3.10pm, later than a previously planned restart at 2.45pm, the NYSE tweeted: \u201cTrading on NYSE and NYSE MKT has resumed.\u201d All the major indices dipped when trading resumed, but had already been lower before the suspension in trading. The stock market shutdown came just hours after United Airlines was forced to ground all of its US flights following a separate technical glitch it described as a \u201cautomation issues\u201d. The airline, which has 4,935 daily departures, halted all flights for more than an hour on Wednesday morning. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s website also went down due to a technical issue at the same time as the NYSE suspended trading. The NYSE glitch came as China\u2019s stock markets continued to free-fall and with the Greek debt crisis still rattling European investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 213 points when trading was halted, a fall of 1.2%. China\u2019s stock markets, which lost 6% on Wednesday, have fallen more than 30% in the past three weeks after soaring 150% in the past year. China\u2019s regulators have blamed \u201cirrational selling\u201d and \u201cpanic sentiment\u201d. The FTSE 100, which closed as normal just before the NYSE glitch occurred, closed up 0.9% to 6,491. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said he initially worried that China\u2019s woes had spread to the US when he heard the news and was relieved that it appeared to be a technical glitch. \u201cThat said, it doesn\u2019t add a lot of confidence in the markets when investors don\u2019t have a lot to begin with,\u201d he said. At about 1pm \u2013 an hour and a half after the trading halted \u2013 one NYSE\u2019s trader walked over to the barricades outside the exchange\u2019s Wall Street headquarters. As he strolled over reporters flocked to him. \u201cWhat? Do you want my autograph now?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can\u2019t comment. What\u2019s scary is you asking me all these questions.\u201d Rumours that the NYSE shutdown may have been caused by a possible cyber-attack were heightened by a tweet from hacking group Anonymous. \u201cWonder if tomorrow is going to be bad for Wall Street \u2026 We can only hope,\u201d said a tweet posted from one of its main Twitter accounts early on Wednesday morning.",

      "bodyText": "Mac the knife strikes again. John McFarlane, the Barclays chairman since April, has form as a slayer of chief executives. While non-executive director at Aviva in 2012, he helped oust the hapless Andrew Moss and filled the chief executive post himself until he found a successor and could revert to being chairman. The demise of Antony Jenkins at Barclays was presented as a decision of all the non-executives, with the deputy chairman, Sir Michael Rake, to the fore, but the final call is always the chairman\u2019s. As at Aviva, McFarlane will become stand-in chief executive, promising an all-action performance more to the liking of shareholders. Naturally, investors cheered. They love a no-nonsense boss who promises to slash bureaucracy, improve returns, cut costs and tickle the dividend. \u201cI have experienced good results in dealing with these matters elsewhere\u201d, said McFarlane, less than humbly. Barclays shares rose 3%. Kind words flowed for Jenkins but the gist of the message was clear: not enough energy and too many committees \u2013 375, said McFarlane \u2013 meant better returns for shareholders were in danger of disappearing over the horizon. The new motto is \u201cacceleration\u201d. Up to a point, one can understand the frustration. Jenkins\u2019 brand of woolly management speak often jarred. Few of us ever understood what the ambition to build \u201cthe go-to bank\u201d really meant. On this view, Jenkins, a retail banker, was a useful antidote to Bob Diamond and his crew of muscular investment bankers but lacked the dynamism to give the new-look Barclays a bigger kick. The group\u2019s adjusted pretax profits increased 12% to \u00a35.5bn last year, but statutory profits were down 20%. The investment banking division continued a miserable run with return on of equity of just 2.7%. \u201cI am not a very patient person\u201d, Jenkins declared in March, probably aware that the behind-the-scenes muttering said he was exactly that. But before Jenkins is consigned to history as too ineffectual, consider whether McFarlane\u2019s promised hard-driving approach is any clearer. The motoring metaphor sounds exciting, but what, for example, does it mean for the investment bank? Does it have a future or not? Hard-driving, in McFarlane\u2019s mouth, does not mean what it did in the old days under Diamond. McFarlane will be as aware as Jenkins that the old days brought scandal, monstrous fines and disgrace. So is he a sceptic of the overpaid investment bankers\u2019 ability to earn their keep? Or does he want to take another lap of the track, just in case? Jenkins toyed with the question inconclusively. Thus Barclays\u2019 statement that ditching Jenkins \u201cdoes not signal any major change in strategy\u201d fails to solve the great investment banking conundrum. Outsiders never knew what the strategy was, or how small the division was meant to be, in the first place. Or is hard-driving code for another dose of old-fashioned cost cutting in the retail and commercial banks? There probably will be more of that, just as there was at Aviva. But it is not a risk-free strategy if you also want to grow revenues. A \u201cleaner and more agile\u201d bank may strike punters as one that is understaffed. Put another way, all banks must serve three masters \u2013 regulators, customers and shareholders. There is no route around regulators these days, so the balance between shareholder and customer demands is critical. McFarlane wants happier shareholders, but the trickier task is to satisfy customers simultaneously. However much McFarlane plays up the parallels with Aviva, the Barclays bus looks harder to handle. China stock market collapse - time to panic? This is what you are not allowed to say in China: the stock market is an equity disaster and the authorities have failed to rescue the market. The phrases \u201cequity disaster\u201d and \u201crescue the market\u201d, you see, have been banned from market reports. For official consumption, the Chinese Communist party is merely adopting sensible measures to address a temporary outbreak of irrationality among investors; calm will return any day now. Yeah, right. Big shareholders have been banned from selling for six months, and trading in almost half the stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges has been suspended, an attempt to air-brush the fact that the real prices would be substantially lower. It\u2019s hard to guess what the authorities will try next. They have cut interest rates, they have shovelled state pension funds into the market, they have encouraged investors to borrow to speculate, and they have banned flotations. It\u2019s not working because even the most gullible Chinese investor can smell panic. The impossible-to-answer question is why the authorities are so alarmed. It was always odds-on that a market that had risen 150% in a year would crack. The alarming assumption must be that Beijing thinks a crash would damage the real economy, by wiping out a chunk of wealthier citizens\u2019 savings or by spreading losses through the banking system. Whatever it is, Beijing needs the market to obey official orders soon. Share prices have been falling for a month and the support operation is becoming ridiculous. Another fortnight like the last and Beijing\u2019s only credible policy will be to let the market crash and to face the demons it fears.",

    "webTitle": "Greek crisis: new bailout request filed \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "PS: The Greek banks aren\u2019t opening until Sunday\u2019s summit has taken place.... The Greek crisis seems to have calmed down tonight, so let\u2019s do a summary. We\u2019ll lurch back into life if there are major developments. Greece is racing to finalise a detailed list of reforms to present to its creditors, in a final attempt to avoid exiting the eurozone. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos submitted a request for a third bailout his morning, offering immediate action on taxes and pensions if creditors looked kindly on this urgent request. It is being analysed tonight: France has shown solid support for Greece today, as we rattle towards Sunday\u2019s emergency summit. President Francois Hollande told reporter tonight that: \u201cTime is short, but France will ensure that Greece is encouraged to produce as precise a plan as possible to inspire trust, that trust that is indispensable if the Eurogroup (of euro zone finance ministers) is going to be able to give its position.\u201d. Earlier, prime minister Manuel Valls told French MPs that it was too dangerous for Greece to leave the eurozone. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has experienced a rough ride at the European parliament today, being criticised by several MEPs (highlights start here). Liberal leader Guy Verhofstadt has set social media alight with a seven-minute attack, in which he blasted the Greek leader for failing to tackle clientism and vested interests in Greece. Tsipras hit back, though, saying Greece had become an \u2018austerity laboratory\u2019, adding: We were in a fiscal stranglehold, we were thinking more about how to keep the economy alive. Adding: We have ideological differences, we are divided on issues, but this is a crucial time to be able to pool our forces. And promising: Tomorrow once again we are going to come up with some very specific proposals. There really is no time to lose now; the ECB has warned that it will pull support from the banking sector without a deal by Monday. And economists now believe that Greece is more likely to leave the eurozone than stay (according to a Reuters poll today). I\u2019ll be back later if there are major developments. Otherwise, see you in the morning.... GW Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with president Prokopis Pavlopoulos looks rather pleasant, given he was explaining how Greece could be facing the eurozone exit door on Sunday: Alexis Papahelas, the prominent political commentator has just told SKAI News: \u201cIt is clear Greece is tragically isolated. The prime minister spent a nightmarish last night in Brussels,\u201d he said adding that the atmosphere had much improved with Euclid Tsakalotos in the finance minister\u2019s seat. He added: \u201cThe French are doing very important things for Greece.\u201d Tsakalotos will return late tonight to Athens to have one last round of meetings with the Greek prime minister over the proposed reform plan the country will table with creditors tomorrow evening. We\u2019re hearing that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with the Greek president has ended. He\u2019s now headed off for talks with the Stavros Theodorakis, the leader of the centrist To Potami party: Greece is under intense pressure to table a last-chance blueprint for radical economic reform, tax increases and spending cuts on Thursday in order to secure a future in the euro and stave off financial collapse, writes our Europe editor Ian Traynor. The reform proposals are to be sent to Greece\u2019s creditors with negotiations at the critical stage. The embattled Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accused his eurozone creditors on Wednesday of exploiting his country as an \u201causterity laboratory\u201d for the past five years while formally asking Europe for three more years of rescue funds. The countdown to Greece\u2019s financial collapse shifted into its gravest phase after European leaders set Sunday as the deadline by which Tsipras has to capitulate to their menu of cuts, tax rises and fundamental reforms of the Greek economy in return for bailout money. Otherwise, EU leaders said, Greece will be cut off from the eurozone, triggering banking chaos, insolvency, and probable exit from the single currency. With the five-year crisis entering a climactic five days, much will hinge on the details of the reforms that Athens is to send to the troika of bailout supervisors on Thursday. The European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European commission are to receive the details by midnight on Thursday, giving them 48 hours to examine them, negotiate, and reach a verdict before another European summit on Sunday either blesses the proposed deal or focuses on plans for coping with a new Greek currency and how to mitigate the expected post-euro humanitarian crisis in Greece. Tsipras sounded characteristically defiant in his first big speech \u2013 to the European parliament in Strasbourg \u2013 outside Greece in almost six months in office. He declared that justice was above the law, repeated that his victory in securing a rejection of EU austerity in a snap referendum on Sunday did not mean Greeks wanted to quit the euro. The days of treating Greece as an \u201causterity laboratory\u201d were over, he vowed. \u201cThe experiment was not a success\u201d.... Here\u2019s the full story: If you\u2019re just tuning in you can see Verhofstaft\u2019s speech here. Over in Athens the Greek government has announced that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will visit the country\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavlopoulos, \u201cimmediately,\u201d reports Helena Smith. A government statement says: \u201cthe prime minister will visit the president of the republic immediately in order to inform him of the latest developments.\u201d #developing Over in Athens there is mounting concern that freedom of speech has begun to pay a heavy price as the crisis deepens. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports Is the Greek media being one-sided or are bodies attached to prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led administration deliberately trying to silence the press? In a country feeling the social spasms that come with economic free-fall, that is the question now being asked as prominent TV anchors faced investigation for allegedly favouring the \u2018yes\u2019 campaign in Sunday\u2019s referendum. Private channels (many owned by the oligarchal elite and other business interests) have been accused by the state-run media watchdog and the Union of Journalists and Athens daily newspapers (ESIEA) of purposefully cultivating a climate of fear and breaching electoral law in the run up to Sunday\u2019s vote. Nine anchors, household names in a nation now addicted to TV news broadcasts, have been told to appear before the disciplinary committee of ESIEA to answer allegations that the government-backed \u2018no\u2019 campaign was deliberately frozen out of programming. ESIEA\u2019s governing board is now dominated by Syriza sympathisers; so too is the judiciary which has also launched an inquiry into the claims. \u201cIn 2009 we missed the big story,\u201d said Paschos Mandravelis, who has been widely vilified for his commentary in the conservative daily, Kathimerini. \u201cWe failed to see that the crisis was coming. Now journalists are asking the right questions, sometimes there is exaggeration but they are basically saying \u2018look something is wrong, very wrong\u2019 and for that they are being punished, deliberately hounded and silenced.\u201d The claims have lead to howls of protests that along with the economy democracy is now also at stake. Highlighting those concerns Kathimerini felt fit to write in its editorial today. \u201cThe regime mentality that has evolved in certain centers of power is cause for grave concern and it is just a matter of time before it becomes a real threat to democracy and everything it holds truth.\u201d For its part, Syriza \u2013 many of whose members hail from the pro-Soviet KKE communist party \u2013 says it is being deliberated by the apparatus of a rotten political elite determined to oust the leftists from power. Latvia\u2019s central bank governor, Ilmars Rimsevics, doesn\u2019t share Manuel Valls optimism that a Greek deal is within reach. He told Latvian TV that: It\u2019s one thing to put an plan on the table but implementation is something else. Why should people believe that the new proposal will be for real?\u201d Rimsevics is clearly unimpressed with Athens, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what Tsipras could offer to the Eurogroup today or tomorrow.\u201d (quote via Reuters) The French PM is now love-bombing the Greek people by tweeting in their language: Which I reckon means: To the Greek people , I say: Greece is Europe! Greece\u2019s request for a third bailout has now been passed onto the European Commission and the European Central Bank. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has asked them to assess Greece\u2019s financing needs, the risk it poses to the eurozone, and the sustainability of its public debt: Hello.... the eurozone finance minister\u2019s conference call that was cancelled this morning might be back on again: Presumably to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout request: Bloomberg is reporting that the European Central Bank has left Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity support unchanged. That means ELA stays capped at \u20ac89bn, and Greek banks remain closed. Guy Verhofstadt\u2019s speech on Greece this morning has now been uploaded to YouTube, and it\u2019s worth watching. As we covered this morning, the leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament tore into Alexis Tsipras, criticising him for talking about reforms but never delivering. Verhofstadt\u2019s conclusion should be ringing in Tsipras\u2019s ears on his way home to Athens: \u201cHow do you want to be remembered? As an electoral accident who made its people poorer? Or as a real revolutionary reformer? Show that you are a real leader and not a false prophet.\u201d The French government\u2019s optimism over Greece is not shared by its counterparts in Berlin, by all accounts. So, Manuel Valls\u2019 claim that a deal is \u201cwithin grasp\u201d may actually highlight the fracture between the eurozone\u2019s largest members. Analyst Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says: There is a strong possibility that the deal is agreed and then voted down in national parliaments. [Valls\u2019 comments] imply Germany and France are on a totally different page of the book..... [therefore] Germany leaves? Valls has confirmed that French MPs would vote on a third Greek bailout (if we get that far). This weekend will be absolutely crucial for Greece, the French prime minister adds: France continues to be Greece\u2019s staunchest ally in the battle to avoid Grexit. Prime minister Manuel Valls has told MPs that it\u2019s vital to protect Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone. Valls said: \u201cKeeping Greece in the euro and therefore in the heart of Europe and the EU is something of the utmost geostrategic and geopolitical importance, \u201cAllowing Greece to exit the euro zone would be an admission of impotence - France refuses that.\u201d Valls then tantalised MPs with the prospect of consummation between the two sides; a deal between Athens and creditors was \u201cwithin grasp\u201d, he claimed. The head of Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog has warned that the UK economy will suffer if the Greek crisis escalates. Robert Chote, head of the OBR, made the comments as he responded to today\u2019s UK budget: And for rolling coverage of the budget, go here: The penny, euro, or possibly drachma has dropped in the City. Economists now believe there is more chance of Greece leave the eurozone than staying. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew appears to have thrown his weight behind calls for a Greek debt restructuring. Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, Lew warned that Greece\u2019s debts are not sustainable, echoing the IMF\u2019s concerns. He pointed to a \u201cdeep\u201d reluctance among some European countries to face up to the issue, though. Lew also (again) urged both sides to reach a deal, warning that Greece would face a painful adjustment if it left the euro. We simply don\u2019t need the \u201cgeopolitical mistake\u201d of a Greek meltdown, he added (perhaps looking nervously towards Moscow?) Finland\u2019s finance minister tweets: And it will probably all come down to the last five minutes... European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has just been interviewed on Bloomberg about Greece. Time is running short, time is very short, says Moscovici. But all isn\u2019t lost... Mr Tsipras knows what he has to do. He must present credible reforms, so we can ensure Greece remains in the eurozone. Moscovici also points to the poverty in Greece: Everyone must be aware that this country has lost 25% of its GDP, that 25% are unemployed, that half the youth are unemployed. So who\u2019s fault is that? The responsibitity must be shared, Moscovici says. But one factor is that Greece economy wasn\u2019t strong enough, or determined enough to reform. It should have reformed 15 years ago - it is imperative that reforms are undertaken now. Greece hasn\u2019t put a figure on the new bailout it is looking for, but it would easily be north of \u20ac50bn. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel explains: The International Monetary Fund has estimated a three-year programme could cost as much as \u20ac70bn. And Peter also flags up Greece\u2019s (polite) request to consider measures to make its debt sustainable and viable: Although the IMF has urged some kind of debt relief, eurozone creditors have fiercely resisted any kind of write-down \u2014 though they have been more open to extending the repayment schedules for their current bailout loans. The Greek request is certainly not a table thumping demand, rhetorically. But the intention is certainly clear. More here. While the European Parliament debate was raging, Greece quietly submitted its formal request for a new aid package in an attempt to avoid crashing out of the eurozone. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has asked for a three-year programme, from the bailout fund (the European Stability Mechanism). And in return, Greece would commit to: \u201cto a comprehensive set of reforms and measures to be implemented in the areas of fiscal sustainability, financial stability, and long-term economic growth.\u201d Importantly, Tsakalotos\u2019s said that Greece is proposing to \u201cimmediately\u201d implement measures, starting next week. That would include \u201cTax reform related measures\u201d and \u201cPension related measures\u201d -- two of the \u201cred lines\u201d that proved so hard to tackle in recent months. Tsakalotos also promises to flesh out these proposals on Thursday, with \u201ca comprehensive and specific reform agenda\u201d which can be assessed by the IMF, ECB and European Commission. And there\u2019s no ducking the debt relief question: Tsakalotos says: Greece welcomes an opportunity to explore potential measures to be taken so that its official sector related debt becomes both sustainable and viable over the long term. Here\u2019s the full letter: Reaction to follow.... There were high jinks in the European Parliament this morning -- UKIP\u2019s Nigel Farage aligned himself with the Greek \u201cNo\u201d campaign by carrying one of their famous OXI signs, until the EC president confiscated it. Freedom of speech, Mr Juncker? Extending the Greek bank holiday until Friday night is not a pledge that they\u2019ll reopen on Monday, of course: It always seemed unlikely that Greece\u2019s banks would reopen before Sunday\u2019s emergency summit. And Reuters is now reporting that the current \u2018bank holiday\u2019, due to expire on Wednesday night, will be extended further. That means banks stay closed, and cash machines will still only dole out \u20ac60 per day. The work never stops if you are Europe\u2019s most powerful leader. After Tuesday\u2019s fractious summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel was back in Berlin for a meeting with her cabinet this morning. She is pictured here with Sigmar Gabriel, her vice chancellor, who warned Greeks they had \u201ctorn down the last bridges\u201d by voting against the EU bailout plan. Next on the the German chancellor\u2019s agenda is a two-day trip to the Balkans, where she will visit Albania, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina - all countries that aspire to join the EU. But the Greek debt crisis is never far away, as the economic chaos ripples across the region. Reuters in Tirana has a good account of how the Greek crisis is hurting its neighbours. Greece\u2019s debt crisis is inflicting hardship on Greeks but the shockwave is fanning out too into its ex-Communist neighbours which are economically dependent on Greece and, because they are poorer, even less well equipped to deal with the consequences. The potential impact on countries such as Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria is likely to be on the agenda of German Chancellor Angela Merkel - a central player in the Greek debt drama - when she visits the region starting on Wednesday. With Greece losing its appeal as a source of earnings for Albanian migrant workers, more are heading to Germany instead. Some 16,000 Albanians have sought asylum in Germany from January to May, with 4,900 arrivals in May alone. \u201cThe Greeks have no money, they are themselves in a crisis,\u201d [one Albanian worker told Reuters]. \u201cThey told us to come and work again in two weeks and get the money.\u201d Among an estimated 600,000 Albanians who work temporarily in Greece, he and his friends had been making the trip for the past eight years. Things had been lean since the 2008 financial crisis but, he said, never so bad as now. \u201cThey never kept money from us for agriculture jobs, but could do nothing about the banks this time,\u201d he said. The European Commission is fielding questions from journalists in Brussels at its daily briefing. A spokeswoman says there will be no briefings on Grexit, because the Commission is not planning on this scenario. Donald Tusk is playing the peacemaker in his final remarks to the European Parliament. He says the source of the crisis in Greece is over-spending not the common currency. He has a message for the Greek government Seek help among your friends and not among your enemies, especially when they are unable to help you. That\u2019s you, Vladimir Putin. Tusk also has a message for Greece\u2019s creditors If you want to help your friend in need do not humiliate him. We need unity not because unity is a beautiful ida but because unity is indispensable to take decisions. This is really and truly the final wake-up call. Tusk notes that Greece has filed its bailout proposal this morning and says he hopes that is a good omen. More applause. Jean-Claude Juncker is now making his closing remarks. Once again, he is defending the European Commission that he leads. He says he has stood up against cuts in pensions for the Greek people and fought to help Greece get a \u20ac35bn aid package. This depends on how you define cuts and whether you believe the Commission\u2019s sums. Update 12.43 As we have reported elsewhere the \u20ac35bn doesn\u2019t really exist; the number is recycled money from the EU budget and notional private-sector funding that hasn\u2019t yet been pledged. The Commission has also gone along with creditors\u2019 wishes to cut the \u201csolidarity grant\u201d available for Greece\u2019s poorer pensioners. Any Greek pensioner in line to lose this benefit would probably dispute Mr Juncker\u2019s defence of Greek pensions. Back at the European Parliament, Alexis Tsipras is defending himself against earlier attacks from MEPs. He admits that over the last five month his government has spent more time negotiating than governing. We were in a fiscal stranglehold, we were thinking more about how to keep the economy alive. He says his government brought to justice many Greeks who had committed tax evasion, rebutting the critique it has done nothing to reform the Greek economy. I want your support to help change Greece... We all understand that this debate is not exclusively about one country. It is about the future of our common construction, the EU and Europe We have ideolgical differences, we are divided on issues, but this is a crucial time to be able to pool our forces. Tomorrow once again we are going to come up with some very specific proposals. And as we are talking about Greece, the inevitable references to ancient tragedy... Sophocles taught us that the greatest law of all human laws is justice... and I think that is something we have to remember. And that is it Loud applause from MEPs. Foreign journalists have been arriving en mass in Athens over the past few weeks. The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison touched down earlier today in the Greek capital, where she found little sign of the political turmoil shaking the country. In the arrivals hall at Athens airport there seemed little sign of a slowdown in summer tourist traffic, with long lines for passport control, a crowd jamming the arrival hall and lines at ATMs just two or three people long -- no more than you would expect at a busy airport. A taxi driver (the mainstay of lazy foreign reporting I know, but they are on the front lines of the tourism industry) said a few repeat customers had decided to put holidays on hold but overall arrivals only seemed to be down by a fraction on this time last year Meanwhile, the Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has been to the market. Journalists and pundits watching Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech to the European Parliament do not sound convinced he helped his cause. The European Parliament gets a nod of approval, although not everyone shares this view. News just in: today\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers has been cancelled. A spokesman for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chairs the eurogroup, announced the conference call would not take place as planned. But in an important step, Greece has filed a proposal for financial aid under the eurozone\u2019s bailout programme, the European Stability Mechanism. Officials in the Eurogroup working group (EWG) are meeting to discuss the latest ideas from Athens. Here are some pictures of Mr Tsipras\u2019s trip to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. As we reported earlier, the Greek prime minister was blasted by leaders of the centre-right and liberal groups. He had a much friendlier reception from the Socialists, the second-largest group in the Parliament. Gianni Pittella, president of the group, said Europe and the eurozone without Greece was unthinkable. That seemed to provide some comfort to Mr Tsipras. But he was soon back in the firing line again. The leader of the Greens, Rebecca Harms, warned Tsipras of cosying up to Vladimir Putin. The Greek prime minister took the initiative of calling the Russian president on Monday, after that resounding rejection of the Greek bailout plan. So has Greece submitted its new bailout proposal to finance ministers or not? Earlier reports suggested it didn\u2019t arrive overnight, but it\u2019s not clear if it has yet landed in ministerial inboxes. Angela Merkel gave Greece until Thursday to lay its plans on the table, but finance ministers are supposed to discuss \u201cconcrete proposals\u201d later today by tele-conference. Watch this space. Update: It\u2019s arrived: Over in Athens the political opposition is demanding that party leaders reconvene for an emergency meeting to discuss the ultimatum the Greek government now faces. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports Anxiety in Athens this morning is almost palpable. Among a political elite who would have played the game very differently, there is mounting concern that one wrong move and Greece will not only be headed for euro exit but years of purgatory on the periphery of Europe. Highlighting that angst, New Democracy\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said this morning it was now urgent that political leaders coalesce immediately. \u201cThe president of the republic (POR) must assemble the council of political leaders now,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me that he doesn\u2019t have official authority. He has a moral obligation.\u201d Earlier Mitsotakis had tweeted that the \u201ctime had come to learn the truth.\u201d The Greek parliament needed to be informed with an urgent debate in the 300-seat House \u2013 and not just the European parliament. The centre-right New Democracy, which oversaw Greece\u2019s entry into the then European Community in 1981, announced this morning: \u201cA national red line is participation in the euro and in Europe. The government has the responsibility in negotiations and Mr Tsipras ought to bring, as he has promised, an agreement that will keep the country in the euro zone.\u201d Truth is, back in Athens very few have any idea what the proposed agreement now involves. After five months of bungled handling of negotiations under Tsipras, all they know is that any deal is going to be much, much tougher than originally thought given the Greek economy\u2019s freefall following the closure of Greek banks. Nigel Farage is on his feet now. The European project has started to die. The plan has failed. The whole of the Mediterranean finds itself in the wrong currency. There is a new Berlin Wall and it is called the euro. The former City trader and UKIP leader proves to be an unlikely friend of the radical Marxist Greek prime minister. He calls Weber\u2019s \u201cattack\u201d on Tsipras disgusting and praises the Greek government for calling a referendum against the \u201cbullies\u201d in Brussels. If you have got the courage you should lead the Greek people out of the eurozone with your head held high. Yes it will be tough for the first few months, but with a devalued currency and friends all over the world you will recover. Verhofstadt in full flow. Verhofstadt\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t seem to be easy for the Greek prime minister to listen to. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament, warns that Europe \u201cis sleepwalking towards a Grexit\u201d. He is laying into Tsipras for not coming up with detailed reforms. I am even ready to come to Athens to discuss it with because I like such a challenge. He outlines his plan for reform: End the clientelist system in Greek politics i.e. party cronyism and rewarding loyalists with jobs. Downsize the public sector End privileges - privileges of the military, the orthodox Church, the Greek islands and the political parties. There is never such a prime minister in Greece who has such a strong mandate as you. You need to come forward with your reform pacakge, it is not a chicken or egg situation. The choice is very simple, Verhoftstadt says, whether you want to be remembered as an accidental prime minister or a real revolutionary who modernised his country. The European Parliament debate on the Greek bailout crisis continues here. I will round up reactions a little later. More from Manfred Weber Sounds like a blistering speech, well worth listening to. Oh German conservative MEP Manfred Weber goes straight on the attack in his response to Tsipras. He refers to Greek government ministers who have talked of sending migrants to other European countries and accused their European creditors of terrorism. If the prime minister of Greece comes to us he should apologise for those utterly unacceptable statements... he has passed over them in silence. Weber makes it clear Tsipras and his government is responsible for this European crisis. You are destroying confidence in Europe I\u2019m battling with the live-feed, but picked up Tsipras\u2019s final soundbite. This is not exclusively a Greek problem, this is a European problem and European problems require European solutions. Others caught more of the substance. Tsipras says Greece needs an agreement with its neighbours that \u201cshows there is light at the end of the tunnel\u201d and brings credible and necessary reforms. Over the last five years, he says, reforms have been put in place that have been burdensome on the Greek people. We must have a basis in which we an succeed on the basis of sustainable development. So far, the Tsipras speech sounds as if it is aimed at a domestic audience. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is now up. A few days after this verdict we have now been given a mandate to re-double our efforts in order to get a socially-just and economically sustainable solution. He praises the Greek people for a \u201ccourageous response\u201d as banks closed and media pressure to vote yes grew. Now Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission takes his turn to address MEPs. The live feed is fading in and out, so I will turn to the quick smart tweeters in Strasbourg/with bigger bandwidth to fill the gaps. Tusk is calling on EU leaders to search for a consensus, in remarks almost word-for-word the speech he gave last night. He strikes a conciliatory tone: All sides of the negotiations share the responsibility for the status quo. Our inability to find agreements may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece and the insolvency of its banking system. I have no doubt that this will affect Europe, also in a geopolitical sense. As Plutarch once said: \u201cto find fault is easy, to do better may be difficult\u201d... let us prove him wrong. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, is speaking first. He starts with the usual pleasantries to Luxembourg, the country that has just taken up the six-month presidency of the EU. Now the substance: We meet at a unique and difficult time for Europe and our monetary and economic union. He begins by giving a report to MEPs on the latest meeting of the European Council in late June, when EU leaders had a rancorous argument about migration quotas and dealing with the humanitarian crisis on their borders. It was the first time European leaders had an honest exchange on the refugee question. A reminder that Greece is not the only crisis the EU is grappling with... Here is a scene from the Parliament. Alexis Tsipras has just taken his seat to cheering and (I think) some booing, but a little hard to tell from the live feed. European Council leader Donald Tusk has just entered the European Parliament\u2019s plenary session in Strasbourg, so it looks as if we will soon begin. The denial follows a report in Kathimerini that the government was preparing to introduce a parallel currency to the euro. Unnamed sources told the paper the finance ministry was considering an IOU currency in case Greece failed to secure a deal. And... The Tsipras/Juncker/Tusk speeches at the European Parliament will get underway at 9.45am (8.45 British summer time), so we will have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, Ryan Heath of Politico has come up with some questions he thinks Alexis Tsipras must answer. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras will be speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in the next few minutes. We are also expecting to hear from Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission and Donald Tusk, who chairs the European Council of EU leaders. You can watch the speeches here. The European Central Bank has warned that failure to reach an agreement on Sunday, will leave it with no choice put to pull the plug on its support for Greek banks. Christian Noyer, a member of the ECB\u2019s decision-making governing council, said Sunday was the last chance to reach a deal and avoid \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the Greek economy. Speaking on French radio this morning he said: The Greek economy is on the brink of a catastrophe. There must be an agreement next Sunday [12 July] at the very latest. After that it will be too late and the consequences will be grave. I fear that if there is no agreement on Sunday the Greek economy will collapse and there will be chaos. The importance of this statement cannot be under-estimated. The ECB has poured \u20ac89bn into the Greek financial system in recent months to stave off collapse, but is barred from lending to insolvent institutions. Noyer, governor of France\u2019s central bank, said Greece\u2019s ECB lifeline could not be stretched indefinitely. We have rules and we have interpreted the rules to their limit to maintain a lifeline to Greek banks, but we cannot continue indefinitely to increase the risks we are taking. Quotes from Reuters/Boursorama The Guardian\u2019s G2 cover story looks at the one practical way everyone can help Greece: go there. Here is a flavour of Alex Andreou\u2019s article: The weather is just as stunning as it ever was this time of year; the archaeological sites just as interesting; the beaches just as magical; the food just as heart-healthy. The prices are significantly cheaper than usual. It is one of those rare everybody-wins situations. The people are even more welcoming, more hospitable and more grateful than ever. The reaction to difficulty has been a broader smile, a wider embrace. We understand that you have a choice and we understand why you have chosen Greece right now. Tourism is liquidity. Tourism is solidarity. Want to help Greece? Go there on holiday Opposition leaders in Greece are anxiously watching the twists and turns of talks in Brussels, Berlin and Paris. As Kathimerini reports the political council of the centre-right New Democracy party met for the first time since Vangelis Meimarakis replaced Antonis Samaras as leader. Samaras was a prominent voice on the yes side in the referendum and fell on his sword as soon as the results became clear. The conservatives urged Tsipras to sign an agreement, reopen Greek banks and ensure depositors\u2019 money is safeguarded. The government does not have a mandate for rupture [with lenders] but one for bringing back a viable agreement. Analysts at Deutsche Bank are sounding a smidgeon more hopeful that an agreement between Greece and its creditors can be reached. But they think Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras will have to sign up to even stricter conditions to get bailout cash, because the Greek economy has worsened in recent days, increasing the country\u2019s financing needs. Here is an extract from their interesting post-summit analysis: (my highlights) The Europeans last night set the framework around which Greece\u2019s Eurozone exit can be averted: Greece effectively has to negotiate the outline of a new 3rd ESM [European Stability Mechanism i.e bailout] program by the end of the week. Whether the Greek side is prepared to accept this remains an open question. Last week\u2019s referendum has politically empowered the Prime Minister, who has the political capital to vote an agreement through parliament. At the same time, it is likely that the level of policy conditionality required from the Greek government is even tougher than before the referendum. As things stand, we attach a marginally higher probability to a post-midnight agreement being reached: the support for Eurozone membership in Greece is clear and the political and economic costs of capital controls are rising. But it is a close call. The future of Greece\u2019s position in the Eurozone is likely to be decided by the end of the week. To break away from Greek news for a moment: we\u2019ve just heard the boss of Barclays bank has been sacked. Can anyone think of a replacement? A deal is possible, says Pierre Moscovici, France\u2019s European commissioner and perennial optimist on the Greek debt talks. Yes, an agreement is possible, essential. We must avoid avoid Grexit. The ball is in Greece\u2019s court . He revealed the Greek proposals had not arrived overnight, ahead of a finance ministers\u2019 conference call this morning I\u2019m sure they are on the way. There is urgency about Greece. We are awaiting proposals and concrete reforms. And to hammer home the message Greece\u2019s place is in the eurozone. The door of the European Commission remains open. Economists, such as ABN AMRO\u2019s Nick Kounis, are not sounding so hopeful. Nobody knows whether EU leaders can find a way out of this mess. Under the best case scenario, Greece could have a new bailout ready by mid August. Under the worse case scenario, Greece goes bankrupt and faces a humanitarian emergency. It\u2019s worth noting that the German chancellor Angela Merkel brushed aside the idea that anyone should think she was an optimist. In their report on last night\u2019s summit Ian Traynor and Larry Elliott map out what to expect in the next few days. Tuesday night\u2019s decisions in Brussels portend several days of frantic, round-the-clock negotiations. Athens is expected to ask for a new bailout programme worth up to \u20ac60bn over two to four years as well as measures to reduce its ballooning debt. The chances of securing a deal hinge on the levels of cuts, austerity, and fundamental reforms of economic and fiscal systems that the Greek government is prepared to endure after Tsipras stonewalled for five months and then called his snap referendum. Merkel ruled out any flat writedowns of Greek debt, but there is likely to be scope for debt restructuring. Greece given days to give bailout deal or face banking collapse and euro exit. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. Europe has days to agree a plan that will enable Greece to stay in the eurozone and stave off bankruptcy. There have been countless last chances, final offers and unmissable deadlines, but now the endgame really is unfolding. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said failure to secure a deal would lead to the bankruptcy of Greece, \u201cpainful\u201d consequences for the Greek people, with geopolitical effects across Europe. Speaking after a summit of eurozone leaders last night, he said: If someone has any illusion that it will not be so, they are naive. The stark reality is that only have five days to find the ultimate agreement. Until now I have avoided talking about deadlines, but tonight I have to say it loud and clear - the final deadline ends this week. Greece\u2019s fate will be sealed at an emergency summit of European leaders on Sunday. That\u2019s right, there will be another European summit. This time all 28 European Union leaders are to attend. In the words of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, bringing in non-eurozone countries is to demonstrate that \u201cwe are all part and parcel of the same European Union\u201d. It is also a sign of how close Greece is to leaving the single currency - something that doesn\u2019t exist in the EU rule book. We have a packed agenda today. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras will address the European Parliament in Strasbourg at 9.30am (8.30am British summer time). Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will also be speaking to MEPs on the Greek crisis. Eurozone finance ministers will be holding a conference call to discuss Greece\u2019s request for a loan from the EU\u2019s \u20ac500bn bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Some ministers were scathing when Greece failed to produce a proposal on Tuesday, so let\u2019s hope Greece has their plan ready today. We will also be tracking all the reaction in Greece - is the Tsipras government about to sign on the line for the proposal Greeks rejected on Sunday? Will any leader make a decisive intervention to stop Grexit - an outcome so many have said they want to avoid. Plenty to come, so stay with us...",

Our correspondent<strong> Helena Smith</strong> reports</p> <p>Anxiety in Athens this morning is almost palpable. Among a political elite who would have played the game very differently, there is mounting concern that one wrong move and Greece will not only be headed for euro exit but years of purgatory on the periphery of Europe.</p> <p>Highlighting that angst, New Democracy\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said this morning it was now urgent that political leaders coalesce immediately. </p> <p> \u201cThe president of the republic (POR) must assemble the council of political leaders now,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me that he doesn\u2019t have official authority. He has a moral obligation.\u201d</p> <p> Earlier Mitsotakis had tweeted that the \u201ctime had come to learn the truth.\u201d The Greek parliament needed to be informed with an urgent debate in the 300-seat House \u2013 and not just the European parliament. </p> <p> The centre-right New Democracy, which oversaw Greece\u2019s entry into the then European Community in 1981, announced this morning: </p> <p> \u201cA national red line is participation in the euro and in Europe. The government has the responsibility in negotiations and Mr Tsipras ought to bring, as he has promised, an agreement that will keep the country in the euro zone.\u201d </p> <p>Truth is, back in Athens very few have any idea what the proposed agreement now involves. After five months of bungled handling of negotiations under Tsipras, all they know is that any deal is going to be much, much tougher than originally thought given the Greek economy\u2019s freefall following the closure of Greek banks. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-08T09:39:24.340Z\">at 10.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-559ce7cee4b00bdd27708751\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-08T09:09:50.068Z\">10.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nigel Farage is on his feet now.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The European project has started to die.</p> <p>The plan has failed.

    "webTitle": "Biggest banks welcome budget reduction in bank levy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Major lenders will be the largest beneficiaries of shock changes to the bank levy announced by George Osborne following sustained lobbying by the industry. But the chancellor\u2019s move to scale back the levy, which has raised \u00a38bn since 2010, came alongside a new 8% surcharge on bank profits that experts said would spread the tax burden more widely across the sector. Shares in HSBC and Standard Chartered, which had sunk this week on concerns about the situation in China, were lifted off their lows. But smaller banks fell following the surprise announcement because they will be hit by an industry tax for the first time. Virgin Money fell 9%, while Aldermore was off 15% and Shawbrook sunk 10% as investors digested the implications of the new surcharge, which will be introduced from the start of next year for banks that make annual profits of more than \u00a325m. Dana Ward, head of financial services tax at accounting firm Grant Thornton, said: \u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s announcement on the reduction of the bank levy will no doubt be welcomed by major banks, including HSBC, and UK business generally.\u201d The change to the bank levy follows a series of complaints by the major banks, particularly those such as HSBC and Standard Chartered, which are based in London but do much of their business overseas. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in May the \u00a3700m it paid towards the bank levy was impeding his efforts to bolster returns to shareholders. His remarks were regarded as particularly pointed given the bank\u2019s ongoing review into whether to remain headquartered in the UK. The levy has been based on bank\u2019s global balance sheets, but will be focused only on their UK operations from 2021. Responding to complaints from banks that the levy has been hiked too often and without warning, Osborne set out a timetable of reductions from 0.21% to 0.18% from January 2016 and 0.17% from January 2017, before reaching 0.10% from January 2021. Wayne Weaver, banking tax partner at accountant Deloitte, said: \u201cSince its introduction, the bank levy has raised over \u00a38bn for the exchequer and is now expected to raise nearly \u00a34bn each year \u2026 [The changes] will benefit the UK banks who currently bear the lion\u2019s share of the levy.\u201d Osborne told MPs: \u201cOur bank levy was introduced to raise revenue and increase the stability of balance sheets, and it\u2019s worked \u2013 but now it risks doing harm unless we change it. So I will, over the next six years, gradually reduce the bank levy rate \u2013 and after that make sure it no longer applies to worldwide balance sheets. \u201cBut to maintain a fair contribution from the banks, I will introduce a new 8% surcharge on bank profits from the 1st January next year. By getting this balance right, it means we\u2019ll actually raise more from the banks this parliament, but at the same time make our country a more competitive place to do business.\u201d He also issued a new remit for the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee - set up by the coalition government to look for weaknesses in the financial sector - to take account of \u201cthe importance of productive investment, innovation and competition in finance\u201d when making decisions. Dominic Hook, national officer for finance at the Unite trade union, was critical of the relaxation of the levy. \u201cThis sends all the wrong signals to the banking industry,\u201d he said. Tom Aston, financial services partner at accountants KPMG, said that while global banks with relatively small proportions of their balance sheets in the UK will benefit, the picture was more mixed for other banks. The banking industry also kept up its calls for a review of the taxation of the sector, which is forecast to bring in around \u00a31bn in corporation tax over the next six years. This followed a government move last year to restrict the way banks can use past losses to reduce their tax bills. The new measures anounced in the budget will bring in \u00a32bn over the rest of the decade. \u201cThis is the fifth new bank-specific tax measure in as many years following fast on the heels of the big rise in March and will increase banks\u2019 tax burden by nearly \u00a32bn. We believe these moves will also undermine competition in the industry by making it harder for smaller players to break through and challenge larger banks,\u201d said Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association. Matthew Barling, banking tax partner at accounting group PwC, said that while banks with large overseas operations would welcome the reforms, the overall tax burden on the sector was rising. \u201cThis sends very much a mixed message in terms of competitiveness of the UK as a place for carrying on banking business.\u201d",

But smaller banks fell following the surprise announcement because they will be hit by an industry tax for the first time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne\">George Osborne introduces new 'living wage' but cuts working-age benefits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virgin Money fell 9%, while Aldermore was off 15% and Shawbrook sunk 10% as investors digested the implications of the new surcharge, which will be introduced from the start of next year for banks that make annual profits of more than \u00a325m.</p> <p>Dana Ward, head of financial services tax at accounting firm Grant Thornton, said: \u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s announcement on the reduction of the bank levy will no doubt be welcomed by major banks, including HSBC, and UK business generally.\u201d </p> <p>The change to the bank levy follows a series of complaints by the major banks, particularly those such as HSBC and Standard Chartered, which are based in London but do much of their business overseas. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/05/hsbc-to-decide-this-year-on-moving-its-hq-from-uk\">the \u00a3700m it paid towards the bank levy was impeding his efforts to bolster returns to shareholders</a>. His remarks were regarded as particularly pointed given the bank\u2019s ongoing review into whether to remain headquartered in the UK. </p> <p>The levy has been based on bank\u2019s global balance sheets, but will be focused only on their UK operations from 2021. Responding to complaints from banks that the levy has been hiked too often and without warning, Osborne set out a timetable of reductions from 0.21% to 0.18% from January 2016 and 0.17% from January 2017, before reaching 0.10% from January 2021.</p> <p>Wayne Weaver, banking tax partner at accountant Deloitte, said: \u201cSince its introduction, the bank levy has raised over \u00a38bn for the exchequer and is now expected to raise nearly \u00a34bn each year \u2026 [The changes] will benefit the UK banks who currently bear the lion\u2019s share of the levy.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne told MPs: \u201cOur bank levy was introduced to raise revenue and increase the stability of balance sheets, and it\u2019s worked \u2013 but now it risks doing harm unless we change it. So I will, over the next six years, gradually reduce the bank levy rate \u2013 and after that make sure it no longer applies to worldwide balance sheets.<br></p> <p>\u201cBut to maintain a fair contribution from the banks, I will introduce a new 8% surcharge on bank profits from the 1st January next year. By getting this balance right, it means we\u2019ll actually raise more from the banks this parliament, but at the same time make our country a more competitive place to do business.\u201d</p> <p>He also issued a new remit for the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee - set up by the coalition government to look for weaknesses in the financial sector - to take account of \u201cthe importance of productive investment, innovation and competition in finance\u201d when making decisions.</p> <p>Dominic Hook, national officer for finance at the Unite trade union, was critical of the relaxation of the levy. \u201cThis sends all the wrong signals to the banking industry,\u201d he said. Tom Aston, financial services partner at accountants KPMG, said that while global banks with relatively small proportions of their balance sheets in the UK will benefit, the picture was more mixed for other banks.</p> <p>The banking industry also kept up its calls for a review of the taxation of the sector, which is forecast to bring in around \u00a31bn in corporation tax over the next six years. This followed a government move last year<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/03/autumn-statement-2014-osborne-to-introduce-google-tax\"> to restrict the way banks can use past losses to reduce their tax bills</a>. The new measures anounced in the budget will bring in \u00a32bn over the rest of the decade.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the fifth new bank-specific tax measure in as many years following fast on the heels of the big rise in March and will increase banks\u2019 tax burden by nearly \u00a32bn. We believe these moves will also undermine competition in the industry by making it harder for smaller players to break through and challenge larger banks,\u201d said Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association.</p> <p>Matthew Barling, banking tax partner at accounting group PwC, said that while banks with large overseas operations would welcome the reforms, the overall tax burden on the sector was rising. \u201cThis sends very much a mixed message in terms of competitiveness of the UK as a place for carrying on banking business.\u201d </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China\u2019s stock exchange regulator has imposed severe limits on stock market selling, having earlier warned of panic in the market as a range of recent government measures failed to prevent stocks plummeting a further 6%. After 10 minutes of morning trading a wave of listed companies\u2019 shares had been suspended across China\u2019s two stock markets after they dropped by the daily limit of 10%. The China Securities Regulatory Commission ruled that controlling shareholders and managers holding more than 5% of a company\u2019s shares could not reduce their holdings for six months, in an attempt to maintain stability in the markets. Earlier, the regulator\u2019s statement saying there had been a surge in \u201cirrational selling\u201d and \u201cpanic sentiment\u201d had done little to calm investor nerves. The Shanghai composite index closed down 5.9%, while the SCI 300 index of the biggest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen lost 6.8%. The rout spread to other world stock markets, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index closing almost 6% down, its biggest one-day drop for nearly seven years. Since their June peak, Shanghai stocks have plunged 30% in the space of three weeks, having soared more than 150% in the previous 12 months as millions of -private investors piled in. \u201cIt\u2019s a stampede,\u201d said Wang Feng, a former Wall Street trader who founded the hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital. \u201cAnd the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction and are too emotional.\u201d About 1,400 companies, or more than half of those listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen \u2013 filed for a trading halt on Tuesday in an attempt to prevent further losses. Chen Jiahe, chief strategic analyst at Cinda Securities, said this suspension was likely to last until the market was stabilised and liquidity was returned to the market. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said it was not possible to know exactly why so many companies had suspended trading, but that a large number were doing so because they had used their own stock as collateral for loans and wanted to \u201clock in the value for the collateral\u201d. Unlike most other stock markets, where most investors are institutional, in China 80% are small retail investors. Balding said this was raising concerns of \u201cpolitical risk\u201d in Beijing. With large numbers of private investors losing a lot of money, the government would be worried about \u201cpeople protesting on the streets\u201d. As part of the attempt to prevent further losses, China\u2019s state asset regulator had already ordered state-owned enterprises not to sell shares of their listed companies. The People\u2019s Bank of China said it was assisting the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), the national margin trading service provider \u2013 which helps brokers lend money to institutions to buy shares \u2013 to help steady the market. It said it would do this through measures such as aiding interbank lending. It would keep a close watch on the market, continue to support the CSFC and guard against systematic and financial risks. The CSFC said it would buy more shares of small and medium-sized companies, which have suffered the biggest losses. Chen said: \u201cThe market is panicking and the government is trying to save it, so we are having something like a conflict between the two powers and we are not sure which will be the strongest.\u201d Ayako Sera, a senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo, said: \u201cToday is all about China, with Greece in the background \u2026 Shanghai\u2019s early losses were like a cliff dive, which had a huge impact on investor sentiment.\u201d The continued sell-offs came after a surprise interest rate cut by the central bank at the end of June. Relaxations in margin trading and other \u201cstability measures\u201d have done little to calm investors. Analysts said they expected the falls to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t see it getting better,\u201d Balding said. \u201cThere is not going to be a turn around within the next week or two. It probably has a long way to go.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What is happening in China? Stock markets in China are tumbling. A three-week plunge has knocked about 30% off Chinese shares since mid-June. China\u2019s securities regulator has warned of \u201cpanic sentiment\u201d gripping investors, many of whom are individuals that have borrowed heavily to play the stock market. Hundreds of Chinese companies have suspended dealings in their shares in a bid to arrest a frenzy of selling. The authorities have stepped in with various measures, including a surprise interest rate cut. But so far, their efforts have failed to stem the rout and some analysts say the moves by officials have only served to heighten alarm. Investors and policymakers around the world are looking on with growing concern that turmoil in the stock markets will spill into China\u2019s real economy, the second-largest in the world and a huge engine of global growth. But weren\u2019t China\u2019s stock markets soaring just a few weeks ago? They were. China\u2019s stock markets had previously been among the highest performing in the world, and had hit a seven-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months. What was behind the dramatic rise in shares? Investors have been piling in, encouraged by falling borrowing costs as the central bank loosened monetary policy. Unlike most other stock markets, where investors are mostly institutional, more than 80% of investors in China are small retail investors. The rise was also fuelled by a switch away from property investment following a clampdown by the government on excessive lending by banks. Laws liberalising the stock market also made it easier for funds to invest and for firms to offer shares to the public for the first time. The past six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. Why did the market turn? Analysts were already warning that the dramatic rise in China\u2019s stock markets was driven by momentum rather than fundamentals. Stocks were looking wildly overvalued at a time when the Chinese economy was losing steam. As fears grew that the rise in many stocks was unsustainable, the selling started. Even China\u2019s bullish securities regulators admitted markets had become frothy before they turned down. How could so many people afford to buy shares? At the centre of the dramatic stock market slide are individual investors borrowing from a broker to buy securities. There has been an explosion in so-called margin lending. Under that system, the broker can make a demand for more cash or other collateral if the price of the securities has fallen \u2013 known as a margin call. What is the problem with margin calls? In short, the problem for China\u2019s 90 million or so retail investors is that shares can go down as well as up. Margin calls are in no way exclusive to Chinese markets. But the mix of investors is unusual compared with most global markets. As brokerages have lapped up people\u2019s appetite for borrowed money and stock market bets, more households have become exposed to the risk of a stock market correction. Regulators have cracked down on margin trading in recent months and the resulting falling share prices have triggered margin calls. If those margin calls continue, investors will have to offload other assets to come up with the cash they need. What are companies doing? About 1,300 companies have suspended their shares \u2013 almost half the market \u2013 in what analysts see as an attempt to sit out the rout. Some companies have suspended trading because they have used their own stock as collateral for loans and they want to \u201clock in the value for the collateral\u201d, said Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Peking University. What are the Chinese authorities doing? Beijing has supported a series of market operations to halt the sharp decline, but each one has been criticised for failing to restore market confidence. China has arranged a curb on new share issues and enlisted brokerages and fund managers to buy massive amounts of shares, helped by China\u2019s state-backed margin finance company, the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), which in turn has a direct line of liquidity from the central bank. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said it would continue to work with the CSFC to steady the stock market. The CSFC also said it would purchase more shares of small and medium-size listed companies \u2013 the firms that have suffered the biggest losses in the rout. How worried is the government? The rapid decline of a previously booming stock market has become a major headache for the president, Xi Jinping, and China\u2019s senior leaders, who are already struggling to avert a sharper economic slowdown. Analysts say the government sees the strength of the Chinese stock market as a sign of its own clout, hence all the attempts to steady the market. Mark Williams, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cChina\u2019s leadership has doubled down on its efforts to prop up equity prices, because it believes that its own credibility is now coupled to continued gains on the markets.\u201d .\u201d Because so many of the investors in the market are individuals, the government will be acutely aware that deepening losses risk denting the real economy and even fuelling social unrest. Then again, in a statement on the economy this week, the premier, Li Keqiang, failed to mention the deepening market crisis. What is the economic backdrop? China\u2019s economy was already losing steam. Its GDP growth rate halved from 14% in 2007 to 7.4% last year. The next GDP figures in mid-July are expected to show the slowest growth since before the financial crisis. In a sign of softening demand, imports have been falling in recent months. Exports have also eased off, despite government measures to stimulate growth. But analysts are divided over the scale of the risk to the real economy from the stock market turmoil. They question the strength of links between the two. Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cIt goes without saying that movements in the Chinese stock market don\u2019t necessarily correlate to China\u2019s economy. This applied on the way up when Chinese stocks rallied more than 100% in the space of a year while economic growth was the slowest in six years. This should also be the case on the way down; just because stocks are crashing, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have a knock-on effect on China\u2019s economy.\u201d Will this spill into other markets? That is the worry. To cover margin calls, investors are having to sell other assets to raise money. Commodities such as copper and silver have fallen in recent days. On top of that, there is the effect on investor sentiment from the Chinese sell-off and fears its real economy could suffer. The contagion is already being felt in other Asian shares, which slid to a 17-month low on Wednesday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was initially resilient to the sell-off on China\u2019s mainland markets, but has been falling and on Wednesday suffered its biggest one-day drop since October 2008: all gains since the start of this year have been wiped out. Who is most exposed? Asian countries have strong trade links with China, so stand to lose out if its economy is hit by stock market falls. Beyond Asian markets, investors in Australia are also starting to feel the effects of the Chinese slump. Australian stock markets have sold off on the back of the Chinese market turmoil and falls in commodity prices. The worry is focused on Australia\u2019s miners, because demand for Australian iron ore and coal will fall if the Chinese economy suffers. The Australian dollar is also under pressure and slumped to a six-year low against the US dollar on Wednesday. Because China has been such an important driver of global growth, the worries spread beyond Australia. The FTSE 100, where several big miners are listed, has been sensitive to weaker economic news out of China in recent months. The British chancellor, George Osborne, used his budget on Wednesday to highlight the external risks to the British economy, which include China. China is the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest export market and exports to the country have fallen over recent months. British banks have also increased their exposure to China in recent years. On the other hand, pressure from China\u2019s slowdown on commodity prices could be helpful for those countries more reliant on imports and keep their inflation rates low. Samuel Tombs, the senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe UK economy has little to fear from slower growth in China ... The eurozone crisis is a much more pertinent danger.\u201d So how does the turmoil in China compare with the crisis in Greece? Potentially, the stock market rout in China, with all the political, social and economic risks it entails, could turn out to be a much bigger threat to the global economy than the debt crisis in Greece. Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the currency experts Forex.com, said: \u201cThe sell-off in Chinese stocks in recent weeks makes the volatility in European and US indices look like a walk in the park.\u201d Economists have said that even if the stock market has limited impact on the real economy in China, that economy was already slowing. There is a risk, they say, that China is heading for a \u201chard landing\u201d.",

Samuel Tombs, the senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe UK economy has little to fear from slower growth in China ... The eurozone crisis is a much more pertinent danger.\u201d</p> <h2>So how does the turmoil in China compare with the crisis in Greece?</h2> <p>Potentially, the stock market rout in China, with all the political, social and economic risks it entails, could turn out to be a much bigger threat to the global economy than the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\">debt crisis</a> in Greece.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the currency experts Forex.com, said: \u201cThe sell-off in Chinese stocks in recent weeks makes the volatility in European and US indices look like a walk in the park.\u201d<br></p> <p>Economists have said that even if the stock market has limited impact on the real economy in China, that economy was already slowing. There is a risk, they say, that China is heading for a \u201chard landing\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The New York stock exchange halted trading in all securities on Wednesday morning after a \u201cmajor technical issue\u201d. The exchange posted the news on its website and said \u201cadditional information will follow as soon as possible\u201d. The halt began at 11.32am ET. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI said there was no sign of suspicious activity and no law enforcement action was needed. Barack Obama has been briefed on the situation, and both the White House and the Treasury Department are monitoring the shutdown. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the president had been informed there was \u201cno indication of malicious actors\u201d being involved. Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said: \u201cWe are in contact with NYSE and are closely monitoring the situation and trading in NYSE-listed stocks.\u201d The NYSE Group, which includes the New York stock exchange, has suspended trading in all securities, worth a total of $28tn, because of technical difficulties. The NYSE has been hit by technical difficulties in the past but the scale of the closure was unprecedented. A technical glitch was reportedly identified before trading began but had been resolved before the opening bell for trading was rung at 9.30am. \u201cWe\u2019re currently experiencing a technical issue that we\u2019re working to resolve as quickly as possible,\u201d a representative of the exchange said in an email. \u201cWe are doing our utmost to produce a swift resolution, communicate thoroughly and transparently, and ensure a timely and orderly market re-open.\u201d Also known as the Big Board, the NYSE is the world\u2019s largest stock market and home to many of the world\u2019s largest companies including AT&amp;T, Bank of America, Ford and General Electric. It is one of the biggest stock market suspensions since Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the September 11 attacks in 2001. The US\u2019s other large exchanges remained open. In a statement, a spokesman for the technology-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange said it was operating normally. NYSE securities can be traded on other exchanges, including Nasdaq. The halt came as China\u2019s stock markets continued their freefall and the Greek debt crisis continued to rattle European investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 213 points when trading was halted, a fall of 1.2%. China\u2019s stock markets have fallen more than 30% in the last three weeks after soaring 150% in the last year. China\u2019s regulators have blamed \u201cirrational selling\u201d and \u201cpanic sentiment\u201d. The trading halt could not have been more poorly timed for Wall Street. Earnings reports start this week with the release of Alcoa\u2019s second quarter report on Wednesday afternoon. The Federal Reserve will also release minutes of its latest meeting on Wednesday, a meeting in which the central bank discussed raising interest rates for the first time since the recession. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said he initially worried that China\u2019s woes had spread to the US when he heard the news and was relieved that it appeared to be a technical glitch. \u201cThat said it doesn\u2019t add a lot of confidence in the markets when investors don\u2019t have a lot to begin with,\u201d he said. The exchange\u2019s woes came on the same day that United Airlines grounded all of its US flights after a computer glitch. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s website also went down due to a technical issue at the same time as the NYSE suspended trading. At about 1 pm \u2013 an hour and a half after the trading halted \u2013 one of the NYSE\u2019s traders walked over to the barricades outside the exchange\u2019s Wall Street headquarters. As he strolled over reporters flocked to him. \u201cWhat? Do you want my autograph now?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can\u2019t comment.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s scary is you asking me all these questions.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Barclays fires chief executive Antony Jenkins", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Antony Jenkins has been brutally ousted as the boss of Barclays bank three years after he was promoted to the job in the wake of the Libor scandal. He is being temporarily replaced by the new chairman, John McFarlane \u2013 who has only been in post since April - to clear the way for new leadership to accelerate changes at the business and inject more energy into its operations. A long-running boardroom row over the future of Barclays\u2019 investment banking side, the business that was built up by his predecessor Bob Diamond, was said to be behind Jenkins\u2019 departure. Tom King, the current head of the investment bank had threatened to quit. McFarlane, though, was quick to say that the investment bank was a crucial part of the bank. The group\u2019s non-executive directors took behind-the-scenes steps through Sir Mike Rake, the most senior independent director, to remove Jenkins after a series of presentations to the board last month in which the current strategy was discussed. McFarlane said there had been \u201crumblings\u201d among the non-executives for some time and they had approached him with their concerns. Jenkins\u2019 departure will be cushioned by a payoff of at least \u00a32.5m \u2013 before bonuses. The board met on Tuesday night to ratify his departure, after which he could receive bonuses worth \u00a39m, current share prices, if all performance criteria are met over the next three years. He owns 5.5m shares. Barclays shares rose 3% to 260p, bolstered by McFarlane\u2019s assertion that the bank would not need to tap shareholders for cash and despite forecasts by analysts at Bernstein that up to \u00a36bn of fresh capital will be needed. Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town, and he\u2019s got the board\u2019s (and, we assume, the regulators\u2019) backing to make sweeping changes. We have long advocated an aggressive pruning of the investment bank; the time for this, it appears, is now.\u201d Amid mounting expectations that the investment banking business will be restrained, McFarlane repeatedly stressed the importance of the operation, which was once the powerhouse of Barclays. It has been the focus of repeated rows over bonuses and scandals such as Libor and foreign exchange rigging. Mark Garnier, Conservative MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, tweeted: \u201cBarclays Jenkins sacking is worrying. New focus on cost cutting, revenue growth and balance sheet leverage sounds rather pre 2007 crisis\u201d. The timing of the announcement evokes memories of 2013 when the bank announced it was paying its top bankers \u00a339.5m in bonuses \u2013 including the since-departed Rich Ricci \u2013 on the day of the budget. The chancellor, George Osborne, is due to deliver his first budget in a Conservative government on Wednesday although McFarlane insisted the timing was coincidental. He said more branches would close and jobs would go. \u201cBarclays is not efficient,\u201d he said, pointing out that it has 375 management committees. The bank needed \u201cenergy and speed of decision-making\u201d, he said, and managers more scope for freedom of decision-making. Barclays\u2019 sponsorship of the Premier League will end next year. The change takes place from 17 July when McFarlane will leave the board of First Group. His promotion to the top job mirrors the role he took on at insurer Aviva during the 2012 shareholder spring when the insurer\u2019s boss was also ousted and McFarlane highlighted this experience to set out his credentials for temporarily taking the helm. McFarlane said: \u201cWhilst it is unfortunate that I have had little time to work with Antony, I respect and endorse the position of the board in deciding that a change in leadership is required at this time. I would add my personal thanks for everything that Antony has done for us. He can be proud of his heritage, especially his excellent work on culture and values that we will continue. I wish him well. \u201cArriving at Barclays with a fresh perspective, it is evident that we have a standout brand with first-class retail, commercial and investment banking businesses. Nevertheless, we are leaving value on the table and a new approach is required. As a group, if we aspire to bring shareholder returns forward, we need to be much more focused on what is attractive, what we are good at, and where we are good at it.\u201d McFarlane said Jenkins\u2019 stratategy was not at issue \u2013 last year he set out plans to axe 19,000 jobs \u2013 but the speed of change was problem. Jenkins said: \u201cIn the summer of 2012, I became group chief executive at a particularly difficult time for Barclays. It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us. I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then.\u201d Rake, who orchestrated Jenkins\u2019 departure, said: \u201cI reflected long and hard on the issue of group leadership and discussed this with each of the non-executive directors. Notwithstanding Antony\u2019s significant achievements, it became clear to all of us that a new set of skills were required for the period ahead. This does not take away from our appreciation of Antony\u2019s contribution at a critical time for the company.\u201d Jenkins was promoted from running the retail bank when Diamond was forced out three years ago just days after the bank was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor. The new chief executive repeatedly said he wanted to make Barclays the \u201cgo to\u201d bank. In an attempt to show he was trying to turn around the culture, he had also installed five huge blocks inside the cavernous entrance hall of the bank in Canary Wharf, each one emblazoned with his buzzwords of \u201crespect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship\u201d. A full-time successor will be sought externally and internally. Immediate speculation will focus on finance director Tushar Morzaria and Jonathan Moulds, who was recently hired to implement the ringfencing rules that UK banks must comply with to separate their high street banks from their investment banking businesses. McFarlane said he was no hurry and said the candidate would need experience of investment banking.",

It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us. I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then.\u201d</p> <p>Rake, who orchestrated Jenkins\u2019 departure, said: \u201cI reflected long and hard on the issue of group leadership and discussed this with each of the non-executive directors. Notwithstanding Antony\u2019s significant achievements, it became clear to all of us that a new set of skills were required for the period ahead. This does not take away from our appreciation of Antony\u2019s contribution at a critical time for the company.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jenkins was promoted from running the retail bank when Diamond was forced out three years ago just days after the bank was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor. The new chief executive repeatedly said he wanted to make Barclays the \u201cgo to\u201d bank. In an attempt to show he was trying to turn around the culture, he had also installed five huge blocks inside the cavernous entrance hall of the bank in Canary Wharf, each one emblazoned with his buzzwords of \u201crespect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship\u201d. <br></p> <p>A full-time successor will be sought externally and internally. Immediate speculation will focus on finance director Tushar Morzaria and Jonathan Moulds, who was recently hired to implement the ringfencing rules that UK banks must comply with to separate their high street banks from their investment banking businesses. McFarlane said he was no hurry and said the candidate would need experience of investment banking.<br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday night, The Way Station, a bar in the Prospects Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, gave a whole new meaning to ladies\u2019 night. This 7 July \u2013 7/7 \u2013 the local watering hole was drawing attention to the gender pay gap by charging women just 77% of their bar tab. Why 77%? Because on average, US women make about 77 to 78 cents for every dollar that men earn. \u201cI have three sisters. The majority of my staff and friends are women,\u201d Andy Heidel, owner of The Way Station, said. \u201cI thought this would be a great way to even the playing field even if it was for one night only.\u201d Cheyenne and Aliyah, two 21-year-olds who did not want to give their last names, made it out for the occasion. Aliyah, a senior at John Jay college who hopes to be a New York police officer, said the gender pay gap is something she worries about when thinking about her post-college experience. \u201cMy male coworker works less than me gets paid more than me,\u201d said Cheyenne, who works in retail and is studying fashion merchandising at LIM College. \u201cThe other day, we were talking about pay and wages and he told me he gets paid more than me.\u201d Both Cheyenne and Aliyah know that they have one more thing working against them: they are black. Women of color earn 64 cents for every $1 earned by men. \u201cMy father as a black man also probably make less than his white colleagues,\u201d said Aliyah. \u201cThis is about equality. This is America,\u201d said Cheyenne. \u201cWe should get equal pay.\u201d Just a few feet away, two young men were having similar conversation. According to Heidel, that was the entire point of Tuesday\u2019s deal: to get people talking. Heidel spent the evening working as bartender and busboy, stocking the bar with alcohol and glassware, slinging drinks, and collecting the empties. The bar started to get busy at 6pm and was still full five hours later. There were about 90 people in the bar, with barely any standing room left for newcomers. \u201cThis is much bigger than I expected,\u201d Heidel told the Guardian, while taking a break outside. After he realized that he might have to turn people away, Heidel asked 706 bar, a bar across the street, if they would join the cause. \u201cI wanted to be able to send them someplace where they would be treated with respect and be able to enjoy the same discount.\u201d The bar draws enough attention on its own. Known as Brooklyn\u2019s \u201cDoctor Who\u201d bar by most due to its Tardis bathroom, it sees its share of out-of-town visitors and devoted regulars. One young man stood outside eyeing the crowd. \u201cWell it\u2019s about three layers deep, but you should go get your 77% bar tab,\u201d he told his female companion, smiling. \u201cI want you to get your damned reward, your reparations.\u201d As they stepped closer to the entrance, a third member of their party, another young man, said: \u201cI love women but I am afraid of noise.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s women\u2019s noise!\u201d said the female, leading them in towards the happy chatter. \u201cI feel claustrophobic just looking at it,\u201d said a young woman as her group of friends approached. Taking a deep breath, she and her friends dived into the crowd. Heidel kept popping in and out of the crowd. Standing outside, he shook hands with those leaving, thanking them for coming out. Regulars slapped his back, congratulating him on the night\u2019s success. \u201cYou touched a nerve,\u201d one of the regulars told him. Heidel said that he was happy to start the dialogue about the gender pay gap, pointing out that the women\u2019s soccer team that won the Women\u2019s World Cup this weekend was paid less than their male counterparts. Not everyone was thrilled with The Way Station\u2019s version of the ladies\u2019 night, with some men\u2019s rights activists saying the deal discriminated against men. To those who were complaining about price discrimination against men and threatening to boycott the bar, Heidel had a ready response: good riddance. \u201cMen are already complaining on the Men\u2019s Rights Reddit and other places saying I am discriminating,\u201d Heidel said. \u201cFor those men complaining about it, those are not the type of people I want as customers so this promotion is helping to weed out those who do not want to treat women with respect.\u201d \u201cThis is certainly price discrimination based on gender,\u201d said Patricia McCoy, a law professor at Boston College. \u201cWhether it is illegal price discrimination is unclear. Some states prohibit price discrimination based on gender, while others do not. Whatever else, certainly what the bar is doing is provocative and guaranteed to draw attention.\u201d The New York City department of consumer affairs did not respond to a request for comment as to whether this would constitute price discrimination in New York. \u201cThis is weeding out the assholes and it\u2019s working,\u201d said Heidel. \u201cIt\u2019s 85% women in there and that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Not even five minutes after he said that, three men passed by. One shook his head, saying: \u201cNo way am I going into that bar.\u201d The US census bureau found that in 2013 women were making $10,800 less a year than men. This means, they were earning only 78 cents for every dollar a man earns. In 2012, women earned 77 cents to every dollar men did. Not everyone is ready to accept these numbers, however. Some critics of the \u201c77 cents for every $1\u201d figure insist that the wage disparity between the genders stems from women\u2019s choice of careers \u2013 for example, women are more likely to pursue degrees in education, social work, healthcare, arts and communications, while men are more likely to study computer science and engineering. Heidel dismissed that argument. \u201cThe stats I have researched are based on same jobs held by women and men,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you took national average, all the male CEOs would skew the numbers even more.\u201d Heidel hopes to make the event an annual thing. \u201cHopefully next year we can do this on 8/5, instead of 7/7,\u201d he said, before diving back into the happy crowd.",

      "bodyText": "David Lenigas, the flamboyant executive who made ambitious claims that there were up to 100bn barrels of oil under the ground close to Gatwick airport in southern England, has abruptly stepped down from his position as executive chairman of UK Oil &amp; Gas Investments (UKOG). No reason was given other than a formal announcement from the small independent oil explorer saying Lenigas would \u201cfocus on other business interests\u201d. The Monaco-based oilman will be kept on as a consultant but will be replaced as chairman by the company\u2019s chief executive, Steve Sanderson, who will take on both roles. The UKOG share price trebled in April after Lenigas triggered a media frenzy when he talked about a world-class discovery, labelled the Gatwick gusher, being made at its Horse Hill-1 well in the Weald Basin on the borders of Surrey and West Sussex. He later appeared to row back on the more exuberant initial claims, but has insisted there are potentially billions of barrels of oil reserves in place, if not necessarily recoverable. As damaging to UKOG has been the announcement last month that pretax net losses in the six months to 31 March were \u00a3383,000, comparedwith \u00a3290,000 in the same period of the preceding year. The company claims it still has enough cash to fund continued exploration around the Weald. Although UKOG insists the oil would be extracted without the use of the controversial fracking technique, environmental campaigners have become ever more determined to stop onshore drilling. Lenigas dismissed suggestions he had been forcibly removed from UKOG. He tweeted: \u201cJust for 100% complete clarification, it was 100% my choice to retire from UKOG. I planned this for a while. Found a great man in Steve.\u201d Lenigas has made both serious and jokey comments on social media. Earlier this week, reflecting on the difficult relations between Greece and the European Union, he tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s about time that Jeremy Clarkson was appointed president of the EU. We might get a straight answer for a change.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "John McFarlane brings his chainsaw to Barclays", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "John McFarlane has a fearsome reputation for shaking up companies soon after he joins them. Barclays said Antony Jenkins\u2019 abrupt departure as chief executive was triggered by non-executives agreeing that his time was up. But McFarlane\u2019s arrival as chairman less than two months ago surely played a part. The veteran banker helped oust Andrew Moss as Aviva\u2019s chief executive in May 2012 after a shareholder revolt over pay and financial performance. There, too, he became stand-in executive chairman, running the insurer for eight months, reining in costs and redrawing its strategy. McFarlane was named as Barclays\u2019 chairman in September 2014, having vehemently denied any interest in the job. He took over from Sir David Walker, who spent three years as chairman, at the bank\u2019s annual meeting in April and is paid \u00a3800,000 a year. At the meeting, disgruntled shareholders called for McFarlane to repeat his shakeup of Aviva at Barclays. One shareholder told the board that only two directors were left at Aviva after McFarlane \u201carrived at Aviva with his axe\u201d. Another said he was looking forward to McFarlane wielding his chainsaw at Barclays. McFarlane sat impassively throughout but he issued an unusual letter to investors suggesting that protesters at the meeting might get their way. Barclays was changing too slowly, costs were too high, businesses might need to be closed and the bank needed to settle disputes with regulators, he said. \u201cWhile substantial progress has been achieved \u2026 it is transparent that a great deal still needs to be done,\u201d he said. McFarlane also played a part in the ejection of Fred Goodwin as chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland. He became a director of RBS in October 2008 \u2013 two weeks before the bank\u2019s rescue by taxpayers. McFarlane later said he was \u201cslightly instrumental in the change of the chief executive\u201d at RBS. He was tipped to become RBS\u2019s chairman but the job went to Sir Philip Hampton. McFarlane stayed on as a non-executive director of RBS until he became Aviva chairman in 2012. McFarlane has chaired the Scottish-based bus and train operator FirstGroup since January. Soon after arriving he cleared out half of the company\u2019s board and quashed hopes of a resumption of dividend payments at the indebted company. Tim O\u2019Toole, FirstGroup\u2019s chief executive, was under pressure when McFarlane arrived but has survived in the job. McFarlane will leave FirstGroup in July, having taken the Barclays job. The Scottish-born banker is best known in Australian banking circles after running ANZ \u2013 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group \u2013 for a decade until September 2007. He turned the bank into one of the region\u2019s most respected companies by focusing on retail banking, cutting investment banking and expanding in China. Before ANZ he was an executive director at Standard Chartered, the Asia-focused UK bank, and headed Citibank\u2019s UK and Ireland business. McFarlane started his business career in manufacturing at Ford\u2019s European operation in 1969. He moved back to the UK from Australia in 2012 to chair Aviva. Outside of his business career, he has played in a skiffle band called the Sekrets and now grows olives in Provence. A reputation for cost control and a willingness to oust chief executives have led some UK journalists to label him Mack the Knife. McFarlane said on Wednesday he did not recognise the nickname and that cost cuts were only part of his work at Aviva. \u201cTripling the market cap and doubling the stock price isn\u2019t about knives its about accelerating\u201d. He said slashing costs had not been a hallmarkt of his 40-year-career but he said: \u201cI am decisive and that\u2019s fair enough \u2026 Look at my track record: it\u2019s largely about process not just about cost.\u201d In Australia, newspapers called him Johnny Hollywood in honour of his performing past and willingness to sing songs such as House of the Rising Sun at corporate and charity events.",

But McFarlane\u2019s arrival as chairman less than two months ago surely played a part. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\">Barclays fires chief executive Antony Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The veteran banker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/08/aviva-chief-executive-steps-down\">helped oust Andrew Moss as Aviva\u2019s chief executive in May 2012</a> after a shareholder revolt over pay and financial performance. There, too, he became stand-in executive chairman, running the insurer for eight months, reining in costs and redrawing its strategy.<br></p> <p>McFarlane <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/12/john-mcfarlane-barclays-chairman-bank-aviva\">was named as Barclays\u2019 chairman in September 2014</a>, having vehemently denied any interest in the job. He took over from Sir David Walker, who spent three years as chairman, at the bank\u2019s annual meeting in April and is paid \u00a3800,000 a year.</p> <p>At the meeting, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/23/barclays-agm-new-chairman-john-mcfarlane\">disgruntled shareholders called for McFarlane to repeat his shakeup of Aviva at Barclays</a>. One shareholder told the board that only two directors were left at Aviva after McFarlane \u201carrived at Aviva with his axe\u201d. Another said he was looking forward to McFarlane wielding his chainsaw at Barclays. </p> <p>McFarlane sat impassively throughout but he issued an unusual letter to investors suggesting that protesters at the meeting might get their way. Barclays was changing too slowly, costs were too high, businesses might need to be closed and the bank needed to settle disputes with regulators, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile substantial progress has been achieved \u2026 it is transparent that a great deal still needs to be done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McFarlane also played a part in the ejection of Fred Goodwin as chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland. He became a director of RBS in October 2008 \u2013 two weeks before the bank\u2019s rescue by taxpayers. McFarlane later said he was \u201cslightly instrumental in the change of the chief executive\u201d at RBS.</p> <p>He was tipped to become RBS\u2019s chairman but the job went to Sir Philip Hampton. McFarlane stayed on as a non-executive director of RBS until he became Aviva chairman in 2012. </p> <p>McFarlane has chaired the Scottish-based bus and train operator FirstGroup since January. Soon after arriving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/21/firstgroup-chairman-revamps-board-quashes-dividend-hopes\">he cleared out half of the company\u2019s board and quashed hopes of a resumption of dividend</a> payments at the indebted company. </p> <p>Tim O\u2019Toole, FirstGroup\u2019s chief executive, was under pressure when McFarlane arrived but has survived in the job. McFarlane will leave FirstGroup in July, having taken the Barclays job.</p> <p>The Scottish-born banker is best known in Australian banking circles after running ANZ \u2013 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group \u2013 for a decade until September 2007. </p> <p>He turned the bank into one of the region\u2019s most respected companies by focusing on retail banking, cutting investment banking and expanding in China. Before ANZ he was an executive director at Standard Chartered, the Asia-focused UK bank, and headed Citibank\u2019s UK and Ireland business.</p> <p>McFarlane started his business career in manufacturing at Ford\u2019s European operation in 1969. He moved back to the UK from Australia in 2012 to chair Aviva. Outside of his business career, he has played in a skiffle band called the Sekrets and now grows olives in Provence.</p> <p>A reputation for cost control and a willingness to oust chief executives have led some UK journalists to label him Mack the Knife. McFarlane said on Wednesday he did not recognise the nickname and that cost cuts were only part of his work at Aviva.</p> <p>\u201cTripling the market cap and doubling the stock price isn\u2019t about knives its about accelerating\u201d. He said slashing costs had not been a hallmarkt of his 40-year-career but he said: \u201cI am decisive and that\u2019s fair enough \u2026 Look at my track record: it\u2019s largely about process not just about cost.\u201d</p> <p>In Australia, newspapers called him Johnny Hollywood in honour of his performing past and willingness to sing songs such as House of the Rising Sun at corporate and charity events.</p>",
