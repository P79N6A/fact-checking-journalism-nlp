      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Bitcoin has made a subdued debut onto the world\u2019s largest futures exchange, as a series of politicians and officials voiced concerns about the digital currency. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) became the second exchange to offer bitcoin derivatives trading last night. And right now, bitcoin futures contracts which settle in 2018 have all fallen below their opening value. The January 2018 contract, which initially spiked over $20,000, has now dropped back to $18,920 - having been originally priced at $19,500. Contracts that mature in February, March and June are all in the red (although they\u2019ve received little attention compared to the January option). Futures contracts allow traders to bet against an asset, so today\u2019s moves could suggest that bitcoin\u2019s stunning rally is running out of steam. But, less than 1,000 contracts have been traded today (each one is worth 5 bitcoins). The spot price of bitcoin has also dipped, currently down 1.6% at $18,640 - having hit a new alltime high near $20,000 last night. CME\u2019s launch of bitcoin futures was accompanied by a series of warnings. For example: Denmark\u2019s top central banker said bitcoin was dangerous, and investors shouldn\u2019t blame regulators if they lost their money. A senior Singaporean regulator said bitcoin had no intrinsic value France\u2019s finance minister is pushing for the G20 to debate bitcoin regulation UBS\u2019s chairmen, Axel Weber, said regulators should take a closer look at digital currencies Analysts at ING also put the boot into bitcoin, saying it would eventually become just a \u2018niche product\u2019 again. ING cited bitcoin\u2019s volatility, scalability issues, and the shadow of regulation among several reasons why it would not replace traditional cash. So those buyers who are hoping to sell their bitcoins at an even higher price in the future may be disappointed, they say: We are enthusiastic about blockchain technology, and the current attention for Bitcoin could boost blockchain and digital currencies\u2019 development. But as we have argued above, we doubt whether Bitcoin itself has what it takes to become a serious mainstream payment systems contender. Instead, we think it is more likely for Bitcoin to return to its roots as a niche payment system. A niche asset adopted worldwide could still have a substantial user base and hence value. It is therefore impossible to say whether the current Bitcoin market price is \u201ctoo high\u201d for a niche asset. Then again, we join the crowd of analysts observing typical bubble characteristics: the idea of an asset that is new, revolutionary, almost magic \u2013 hard to understand, but let\u2019s invest anyway because it will become huge. This idea is a form of \u201cthis time it\u2019s different\u201d-thinking. \u201cYes we know about all those previous bubbles that popped, but Bitcoin is really, really different.\u201d We are not so sure. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our news story about the kerfuffle over Ikea\u2019s tax affairs: European stock markets have closed at their highest level in almost six weeks, following Wall Street\u2019s lead. The German Dax led the charge, gaining 1.6%, with France\u2019s CAC and the Italian FTSE MIB both gaining 1.33%. The UK lagged behind, with the FTSE 100 finishing 46 points higher at 7,537, up 0.6%. The Footsie was held back by the pound, which has gained almost a cent today to $1.34 (which is bad for exporters). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says the City is anticipating a final deal on US tax cuts soon. Risk on sentiment is driving trading, as investor optimism over the US tax bill being passed sooner rather than later is lifting stocks. The 2 wavering Senators, which could have thrown the vote in the Senate slim majority are now back on side and the markets are cheering. France\u2019s call for G20 leaders to debate bitcoin regulation may win the support of Germany. Bloomberg reports: In Berlin, a Finance Ministry spokesman said it was watching \u201cbitcoin and other cryptocurrency developments closely,\u201d adding that Germany\u2019s financial supervisor Bafin has already warned of the risks of cryptocurrencies for consumers. In Greece leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras has urged banks to do more to clamp down on big time debtors, citing the banking system\u2019s record stock of non-performing loans. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a no-holds barred speech Tsipras told leading bankers today that the time had come to crack down on big-time debtors and strategic defaulters as part of efforts to restore liquidity to Greece\u2019s cash-strapped economy. Those who had allowed bad debt to bust businesses, but done well themselves, had to be \u201cchased,\u201d he told bank representatives assembled at his office, adding: \u201cLiquidity needs to be restored to the economy \u2026 We need a responsible and effective way to deal with the problem of non-performing loans.\u201d By failing to effectively deal with NPLs \u2013 of which Greece has the highest amount in the EU \u2013 and provide funding for others, he said, banks were failing to properly support young Greeks in fulfilling their dreams. Describing the role of banks as crucial, the leftist leader also called for the creation of an \u201cobservatory\u201d that could advise the government on what banks could offer. With less than a year before the debt-stricken country\u2019s third international bailout officially expires \u2013 ending, it is hoped, an era of international supervision \u2013 the government is keen to improve daily life. On Friday the International Monetary Fund also cited bad debt as a major obstacle for Cypriot banks despite the island\u2019s impressive economic recovery after its own crisis in 2013. NPLs in Cypriot banks amount to 46% of loans -- after Greece the highest amount in the EU. Maybe some of these bubble warnings are getting through to investors. The bitcoin futures price is now moving south, as more traders take a position via CME\u2019s new derivatives platform. Almost 840 contracts for the January 2018 bitcoin contract have now been traded - with the price now falling to $19,010 [reminder, each contract is for five bitcoins]. Over in New York, the US stock markets has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 138 points, or 0.5%, to 24,790 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also up, while rallying tech stocks have sent the Nasdaq higher too. Investors are excited by the possibility that the US Congress might reach a final agreement on tax reforms. Those reforms have been heavily criticised by some experts, who fear it will drive up the US deficit and hand the richest Americans a tax cut. So why is Wall Street celebrating? Because the bill will slash corporation tax, delivering a massive windfall to large corporations. Analysts at FxPro say: With the bill reducing corporation tax from 35% to 21%, there will be a windfall to US companies. With the possibility of share buy-backs and/or higher dividends by US Corporations, this will, in turn, increase the pace of interest rate hikes and see a stronger US dollar as a result. But.... foreign exchange expert Kit Juckes of Societe Generale points out that bond traders aren\u2019t impressed by the tax reforms: The US Tax Bill will probably be voted on, pass and will turn up on the President\u2019s desk this week . A significant boost to the economy? \u201cOh yes, it is\u201d cries President Trump, who calls it \u2018one of the great Christmas gifts\u2019 to the middle class. \u201cOh no, it isn\u2019t\u201d answers the bond market, as 10yr Notes meander along at 2.37% this morning, and TIPS remain mid-range. The bond market fell for the President\u2019s policy promises this time last year and is resolutely unimpressed this time round. \u2018Bah, Humbug\u2019 sums it up (at the risk of mixing panto-metaphors). Denmark\u2019s top central banker has now issued a stern warning to speculators to avoid bitcoin. Lars Rohde, governor of the National Bank of Denmark, told local broadcaster DR that bitcoin was a dangerous bubble, comparing it to the tulip bulb mania of the 17th Century. Rohde declared that putting money into bitcoin was basically gambling, warning: \u201cYou have to stay away [from bitcoin]. It is dangerous. Rohde also warned that people buying bitcoin shouldn\u2019t blame regulators if they suffer losses when the market crashes. He says: \u201cIt is not a regulated market. It is not the responsibility of the authorities. It is the responsibility of the individual.\u201d So far so smooth for bitcoin today..... Don\u2019t risk the scrum of present-hunters in the shops this lunchtime. Instead, pit your wits against our Christmas quiz.... Breaking away from Bitcoin.... and the European Union has launched an investigation into whether Ikea is unfairly dodging tax. The EU has opened an in-depth investigation into the Swedish furniture giant\u2019s tax deals in the Netherlands, and whether it used a Dutch subsidiary to slash its tax bill. EU\u2019s anti-trust commissioner Margrethe Vestager is concerned that Ikea may have had an unfair advantage over rivals, by using various subsidiaries to reduce its tax burden. She says: \u201cAll companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax. \u201cMember states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere.\u201d The inquiry focuses on two tax rulings in the Netherlands. One allowed Inter Ikea, its Dutch branch, to pay a large licence fee to a Luxembourg-based division which paid less tax. A second ruling involved a loan arrangement between Inter Ikea and a unit in Liechtenstein, which also moved shifted taxable revenue to a low tax jurisdiction. Most of the EU\u2019s previous tax inquiries have focused on US companies, as Apple and Amazon. This one is closer to home, points out Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit. We should note that CME\u2019s new bitcoin futures contracts actually covers five units of the digital currency. So the 681 contracts traded so far today have a notional value of 3,405 bitcoins -- or around $65m. Singapore\u2019s financial watchdog has joined the chorus of concerns over cryptocurrencies. Sopnendu Mohanty, the top fintech official at Singapore\u2019s monetary authority (MAS), has warned that people who have invested in bitcoin will come a cropper when they try to withdraw their funds. The Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has the story: Bitcoin has no fundamental value and is likely to end in tears once speculators discover how hard it can be to extricate their cash, Singapore\u2019s financial watchdog has warned. Sopnendu Mohanty, Fintech chief for Singapore\u2019s monetary authority (MAS), said there was a crucial difference between Bitcoin and rival crypto-currency Ethereum, but it is far from clear whether either improves day-to-day transactions or has much potential as a tool for central banking. \u201cBitcoin has no natural intrinsic value. Can you buy a house with it? Can you use it for daily interactions? It may be valued at $18,000 right now but what I want to know is how you convert it into fiat currency and realize that value. The risk comes at the moment of conversion,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph.... More here: Singapore\u2019s Fintech chief warns on Bitcoin delusion The bitcoin futures price is also rallying. The January contract has now jumped back to $19,645, over the opening price of $19,500, and ahead of today\u2019s \u2018spot price\u2019. But the trading volume is still quite modest, with exactly 666 contracts so far on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u2019s new offering. Other longer-dated bitcoin futures contracts are also available, but are being ignored - just seven have been traded so far. I guess that betting where bitcoin\u2019s price in June 2018 is too risky even for seasoned traders... Bitcoin is creeping higher again, as early bird traders head to their desks in America. The spot price has jumped back over $19,000, erasing this morning\u2019s small dip as CME\u2019s futures trading got under way. Swissquote Bank, an online bank based in Switzerland, has a more positive view of bitcoin than UBS. It has been letting customers buy bitcoin since July, and today it added four other digital currencies - Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin and Ripple Analyst Yann Quelenn argues that bitcoin\u2019s scarcity (there can only ever be 21 million coins, with 16m discovered so far) will help push its price higher. Quelenn says: Who would have thought at the start of 2017 that Bitcoin would increase 20-fold? That was simply unpredictable. The introduction of futures trading has driven up prices. Nonetheless, it is also artificially increasing supply and weighing on prices. In the short-run, Bitcoin is likely to reach US$ 25,000. A correction is due at some point, but within the next few years it should easily reach US$ 100,000. By the way: Bitcoin is far from perfect, with high transaction fees and low scalability. And it is expensive, but it is even more scarce. Newsflash: British manufacturers are ending 2017 on a high, with the strongest order books in 30 years. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly healthcheck on UK factories, which found that exports and total output are both strong. The survey found that: 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +17% (joint highest with last month and August 1988) 28% of firms said their export order books were above normal, and 12% said they were below normal, giving a balance of +16% well above the long-run average of -18% 42% of businesses said the volume of output over the past three months was up, and 11% said it was down, giving a rounded balance of +30% above the long-run average of +4% The slump in the pound after last year\u2019s Brexit vote should have made UK exports more competitive. But...it also means that imported raw materials are more expensive. That is likely to translate into higher prices in the shops in the months ahead. Correction corner: I daftly called UBS a German bank earlier. It\u2019s Swiss, of course (the name dates back to Union Bank of Switzerland) Thanks to the readers who kindly flagged it up. Update: Bitcoin is still hovering around the $18,800 mark, having dropped back from nearly $20,000 overnight. The future price of Bitcoin is also quite stable on CME\u2019s platform. Just over 650 contracts for bitcoin\u2019s value in January 2018 have now been traded since last night. Right now, that contract is priced at $19,330, down from the opening price of $19,500. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says the introduction of futures contracts is having a slight negative impact on the bitcoin price. This negative impact from CME futures on Bitcoin is likely temporary, just like it was with the launch of CBOE futures last week. Until the bulk of the volume of trading is done through futures, spot prices should dictate the futures price, not vice versa. Bitcoin is a rubbish investment, literally! An email just popped into my inbox, announcing that you can use digital currencies to pay to have your company\u2019s waste and recycling hauled away. York-based BusinessWaste.co.uk will now accept bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum - along with dusty old cash and credit cards. They insist it isn\u2019t a publicity stunt (perish the very thought!), but a natural response to customer demand... Business Waste spokesperson Mark Hall argues: \u201cIndividuals and companies are trading in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies all over the world. So of course we\u2019re going to accept it from our customers.\u201d Here\u2019s some Twitter reaction: Dutch Bank ING shares some of Axel Weber\u2019s concerns over bitcoin. In a new research note, ING argue that the digital currency will eventually return to being a \u201cniche product for a select group of enthusiasts\u201d, rather than a revolutionary new currency that reshapes the financial system. Why? They argue that there are several impediments build into bitcoin, which will prevent it becoming the peer-to-peer electronic cash system envisioned by creator Satoshi Nakamoto. For example: Regulation: Its decentralised nature makes it difficult to regulate. Governments and regulators may never come to like decentralised financial networks at all. A negative event, such as a price crash followed by public outcry, could trigger a regulatory crackdown. Intermediaries: Working without intermediaries is cherished by a core group of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The mass audience however dislikes having no rights, no recourse, no guarantees, no legal coverage, nothing. They just want secure, reliable and hassle-free access to their money, and a help desk to call when they lose their password. Scalability: The Bitcoin network is currently clogged and the current level of transaction fees (average $8 in November) makes it very unattractive for small payments. Volatility: while the value of \u201cordinary\u201d money is managed by the central bank, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is fixed and its value depends greatly on demand. This makes it inherently volatile. Energy use: in the case of Bitcoin, the price of taking out intermediaries is very high electricity consumption. Governance: Blockchain is great at rule enforcement, but does not provide at all for rule-setting. This lack of governance makes implementing innovations slow and painful. Moreover, power may get concentrated in the hands of a few (miners, in the case of Bitcoin). The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: France\u2019s finance minister, Brune Le Maire, has also waded into the bitcoin debate. He wants the G20 group of leading advanced economies to debate the whole issue of digital currencies next speing. Speaking on French news channel LCI, Le Maire says: \u201cI am going to propose to the next G20 president, Argentina, that at the G20 summit in April we have a discussion all together on the question of bitcoin.\u201d Le Maire told French news channel LCI. \u201cThere is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how (...) with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin.\u201d But..... can the G20 really do much about bitcoin? They can certainly try to clamp down on criminals who use anonymous decentralised currencies to launder money. But beyond that, it gets tricky. Bitcoin isn\u2019t an official currency, so it doesn\u2019t fall under the control of a central bank. So should it be regulated as a security - a financial asset? Possibly. Back in July, America\u2019s Security and Exchange Commission ruled that Initial Coin Offerings \u2013 where a new digital currency is launched and sold to investors \u2013 meet some of the criteria. That opens up to prospect of ICOs being scrutinised by regulators. But even that wouldn\u2019t extend to interfering with day-to-day prices. The FT have published a good take on the battle between the two rival Chicago-based financial exchanges to offer bitcoin derivatives. Here\u2019s a flavour: The bitcoin futures race began in earnest on Sunday as exchange operator CME Group challenged another Chicago exchange that had launched the first digital-currency futures a week before. In the first three hours of trading, nearly $50m in bitcoin futures changed hands on CME, the world\u2019s biggest exchange operator by market value. Rival Cboe Global Markets had hosted $30m in bitcoin futures trading over the same time. The two Chicago-based exchanges created competing bitcoin futures contracts as prices flew higher and professional investors sought exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange. Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME. Investors will closely watch how CME\u2019s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world\u2019s most-liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities. Futures listings tend to be a winner-takes-all business. More here: Duelling bitcoin futures go head-to-head as CME launches contract The launch of bitcoin futures contracts has two significant implications. Firstly, it makes it easier for institutional investors to take a position in bitcoin. They don\u2019t have to actually buy and sell digital currencies, let alone mine them by cracking complicated maths problems. Instead, they just take a position and profit, or lose money, when the contract expires, based on CME\u2019s index of bitcoin prices across several exchanges. Secondly, it allows people to bet against bitcoin. Until now, there hasn\u2019t really been any way of wagering that digital currencies are overpriced. Derivatives contracts allow a trader to bet that bitcoin will be worth less than the current price in, say, mid-January (or whenever a particular futures contract expires). That should mean that digital currencies find their \u2018true\u2019 value, stripping out some of the recent volatility. That\u2019s the theory, anyway. It may not go as smoothy in practice, as Lee Wild of interactive investor explains: Introducing futures contracts in the US was meant to give short-sellers access to the market and improve liquidity, but availability is still fairly restricted. The introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the weekend may help, but it will take time. Until it becomes easier to sell short, buying dries up, or there are tech issues or a major hack, bitcoin will keep passing milestones with alarming regularity. Right now, there\u2019s a long queue of investors, both amateur and professional, still waiting for a ride. This bubble is not bursting yet.\u201d CNN Money reckons the bitcoin bandwagon \u201cjust keeps rolling on\u201d, with the launch of futures trading on CME. They say: The involvement of top financial institutions in the bitcoin market underscores its growing mainstream acceptance even as government officials, business leaders and economists continue to warn people against investing in it. The CME launch \u201cadds considerable legitimacy\u201d to bitcoin trading, said Shane Chanel, an adviser at Australian investment services firm ASR Wealth Advisers. Swiss bank UBS has warned anyone keen to invest in bitcoin that they risk losing their money. UBS chairman Axel Weber fears that the digital currency\u2019s recent gains are unsustainable, and says investors and speculators should keep away. Speaking to Swiss newspaper NZZ, he says: \u201cWe as a bank have consciously warned against this product because we do not assess it to be valuable or sustainable.\u201d Weber argues that financial regulators should now step in, given the surge of interest in bitcoin recently. Otherwise, he fears smaller investors could be wiped out by bitcoin\u2019s volatility. As Weber puts it: \u201cAs soon as small investors invest, the regulators are required.... I would welcome an discussion with regulators about cryptocurrencies. There are already signs that governments are taking more interest in bitcoin, with European officials concerned that it is being used for moneylaundering. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The future of finance, or an unsustainable speculative bubble that will cost investors their shirts? The jury is still out on Bitcoin. What we do know, though, is that the cryptocurrency has crossed another barrier -- the world\u2019s biggest exchange is now offering bitcoin futures. From today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is allowing investors to wager whether they think bitcoin will rise or fall in value in the months ahead (after seeing it surge around 2,000% this year). CME is the second exchange to offer bitcoin futures \u2013 rival Cboe stole a march last week \u2013 and this move shows how digital currencies have pushed their way into the mainstream. The launch has gone fairly smoothly so far. The \u2018spot price\u2019 of bitcoin initially surged to almost $20,000, a new record, before dipping back towards $18,800 by 8am London time. Such volatility shows why sceptics argue that bitcoin is hardly a reliable store of value, mind you. Over on CME, the January 2018 futures price has actually dropped a little in the first few hours of trading. It was priced at $19,500, but is now changing hands at $19,370. That suggests that investors expect bitcoin to broadly hold its value over the next month. Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, told Reuters that many traders are approaching bitcoin cautiously: \u201cWe saw a nice open on light volume, but pretty uneventful so far,\u201d \u201cThis is a brand-new asset class and I think perhaps a lot of investors want to sit back and see how this plays out before dipping their toes in this market.\u201d Also coming up today... Stock markets are expected to rise, as investors salivate over the prospect of US tax reforms being signed off by Donald Trump by the end of this week. New eurozone inflation figures are due this morning, and likely to show prices rose by just 1.5% in the last 12 months. In the UK, the CBI publishes its latest industrial trends survey, showing how British factories fared last month.

It is therefore impossible to say whether the current Bitcoin market price is \u201ctoo high\u201d for a niche asset.</p> <p>Then again, we join the crowd of analysts observing typical bubble characteristics: the idea of an asset that is new, revolutionary, almost magic \u2013 hard to understand, but let\u2019s invest anyway because it will become huge.

But beyond that, it gets tricky. Bitcoin isn\u2019t an official currency, so it doesn\u2019t fall under the control of a central bank.</p> <p>So should it be regulated as a security - a financial asset? Possibly. Back in July, America\u2019s Security and Exchange Commission ruled that <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/us-sec-rules-digital-token-sales-securities-dao-violated-law-2017-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">Initial Coin Offerings \u2013 where a new digital currency is launched and sold to investors \u2013 meet some of the criteria</a>.

The two Chicago-based exchanges created competing bitcoin futures contracts as prices flew higher and professional investors sought exposure inside the walls of a regulated exchange.</p> <p>Success in launching futures contracts could confer legitimacy to bitcoin and add a revenue stream for Cboe and CME.</p> <p>Investors will closely watch how CME\u2019s contract fares because the more than 100-year-old exchange runs several of the world\u2019s most-liquid futures markets in interest rates, currencies, equity indices and commodities.

They don\u2019t have to actually buy and sell digital currencies, let alone mine them by cracking complicated maths problems. <br></p> <p>Instead, they just take a position and profit, or lose money, when the contract expires, based on CME\u2019s index of bitcoin prices across several exchanges.</p> <p><strong>Secondly</strong>, it allows people to bet against bitcoin. Until now, there hasn\u2019t really been any way of wagering that digital currencies are overpriced. Derivatives contracts allow a trader to bet that bitcoin will be worth less than the current price in, say, mid-January (or whenever a particular futures contract expires).</p> <p>That should mean that digital currencies find their \u2018true\u2019 value, stripping out some of the recent volatility.</p> <p>That\u2019s the theory, anyway. </p> <p>It may not go as smoothy in practice, as <strong>Lee Wild of interactive investor</strong> explains<strong>:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Introducing futures contracts in the US was meant to give short-sellers access to the market and improve liquidity, but availability is still fairly restricted. The introduction of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange over the weekend may help, but it will take time.</p> <p>Until it becomes easier to sell short, buying dries up, or there are tech issues or a major hack, bitcoin will keep passing milestones with alarming regularity. Right now, there\u2019s a long queue of investors, both amateur and professional, still waiting for a ride.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers have ended 2017 on a high note, with output surging to meet the strongest order books in almost three decades. The latest snapshot of industry from the CBI found the strong growth recorded in November continued in December but is expected to abate in the early months of 2018. In a survey of 371 manufacturers, 28% said order books were above normal while 11% said they were below normal. The balance of + 17 points was the joint highest on record and well above the long-term average of - 14 points. The employers\u2019 organisation said order books were particularly buoyant for the motor vehicles and transport equipment, and mechanical engineering sectors. The weak pound was helping to swell export order books, even though they were slightly softer than in November, the CBI said. Output rose for 42% of the firms questioned during late November and early December while 11% said production was lower. The rounded balance of +30 points was above the long-term average of +4 points. Manufacturers also reported inflationary pressure, with output prices expected to rise over the next three months at their fastest pace since June. The survey also reported that stocks of finished goods were below normal \u2013 a sign that some companies are meeting orders by running down inventories. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist of Pantheon Macro, said it was only the 11th time in the 42-year history of the CBI survey that more manufacturers said stock levels were inadequate than adequate. \u201cAll this suggests that manufacturers are running at full capacity and can\u2019t easily ramp up production in the near-term to meet higher demand,\u201d he added. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, said: \u201cAs we head towards the end of 2017, UK manufacturers\u2019 total order books remain at a near-30-year high, with export order books remaining at their strongest since the mid-1990s. \u201cWhile the lower level of sterling continues to support exporters, cost pressures remain intense.

      "bodyText": "A crackdown by the European regulator on high-risk online bets has sent shares in spread-betting firms plummeting. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said late on Friday it was considering a ban on the marketing, distribution or sale to retail clients of binary options, amid fears they are too risky for amateur speculators. Binary options allow speculators to bet on whether the price of financial indices such as a share index, commodity (like gold) or currency will rise or fall over a given period of time, often varying between 30 seconds and five minutes. ESMA is also considering imposing restrictions on the marketing, distribution and sale of contracts for difference (CFDs) to retail clients. Measures include imposing leverage restrictions, a guaranteed limit on client losses, restricting trading incentives such as bonus offers, and issuing standardised risk warnings. Shares in London-listed spread-betting firms plunged on the news. Plus500 fell more than 17%; CMC Markets was down nearly 14% in early trading and IG Group lost more than 12%. The European regulator said it had been concerned about the provision of speculative products such as CFDs, including rolling-spot foreign exchange products and binary options, to retail clients \u201cfor a considerable period of time\u201d. Some national authorities have already cracked down on the sector, but ESMA said it \u201cremains concerned that the risks to investor protection are not sufficiently controlled or reduced\u201d. The Financial Conduction Authority, Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, recently announced it would regulate binary options for the first time from January. It warned that the majority of consumers lose money on binary options. There have been been a reported 2,605 victims who lost \u00a359.4m on binary options scams since 2012. The FCA will take over the regulation of binary options from the Gambling Commission from 3 January. The FCA said it \u201csupports ESMA in its consideration of potential EU-wide product intervention\u201d. It added: \u201cOur domestic policy work on permanent product intervention measures applicable to firms offering CFDs and binary options to retail clients is ongoing. Any permanent FCA policy measures would take into account any prospective ESMA measures.\u201d ESMA will conduct a brief public consultation in January. Any measures would apply for three months but could then be renewed. Plus500 welcomed the \u201cstrong regulatory framework that this will bring to the industry\u201d. It said it had never offered binary options and removed its bonus schemes for the vast majority of its operations in January. IG said it \u201cseeks to only accept clients who understand the risks involved with its products and how they operate\u201d. The firm said the measures would not have a significant financial impact on its business in the current financial year, but that it was hard to assess the longer-term impact. It stopped offering its Sprint binary product to new retail clients in January, and revenue from binaries traded in the UK and EU was less than 5% of the company\u2019s revenues in the first half. IG welcomed most of the measures, but said the leverage restrictions under review were \u201cdisproportionate and go beyond what is needed to protect consumers from poor outcomes associated with excessive leverage\u201d. It warned that this could push punters to trade CFDs with unregulated firms based outside the EU. Rival CMC said: \u201cFair client outcomes have always been a focus, with margin close-out and standardised risk warnings already in place throughout the group.\u201d It said the ban on binary products would not have a material impact on its business, as they only generated \u00a32.1m of revenues in the first half of 2018: \u201cProposed margin changes are likely to have an impact on how clients trade, although at this stage it is not possible to quantify the impact.\u201d The firm focuses on wealthier clients and says it has one of the highest revenue per client in the industry.",

    "webTitle": "Global coal consumption forecast to slow", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Every major country in the world except India reduced its consumption of coal last year, with demand for the dirty fuel forecast to stagnate for the next half decade, according to official forecasts. The International Energy Agency said 5.3bn tonnes of coal equivalent were burnt in 2016, down 1.9% on the year before and 4.2% on 2014, the fastest decline since 1990-1992, when the global economy was in recession. Global consumption of coal will stagnate over the next half decade, the IEA forecasts, confirming the last two years\u2019 record falls for the fossil fuel were not a blip. China, the US and Europe drove the continued drop-off in demand last year, offset only partly by India, one of a few Asian countries where the burning of coal is expected to grow until 2022. \u201cAlthough the IEA is very optimistic about the development of renewables and the future role of gas, in some countries coal will also provide a significant share of the electricity needs,\u201d said Keisuke Sadamori, the agency\u2019s director of energy markets and security. However, he added: \u201cOverall, what we see is a stagnation of coal demand over a decade.\u201d While solar is making huge strides in India, rapid GDP growth of 7.8% a year and prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal of bringing power to the 240 million Indians without electricity mean coal use will grow too. Coal-fired power generation in India is expected to increase by 4% a year until 2022. Greenpeace argued that the IEA was being too bearish about the growth of renewables in India, and skewing the picture for coal\u2019s prospects. Worldwide, the IEA said it expects coal\u2019s share of the energy mix to shrink slightly, from 27% last year to 26% in 2022. The UK had probably made the quickest transition away from coal of any country so far, Sadamori said. Coal went from 40% of the power mix in 2012 to less than 10% last year, and in the first half of this year provided just 2%. Sadamori said that declining electricity demand, an ageing coal fleet, EU pollution directives, renewables incentives and the government\u2019s carbon tax had created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d to force the closure of British coal power stations. There are eight coal power stations left in the UK, and ministers have promised to phase the fuel out entirely by 2025. The IEA argued that, contrary to what some experts have said, there would be no revival for coal in the UK if gas prices go up, because power imported from Europe would be more competitive. In the US, where gas last year displaced coal as the top source of power for the first time, Donald Trump\u2019s election and pro-coal measures were seen as providing some optimism for the sector. However, US coal demand is expected to continue declining over the next five years, albeit at a slower rate than in recent years. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Price cutting by homeowners desperate to shift their property in a slowing market has reached the highest levels in six years, according to an analysis by website Zoopla. Just over 35% of the homes marketed on the site have marked down their price in the hope of achieving a sale, with the biggest discounts in the London property market. The 35% figure compares with 29% just before the EU referendum in 2016, although it is below the levels recorded in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Sellers in Richmond and Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, both relatively prosperous areas, are among those to have made the deepest reductions in sale prices. Zoopla put the average mark-down by sellers in Kingston at \u00a384,244. It added that around half of all the properties for sale in Kingston and other nearby locations such as Mitcham and Camberley in Surrey have been reduced since their first listing, indicating that sellers are having to significantly readjust their hopes in the light of the Brexit vote. Lawrence Hall, at Zoopla, said it was good news for first-time buyers trying to get on the property ladder. \u201cA slight rise in levels of discounting is to be expected at this time of year when house-hunters are likely to be delaying their property search until activity picks up in January,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThose on the look-out for a bargain should consider looking in Camberley or Kingston upon Thames in the south, or areas of the north-east \u2013 home to some of Britain\u2019s biggest discounts.\u201d The average asking price reduction across the country currently stands at \u00a325,562, according to Zoopla. The property website said towns in Scotland and northern England have proved more resilient to discounts. About 16% of homes in Edinburgh have been reduced in price, followed by 19% in Salford, 22% in Glasgow, and 25% in Manchester - all below the national average. In London, 39% of property listings have recorded a price reduction, up from 37% in July. Economists predict that a number of factors will weigh on house price growth in 2018, including falling real wages and weak consumer confidence as Britain\u2019s future outside the EU remains uncertain. \u201cWe see house prices rising a modest 2-3% in 2018,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group, the EY Item Club. \u201cThe fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging over the coming months with consumers\u2019 purchasing power continuing to be squeezed by inflation running higher than earnings growth. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and a limited willingness to engage in major transactions.\u201d Archer added that the Bank of England\u2019s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade could be another factor to dampen the housing market in the months ahead. \u201cWhile the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% [to 0.5%] and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, the fact that it was the first rise since 2007 could have a significant effect on housing market psychology,\u201d he said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

From the start of 2018, banks will be required to scrutinise the immigration status of their 76 million current account customers against a government database of individuals without leave to remain in the UK. The checks must be conducted every quarter starting in January and put the onus on the financial providers to inform the Home Office of any matches. The process will be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, which has powers to fine any firms that fail to comply with rules or issue public sanctions. The Home Office will tell the banks whether they need to close the accounts or if a freezing order will be sought in the courts. When the government first revealed the new duties for banks, immigration welfare campaigners warned that the Home Office\u2019s recent record meant it could not be trusted to implement this new system without errors.

      "bodyText": "The next generation of British authors could struggle to land a book deal after Brexit, according to the publisher who launched Harry Potter writer JK Rowling\u2019s career. The UK\u2019s close ties with Europe meant British publishers enjoyed a huge financial benefit from exploiting the exclusive English-language rights to books sold across the continent. However, US publishing companies such as Simon &amp; Schuster believe Brexit will open the door to competition and break the cosy historical deals enjoyed by British publishers. Under such a scenario, British publishers will be forced to focus on keeping their star writers happy, potentially offering them more lucrative deals to keep European rights. As a result, financially pressured British publishers are likely to become more risk-averse in signing and promoting new and aspiring authors. \u201cQuite often now, a British publisher of a work will have exclusive rights in Europe \u2013 because Britain is part of Europe,\u201d said Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury, the publisher of the Harry Potter books. \u201cWhen Britain isn\u2019t part of Europe, it is possible that it will become more of a shared market with American publishers, an \u2018open market\u2019 as it is called. There is a potential issue where more American editions of books could come into the continent than under current arrangements.\u201d Europe is the biggest export region globally for UK-published books, accounting for more than a third of the almost \u00a31.2bn annual sales of English-language print titles. A senior publishing industry figure said that if a \u201creally brutal battle\u201d between UK and US publishers was to emerge over European book deals there would be major financial implications for British publishers. \u201cThere are some American publishers who feel that Brexit provides an opportunity to aggressively assert themselves into Europe in a way they haven\u2019t been able to previously,\u201d said the senior industry executive. \u201cFor very big authors, you could argue there will be more competition for their signatures, they may earn more money post-Brexit. A really brutal battle and price war between UK and US publishers would see a focus on big names to maintain and drive profits. But everyone further down the chain from star author status is likely to be worse off.\u201d Each year, 200,000 books are published in the UK, the highest number in the world. The senior executive said that budding authors would not only find it harder to get their books into print; if they did get offered deals, they were likely to be asked to sign away more rights, on less lucrative terms, earlier in their careers as publishers seek to make their investments pay off. \u201cUK publishers are likely to take less risks on new incoming authors, including paying them less and forcing them to sign away global rights sooner than they would normally, to take a bigger share of earnings,\u201d said the executive. \u201cAs a new incoming author, it would be hard to resist those sorts of demands. For new and smaller authors, it is likely to be a lot tougher.\u201d Book publishing is one of the UK\u2019s biggest success stories: Britain is the biggest exporter of books in the world with a 17% share by value, ahead of the US (15%) and Germany (10%). \u201cThe UK is the number one exporter of books anywhere in the world and it is incredibly important that we don\u2019t do anything that undermines that,\u201d said Stephen Lotinga, the chief executive of the Publishers Association. \u201cWe have been urging the government to secure a deal with the European Union which ensures we continue to have the fullest possible access to our largest single market so that one of the most successful creative industries the UK has can continue to thrive.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "A sudden power outage brought the world\u2019s busiest airport to a standstill on Sunday, grounding more than 1,000 flights in the US just days before the start of the Christmas travel rush. Passengers at Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta were left in the dark when the lights suddenly went out at about 1pm. All outgoing flights were halted, and arriving planes were held at point of departure. International flights were being diverted, officials said. The airport said a fire had caused \u201cextensive damage\u201d to the complex\u2019s electrical systems. Fire crews doused the flames and repair crews from Georgia Power managed to restore power to all areas after about 11 hours but the incident is expected to wreak havoc on the holiday travel plans of thousands. The cause of the outage is unknown and Georgia Power said such outages were \u201cvery rare\u201d . Delta, with its biggest hub operation in Atlanta, was the airline hardest hit. By evening, it had already cancelled 900 Sunday flights and another 300 on Monday, nearly all of them in Atlanta, according to tracking service FlightAware.com. Robert Mann, an aviation consultant and former American Airlines executive, said it would probably be Tuesday before Delta\u2019s operations in Atlanta returned to normal, and for passengers \u201cit could be most of the week\u201d because there weren\u2019t many open seats on other flights in the last week before Christmas. \u201cTomorrow is going to be a long and difficult day for everybody,\u201d Mann said. When flights at Atlanta were grounded for most of one day in April, it took Delta five days and about 4,000 cancelled flights before it fully recovered. At Southwest Airlines, about 70 Atlanta departures out of 120 scheduled for Sunday were cancelled, an airline spokesman said in an email. United Airlines and JetBlue Airways were among carriers reporting delays or cancellations. Passengers stranded and unable to fly were being taken to the Georgia International Convention Centre for the night. Delta passenger Emilia Duca, 32, was on her way to Wisconsin from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, when she got stuck in Atlanta. She said police made passengers who were in the baggage-claim area move to a higher floor. She said restaurants and shops were closed. \u201cA lot of people are arriving, and no one is going out. No one is saying anything official. We are stuck here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d Jeff Smith, 46, of Pittsburgh, was stuck in a plane on the asphalt for three hours after it landed. \u201cThis is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had at an airport,\u201d he said. Sara Melillo was travelling to Pittsburgh from Kenya, where she lives with her husband, Greg Presto, to spend Christmas with his family. The couple were stuck on the asphalt for six hours. They had made stops in Nairobi and Amsterdam and landed shortly after the lights went out in Atlanta. She said the pilot didn\u2019t have a lot of information for the travellers but the plane had airconditioning and attendants offered water and juice a few times. She described the Delta terminal as \u201cbig chaos\u201d with not enough customer service for the hundreds of people trying to find a flight or a place to sleep for the night. With her new boarding pass handwritten and her bags still stuck on a plane, Melillo was hopeful that she and her husband would be able to get a flight in the morning to Pittsburgh, she said as she waited for a lift to a hotel. Mozell Smith, 68, of Atlanta arrived at the airport hours after the electricity went off. He was headed to Las Vegas with a sister and a friend. \u201cThis is terrible. I wish someone would\u2019ve given us a heads-up before we got to the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish there would have been better communication.\u201d American Airlines reported only a handful of diversions and cancellations because the carrier does not use Atlanta as a hub, airline spokeswoman Alexis Aran Coello. Hartsfield-Jackson, which serves 104 million passengers a year, is the world\u2019s busiest airport, a distinction it has held since 1998. The airport serves an average of 275,000 passengers daily, according to its website. Nearly 2,500 planes arrive and depart each day.",
