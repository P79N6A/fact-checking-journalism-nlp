It's a long way from a private jet,\" Michael Woodford shouts out as he charges across five lanes of traffic and into the underground at Euston Square.</p> <p>In a previous life as the boss of one of Japan's biggest companies, Woodford was used to being served champagne at 33,000ft as a stewardess put slippers on his feet. But that was a very different life again from the one Woodford was born into, in a \"sink estate in Liverpool\".</p> <p>As well as having a difficult upbringing in a \"shoebox\"-sized home, Woodford was bullied for being both Jewish and Chinese \u2013 he is neither, but he went to the King David Jewish school and has a slightly oriental appearance from Tamil ancestry.</p> <p>\"To get home you had to walk past the two big rough comprehensives, and they'd see my school blazer and yellow and black tie and they'd say, 'Are you a yid, lad?'</p> <p>\"I would say, 'No, I'm a gentile,' but they couldn't understand that, which would always irritate them and I'd get pushed around. Another day I'd come back and they'd say, 'Are you a chink, lad?'. I'd say, 'No I'm English,' and they'd say, 'Ah, two number 16s.' They thought they were hilarious.\"</p> <p>Despite the bullying, Woodford, 52, is still in touch with many friends from his formative years in Liverpool and Southend. But he says you will never catch him boasting about the private jet that would whisk him from the modest Southend home he has lived in for 30 years to Paris for the overnight first-class flight to Tokyo, or his \u00a32.75m to \u00a33m a year salary. \"My friends aren't businessmen, they're artists and teachers, that sort of thing,\" he says. \"If I went on about things like that, they would think I was a tosser.\"</p> <p>While he always tried to stay grounded as he climbed the corporate ladder at Olympus over three decades, it's tough, he says, to break ties with the luxury lifestyle. \"I don't like travelling economy on long-haul flights. All that pampering over the years has obviously got to me \u2013 so it's always business class,\" he says as he relaxes into the leather seats of the first-class carriage from Paddington to Oxford for the latest in a series of public speaking engagements.</p> <p>Woodford joined Olympus's British subsidiary Keymed as a salesman in 1980 and rose to become managing director of the division before he was 30, then went on to become head of Olympus in Europe before being called to the top job in Japan. \"But, you know, I don't live on a yacht or do silly things.\"</p> <p>It's not as if he can't afford to be a little silly. Earlier this year he collected a \u00a310m settlement over his dismissal for blowing the whistle on a \u00a31bn fraud scandal at the endoscope and digital camera company.</p> <p>\"It must make you feel sick, interviewing people earning all this money,\" he says. \"I'm quite leftwing, you know. I could be a communist, if that worked any better than capitalism.\"</p> <p>Some of his beliefs would go down well with Marx and Lenin. His kids won't be getting any of the \u00a310m. \"If I'm struck down now, they won't get a penny,\" he says. \"Rather than being posh little rich kids, they're going to go out there and earn it on their own.\" Edward, 19, and Isabel, 17, were sent to state grammar schools until he left for Tokyo, when Isabel was sent to a private boarding school \u2013 \"she would have had to be sedated and handcuffed to go [to Tokyo]\" \u2013 where, Woodford says, she's educating her classmates.</p> <p>\"Isabel told me the other day that some of her friends at school were saying taxation is wrong \u2013 not the level of taxation [but the fact that it exists]. She told them that that's what pays for the hospitals and the schools for other kids who can't afford to go to nice little rich schools.\"</p> <p>His money will go to charity, predominantly those campaigning for human rights, such as Clive Stafford-Smith's Reprieve, and road safety foundations.</p> <p>Noting the irony that he had just run across one of London's busiest junctions, he says, \"But we looked both ways, right? And we were late. Being late in Japan is just about the rudest thing you can do. The contents of a meeting [in Japan] don't matter as long as you arrive on time.\"</p> <p>Woodford says Japan's obsession with politeness and social niceties is partly to blame for the country's fall from the top of the global power tree and the fraud that almost destroyed the 93-year-old Japanese electronics company.</p> <p>\"There is a disaster in Japan because of these social characteristics \u2013 the deference, not being able to question people in authority,\" he says. It was this attitude, he continues, that almost allowed Olympus's previous bosses to cover up more than \u00a31bn of fraud.</p> <p>He first got wind of the claims just weeks after taking over as chief executive \u2013 the first foreigner, or <em>gaijin</em>, to run the company, and only the fourth at any major Japanese company \u2013 when a friend emailed him a translation of \"amazingly detailed\" claims published in Facta, a local magazine with a campaigning remit similar to Private Eye.</p> <p>\"When I got to the office I expected everyone to be talking about it. But no one mentioned it.\" By lunchtime he summoned two of his most trusted colleagues and ask them if they had read it. They had, but said that Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, Olympus's previous CEO and then chairman, had \"told them not to tell me\". Eventually Woodford demanded a meeting with Kikukawa and Hisashi Mori, then deputy president and \"Kikukawa's permanent sidekick\".</p> <p>The table for the lunchtime meeting was set out with the \"most wonderful selection of sushi, but in front of my place was a tuna sandwich\", Woodford, a committed sushi fan, told students at Sa\u00efd business school in Oxford later that evening. \"It wasn't just any tuna sandwich \u2013 it was a tuna sandwich that would have made British Rail in 1981 proud. It was that manky. The tuna sandwich was to tell me my place in life.</p> <p>\"That's when it really blew up, and the shit hit the fan,\" he said, before pausing hand over mouth in mock horror that he might have committed another terrible faux pas on top of arriving half an hour late for his own talk. \"Can you say that at Oxford?\"</p> <p>Although Woodford tried to embarrass Mori into talking to him by following him into the urinals and shouting at him eyeball to eyeball, Mori and Kikukawa refused to explain why Olympus had spent almost \u00a31bn buying three \"Mickey Mouse\" companies and paid $687m for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) advice on the deal. \"It was the largest payment ever made for M&amp;A advice in the history of capitalism by a factor of three,\" Woodford says. Forensic accountants traced the money to London, from where it \"went to the Cayman Islands and disappeared\".</p> <p>When the next edition of Facta was published, it claimed the fraud was linked to \"antisocial forces\" \u2013 code for the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. \"I was scared. Even telling you now I can feel myself shaking and feel my hands going cold, soon my feet will go cold too,\" he says. \"I started to think what was going to happen to me. My fate could have been, 'Michael has been under a lot of stress, he's been drinking and taking sleeping pills. He jumped off the top of a building.' That's what happens in Japan.\"</p> <p>At home, his wife, Nuncy, (\"she's Spanish, Latin-tempered and very bossy\") was having constant nightmares. And it was about to get worse. Woodford called a meeting of the whole Olympus board to discuss the crisis, but Kikukawa had changed the agenda. \"This meeting is to vote on the dismissal of Michael Woodford as CEO,\" Woodford heard via simultaneous translation in his headset. \"As he said the O, all the directors put their arms up. They couldn't have put them up higher.\"</p> <p>The next word was from Kikukawa. \"'Mr Woodford cannot speak on this matter because he has a conflict of interest.' It was an eight-minute corporate execution.\"</p> <p>He was forced to give up his apartment and take the bus to the airport, but Woodford wouldn't acquiesce to Mori's demands to hand over his iPhone. \"I got in his face. 'Are you going to take it off me? My wife will be phoning, she'll be worried,'\" he says. \"Mr Mori didn't know I'd grown up in Liverpool.\"</p> <p>Within hours he had given all the details to the press and the police. Kikukawa and Mori eventually resigned, but even then the rest of the board and institutional shareholders failed to support his bid to be reinstated as CEO.</p> <p>\"It is like a John Grisham novel.

It was an eight-minute corporate execution.\" He was forced to give up his apartment and take the bus to the airport, but Woodford wouldn't acquiesce to Mori's demands to hand over his iPhone. \"I got in his face. 'Are you going to take it off me? My wife will be phoning, she'll be worried,'\" he says. \"Mr Mori didn't know I'd grown up in Liverpool.\" Within hours he had given all the details to the press and the police. Kikukawa and Mori eventually resigned, but even then the rest of the board and institutional shareholders failed to support his bid to be reinstated as CEO. \"It is like a John Grisham novel. But it's true.\" Exposure: Inside the Olympus Scandal \u2013 How I Went from CEO to Whistleblower (Portfolio Penguin) is published on 29 November.

    "webTitle": "FTSE 100 has best week for nearly a year but Tesco fails to inspire investors", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco, which is attempting to revive its UK business after a profit warning earlier this year, must have hoped for a boost after an investor trip earlier this week designed to show off its latest innovations. The visit took in an automated warehouse in Enfield, built to fulfil online orders, and a couple of revamped stores in Hertfordshire and London. But while analysts were impressed enough with what they saw, they repeated their caution on Tesco's prospects, given the difficult consumer climate in the UK and continuing doubts about its stuggling US business Fresh &amp; Easy. Tesco, which issues a third quarter trading update on 5 December, edged up 0.65p to 318p, exactly the same level as before Tuesday's visit. Tesco's investment in its web business could put further pressure on rival Ocado. But Ocado received some good news this week, as it successfully raised \u00a336m and extended its bank facilities, giving it some breathing space. Its shares rose 0.3p to 74.8p. Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon kept his sell rating on Ocado, despite admitting it now had the funds to survive for some time: Ocado is still operating an inefficient model, growing below City expectations and its multichannel competitors. Going forward, much will depend upon February's launch of [its second warehouse]. That said, the monkey is off their back and management now has considerable breathing space. Elsewhere among the retailers, Dixons Retail was in focus as analysts said it should benefit from the demise of rival Comet. Morgan Stanley said: We believe that [Dixons' subsidiary] Currys will gain around 40% of Comet's lost sales, driving 12% UK like for like growth next year. Dixons' balance sheet is stronger than it has been for several years and the group is rapidly becoming very cash generative. Unlike HMV, the products that Dixons sells are not in structural decline and there are still more than 1,000 independents in the UK electricals market from whom to take share. Dixons closed 0.21p higher at 26.01p, while Kingfisher climbed 3.7p to 280.7p as UBS issued a buy note ahead of the DIY group's latest update on Thursday. Overall, leading shares ended the week on a positive note, with the FTSE 100 closing 28.11 points higher at 5819.14, the first time it has risen five days in a row since early August and its best weekly rise for almost a year. Sentiment was helped by a strong performance from Wall Street, which was closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving but seemed to make up for lost time in a curtailed Friday trading session with an increase of nearly 1.5% increase. Over the week the FTSE 100 has added around 215 points - or around \u00a354bn - despite a meeting of Greece's international lenders failing to resolve the country's debt crisis and the collapse of the summit on the EU budget. Investors took heart from some reasonable economic data from China, the US and Europe, including a positive German business confidence survey, and remained optimistic that Greece would receive the necessary funding at - yet another - meeting next week. The German confidence survey gave a lift to industrial groups including GKN, up 4p at 218.4p, and IMI, 17p better at \u00a310.17. Elsewhere the legacy of an $11bn UK acquisition came back to haunt American technology group Hewlett-Packard. The US computer and printer group said it was writing $8.8bn off the value of Autonomy, the Cambridge software business it bought last year at what was widely believed at the time to be an inflated price. HP said it had discovered \"serious accounting improprieties\" at the UK company and \"a wilful effort by Autonomy to mislead shareholders.\" It said a whistleblower had come forward after Mike Lynch, who co-founded Autonomy and sold the business to HP, left the US company in May. Lynch immediately denied the claims, which have been passed on to UK and US regulators. HP's shares are down around 10% following the revelation. Meanwhile video search business Blinkx, spun off from Autonomy in 2007, was caught in the fallout of the allegations. Its shares fell 11% to 67.75p as the news emerged on Tuesday before recovering some of its losses to close 3p higher at 70p. HP owns nearly 13% of Blinkx while Lynch holds a 6% stake, which could lead to continuing volatility in the shares. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said: We strongly believe that [the initial] reaction in Blinkx's share price was both illogical and excessive. The businesses \u2013 and revenue models \u2013 are very different and there is no suggestion of any accounting irregularities or improprieties at Blinkx. While HP does have a 12.6% holding in Blinkx following the Autonomy acquisition last year, we reiterate our view that HP has a number of financial stakes in technology and digital media businesses and has given no indication of its intention to dispose of its stake. It was a busy week for the mining sector, with shareholders and regulators finally approving the long-drawn out merger between Xstrata, up 6p at \u00a310.20, and Glencore, 2.15p better at 342.85p. But a controversial management retention scheme was thrown out by investors. Lonmin, where Xstrata has an 8% stake, cleared its own hurdle, as an $817m cash call to bolster its battered balance sheet was given the go-ahead on Monday. Its shares closed down 7.7p at 291.4p. Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation made another move to assuage investor worries about its corporate governance after various boardroom battles. Former banker Mehmet Dalman, who became chairman earlier this year promising better transparency, was given a number of executive functions, but the Kazakh mining group stopped short of making him executive chairman, as some had anticipated. The shares added 2p to 274.5p despite news that UBS had removed ENRC from its most preferred list \"as we expect no short term catalysts for the stock.\" SABMiller rose 33p to \u00a328.34 after a number of brokers - including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Societe Generale - raised their price targets following the brewing group's better than expected figures on Thursday. On the speculative front, BG rose 3.5p to 1076.5p on revived talk it was in the sights of a number of possible predators, including Petrobras. Finally Chemring, the defence company where Carlyle Group decided not to bid, climbed 2.5p to 231.7p on talk other private equity businesses might be interested.",

HP said it had discovered \"serious accounting improprieties\" at the UK company and \"a wilful effort by Autonomy to mislead shareholders.\" It said a whistleblower had come forward after Mike Lynch, who co-founded Autonomy and sold the business to HP, left the US company in May.</p> <p>Lynch immediately denied the claims, which have been passed on to UK and US regulators.</p> <p>HP's shares are down around 10% following the revelation. Meanwhile video search business <strong>Blinkx</strong>, spun off from Autonomy in 2007, was caught in the fallout of the allegations. Its shares fell 11% to 67.75p as the news emerged on Tuesday before recovering some of its losses to close 3p higher at 70p.</p> <p>HP owns nearly 13% of Blinkx while Lynch holds a 6% stake, which could lead to continuing volatility in the shares. Analysts at Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We strongly believe that [the initial] reaction in Blinkx's share price was both illogical and excessive. The businesses \u2013 and revenue models \u2013 are very different and there is no suggestion of any accounting irregularities or improprieties at Blinkx. While HP does have a 12.6% holding in Blinkx following the Autonomy acquisition last year, we reiterate our view that HP has a number of financial stakes in technology and digital media businesses and has given no indication of its intention to dispose of its stake. </p> </blockquote> <p>It was a busy week for the mining sector, with shareholders and regulators finally approving the long-drawn out merger between <strong>Xstrata</strong>, up 6p at \u00a310.20, and <strong>Glencore</strong>, 2.15p better at 342.85p. But a controversial management retention scheme was thrown out by investors.</p> <p><strong>Lonmin</strong>, where Xstrata has an 8% stake, cleared its own hurdle, as an $817m cash call to bolster its battered balance sheet was given the go-ahead on Monday. Its shares closed down 7.7p at 291.4p.</p> <p><strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> made another move to assuage investor worries about its corporate governance after various boardroom battles.</p> <p>Former banker Mehmet Dalman, who became chairman earlier this year promising better transparency, was given a number of executive functions, but the Kazakh mining group stopped short of making him executive chairman, as some had anticipated.</p> <p>The shares added 2p to 274.5p despite news that UBS had removed ENRC from its most preferred list \"as we expect no short term catalysts for the stock.\"</p> <p><strong>SABMiller</strong> rose 33p to \u00a328.34 after a number of brokers - including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Societe Generale - raised their price targets following the brewing group's better than expected figures on Thursday.</p> <p>On the speculative front, <strong>BG</strong> rose 3.5p to 1076.5p on revived talk it was in the sights of a number of possible predators, including Petrobras.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Chemring</strong>, the defence company where Carlyle Group decided not to bid, climbed 2.5p to 231.7p on talk other private equity businesses might be interested.</p>",

Here's a quick closing summary.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>European leaders are returning home after a two-day summit which failed to agree a deal on the next EU budget.</strong> Talks collapsed around 3.30pm today, when it became clear that the divisions between EU members were too great (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/23/eurozone-crisis-eu-budget-summit-cameron#block-50af9755b579cb0f059747ea\">from 3.33pm</a>).</p> <p>Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden formed an alliance against European plans for increased spending.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>David Cameron was highly critical of Brussels, having seen his push for spending cuts rebuffed. </strong>The UK prime minister claimed that the EU needs to move into the real world, and insisted that Britain was still committed to Europe.

He had earlier seen little support for his push to cut EU pay and perks.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Italy's Mario Monti, though, hit back at the UK.</strong> He claimed Cameron's position was incoherent, accusing the British PM of 'demagoguery' in his zeal to cut spending.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>European leaders tried to put a positive spin on events.</strong> European Council president<strong> Herman Van Rompuy</strong> argued that leaders had made progress, while Commission president <strong>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso</strong> was encouraged that leaders were discussing spending cuts for the first time ever.

But Van Rompuy decided to postpone the negotiations, possibly into the new year, after a furious row about the overall level of the budget.</p> <p>Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, was adamant that Van Rompuy's \u20ac973bn budget would have to be cut by \u20ac100m. He won some support from Cameron, Angela Merkel and Fredrick Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister.</p> <p>Cameron was keen to shave at least \u20ac50bn from the budget.

      "bodyText": "It's all gone quiet in Brussels, so I'm going to stop the liveblog for the day. Keep watching www.guardian.co.uk for analysis and reaction to today's events. Here's a quick closing summary. \u2022 European leaders are returning home after a two-day summit which failed to agree a deal on the next EU budget. Talks collapsed around 3.30pm today, when it became clear that the divisions between EU members were too great (from 3.33pm). Britain, Germany, The Netherlands and Sweden formed an alliance against European plans for increased spending. \u2022 David Cameron was highly critical of Brussels, having seen his push for spending cuts rebuffed. The UK prime minister claimed that the EU needs to move into the real world, and insisted that Britain was still committed to Europe. (from 4.30pm). He had earlier seen little support for his push to cut EU pay and perks. \u2022 Italy's Mario Monti, though, hit back at the UK. He claimed Cameron's position was incoherent, accusing the British PM of 'demagoguery' in his zeal to cut spending. \u2022 European leaders tried to put a positive spin on events. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy argued that leaders had made progress, while Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso was encouraged that leaders were discussing spending cuts for the first time ever. (see 4.08pm) \u2022 Elsewhere in the eurocrisis, the IMF had denied that it is close to agreeing a bailout for Cyprus (see 2.24pm)......and eurozone finance ministers are due to hold a teleconference tomorrow about Greece's ever-delayed bailout (see 10.27am). I'll be back on Monday, when eurozone finance ministers, the IMF and the European Central Bank will make another attempt to agree a deal on Greece. Until then, have a great weekend all. Good night! Here's a date for your new 2013 diary -- EC officials are suggesting February 7 and 8 as posslble dates to hold new talks on the EU budget. That's via the BBC's Norman Smith, who adds: The Financial Times aren't impressed by the shambolic way in which the EU summit broke up: Bruno Waterfield of the Daily Telegraph provides this handy guide to EU policy at this difficult time: Nick Watt, our senior political correspondent, reckons that Cameron has reasons for optimism as he heads back to London. Here's what Polish prime minister Donald Tusk told reporters after the summit broke up (via Reuters): All participants in the summit agreed that the positions (in negotiations) have moved closer to each other and there is scope for compromise, but it will clearly require more time. It is better than what we had expected only 12 hours ago, but we are certainly far away from a final agreement.......This afternoon I saw for the first time that the negotiating positions of some countries are to reach a compromise, not to drag out endlessly the talks to block them. For me this was a quality change. Nobody is interested in having the talks fail, and everybody understands they will have to move a little bit. The fact that cohesion policy and Common Agricultural Policy are regarded as safe from further cuts is not something that we can call a victory, but it is certainly a message that is very comforting for Poland. UK opposition MPs are claiming that the summit shows that David Cameron is isolated in Europe (even though he seemed to have allies in Germany and the Dutch). Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: David Cameron has failed to persuade other European leaders to deliver the reform of and real terms cut in the Budget which MPs voted for. (that's a reference to this vote on 31 October). Balls added: He is increasingly weak and isolated in Europe, just as he is at home. The Prime Minister needs to start building alliances if he is to deliver a good deal for British taxpayers and for the future of the European Union. Hmmm -- Cameron could probably do to build bridges with the Italians (see 5.27pm), but actually he looks less isolated than at other meetings, especially as the Dutch government wanted an even larger budget cut than the Brits. Portuguese journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo suggests the Dutch could have actually undermined Cameron's chances of being the most critical voice on EU spending: David Cameron has just tweeted about the Summit: And one of his MPs has offered sympathy for his 'ordeal': Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, has laid into David Cameron for his conduct during the summit. In his press briefing, Monti claimed that the UK PM had taken an \"incoherent\" position on budget cuts, accusing him of being full of 'demagoguery'. The ever-urbane Monti added that Italy (which is a net contributor to the EU budget, incidentally), is certainly in favour of better management of EU spending and administration (the pay and perks which Cameron attacked), but suggested the UK had gone too far in its attacks. Monti also reiterated that he believes rebates should be abolished, saying it is not fair for richer countries (Britain) to be subsidised in this way. Monti added that Italy was also not happy with the budget plans that were on the table, but predicted agreement in \"weeks, not months\". Finally, the Italian PM said the atmosphere at the meeting was better than on other occasions. So that's one positive. Briefings are continuing, but it's pretty clear now that the Summit collapsed because Britain and Germany, with the Netherlands and Sweden in support, made it clear that Herman Van Rompuy's budget proposals were unacceptable. The lack of progress forced Van Rompuy to throw in the towel, explain Ian Traynor and Nick Watt from Brussels: Britain made clear that David Cameron was happy to continue with the negotiations over the weekend. But Van Rompuy decided to postpone the negotiations, possibly into the new year, after a furious row about the overall level of the budget. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, was adamant that Van Rompuy's \u20ac973bn budget would have to be cut by \u20ac100m. He won some support from Cameron, Angela Merkel and Fredrick Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister. Cameron was keen to shave at least \u20ac50bn from the budget. Merkel was keen to see further cuts on the Van Rompuy proposal, though she would have accepted more modest cuts. More here. Finally, David Cameron reiterates that he was not a lone voice in Brussels over the last two days, saying: We had strong allies, particularly the Dutch and the Swedes in ensuring that unacceptable spending was blocked. And then the final soundbite: We've not got a deal, but we've not got an unacceptable deal either. That's the end of Cameron's press conference. Has the talk about an In-Out referendum on Britain's future in Europe weakened the Prime minister's resolve, a journalist asks. Cameron denies it, saying: Britain does have a part and a role to play in Europe... But if you just ignore the debate and say nothing needs to change, you won't be serving the UK interest. Cameron has denied that he doesn't care about Europe -- telling reporters that he and his government remain committed to the EU. He cites the importance of helping newer members from Eastern Europe, saying that growing their economies will be good for Britain. The prime minister was also adamant that he was not isolated: David Cameron has blasted European Union leaders for their failure to agree with him, and the other countries who wanted a smaller budget. Giving a press briefing now (live on Sky), the prime minister said that Van Rompuy's proposal was \"just not good enough\". EU institutions, he said, are living in a \"parallel universe\", and must adjust to the \"real world\" where countries are making real terms cuts to their spending to ride out the financial crisis. Just in: the official statement from the Members of the European Council: The European Council gives its President the mandate together with the President of the European Commission to continue the work and pursue consultations in the coming weeks to find a consensus among the 27 over the Union's Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020. The bilateral talks and the constructive discussion within the European Council show a sufficient degree of potential convergence to make an agreement possible in the beginning of next year. We should be able to bridge existing divergences of views. A European budget is important for the cohesion of the Union and for jobs and growth in all our countries. You can also watch the ongoing Van Rompuy/Barroso press conference here: Angela Merkel is giving her own press conference across the halls in the EU HQ -- I've embedded the live video feed above. There's no translation into English, but Open Europe is helpfully watching it and tweets early highlights: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the EC, also denies that the talks have been a waste of time. He tells the press conference that leaders now have a better idea about their respective positions. He also point out that leaders are discussing real cuts in the EU budget \"for the first time ever in EU history\". Van Rompuy insisted that the Summit has not been a disaster, and it would be wrong to 'dramatise' the situation. This is a budget for the next seven years, after all. Van Rompuy says there was consensus that the EU needs a 'moderation' budget at this stage in the financial crisis, and also says leaders agreed that they need a \"growth budget\". Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso of the Commission are giving a joint press conference now. You can watch it live here: After the drama of October 2011 when the UK played its Veto, there's something rather sad about the way today's Summit subsided - not with a bang, but a whimper. EU officials are briefing that 'net payers' -- the countries whose contributions fund the Union -- could not reach agreement, but that there was no single flashpoint, and David Cameron didn't find himself as a lone voice facing the other 26 countries. Here's some instant reaction from reporters there: Angela Merkel is preparing to hold a press conference to explain what went wrong, and outline what happens next. Expected at 5pm Brussels time - so in just 10 minutes time. Now that the Summit has collapsed, EU officials must write a communique explaining what has happened, and what happens next. Putting a positive spin on this Summit could be a challenge. The UK government is briefing that the summit is over, without a deal. Senior UK government sources have announced that the talks have broken up with the various sides still in deadlock over the issue of funding the EU for the next seven years (Ian Traynor reports from the scene). The EU summit seems to have descended into chaos and confusion -- with reports that the whole thing has been called off, and other officials insisting that talks will continue. Reuters is snapping that the summit is over. However the Polish delegation, for example, insists that talks should continue tonight. As Ian Traynor just explained to me by phone, leaders can't even agree if they're talking. Some countries would like to push on tonight, but others would rather come back later -- next week, or next year. Marco Zatterin of La Stampa also believes talks are off: Developing... Some photos of the latest diplomatic wrangling inside the EU HQ have arrived: Back to Brussels, where leaders have been discussing the budget over lunch. Luke Baker of Reuters tells me that they've been tucking into cheese fondue and deer filet (which sounds like an improvement on last night's cold cuts). Alexander Stubb, Finland's foreign affair's minister, is not optimistic: But leaders haven't given up yet! The IMF has just released a statement, effectively denying that it has reached a deal over Cyprus's bailout (as was rumoured this morning - see 10.56am) Here's the full text: An EC/ECB/IMF mission has had productive discussions with the Cypriot authorities on the policy building blocks of a macroeconomic adjustment program. The authorities and EC/ECB/ IMF teams made good progress towards agreement on key policies to strengthen public finances, restore the health of the financial system, and strengthen competitiveness, so as to pave the way for the economy to return to sustained growth and financial stability. Discussions are expected to continue from respective headquarters with a view to making further progress toward a potential program. The preliminary results of a bank due-diligence exercise, expected in the next few weeks, will inform discussions between official lenders and Cyprus on financing solutions consistent with debt sustainability. 'productive discussions...'good progress'...'potential program' - all phrases that don't scream BAILOUT AGEEED. Curious -- reports from Cyprus say the government has been holding talks with the country's trade unions to explain the details of a deal with the IMF. Once again, though, debt sustainability looks like the the big hurdle. More video from Brussels -- this time of Angela Merkel being pessimistic. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister, has proposed axing Britain's EU rebate as part of a wide-ranging reform of the way Europe handles its finances. Verhofstadt, described as an ally of Nick Clegg (now there's a rare species) in the European Parliament, said the EU needed to change to a system of raising finances through direct taxation. He said: If own resources [tax revenues that go directly to the EU] are further developed then the rebate shall disappear... The whole income of the union shall be based on own resources. There are no national contributions. If the national contributions disappear in the future there is no rebate necessary. What kind of direct taxation might the EU use? Verhofstadt suggests a levy on consumer spending (maybe VAT, or airport duties), or maybe a financial transaction tax. Speaking of Verhofstadt, he delivered a barn-storming attack on Nigel Farage MEP on Wednesday - saying that the UKIP leader's salary was \"the biggest waste of money in the European Union\". Waving his arms, Verhofstadt blasts Farage, saying: You are (a) member of the Fisheries committee, for example, and you're never there - never.... You're coming here saying it's a scandal, the salaries that are being paid, and you pay yourself a salary without doing any labour in your own committee... At which point Farage's eyes come close to popping out of his head. Ian Traynor has been working his contacts in Brussels, and reports that the UK prime minister got the cold-shoulder treatment from the heads of the European Council and Commission Open Europe, the think tank, has got hold of the revised EU budget proposals which Herman Van Rompuy unveiled last night (and which David Cameron and Angela Merkel have found so unwelcome). It's now online, here. Open Europe has analyst the document, to show that Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) spending has risen (as mentioned back at 8am), while there is no change to administration costs despite David Cameron's demands for pension and salary cuts (ala 8.12am): (the first column, HvR I, show the original proposals and the second column is the revised plan). Open Europe says the HvR II options are not acceptable to many EU countries: The increased spending on CAP and Cohesion moves further away from the spending split which many in the UK would like to see, while although the headline figure has not increased it is still probably slightly too high. So, despite talk of progress last night, it still seems that, from a UK perspective (but also likely a Swedish, Dutch and German one) there are some significant divisions. New proposals will be produced today? Can HvR III (which sounds like a dubious Hollywood trilogy) deliver a breakthrough?... Struggling to comprehend what Europe's seven-year \u20ac1trn budget means to the average citizen? Panic not - the Guardian has created a nifty interactive which how much we all give to, and receive from, the EU. And on what the money is spent on. Interesting stuff (as a Brit, I apparently give \u20ac180.38 and receive \u20ac105.12 - of which \u20ac15 goes to French farmers). Try it yourself. Herman Van Rompuy's team have been telling the media in Brussels that the European Council feels there are \"many options\" available towards reaching a \"good deal\". Van Rompuy should be unveiling his revised EU budget proposals shortly, although David Carretta of Italian radio station Radio Radicale reports that Van Rompuy may wait until after lunch. Carretta adds that the Van Rompuy team are still optimistic: Angela Merkel and David Cameron held talks this morning, in a sign that the UK and Germany are forging a partnership over the EU budget. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that Merkel is offering Cameron strong support. She appears concerned that the UK could be isolated from other net contributors to the EU budget - thus weakening those who want a lower settlement. Ian also reports: Angela Merkel received a dose of good news as she arrived at the Brussels summit - German business confidence brightened surprisingly in November. The Ifo business climate index, a barometer of economic health in Europe's largest economy, rose to 101.4 from 100.0 last month, an increase for the first time since six consecutive declines. Analysts had forecast a modest drop to 99.5. Munich's Ifo Institute said: The German economy is holding up in the face of the euro crisis. Companies expressed slightly greater satisfaction with their current business situation. They were also far less pessimistic about future business developments. Export expectations were positive for the first time in three months (my colleague Nadine Schimroszik reports). The news pushed the euro to a three-week high of \u20ac1.291. Conversely, Italy's economy continues to suffer, with consumer spending dropping 1.7 % in September as the country continued to contract. More video - this time of David Cameron's arrival at today's Summit talks, where he tells the press that leaders haven't made enough progress so far and need to stop \"tinkering\" around the edges. Dow Jones Newswires is reporting that eurozone finance ministers will hold a telephone briefing on Saturday to discuss the Greek financial programme. Which suggests they're getting their plans in place for the Eurogroup meeting on Monday. The clocks have struck noon in Brussels, which means the second day of the EU summit is officially under way. Pessimism is stalking the corridors, however. Belgium's prime minister, Elio Di Rupo, claimed that the main problem with Van Rompuy's proposal was there was \"not enough money in the pot\". He also criticised the UK for not showing more imagination The leaders of Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark have been holding talks (a quadrilateral-meeting?) to discuss the EU budget deadlock -- here's a picture of them as it broke up. The blurry figure in the foreground is Helle Thorning-Schmidt of Denmark. There are also reports this morning of progress over the EU's other huge headache - Greece. Reuters claims that the International Monetary Fund has conceded that Greece should be given until 2022 to bring its debts down to 120% of GDP, not 2020 as it had previously insisted. That's a significant move, if so, and would bridge most of the funding gap. A separate Reuters story claims that Greece's \"foreign lenders\" (the IMF, presumably) are considering forcing the European Central Bank to forego the profits on its Greek bonds (which it bought at a discount). That would save Greece around \u20ac10bn. Put together, these two reports suggest a compromise is being strung together, with both the IMF and the ECB giving enough ground to get Greece's delayed aid tranche through. There are a few important developments in the eurozone crisis this morning, including the news that Cyprus has agreed the terms of a bailout. Government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou told reporters in Nicosea this morning that the behind-the-scenes briefings were taking place this morning, adding: We are awaiting the official announcement from Brussels in the afternoon. This would make Cyprus the fourth member of the Eurozone to seek financial help since the crisis began. Cyprus has been locked in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for months, since its banks suffered huge losses through their exposure to Greece. The final bailout could be \u20ac17bn -- or almost its entire GDP last year. A remarkable sum for such a small country. Here's a video clip of France's president warning that today's negotiations will be tough. Angela Merkel has just arrived at the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, and suggested that another Summit will be needed to resolve the budget row. The German chancellor added that failure to reach agreement today over spending from 2014-2020 would not be \"dramatic\". More leaders have arrived at the summit meeting in Brussels and there is little sign of a breakthrough. Jyrki Katainen, prime minister of Finland, warned the press pack that it would be \"difficult\" to reach a deal on the EU budget deal today, adding: everything is open. And the prime minister of Sweden, Fredrik Reinfeldt, indicated he was in for the long haul: I am not in a hurry. It will take a long time. Reinfeldt had previously said he would not accept Sweden being hit with a larger budget increase than other richer nations. David Cameron has just arrived back at the Summit, and told journalists that EU leaders need to stop tinkering and make real cuts to spending levels. Cameron said: Well I don't think there's been enough progress so far. There really is a problem that there hasn't been the progress in cutting back proposals for additional spending. It isn't the time for tinkering. It isn't the time for moving money from one part of the budget to another. We need unaffordable spending cut. That's what's happening at home and that's what needs to happen here. That's via Nick Watt, our senior political correspondent, who's at the scene. And Ian Traynor flags up that the line about 'tinkering' is a slapdown to Herman Van Rompuy: Sky's Robert Nisbet has tweeted a nice photo from inside the Summit room, of the UK's desk: Reminds me of a great picture from May of George Osborne being surrounded at a 2am meeting on bank regulation: The Brussels press pack are up and about and pondering whether the real message of this summit is that Germany and France have drifted apart. As I flagged up at 8.00am, president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande refused to accept reductions to farm subsidies -- and is one of the most powerful voices lobbying for a higher budget. Angela Merkel, though, is leaning towards the UK position (although not as extreme) The Daily Telegraph's Bruno Waterfield agrees that Merkel and Hollande are on opposite side of this battle. He tweets that four Northern countries - Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden - are battling three Southerners - France, Italy and Spain. David Cameron may have failed to cut EU salaries and pensions (see 8.12am), but there was one sign that the Brussels gravy train had taken a shunt -- last night's dinner was rather less lavish than usual. Leaders nibbled on cold cuts of meat, perhaps a recognition that austerity has to reach the very top occasionally. It feels in tune with the chilly relationships at the heart of the European project, as Ian Traynor and Nick Watt wrote last night in a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at Summit life: It's a grinding, gruelling way of doing business, seemingly destined for dysfunction. Anywhere else on the European conference circuit, people meet in the morning, do their business through the day and top things off with dinner. But the leaders kicked off at 8pm, bracing themselves for an extremely long night of bleary-eyed arithmetic. Martial metaphors are to the fore. Red lines, battles, shoring up the defences, duels, and showdowns. And they're supposed to be friends. European parliament president Martin Schulz reckons a deal palatable to David Cameron will not be delivered today. Speaking after last night's session broke up, he sald: The room for manoeuvre for Mr Cameron is so small that it is likely he will not agree, that's my impression. David Cameron didn't make much progress in his push for a real-terms freeze in the EU budget. The UK prime minister failed to persuade other leaders that EU administration costs should be sliced by \u20ac6bn, leaving the UK's proposal still \u20ac50bn higher than the Van Rompuy 'compromise'. As my colleagues Ian Traynor and Nick Watt reported last night, Cameron proposed: \u2022 Increasing the retirement age to 68 for all EU officials now under the age of 58. The current retirement age is 63. This would save \u20ac1.5bn. \u2022 Cutting the overall EU pay bill by 10% for officials, saving \u20ac3bn. \u2022 Lowering the pension cap from 70% of an official's final salary to 60%, saving \u20ac1.5bn. A UK official said: These are not dramatic changes. The commission and others are telling the Greeks, the Italians and others that they should put the retirement age up to 68. In the UK we have cut [public sector] pensions to a career average salary. They argue that it is very difficult legally to change people's terms and conditions. Well, we have managed it in the UK. The proposal didn't please Brussels (EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso apparently reacted 'defensively'), but certainly went down well with the Daily Mail, which gushed: David Cameron brandished a list of the \u2018outrageous\u2019 pay and perks of tens of thousands of Eurocrats last night as he clashed with EU leaders over British demands for cuts to Brussels\u2019 vast budget. The suspicion, however, is that Cameron is making a noise about the Brussels gravy train because he knows he can't persuade other leaders to accept a budget freeze (let alone the cut which the UK parliament voted for). France was the early winner in last night's talks, with president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande persuading Herman Van Rompuy to water down proposed cuts to agriculural subsidies and regional aid. Poland had also attacked the plans, and the upshot of both countries' lobbying was that Van Rompuy proposed a revised plan, scaling back the cuts to farm subsidies and regional development funds. But with Van Rompuy's plan still meaning an \u20ac80bn cut to the EC's original proposal, other areas are likely to take the hit. The development was not welcomed by British and German officials, who said it made a budget deal this week more remote. And speaking of France, Standard &amp; Poor's has just reaffirmed its credit rating as AA+ (that's the second highest rating), but warned that Paris would probably miss its deficit target in 2013. European Union leaders are struggling to agree a deal over the EU budget after the first day of talks ended without agreement. Negotiations broke up after midnight in Brussels, after the revised seven-year funding plan proposed by European Council president Herman Van Rompuy wasn't enough to bridge the divide among EU leaders. Talks resume at 11am GMT (noon local time), but diplomats and politicians are downbeat about the prospects of a deal \u2013 threatening weeks, or even months, of conflict that would overshadow efforts to resolve the eurozone financial crisis. Although Van Rompuy is pushing for a smaller budget increase than originally suggested, his draft proposal is still tens of billions of euros higher than the sums acceptable to the likes of Britain \u2013 who has been playing the traditional role of a trouble-making Scrooge. Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, has already said there has been limited progress.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Around 900 UK staff have lost their jobs at Tata Steel, with nearly 600 leaving its Port Talbot operations in Wales, the company has said. Workers were told on Friday morning that their jobs were being cut in the latest round of cost savings by the loss-making steel maker. Bosses also plan to close 12 steel finishing and processing sites across the country. Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel's European operations said: \"Today's proposals are part of a strategy to transform ourselves into an 'all-weather' steel producer capable of succeeding in difficult economic conditions.\" The majority of the 580 jobs to go in Port Talbot, which employs 5,000 people, will be management and administrative positions, while a further 155 jobs are to be lost in Yorkshire, 120 in the West Midlands and 30 in Teesside. Shift levels at the company's Rotherham and Hartlepool plants will also be reduced as demand for pipelines and bars diminishes. However, the company, which employs 19,000 staff in the UK, will create 120 new jobs when a hot strip rolling mill opens at Llanwern, and one of two blast furnaces at Port Talbot will restart in the new year as part of a \u00a3250m investment plan. Unions reacted with anger at the decision, which follows a similar round of redundancies in 2011 when 1,500 jobs were lost at Tata's Scunthorpe operations and around 100 in Corby. Unite union Wales secretary Andy Richards said: \"Today's announcement of job losses at Tata is devastating news for both the employees involved and the local community, especially coming so close to Christmas. \"It is a dark day for Welsh workers and for the steel industry in Wales \u2013 another twist in the knife of decimation started by Thatcher over 30 years ago.\" Michael Leahy, general secretary of the trade union Community, said: \"Sadly, these potential job losses are symptomatic of the continuing failure of the government's economic policy and yet another reason why we are calling on the British government to take urgent action to stimulate economic growth and help revive the manufacturing sector.\" He added: \"This announcement comes after a four-year long downturn in the UK and European steel industry, where the fall in UK steel demand has been steeper than in any other major European economy. This is why we need faster investment in infrastructure programmes and community benefit clauses in UK procurement, just as France and Germany do to support their own manufacturing industry.\" Earlier this month the business swung to a loss of $67m (\u00a342m) for the quarter, due to falling demand for steel in Europe, which accounts for two-thirds of its 28m tonne capacity. The company said demand has fallen 25% since 2007 and was forecast to fall by a further 10% this year.",

Bosses also plan to close 12 steel finishing and processing sites across the country.</p> <p>Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel's European operations said: \"Today's proposals are part of a strategy to transform ourselves into an 'all-weather' steel producer capable of succeeding in difficult economic conditions.\"</p> <p>The majority of the 580 jobs to go in Port Talbot, which employs 5,000 people, will be management and administrative positions, while a further 155 jobs are to be lost in Yorkshire, 120 in the West Midlands and 30 in Teesside.</p> <p>Shift levels at the company's Rotherham and Hartlepool plants will also be reduced as demand for pipelines and bars diminishes.</p> <p>However, the company, which employs 19,000 staff in the UK, will create 120 new jobs when a hot strip rolling mill opens at Llanwern, and one of two blast furnaces at Port Talbot will restart in the new year as part of a \u00a3250m investment plan.</p> <p>Unions reacted with anger at the decision, which follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/20/tata-steel-job-losses-yorkshire-teesside\" title=\"\">a similar round of redundancies in 2011</a> when 1,500 jobs were lost at Tata's Scunthorpe operations and around 100 in Corby.</p> <p>Unite union Wales secretary Andy Richards said: \"Today's announcement of job losses at Tata is devastating news for both the employees involved and the local community, especially coming so close to Christmas.</p> <p>\"It is a dark day for Welsh workers and for the steel industry in Wales \u2013 another twist in the knife of decimation started by Thatcher over 30 years ago.\"</p> <p>Michael Leahy, general secretary of the trade union Community, said: \"Sadly, these potential job losses are symptomatic of the continuing failure of the government's economic policy and yet another reason why we are calling on the British government to take urgent action to stimulate economic growth and help revive the manufacturing sector.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This announcement comes after a four-year long downturn in the UK and European steel industry, where the fall in UK steel demand has been steeper than in any other major European economy. This is why we need faster investment in infrastructure programmes and community benefit clauses in UK procurement, just as France and Germany do to support their own manufacturing industry.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month the business swung to a loss of $67m (\u00a342m) for the quarter, due to falling demand for steel in Europe, which accounts for two-thirds of its 28m tonne capacity.</p> <p>The company said demand has fallen 25% since 2007 and was forecast to fall by a further 10% this year.</p>",

Walmart and Toys R Us opened at 8pm on Thursday with some products in their Black Friday deals, while electronics retailer Best Buy opened at midnight in the traditional sales that follow Thanksgiving. The sales also stretched across the Atlantic, with Apple, Currys, PC World, Asda and Amazon offering discounts to coincide with the US holiday. Sales are expected to increase 4.1% over the festive period, according to the National Retail Federation in America, down on the 5.6% increase seen in 2011.

Charles O'Shea, a senior analyst at Moody's, told Reuters the reason for early store openings could be to challenge online retailers. He said: \"It's a recognition that retailers need to be more aggressive and want to show their physical stores are important. It's a finite pie; if you can get a bit more by being open, then do it.\" However, Kevin Sterneckert from researchers Gartner Group warned: \"They [shoppers] will buy things because they looked at it in the store.

Amazon, which introduced Black Friday to the UK market in 2010, has been running deals on its website all week and will continue until Monday \u2013 known as Cyber Monday. Elsewhere, Currys and PC World started a \"100-hour price crash\" sale running until Monday evening, with electronics discounted by up to 66%. Asda \u2013 owned by US giant Walmart \u2013 has a Black Friday weekend running on its website, which appears to be highly successful.
