      "bodyText": "Two key factors would seem to be driving the apparent upsurge in enthusiasm for nationalisation. The first, mentioned in your Business Leader, is not just the absolute obscenity of the remuneration packages of financiers, directors and senior managers, but also the persistent impression they give that, while most of us think they are screwing us, they still \u201cjust don\u2019t get it\u201d (\u201cNationalisation plans are now music to ears of voters who are tired of free-market odes\u201d). Even if they are in charge of enormous industries, it is very hard for someone doing an important job such as teaching or working in a small local business, rubbing along on, say \u00a320,000 to \u00a340,000 a year, to understand how any job can merit a salary that sounds like a lottery win. The other factor may be that there is a general belief that nationalised industries will not return to the old levels of indifferent customer service. The cartoonist Giles used regularly to characterise British Rail staff as uninterested \u201clittle Hitlers\u201d. I remember that we laughed, but there was an element of recognition in that laughter. Service was poor and customers were not treated as if they were in the right. Having learned in our own jobs that being nice to customers makes everyone\u2019s day more pleasant, perhaps we are all now ready to believe that a British Rail platform attendant or a British Gas repair man in a nationalised context will realise that there is everything to gain from saying: \u201cEnjoy your journey\u201d or: \u201cLet us know if the repair is unsatisfactory\u201d, whether they mean it or not. If that is the case, nationalisation might seem to offer the best of both worlds. Colin Padgett Gestingthorpe Essex Catalan vote broke rule of law I once was one of many Spaniards who would have forgone their constitutional right to vote on Catalan independence. No more. The pro-independence parties called an early local election in 2015 and joined forces with one single objective: Catalan independence. Not only did they lose the majority they had, but they lost the popular vote. So much so that they had to add the anarchist/anti-capitalist far left to get a slim majority in the Catalan parliament. Seeing the froth of independence slowly settling into a simmer after years of economic crisis, they turned up the heat by breaking national and their own regional laws, calling an illegal referendum and railroading the opposition that represent the other half of Catalans. I condemn all acts of violence, but democracy requires the rule of law to prevail. The Spanish government has to accept its share of criticism, but it did not break the law: it tried to maintain it \u2013 and with the benefit of hindsight, very badly \u2013 while the Catalan government incited its followers on to the streets to vote, knowing it was an illegal act. A patriot is not someone who divides friends and families to create a sovereign nation. Nationalisms and populisms need to be defeated with the rule of law and that\u2019s why I will, until further notice, keep my constitutional right to decide on Catalan independence, to serve and protect the rights of all the other Catalans who wish to remain as part of the Spanish nation, where there is room for all. Antero Touchard Madrid BBC and church both to blame One has to wonder what planet the Church of England and the BBC inhabit (\u201cWar of words rages between archbishop and BBC over handling of abuse scandals\u201d, News). In both cases, the self-importance of holding their own organisation in some imaginary orbit, where it is thought that they have acted well, is clearly laughable. The church, just like the BBC, has covered over many misdemeanours, clearly documented over the years. The BBC says of the Savile debacle that once the allegations became known, a full independent investigation was carried out by a high court judge. This is rubbish, as the BBC was very well aware over many years that there was a smoking gun with Savile. It knew of many stories circulating and had blocked a Newsnight programme on Savile.

    "webTitle": "Nearly 70% of Australians oppose government loan for Adani mine \u2013 poll", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Polling released on Sunday shows Australians are mostly opposed to Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, and even more strongly opposed to it getting any government assistance. The ReachTel poll, commissioned by The Australia Institute, also shows Australians think a loan to Adani from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility would damage the country\u2019s reputation \u2013 a fact that if \u201clikely\u201d to be true, would make the loan unlawful. Asked simply whether they support or oppose the construction of Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine, about 50% more respondents were opposed to it than supported it. Of the 1,421 respondents 30% said they supported the mine, while 44% opposed it. However, 26% of respondents to the survey conducted in late September said they weren\u2019t sure. Just 16% said they supported a taxpayer loan to assist construction of the mine, with 68% opposing it. On Saturday, the Guardian reported on a larger poll conducted more recently, showing 55.6% opposed to the mine. In the poll released today on Sunday, a clear majority of people \u2013 58% \u2013 said they thought such a loan would damage the government\u2019s reputation. Naif\u2019s investment mandate says it \u201chas a responsibility to act in a way that is not likely to cause damage to the Australian government\u2019s reputation\u201d. Other agencies, such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, operate under almost identical conditions. In July, Oliver Yates, who was the chief executive of the CEFC since its inception in 2012 until May this year, told the Guardian that the Naif loan should never have progressed past the initial inspection by the Naif board, since it did not pass the reputation test. If the loan is likely to cause reputationdamage, it would be unlawful. Just over half the respondents from Sunday\u2019s poll said they would support a new rule that prevented Naif, or other similar agencies, supporting mining projects in Australia \u2013 while only 24% opposed such a rule. However, contrary to the apparent wishes of the public, and in the face of private banks increasingly being unwilling to back coalmines, the Turnbull government last month overturned a rule that had been in place for several years stopping another government agency \u2013 the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation \u2013 from loaning money to mining operations. \u201cThis polling shows not just that taxpayer subsidies for Adani are deeply unpopular, but that more Australians oppose than support the mine going ahead, regardless of subsidies,\u201d said the deputy director of the Australia Institute, Ebony Bennett. \u201cThe strong support or opposition, a better indicator of an issue being a vote-changer, shows just 8% strongly support while 23% strongly oppose the mine,\u201d she said. \u201cPoliticians \u2013 both state and federal \u2013 have spent a lot of time and political capital promoting Adani and the mine, but the campaign has backfired, with opposition strengthening. \u201cPrevious Australia Institute polling in shows opposition to subsidies has grown to 68%, up from 64% in May 2017.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Electric cars key to driving change in UK\u2019s energy supply industry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You drive home and plug in your electric car, telling an app how many miles you need the next day. As you eat dinner, relax and sleep, your energy supplier takes control of your battery, using it to buy power when it\u2019s cheap, selling it back later when high demand pushes prices up. The company offers national and local power grids services from your battery, making more money that it will later split with you, perhaps as \u201cfree miles\u201d for your car. This sounds like a far-off vision of the future. But the scenario will be reality next year for British households able to afford a new Nissan Leaf electric car and willing to allow energy firm Ovo to fit a special charger in their home. \u201cThe customer has to want to do it and understand it, and allow someone else to have some degree of control over their charging patterns for some form of rewards,\u201d said Tom Pakenham, head of electric vehicles at Ovo. In his view, everyone benefits: individuals, suppliers and energy networks coping with the increasing, but variable, amount of wind and solar power flowing through their cables. \u201cElectric vehicles, like all vehicles, are an under-utilised asset: cars are parked 92% of the time, doing nothing. So why not make some use of it, to allow us to deploy renewables on the grid, and to allow the owner of the car to benefit somehow?\u201d he said. It is not just medium-sized challenger companies like Ovo eyeing this emerging opportunity. Big-six firm E.ON launched a tariff last week targeting owners of electric cars, offering electricity at night \u2013 when most of the UK\u2019s 100,000 plug-in cars are charged and when energy demand is usually at its lowest \u2013 at prices a third cheaper than in the daytime. \u201cThe next big challenge is going to be how we integrate all these electric vehicles into the grid system,\u201d said Dr Chris Horne, head of origination at E.ON. \u201cIn time, you can see how this is a complete change in the way we think about energy, motoring and vehicles.\u201d The German firm is exploring the sort of vehicle-to-grid technology being used by Nissan and Ovo. E.ON thinks the concept may begin to become more mainstream in the next decade, boosted by a \u00a320m government fund for projects starting next year, and the greater availability of electric car models \u2013 not all are capable of it. This switch, from individuals potentially giving back power to their supplier, as well as taking it, marks the beginning of a whole new relationship between energy company and citizen. On the one hand, cheaper solar and energy storage at home could, as one researcher at Imperial College recently put it, \u201cbleed revenues from the utilities sector\u201d. \u201cOur relationship with the grid will become quite different, from being utterly dependent on the grid for power, people may become a bit more interdependent, giving or taking,\u201d said Dale Vince, founder of green electricity firm Ecotricity. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a role for energy companies, it\u2019ll just be very different. It could be considerably diminished in terms of energy supply, if you go far into the future,\u201d he added. On the flip side, helping a customer with the complex task of exploiting their battery is an opportunity for energy companies to move beyond just supplying electricity and gas, where price is still the main differentiator, into being providers of a range of energy services. British Gas has already started down this road, offering a range of smart home products under its Hive brand and launching a site to find tradesmen. Horne said electric cars offered a chance for firm to change their relationship with consumers, and focus on offering them \u201csolutions\u201d, not just power. \u201cWe think people can become their own energy-independent unit and we\u2019re excited by that vision and need to support it. But, obviously, if people don\u2019t buy energy from us, we need to find other ways to have relationships with them, and to supply them with products and services,\u201d said Pakenham. Robert Llewellyn, the actor and writer, knows all about that changing relationship. An advocate for electric cars and renewable energy, he has had a battery-powered car and solar power for seven years, and the solar panels were upgraded this year. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my relationship with my energy supplier \u2013 I give them much less money. Since May, I\u2019ve been around 85% powered by solar,\u201d said Llewellyn, best known for playing mechanoid Kryten in Red Dwarf. \u201cMy one house makes no difference, but if there were 5m homes with [solar and electric cars], it would really help the national grid and reduce the costs of generating power,\u201d he said, referring to the \u00a33bn annual cost to consumers of running the UK\u2019s energy networks. For Llewellyn, electric cars, batteries and solar power are most exciting not at individual level but at community level, citing his Gloucestershire village\u2019s efforts to generate its own electricity. \u201cWhat\u2019s emerging rapidly is community-owned energy generation and distribution,\u201d he said. This future, where electric cars are used as a key element of our energy system, is not without potential downsides. Vince said he had concerns about the impact on the car battery\u2019s longevity, though Ovo thinks active management of it could even be beneficial. Thinktanks have warned that just six electric cars in one neighbourhood could cause unplanned drops in voltage if they are not charged at the right times of day. And another worry is the social impact of lots of solar- and electric car-equipped homes reducing their reliance on the power grids. Tom Edwards, an analyst at energy expert Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cIf I install a battery in my home, because I can afford to put a battery in, that means I\u2019m avoiding the cost of using the national grid but my neighbours might not necessarily be, and they\u2019re going to have to pick up the slack that I\u2019m not paying for.\u201d The risk, as he puts it, is that one day, \u201cyou\u2019re left with the whole \u00a33bn bill landing on one old lady in Cornwall\u201d. To avoid that, regulator Ofgem is looking at how paying for the energy network might change in the future, such as a phone-line rental-style charge, rather than being based on the amount of energy used. There is also disagreement over whether it\u2019s more efficient to produce and store power at a local level, close to where it\u2019s consumed, or at large central power stations with the energy transmitted over long distances. \u201cMaking power where it\u2019s used at the home level is the most efficient way to do it because you avoid all the losses of the distribution and transmission system to get it to people,\u201d argues Vince. Under Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour party has made such a decentralised system one of the planks of its energy policy. For Edwards, it\u2019s not a given that greater energy independence for consumers is a good thing. \u201c[It\u2019s] not necessarily, because the most efficient way to generate electricity is in very large power stations. They will be more efficient than anything you can stick on your roof.\u201d One thing Edwards agrees on is that batteries, along with trends such as more renewables and greater digitisation, mean upheaval is coming. \u201cThe system will fundamentally change,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "As one of the UK\u2019s renewable energy chiefs has pointed out, electric cars won\u2019t tackle climate change if they run off fossil fuels. Matthew Wright, managing director of Dong Energy UK, said that although plug-in cars could cut local air pollution, it would be a \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d if they increased greenhouse gases from coal and gas power stations. \u201cThe fit between renewable energy and electric is a natural [one],\u201d he argued. E.ON, one of the big-six energy suppliers, agrees: its dedicated new electric car tariff is supplied with 100% renewable power. Put simply, the greener the electricity mix, the greener your electric car. Today, around half of power generated in the UK comes from low-carbon sources. Here\u2019s how that breaks down, and how it might look in the future. Wind Nearly a third of the UK\u2019s electricity between April and June was generated from renewable sources \u2013 a new record, and up a quarter on the same period last year. The milestone was driven in large part by the growing number of windfarms on land and around the UK\u2019s coast. It also helped that wind speeds were relatively high and overall electricity generation was lower than normal. The records have continued into autumn. Last Sunday night was the perfect time to plug in a car, as the carbon emissions from power generation were at their lowest level ever, because of windfarms. Offshore windfarms have been making headlines as well as power, securing record low levels of state support in a government auction last month. Three major offshore farms will be built in the early 2020s for a subsidy price well below nuclear, and half what the technology cost just a few years ago. The UK has more offshore wind power capacity than any other country in the world, and is helping set records in Europe too. Last Monday, Europe generated a new high of 263 gigawatt hours of power from offshore turbines, 95GWh of which came from the UK. Some industry-watchers think that offshore windfarms, where larger and more efficient turbines are driving costs down fast, could become so cheap that they eventually outcompete their onshore counterparts in Britain, too. But for now, those on land still provide 50% more power than those at sea. Solar The number of solar panels in the UK grew at a dizzying rate between 2011 and 2016, and now provide a significant source of power in the middle of the day. Solar is a large reason the national grid went without coal power for 24 hours in April, the first time the UK had done without the dirty fuel for a day since the industrial revolution. For one brief period on a Friday in May, solar even eclipsed the UK\u2019s eight nuclear power stations for electricity generation. However, the outlook for the next five years is cloudier. Experts forecast the amount of solar installed will be a fifth of the capacity fitted in the past five years. Nuclear Nuclear power stations usually provide between a fifth and a quarter of the UK\u2019s power, taking a 23.6% share during April and June. EDF, which is building Britain\u2019s first new nuclear station in decades at Hinkley Point in Somerset, thinks that by 2035, nuclear\u2019s share should grow to around a third of UK power supply. In the French state-owned firm\u2019s vision of the future, another third will come from renewables and the last third from gas. Together, EDF sees the three as the best way of achieving reliable, affordable and low-carbon power. But seven of the UK\u2019s eight existing nuclear power stations, which began generating electricity in the 1970s and 1980s, are expected to come off the grid late next decade. That means for atomic power to supply a third of the UK\u2019s needs, Hinkley Point C will need to be finished on time, and three more plants of a similar size will need to be built. One of those could be by EDF itself, at Sizewell in Suffolk, if it can build the reactors for a subsidy price low enough that the government would agree it. EDF is also supporting a Chinese nuclear company, CGN, which is at the start of a four-year process to get regulatory approval for a plant at Bradwell, in Essex. Other international consortia are hoping to build a plant at Wylfa in Wales and Moorside in Cumbria. Biomass Although environmentalists dispute the idea that wood-burning is green at all, it is still officially considered low-carbon by the UK and EU. The UK\u2019s biggest power station, Drax in North Yorkshire, has already converted three of its six units from coal to biomass, and is exploring switching a fourth. Later this year, an old coal power plant at Lynemouth in Northumberland is also slated to reopen as a biomass power station.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s chief operations officer will leave the crisis-hit airline at the end of the month, its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, has announced. Michael Hickey\u2019s resignation comes after the Irish airline had to scrap the bookings of more than 700,000 passengers last month due to an apparent shortage of pilots, having failed to plan for enough leave for staff. O\u2019Leary said: \u201cOver the past 30 years Mick Hickey has made an enormous contribution to Ryanair, especially the quality and safety of our engineering and operations functions. \u201cHe will be a hard act to replace, which is why we are grateful he has agreed to continue in an advisory role to smooth the transition to a successor and to complete a number of large projects he is currently working on including a multi-year engine maintenance contract and new hangar projects in Seville and Madrid.\u201d Hickey will be the first executive to leave the embattled airline after the scheduling crisis. The company was already under heavy fire for cancelling up to 50 flights a day in the middle of September before an extra 18,000 flights were axed at the end of the month. O\u2019Leary issued an unprecedented apology to his pilots this week in an attempt to stem the crisis at the airline, which has also faced the threat of an employee revolt. Ryanair hoped a bonus payment could entice some pilots to change their holiday plans, but O\u2019Leary further inflamed the situation with disparaging comments about pilots at the airline\u2019s annual meeting in Dublin. On Thursday, he sent an unusually contrite letter to pilots at the airline \u201cto apologise personally to each of you for the disruptions you have experienced\u201d. O\u2019Leary had accused pilots of being \u201cprecious about themselves\u201d and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d, saying: \u201cI would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked, or how anybody who by law can\u2019t fly more than 18 hours a week could possibly be suffering from fatigue.\u201d He said the comments had been directed at \u201cpilots of competitor airlines and their unions\u201d, a favoured refrain of O\u2019Leary\u2019s when addressing those who have criticised his employment model. \u201cI have the utmost respect and admiration for Ryanair\u2019s pilot team,\u201d he said. The letter offered a range of improvements to terms and conditions, including salary increases, loyalty bonus payments, improved rostering and better compensation for those pilots forced into working away from their home base. But it warned pilots against taking alternative employment with other airlines, particularly Norwegian, where hundreds are thought to have decamped. A graph of his rival airline\u2019s tumbling share price, along with some choice financial facts, was appended to the letter.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the week running up to the collapse of Monarch Airlines, one crew member noticed that something was awry. The soap had run out on a flight back to Gatwick and a request to replenish supplies was left unanswered. A few days later, on Monday this week, Monarch was no more: almost 2,000 staff would be laid off and the travel plans of 860,000 passengers would be disrupted. Her concerns about toiletries aside, Shelley Matthews didn\u2019t notice serious problems at the carrier, despite rumours and past financial uncertainty. \u201cThey told us we were going to go long haul and we were due to have brand new uniforms next year. We even had a huge recruitment day in Brighton two weeks ago,\u201d she said. Other recruitment events were scheduled in Birmingham and Luton, with hundreds of young people told to bring CVs to apply for their dream jobs \u2013 even as the airline\u2019s bosses fought to keep the business afloat. Monarch had, of course, needed rescuing before. Its sale in 2014 to Greybull, a private equity firm, came wrapped up in redundancies and pay cuts. Optimistic plans, including a new Boeing 737 fleet, were put in place. But recovery was thwarted by terror attacks, a weak pound after the Brexit vote, and ferocious competition. By 1 September, the management team was desperate. Accountants at KPMG were called in to lay out the options and Monach had to inform the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority. Only four weeks remained until a significant deadline, the renewal of the Atol licence \u2013 which compensates passengers in the event of a travel operator collapsing \u2013 for the company\u2019s Monarch Holidays unit. Atol cover is a legal requirement which the CAA would only grant if assured the company was financially viable. Monarch\u2019s previous dalliances with collapse had woken the CAA up to the need for contingency plans, honed over the last three years. Contracts were already in place with a host of carriers, from international names to providers of so-called wet-lease services, where fully crewed planes operate on behalf of another airline. By mid-September, they were being put on standby. Still, Monarch flew on, and bookings were taken, as its prospects looked increasingly grim. Investors were approached and rivals such as easyJet were sounded out about the possibility of a sale. A new company, Shelfco, was set up, to hive off the prospective long-haul Monarch and its costly Boeing orders. Meetings took place with the government, in the vain hope that a bridging loan could see it through the winter. The summer season, when airline coffers should bulge, had seen slim pickings, but Monarch still had money in the bank. By Friday 29 September, all eyes were on the regulator \u2013 but only because of the entirely separate crisis at Ryanair. While the public demanded action to compensate Ryanair passengers, the CAA was sitting on an even bigger powder keg. An insider said: \u201cMonarch was moving only in one direction. But even on Friday there were ongoing conversations.\u201d Meanwhile, planes were starting to relocate from Qatar Airways, ready to step in. On Saturday night, the decision was taken to pull the plug. The CAA extended the Atol licence for 24 hours and triggered the rest of its contingency plans: building a website; collecting passenger data from Monarch; getting flight planners to secure airport slots to operate another 700 flights in the next fortnight to return passengers to the UK. Monarch\u2019s fares were hiked overnight to deter customers from booking \u2013 although many still did. On Sunday morning, Monarch\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, instructed crew to keep calm and carry on despite \u201cspeculation\u201d, emailing: \u201cLet\u2019s show everyone that we are made of strong stuff here at Monarch.\u201d Then, after flight ZB3785 from Tel Aviv landed in Manchester at 3.29am on Monday, the death of Monarch was declared. At 4am KPMG announced the airline was insolvent; minutes later, the government proclaimed the UK\u2019s \u201cbiggest ever peacetime repatriation\u201d under way to fly 110,000 passengers home. Within hours, the first had returned, only on a differently labelled plane, costing the taxpayer \u00a3545 per ticket. For those in the UK, ready to fly out, there was little to soften the blow, administered by text message. Many passengers had arrived at airports, seeing their flights cancelled minutes before they were due to board. Staff, meanwhile, had been emailed with the news and asked to attend 9am meetings across the country, to be told they were being laid off. Administrators expect it will take several weeks before creditors\u2019 losses are unpicked. The 110,000 people abroad bailed out by the government increasingly look like the lucky ones, while many more customers negotiate alternatives and chase refunds for vanished flights. As Matthews notes, the redundancies don\u2019t cover \u201cyoungsters who had just been offered jobs and were very excited to start. Now that\u2019s all gone.\u201d",
