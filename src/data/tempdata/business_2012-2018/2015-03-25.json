      "bodyText": "MPs have accused Sports Direct of behaving like a \u201cbackstreet outfit\u201d by refusing to pay suppliers and of \u201cshafting\u201d around 200 workers at an Ayrshire warehouse who were laid off by the retailer with only 15 minutes\u2019 notice. At a parliamentary inquiry into the January collapse of one of the retailer\u2019s subsidiaries, Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell was forced to defend the company\u2019s conduct but admitted he and most of the board had been unaware of two months\u2019 of key negotiations over the future of their business in Scotland. Workers at a Scottish warehouse lost their jobs when administrators were called into West Coast Capital (USC), a Sports Direct-controlled entity that owned 28 stores in the retailer\u2019s USC chain. The West Coast Capital (USC) stores were then immediately bought out of administration by Sports Direct\u2019s Republic division, which already owned 32 USC stores. Roughly 80 of the Ayrshire warehouse\u2019s 200 employees were made redundant with the bill picked up by taxpayers via the Insolvency Service. The rest were agency workers not entitled to redundancy pay. Ian Davidson, chairman of the Scottish affairs committee, said Sports Direct had \u201cshafted\u201d taxpayers, suppliers and workers. He accused the company of \u201cwalking away with the assets\u201d in a move that \u201cmight be legal but it is certainly not moral.\u201d Hellawell, a former chief constable who has chaired Sports Direct since 2009, said the company had intended to keep the warehouse and he had not known about the administration until the day before it happened. But he admitted he had not read the administrator\u2019s report in which Duff &amp; Phelps, a financial advisory firm, said it had been meeting with Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey since November 2014 to discuss the potential pre-pack administration of USC. Simon Reevell, a Conservative member of the Scottish affairs committee, suggested Forsey\u2019s failure to inform the board had allowed Sports Direct to avoid a legally required consultation process over redundancies at USC. Davidson said the board had not been told about the plan until it was a \u201cfait accompli\u201d when they had no choice but to go ahead. \u201cEssentially you were there for decoration or a final decision that had already been taken but needed to be rubber stamped,\u201d he said. Hellawell said: \u201cOur legal advice is that we did not break the law.\u201d Helawell also admitted the company had, as a negotiating tactic, refused to pay a key USC supplier, Diesel, as well as the landlord of its Ayrshire warehouse. MPs described this as a form of blackmail. \u201cWe understand that on at least one occasion the company tried to negotiate on its rent by refusing to pay, and with a supplier by refusing to pay. That sounds like a backstreet outfit,\u201d said Reevell. \u201cWe struggle to understand why a reputational matter like this was completely unknown to you as chairman.\u201d Asked what he intended to do about the use of such tactics Hellawell said: \u201cClearly I am going to ask some searching questions.\u201d The chairman told reporters that he did not need to reconsider his position at Sports Direct but he admitted during the hearing: \u201cThis whole thing hasn\u2019t helped our reputation.\u201d Hellawell said Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder \u2013 who MPs are keen to question about the affair and Sports Direct\u2019s widespread use of zero-hours contracts \u2013 had \u201cnever refused\u201d to attend the parliamentary committee and would be prepared to meet MPs. After weeks attempting to secure Ashley\u2019s attendance, MPs earlier this month published correspondence in which his adviser said he had \u201cimmovable commitments\u201d throughout March, meaning he was unavailable before parliament dissolves ahead of the general election. MPs believe Ashley is the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind Sports Direct, which has been widely criticised for its treatment of employees. At the committee Hellawell admitted 14,700 people \u2013 about 78% of the retailer\u2019s staff \u2013 were on \u201ccasual\u201d contracts which don\u2019t guarantee a minimum amount of work. He said those staff worked an average of 15 hours a week. In a further insight into the running of Sports Direct Hellawell told MPs that Ashley, a 55% shareholder who is executive deputy chairman, worked up to 60 hours a week. He said he was involved in the day-to-day running of the business with three or four other senior executives, led by Forsey. This group only informed the board of a plan to put part of USC into administration on the day before it collapsed. But Hellawell insisted that negotiations about the future of USC were just one of a long list of issues related to the daily running of the company that the board would be unaware of. He took a heavy battering from MPs over his lack of knowledge about the collapse of USC, with some of his answers reduced almost to a whisper. At one point he complained \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was on trial.\u201d He insisted that Sports Direct had saved 800 jobs by only putting part of USC into administration and continuing to operate its stores.",

That sounds like a backstreet outfit,\u201d said Reevell. \u201cWe struggle to understand why a reputational matter like this was completely unknown to you as chairman.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what he intended to do about the use of such tactics Hellawell said: \u201cClearly I am going to ask some searching questions.\u201d The chairman told reporters that he did not need to reconsider his position at Sports Direct but he admitted during the hearing: \u201cThis whole thing hasn\u2019t helped our reputation.\u201d</p> <p>Hellawell said Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder \u2013 who MPs are keen to question about the affair and Sports Direct\u2019s widespread use of zero-hours contracts \u2013 had \u201cnever refused\u201d to attend the parliamentary committee and would be prepared to meet MPs. </p> <p>After weeks attempting to secure Ashley\u2019s attendance, MPs earlier this month published correspondence in which his adviser said he had \u201cimmovable commitments\u201d throughout March, meaning he was unavailable before parliament dissolves ahead of the general election.</p> <p>MPs believe Ashley is the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind Sports Direct, which has been widely criticised for its treatment of employees. At the committee Hellawell admitted 14,700 people \u2013 about 78% of the retailer\u2019s staff \u2013 were on \u201ccasual\u201d contracts which don\u2019t guarantee a minimum amount of work. He said those staff worked an average of 15 hours a week.</p> <p>In a further insight into the running of Sports Direct Hellawell told MPs that Ashley, a 55% shareholder who is executive deputy chairman, worked up to 60 hours a week. He said he was involved in the day-to-day running of the business with three or four other senior executives, led by Forsey. This group only informed the board of a plan to put part of USC into administration on the day before it collapsed.</p> <p>But Hellawell insisted that negotiations about the future of USC were just one of a long list of issues related to the daily running of the company that the board would be unaware of. </p> <p>He took a heavy battering from MPs over his lack of knowledge about the collapse of USC, with some of his answers reduced almost to a whisper. At one point he complained \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was on trial.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted that Sports Direct had saved 800 jobs by only putting part of USC into administration and continuing to operate its stores. </p>",

Three members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee separately said that they thought inflation \u2013 which is likely to turn negative next month \u2013 would bounce back soon. The interventions by deputy governor Minouche Shafik and two of the externally appointed members of the MPC, Kristin Forbes and David Miles, contrast sharply with comments made last week by the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane. Haldane said it was possible that there had been a permanent downward move in inflation and that he could easily envisage cutting rates from their current record low of 0.5%. But this view was not supported by Shafik, Forbes or Miles, who made their views public before the Bank goes into \u201cpurdah\u201d later this week for the duration of the election campaign. All three echoed remarks made recently by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, who said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to cut rates in response to a temporary fall in inflation. Shafik, in an interview with Kent Business, said underlying inflation is \u201cnot that low\u201d despite the drop in inflation to its lowest ever level on the government\u2019s preferred measure, the consumer prices index. She added that the next move in interest rates was likely to be upwards. \u201cInflation is below the 2% target we are meant to have achieved, but the real drivers behind that are temporary and mainly external.\u201d Forbes said in an article for the London Evening Standard: \u201cLow inflation is unlikely to persist because the recent sharp fall in the price index is driven primarily by the sharp fall in energy and food prices. In fact, Bank calculations suggest that around three-quarters of inflation\u2019s deviation from our 2% target can be explained simply by recent price falls in these sectors.\u201d Meanwhile, Miles, in an interview with the Financial Times, said it would be wrong for the Bank to be panicked into a cut in interest rates because of the current level of inflation. Noting that he saw no deflationary forces holding back the economy, Miles warned against a knee-jerk response, adding that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that interest rates would rise. \u201cIt\u2019s wise to hold your nerve and not to get panicked into a response to the current [zero] rate,\u201d he said. Miles said inflation was likely to turn negative in the months to come, but added: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t see at the moment is persistent underlying deflationary pressures in the UK \u2014 they are striking by their absence\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Rapidly expanding demand for fresher, more convenient food forged the $40bn merger of Heinz and Kraft that reconfigured the world\u2019s supermarkets on Wednesday. Now, financial analysts and food industry experts say, those changing appetites are expected to set off a wave of industry consolidation as global food giants grapple to adapt. \u201cThis is a very difficult time to be in the food business as consumers change the way they eat,\u201d said Harry Balzer, the chief food industry analyst at market research firm NPD. \u201cIt seems we will see a number of these mergers as a way to create efficiencies.\u201d Heinz and Kraft announced plans to create the world\u2019s fifth largest food company, which will count Heinz\u2019s signature ketchup as well as Kraft Mac and Cheese, Jell-O, Oscar Mayer, Planters and Kool-Aid among its top brands. Balzer, who has followed American eating habits for the the past 29 years, said Heinz and Kraft are two big brands that have been brought together by the same challenge: keeping up with the rapid changes in what Americans want to eat \u2013 and how they want to eat it. \u201cPeople are not storing food as much as our parents did, as they seek fresher food,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re no longer storing as much, the people providing the inventory [generally large food conglomerates] will suffer. The de-inventorying of the American larder is not good for food companies.\u201d In his annual report of American\u2019s eating patterns, Balzer said the US consumer has entered into a third phase of the \u201chealthy food revolution\u201d. \u201cIn this latest evolution, consumers appear to be avoiding foods and beverages that were made to be better for them,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, consumers are going for products that are real and not altered.\u201d David Hayes, an analyst at investment bank Nomura, said the Kraft/Heinz deal \u2013 orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett \u2013 was \u201cpart of an ongoing, and long overdue, process of consolidation in the US food sector\u201d. David Turner, global food and drink analyst at market research firm Mintel, said the whole of the global food industry remains decades behind consumer desire for healthier, fresher food. \u201cThe food industry is really struggling in the US, particular in ambient [food stored in cupboards] and frozen foods, as consumers increasingly want fresh and convenient foods,\u201d he said. \u201cThe movement is most strong among younger customers who say \u2018I want to eat fresh and I want to know what the ingredients are, and I don\u2019t mind paying more\u2019. \u201cIf you\u2019re running a huge factory in the middle of the country churning out packaged food \u2026 it is quite hard to pitch that to trendy Californians.\u201d Turner said the US food industry had grown too complacent, assuming that people would continue to buy the well-established brands they have eaten since childhood. The food companies \u201cthought \u2018people in the US love food, and like buying more food\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need to change hasn\u2019t been there. Now there is a paradigm shift: people want to eat fresher and healthier, and are prepared to pay for it.\u201d Turner said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d expects a wave of mergers and acquisitions of other food companies following the Heinz/Kraft deal. \u201cThis is going to give Heinz/Kraft a huge logistically leverage and power with retailers,\u201d Turner said. \u201cEvery time Buffett has made a big deal, there has always been a wave of big M&amp;As that followed.\u201d",

      "standfirst": "<p>Kraft is an obvious target for 3G and Warren Buffett after their shakeup at Heinz, but it will be more of a cost-cutting merger than a match made in heaven</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Forget the tomato ketchup and processed cheese. Heinz and Kraft smothered their merger announcement with indigestion-inducing quantities of the word \u201ciconic\u201d. Nine squirts in a six-page summary was designed, presumably, to encourage the thought that the well-known (which is what they meant) brands belong together and that a life of harmony awaits.</p> <p>What really awaits is deep cost cuts. It has been an open secret that the owners of Heinz \u2013 the Brazilian billionaires at 3G plus Warren Buffett \u2013 have been hunting for their next candidate for a shake-up. Heinz has been pushed to the point where every $5 of sales yields a dollar of profit. That\u2019s a nice margin. No wonder the hard-running 3G wants to repeat the trick, and Buffett wants to help fund it.</p> <p>Kraft is a suitable target because the scope for improvement is obvious. The company doesn\u2019t get close to Heinz\u2019s margins and was slow to see the decline of processed food. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that our world has changed and our consumers have changed, but our company has not changed enough and certainly has not kept pace,\u201d Kraft\u2019s chief executive, John Cahill, confessed last month.</p> <p>Cahill will join the board of the combo as vice chairman, which sounds like a walk-on role. Heinz chairman Alex Behring will retain his title, and so will its chief executive, Bernando Hees. The Brazilians calculate there are $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) of annual savings up for grabs and they intend to ensure they arrive.</p> <p>The terms of surrender for Kraft are undoubtedly good. Shareholders will get 27% of the company\u2019s pre-deal value via a cash dividend plus a 49% holding in the combo. Kraft\u2019s shares rose by a third.</p> <p>3G and Buffett are prepared to offer those terms not only because they are confident of getting the savings. They also have to find relatively little new cash to make the merger happen \u2013 just $10bn to fund Kraft\u2019s dividend. In that sense it\u2019s a clever deal. But spare us the hyperbole. This is a defensive, cost-cutting merger. </p> <h2>Caution for Quinn at Balfour Beatty</h2> <p>It is two months since Leo Quinn, Balfour Beatty\u2019s new Mr Fixit, spoke about the \u201cconspiracy of optimism\u201d that had landed the once-mighty construction firm in a mess. Even now, hard reality arrives with a thump. The UK construction division, source of most of the woes, is taking a further \u00a3118m write-down. The final dividend is axed and restatement in a year\u2019s time will be at an \u201cappropriate\u201d level, which could mean anything.</p> <p>Yet the share price rose 6%. That was a strong vote of confidence in Quinn\u2019s talents as a turnaround specialist. And, to be fair, one can see how, with more discipline in bidding for work, the tale could come good. Balfour has \u00a36.6bn of annual revenues in construction, mostly in the UK and US. At a 2%-3% profit margin, profits would be \u00a3130m-\u00a3200m, instead of today\u2019s losses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the investment division \u2013 lots of completed PFI schools, hospitals and court houses \u2013 is worth \u00a31.3bn. So, on paper, and with a small sum of net cash in the mix, one can justify Balfour\u2019s market value of \u00a31.7bn.</p> <p>In practice, everything screams caution. Quinn\u2019s initial self-help programme \u2013 \u00a3200m of cash-flow improvement, and \u00a3100m of cost savings \u2013 will take two years. But more may be required to get back to industry standards.</p> <p>The passage in Quinn\u2019s statement that spoke most loudly was the one about how long Balfour has been in decline. The underlying performance has been going backwards since 2010, significant capital outflows have occurred since 2009, and the root cause is an acquisition spree that started in 2000. Undoing that history will take time.</p> <h2>No medals for Sports Direct governance</h2> <p>Encouraging news. Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley is prepared to explain to MPs the process by which part of the group\u2019s USC subsidiary was placed into administration in January; staff got just 15 minutes\u2019 notice that they were losing their jobs. Keith Hellawell, the retailer\u2019s chairman, made the unexpected offer during a disjointed session of the Scottish affairs committee.</p> <p>Mind you, let\u2019s hope Hellawell is in full possession of the facts. His other revelation was that he was unaware that Sports Direct executives had been talking to potential administrators about USC as long ago as last November. Hellawell learned about the actual administration only the day before it happened. That will not reassure those who worry about the robustness of boardroom governance at Sports Direct.</p>",

It has been an open secret that the owners of Heinz \u2013 the Brazilian billionaires at 3G plus Warren Buffett \u2013 have been hunting for their next candidate for a shake-up. Heinz has been pushed to the point where every $5 of sales yields a dollar of profit. That\u2019s a nice margin. No wonder the hard-running 3G wants to repeat the trick, and Buffett wants to help fund it. Kraft is a suitable target because the scope for improvement is obvious. The company doesn\u2019t get close to Heinz\u2019s margins and was slow to see the decline of processed food. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that our world has changed and our consumers have changed, but our company has not changed enough and certainly has not kept pace,\u201d Kraft\u2019s chief executive, John Cahill, confessed last month. Cahill will join the board of the combo as vice chairman, which sounds like a walk-on role. Heinz chairman Alex Behring will retain his title, and so will its chief executive, Bernando Hees. The Brazilians calculate there are $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) of annual savings up for grabs and they intend to ensure they arrive. The terms of surrender for Kraft are undoubtedly good. Shareholders will get 27% of the company\u2019s pre-deal value via a cash dividend plus a 49% holding in the combo. Kraft\u2019s shares rose by a third. 3G and Buffett are prepared to offer those terms not only because they are confident of getting the savings. They also have to find relatively little new cash to make the merger happen \u2013 just $10bn to fund Kraft\u2019s dividend. In that sense it\u2019s a clever deal. But spare us the hyperbole. This is a defensive, cost-cutting merger. Caution for Quinn at Balfour Beatty It is two months since Leo Quinn, Balfour Beatty\u2019s new Mr Fixit, spoke about the \u201cconspiracy of optimism\u201d that had landed the once-mighty construction firm in a mess. Even now, hard reality arrives with a thump. The UK construction division, source of most of the woes, is taking a further \u00a3118m write-down. The final dividend is axed and restatement in a year\u2019s time will be at an \u201cappropriate\u201d level, which could mean anything. Yet the share price rose 6%. That was a strong vote of confidence in Quinn\u2019s talents as a turnaround specialist. And, to be fair, one can see how, with more discipline in bidding for work, the tale could come good. Balfour has \u00a36.6bn of annual revenues in construction, mostly in the UK and US. At a 2%-3% profit margin, profits would be \u00a3130m-\u00a3200m, instead of today\u2019s losses. Meanwhile, the investment division \u2013 lots of completed PFI schools, hospitals and court houses \u2013 is worth \u00a31.3bn. So, on paper, and with a small sum of net cash in the mix, one can justify Balfour\u2019s market value of \u00a31.7bn. In practice, everything screams caution. Quinn\u2019s initial self-help programme \u2013 \u00a3200m of cash-flow improvement, and \u00a3100m of cost savings \u2013 will take two years. But more may be required to get back to industry standards. The passage in Quinn\u2019s statement that spoke most loudly was the one about how long Balfour has been in decline. The underlying performance has been going backwards since 2010, significant capital outflows have occurred since 2009, and the root cause is an acquisition spree that started in 2000. Undoing that history will take time. No medals for Sports Direct governance Encouraging news. Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley is prepared to explain to MPs the process by which part of the group\u2019s USC subsidiary was placed into administration in January; staff got just 15 minutes\u2019 notice that they were losing their jobs. Keith Hellawell, the retailer\u2019s chairman, made the unexpected offer during a disjointed session of the Scottish affairs committee. Mind you, let\u2019s hope Hellawell is in full possession of the facts. His other revelation was that he was unaware that Sports Direct executives had been talking to potential administrators about USC as long ago as last November. Hellawell learned about the actual administration only the day before it happened. That will not reassure those who worry about the robustness of boardroom governance at Sports Direct.",

      "bodyText": "Time to recap. Greece\u2019s efforts to avoid bankruptcy have hit another hurdle, raising the risk of default next month. Officials ruled against Athens\u2019 claim that \u20ac1.2bn of funds was wrongly taken back by the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund last month, and should be returned. That dashes hopes that the money could be used to tide Greece over the next few weeks. A spokesman explained that: \u201cThere was agreement that, legally, there was no overpayment from the [Greek bank recapitalisation fund] to the EFSF.\u201d The FT has a good take, here (\u00a3). The news weighed on Europe\u2019s stock markets, which ended the day in the red. The Euro Working Group has also given Greece until Monday to produce a credible list of reforms, before any bailout funds will be extended. The news came after Greece marked the anniversary of its 1821 battle for independence, with a military parade in Athens (photos and coverage starts here) Soldiers, tanks, fighter jets and helicopters were all deployed in a show of pride, on a rainy day in the capital. Unlike in recent years, the absence of security fences allowed thousands of Athenians to experience the event, and meet senior politicians including prime minister Alexis Tsipras afterwards. Some, though, felt the display of military might was too jingoistic. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker told MEPs he was more optimistic that a breakthrough will be reached in time. He said (via the Daily Telegraph): \u201cI have to recognise that I was very pessimistic during the last weeks because there was no progress whatsoever\u201d. \u201cBut now we are back in a normal process and I do think that we can come to a conclusion that will be both in favour of Greece, we love Greece, and the European Union\u201d. There are renewed fears, though, that Greece\u2019s banks are running out of funds - after the European Central Bank extended another couple of billion euros in emergency liquidity. Meanwhile in the UK, another Bank of England policymaker has suggested that interest rates could be cut. Kristin Forbes also believes inflation is probably turning negative this month. And unions fear job cuts after two US food giants, Kraft and Heinz, announced merger plans. Thanks, and goodnight... GW Shares in UK technology firm ARM slid 6% today, helping to push the Footse 100 index into the red. My colleague Nick Fletcher explains: Leading shares fell back below 7000 as worries about the US economy dragged down markets. Technology shares came under pressure, with chip designer Arm down 73p at \u00a311.27. Traders said growth stocks were being sold on both sides of the Atlantic, while a downgrade of Advanced Micro Devices from neutral to sell by UBS helped unsettle the semiconductor sector. And here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full market report, with details of all the main moves: Weak US data also hit shares in Europe, points out Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct: Once again it\u2019s been some worse than expected readings out of the US that have gripped the attention of traders during the session, leaving the FTSE-100 to close below the 7,000 level and the concern is whether this is the start of another rout. US durable goods data came in significantly worse than forecast, but with the Federal Reserve continuing to advocate the line that there\u2019s still room for a rate hike in the summer, some investors appear to be taking fright at the prospect. Europe\u2019s stock markets finished the day in the red. The news that Greece had lost its claim for \u20ac1.2bn from the European bailout authorities has hit sentiment, says Chris Beauchamp of IG. A resurgence of Greek woes has caught markets off guard, as the country finds its cash reserves slipping through its fingers. An attempt by the Athens government to recover \u20ac1.2 billion that it believes was incorrectly handed over has been slapped down by the rest of the eurozone, and while the ceiling on emergency liquidity has been raised, this is perhaps the most temporary of temporary measures. It seems the eurozone is now determined to push Greece to the wall and ensure that Athens cooperates. Such very public falling-outs do nothing for investor confidence, which seems to be sapping despite an eight-month high in business confidence in Germany. Shares are sliding on Wall Street, following today\u2019s decline in US durable goods sales and data showing that business investment spending plans fell for a sixth straight month in February. The head of the European Council, Donald Tusk, continues to resist holding a special summit to tackle the Greek bailout... ... while his counterpart at the Commission reckons the situation is improving. Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes has told the Evening Standard that UK inflation will probably keep falling after hitting zero last month. And if it falls too far, the BoE could cut interest rates from their current record low of 0.5%, she added Reuters has snapped the key points BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S FORBES SAYS VERY GOOD CHANCE INFLATION WILL FALL NEXT MONTH AND BE NEGATIVE - LONDON EVENING STANDARD BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S FORBES SAYS LOW INFLATION IS UNLIKELY TO PERSIST BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S FORBES SAYS STERLING STRENGTH LIKELY TO CAUSE IMPORT PRICES TO FALL FURTHER, POWERFUL TREND OF GLOBAL DISINFLATION BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S FORBES SAYS WAGES HAVE BEGUN TO PICK UP, COUNTERACTS LOW INFLATION BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S FORBES SAYS BOE CAN CUT RATES BELOW 0.5 PCT IF NEEDED TO RESPOND TO LOW PERSISTENTLY LOW INFLATION Chatter about a potential UK rate cut is growing, points out economist Sean Richards (who has been predicting for months that this could happen). Newsflash from Bloomberg: The European Central Bank has reportedly agreed to raise the emergency liquidity on offer to Greek banks, to \u20ac71bn. That\u2019s good news, as it means they shouldn\u2019t run out of funds tomorrow. But also bad news, as it suggests they continue to leak deposits as anxious savers withdraw funds. Bloomberg also has details of the conference call that took place between Greece and its lenders today -- Athens has apparently been given until Monday to produce a new programme of reforms. Yesterday, Greece said it would have this plan ready by Monday \u201cat the latest\u201d; it could be a busy weekend at the Finance Ministry..... British unions fear that the mega-merger announced between Heinz and Kraft today will lead to job losses. Unite is urgently seeking a meeting with Heinz management, to find out what the deal means for their UK operations. National officer Julia Long says: \u201cWe and our trade union colleagues in the food industry around the world know from experience that deals like this often involve job losses and ruthless cost-cutting, as global capital wants a quick return on its investment. News of this merger is a bolt from the blue for our members at Heinz. They deserve better, and we will be fighting for a better deal for them. Kraft shareholders are sharing in a $10bn special dividend, paid for by Heinz owners, Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, to ease the deal through. Workers don\u2019t get such sweeteners, though. Long says: \u201cThe fact that shareholders have been hosed down with cash, while workers seem to have been kept in the dark is concerning.\u201cWe sincerely hope that this is not the shape of things to come. These companies have worked with unions to build their prosperity in the past and need to do so in this new entity too.\u201d More than 1,000 Unite members work at Heinz\u2019s canning operation in Wigan, with others based at Hayes, Kendal, Leamington Spa, Luton, Norfolk and Telford, as well as Dundalk in the Irish Republic. The US dollar has lost ground in the currency markets after weaker than expected durable goods data hit the wires. Orders for US durable goods (such as long-lasting consumer products and machinery), fell by 1.4% in Febuary, extending the worst run since the depths of the financial crisis. This sent the euro up almost half a cent, to $1.096, and the pound up exactly half a cent to $1.49. The German finance ministry has now confirmed, to Reuters, that Greece\u2019s claim that \u20ac1.2bn of its money was wrongly taken by Brussels last month has been rebuffed. Bad news for Athens. Brussels journalists are reporting that Greece will not be receiving \u20ac1.2bn back from the European Union\u2019s bailout fund. This relates to almost \u20ac11n of unused rescue funding which Brussels recovered from Greece in February. Greece had argued that Brussels officials had wrongly taken \u20ac1.2bn which didn\u2019t actually belong to the rescue fund, and wanted it back to cover its funding needs. And here\u2019s a better picture of the tanks which rolled past the Athens parliament this morning: There was a different feel about today\u2019s Independence Day parade in Athens, as Greece\u2019s PM and president both mingled with attendees afterwards. The new government\u2019s decision to take away the security gates ouside parliament also helped, as Keep Talking Greece explains: The new Greek government decision to remove barriers and allow people to attend the parades at close range has a strong symbolism aiming to demonstrate that neither the government is afraid of protests nor the people feel the need to protest austerity. Crowds of people joined the school students\u2019 parade yesterday and the military parade in downtown Athens today. No stiff lip, no riot police around, no metro stations closed to public. More here: Greeks enjoy Independence Day parades without barriers Greek thoughts, from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch\u2019s analysts: Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has been marking Independence Day on Crete: Across the eurozone to Ireland, there are signs that the recent property boom is cooling. Prices fell by 0.4% last month, but are still almost 15% higher than a year ago -- or over 20% higher in the capital. 11:00 - IRISH RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES -0.4 PCT M/M IN FEB, UP 14.9 PCT Y/Y 11:00 - RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES IN DUBLIN -0.7 PCT M/M IN JAN, UP 21.4 PCT Y/Y Back in the corporate world, a major deal has just been announced. Consumer giants Heinz and Kraft are being merged, to create the world\u2019s fifth largest food and drinks company. The deal is orchestrated by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway group and Brazilian private equity giant 3G Capital, who together own Heinz. And what a collection of foodstuffs they bring together: More peaceful scenes now in Athens - dancers in traditional dress are performing to the crowds: The livefeed is still running. The parade is wrapping up, after scores more soldiers have marched past the parliament as Chinook helicopters and jets flashed by above them. Back in 2012, Helena wrote about the thorny issue of Greece\u2019s military budget. Worth a reread: This parade reminds me that Greece spends more on defence, as a percentage of national output, than any other EU member. And around a quarter of that bill is spent in Germany. Scores of marching soldiers continue to stream past the Greek president. I just spotted Alexis Tsipras watching the parade. Helicopters can also be spied in the distance, though the Athens rain. Glad I\u2019m not picking up the fuel bill for this affair. Fighter jets just whizzed overhead in Athens, as the military parade continues.... There\u2019s a live webfeed of the Athens parade here, showing soldiers marching past president Prokopis Pavlopoulos. Greek motorcycle police are also taking part in the Independence Day march; reigniting memories of clashes with anti-austerity protesters. The bad weather in Athens has not deterred people from attending the military parade. Tanks on the streets of Athens: Back in the UK, mortgage approvals have hit their highest level in five months. A total of 37,305 new home loans were agreed in February, the British Bankers Association reported, up from 36,517 in January. That\u2019s a bigger rise than expected. But while activity did pick up last month, it\u2019s still 20% fewer new mortgages than in February 2014 when over 46k were approved. Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports that the military parade is beginning. First, the newly-installed president of the Greek republic Pavlos Pavlopoulos is laying a wreath before the tomb of the unknown soldier, in front of the Athens parliament. Helena writes: For the first time in years barriers will be removed so that spectators can get a better glimpse of the military parade - in this case mechanised units and foot soldiers. The Greek defence leader and junior party leader Panos Kammenos is pulling out all the stops, allowing ceremonial guards from north to south to participate in the bonanza. At 10am this morning the cannons went off; three hours earlier I was woken by a military band marching up my street. The feel-good show has been somewhat doused by heavy rain and is not without controversy. Many are describing the nationalist display as harking backs to the days of the military junta and extremely kitsch. The centrist To Potami party has denounced the celebrations as being an ill-conceived cover to hide: \u201cA Greece that hurts her children, who take the road of immigration and joblessness. A Greece that hides its reality under the rug of a mouldy nationalism.\u201d The jump in German business confidence also suggests Mario Draghi\u2019s QE programme is helping to stimulate the euro economy. German companies are more upbeat, the latest survey from the IFO Institute shows, suggesting Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to expand at a fair rate. IFO\u2019s business climate index has beaten forecasts by rising to 107.9, up from February\u2019s 106.8. Economists expected a reading of 107.3. Firms are happier about current conditions (this sub-index rose from 111.3 to 112), and also more optimistic about future prospects (up to 103.9 from 102.5). IFO says the weaker euro, and the lower oil price, are giving German firms a lift; the slide in the exchange rate is giving exporters more confidence about the future, too. Geopolitical dangers remain the biggest extreme risk nagging at fund managers, according to the latest survey from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Hard to argue with, really.... The latest twists in the eurozone debt crisis haven\u2019t dented the popularity of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, according to the latest opinion polling: France\u2019s economy may be turning the corner, according to statistics body INSEE this morning. INSEE\u2019s business climate index has risen this month, suggesting that firms are more confident about prospects. It says: In March 2015, the business climate indicator is improving. The indicator, compiled from the answers of business managers in the main sectors, has moved upward, from 94 to 96, after being stable during three months. It still lies below its long-term average (100). The business climate indicator has improved by one point in services and by three points in trade. It is stable in building construction, and has lost one point in manufacturing. Greece\u2019s prime minister has returned to Athens following a two-day trip to Berlin which appears to have improved the tense relations with Germany. But now, Alexis Tsipras must address concerns within his own party over the reforms which Greece\u2019s creditors are seeking. The Kathimerini newspaper says that Tsipras will first pitch the package to the party\u2019s political secretariat in the next few days, followed by all of his party\u2019s MPs. They could object to several potential reforms: This could include the retention of the contentious ENFIA property tax for another year, albeit adjusted so that the less well-off pay less, as well as labor and pension reforms. The coalition has already sought to defuse any tension over privatizations by saying that it will only seek strategic partnerships that allow the state to retain a controlling majority. Lenders also want the special 30 percent reduction on VAT enjoyed by Greece\u2019s islands to be scrapped; another potential flashpoint. Europe\u2019s stock markets have opened calmly, as investors await the IFO survey of German business climate in an hour\u2019s time. The Eurofirst 300 index of leading shares dipped by 0.2%. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by just 3 points to 7023. Stan Shamu of IG says: Europe has been particularly interesting as Germany tries to pull the region out of a slump but some analysts remain concerned that the two-speed economy will not be easily rectified. Japanese investors are alarmed by the risk of Greece leaving the euro, and Britain leaving the European Union, reports Stephen King, HSBC\u2019s chief economist. Last night, economists at Deutsche Bank predicted that Greece will run out of funds on April 9th, when it must repay \u20ac460m to the IMF, without fresh funds. They warned that tax revenues so far this year are below target (by around \u20ac1bn), and the steady withdrawal of savings is leaving Greek banks worryingly short of liquidity. Deutsche Bank says: \u201cDeposit flight has risen to about \u20ac400 million on March 18, the highest since the Feb. 20 agreement. The risk of capital controls continues to rise.\u201d On balance, they still reckon a deal will be reached with Greece\u2019s creditors, but \u201cuncertainty will remain high\u201d in the meantime. While Greece proudly marks Independence Day, officials in Brussels will be discussing the state of the reform plan demanded by creditors, and the health of its banking sector. Officials on the Euro Working Group will hold a teleconference call to discuss how much progress has been made towards a credible economic plan to unlock much-needed bailout funds. Meanwhile, officials from the ECB will discuss the Greek banking system - and the emergency liquidity keeping it afloat. Bloomberg has the details: The European Central Bank Governing Council will hold a weekly call to assess the Emergency Liquidity Assistance keeping Greece\u2019s banking system afloat while euro-area finance ministry officials will have a separate discussion on the progress of the country\u2019s economic policy program. Without access to capital markets, or the ECB\u2019s normal financing operations, Greek banks rely on almost 70 billion euros ($76 billion) of ELA to cover a financing shortfall exacerbated by steep deposit withdrawals. While inspectors are gauging the case for continuing financial support for Europe\u2019s most-indebted nation, many Athenians will be watching a parade of battle tanks and fighter jets to mark the beginning in 1821 of the war that won independence from the Ottoman Empire. The government of George Papandreou scaled down military parades to cut costs after the Greek debt crisis erupted in 2010. Fighter jets made a comeback to the skies of Athens last year at a cost of about 500,000 euros, according to a defense ministry official from the previous administration. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. And happy Independence Day to our Greek readers, at home and abroad. Ceremonies are taking place in Greece today to commemorate the events of 1821, when revolutionaries began the battle to overthrow the Ottoman Empire and claim freedom. Well said, ambassador. Greece won\u2019t hold back on the celebrations today, with a big military parade planned, including a flypast in Athens. Yesterday, students marched through the Greek capital to mark the event too. But behind the ceremony, Greece is under growing time pressure to come up with credible reforms that will unlock aid from its creditors, before running out of cash sometime in April. It emerged last night that the European Central Bank\u2019s supervisors has written to Greek banks, instructing them not to buy any more government debt. The FT says the ECB could make the restriction legally binding. That cuts off a potential source of emergency funding for Athens. Also coming up today..... Germany\u2019s IFO institute publishes its latest business climate survey at 9am. That will show whether German firms are benefiting from the weak euro and cheap oil. At 9.30am, the British Bankers Association reveals how many UK home loans were issued last month. And this afternoon, we get the latest US durable goods report. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares fell back below 7000 as worries about the US economy dragged down markets. Technology shares came under pressure, with chip designer Arm down 73p or more than 6% at \u00a311.27. Traders said growth stocks were being sold on both sides of the Atlantic, while a downgrade of Advanced Micro Devices from neutral to sell by UBS helped unsettle the semiconductor sector. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 28.71 points lower at 6990.97 after earlier hitting 7035. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 200 points by the time London closed, after weak durable goods orders and business investment figures prompted concerns about the strength of the US economy, although there was still uncertainty about whether the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in the short term. Worries about Greece also continued to unsettle investors. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: A resurgence of Greek woes has caught markets off guard, as the country finds its cash reserves slipping through its fingers. An attempt by the Athens government to recover \u20ac1.2trn that it believes was incorrectly handed over has been slapped down by the rest of the eurozone, and while the ceiling on emergency liquidity has been raised, this is perhaps the most temporary of temporary measures. Elsewhere SABMiller slipped 20p to \u00a336.45 as analysts tried to decide whether a bid for the brewer would emerge. There had been speculation that Anheuser-Busch InBev might partner with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to make an offer for SAB, but news that 3G was involved in a deal to merge food groups Kraft and Heinz would seen to make that less likely. Mike van Dulken, head of Research at Accendo Markets, said: [The Kraft] talks likely imply a previously mooted \u00a375bn bid for SABMiller being off the table, in the near-term at least, from competitor Anheuser-Busch InBev and partner 3G (which controls a 21% Budweiser stake since the 2008 Belgian-US merger), flattening some of the sector M&amp;A fizz which had been bubbling for a while even if SAB\u2019s prospects remain strong thanks to an enviable emerging markets growth story. But Canaccord Genuity said if a deal was to be done, it would be done soon: There has been some market discussion about the likelihood of 3G teaming with ABI to bid for SABMiller. We have discounted this, since ABI has sufficient resources to bid alone, should it wish to do so - and the mooted combination of Kraft and Heinz by 3G appears far more logical from the 3G perspective. Indeed, any involvement of 3G with ABI would have been a complicating factor. We therefore reiterate our view that a bid for SABMiller by ABI remains feasible, and that this appears more likely this year than in future years. With net debt/EBITDA at 2.3 times (at December 2014) and the need to decide whether to renew the Pepsi bottling contracts in Latin America by the end of 2015, we expect pressure both from external investors and from the company\u2019s own disciplined management to result in decisive balance sheet action being taken. Tui rose 31p to \u00a312.14 after a well-received update from the travel group, but Barclays fell 6.55p to 251.90 as Investec moved from buy to hold Among the mid-caps Hunting was 34.5p higher at 534.5p after a positive note from Goldman Sachs, which said the oil services company should benefit from a rebound in US business next year, and could also be a bid target. Software group Kofax soared 229.5p to 732.5p as US group Lexmark agreed a $1bn deal to take over the UK business. Jefferies said: The strategic rational is clear, and this fulfills our prediction for Kofax being acquired by a larger consolidator. Given the significant premium at $11 a share, we recommend this transaction to investors. George O\u2019Connor at Panmure Gordon said: Lexmark buys Kofax as it doesn\u2019t want to take overseas cash back home, and pay tax on it. Nice move team Kofax. Remember London investors a nice double header here \u2013 shares re-rated as they head to the US, and then another as they get acquired. The theme should make investors think about other UK stocks where they have a decent global profile \u2013 think about SDL, for example. SDL, however, slipped 4p to 432p.",

Women account for 8.6% of all executive roles on FTSE 100 companies \u2013 an all-time high that compares with 5.5% in 2011. Recent research by the Guardian showed there are more men called John running FTSE 100 companies than all the female bosses put together. Among chief executives and chairs of FTSE 100 companies, there were 17 men called John (or Jean) \u2013 and seven women. Men called David or Dave outnumbered women by two to one. No FTSE 100 company has achieved gender parity in the boardroom. The drinks conglomerate Diageo and Intercontinental Hotels Group come closest with 45.5% female directors. In the next rank are insurance group Admiral (41.7%), outsourcing company Capita (40%) and retailer Kingfisher (40%). However, 59 FTSE 100 companies are falling below the 25% benchmark and 12 companies have only one woman on their boards. The march of gender equality has also been slower among the smaller listed companies that make up the FTSE 250 index. The percentage of female directors has risen to 18%, while the number in executive jobs is 4.6%, virtually unchanged since 2011. Twenty-three FTSE 250 companies do not have a single woman in their boardrooms, including City of London Investment Trust, Enterprise Inns, JD Sports, Supergroup and Riverstone Energy. Vince Cable, the business secretary, recently told the Guardian he would like to see a target on gender-balanced recruitment for the FTSE 250 and urged all companies to tackle the \u201cserious deficiency\u201d of women in the chief executive and chairmanship roles. Responding to the latest figures, Cable said: \u201cWe have made good progress in the last four years, and if we continue this trend in the next parliament, I would expect to exceed a third of female representation by 2020. We know that\u2019s where the tipping point lies in influencing decision-making. We must also focus on ensuring women are rising fast enough through the pipeline and taking up executive positions.\u201d But Elena Doldor at the Cranfield International Centre for Women Leaders warned that recruitment of female directors could slow down without more ambitious action from companies. \u201cOur predictions suggest that as we approach 2020, women\u2019s representation on FTSE 100 boards is likely to stagnate around 28%. There are still not enough women on executive committees or in the executive pipeline. Introducing aspirational and measurable targets for women at all levels is the only way to achieve real progress. Growing the female talent pipeline needs to be high on the agenda for every board, CEO and executive committee.\u201d In his report, Davies also called on investors to play a more active role in improving gender balance in the companies. \u201cWhile some investors lead the way in this area, many do not actively challenge companies on gender diversity at board and executive level,\u201d the report stated. Heather Jackson, founder of An Inspirational Journey, an organisation that advises companies on employee development, said: \u201cThe number and representation of women on FTSE 100 and 250 board positions in no executive roles is not the way to measure progress. The number of women attaining and developing executive and senior management roles is the way to monitor true progression.\u201d \u201cWhat is disappointing is the FTSE 250 [results] because that is where we grow our talent.\u201d She said companies needed to make more effort to nurture female middle managers. \u201cWe have got to look at ways of retaining [women], nurturing them and getting them board ready at an early age. You don\u2019t have to be an executive in your company to be a trustee or an [non-executive director] of a smaller company\u201d \u201cWe need to encourage more women to take up executive roles and encourage more chief executives to choose the right executive for the job regardless of gender.\u201d The Manufacturers\u2019 Organisation (EEF) said the Davies report reflected a wider challenge for British industry. \u201cUntil we attract more female apprenticeships, graduates and other new entrants, we will continue to see women under-represented at all levels of manufacturing, including the boardroom,\u201d EEF chief executive Terry Scuoler said. \u201cFailing to tap into this rich resource is a wasted opportunity given our sector\u2019s pressing and long-term need for skills.\u201d",
