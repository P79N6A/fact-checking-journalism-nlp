      "bodyText": "Financial markets are complacent about the risks of sharply higher interest rates that could be triggered by better than expected growth in the global economy this year, the World Bank has warned. The Washington-based organisation said that much of the rich west was running at full capacity as a result of a broad-based upswing in activity, but were now vulnerable to a period of rising inflation that would prompt action from central banks. Launching the Bank\u2019s global economic prospects, the lead author Franziska Ohnsorge said: \u201cThere could be faster than expected inflation that would mean faster than expected interest rate hikes.\u201d Ohnsorge added that stock markets were at levels similar to those seen before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, while bond markets were assuming that low inflation would keep official borrowing costs down. \u201cFinancial markets are vulnerable to unforeseen negative news. They appear to be complacent,\u201d she said, while announcing that the Bank has revised up its 2018 forecast for the global economy following a better than expected performance in the US, China, the eurozone and Japan in 2017. In its half-yearly assessment, the Bank said a recovery in manufacturing, investment and trade would mean global growth of 3.1% this year, up from the 2.9% pencilled in last June. But it warned the acceleration in growth would be temporary unless governments implemented structural reforms to raise long-term growth potential. \u201cThe broad-based recovery in global growth is encouraging, but this is no time for complacency,\u201d said Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank\u2019s president. \u201cThis is a great opportunity to invest in human and physical capital. If policy makers around the world focus on these key investments, they can increase their countries\u2019 productivity, boost workforce participation, and move closer to the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.\u201d After a prolonged period in which its forecasts have been too optimistic, the Bank raised its 2017 projection for global growth from 2.7% to 3% and revised up estimates for both 2018 and 2019. The eurozone provided the biggest positive surprise, with its growth rate in 2017 upgraded by 0.7 points to 2.4%. The World Bank said the good news would continue in 2018, raising its forecast for the year by 0.6 points to 2.1%. There were smaller growth upgrades for the US - from 2.1% to 2.3% in 2017 and from 2.2% in 2018 - and for Japan, where growth estimates were raised by 0.2 points to 1.7% in 2017 and by 0.3 points to 1.3% in 2018. Of the leading developing economies, only India performed less strongly than the World Bank anticipated last summer, with growth of 6.7% in 2017 and 7.3% in 2018 representing downgrades of 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. But China, Russia and Brazil have all been given growth upgrades by the Bank. China\u2019s expansion in 2017 is now put at 6.8%, up 0.3% on last June\u2019s estimate, with a smaller 0.1 percentage point upward revision to 6.4% this year. Russia is expected to grow by 1.7% in both 2017 and 2018, an increase of 0.4 and 0.3 points respectively, while Brazil\u2019s emergence from recession was stronger than the Bank estimated, with growth upgraded by 0.7 points to 1% in 2107 and by 0.2 points to 2% in 2018. Although heartened by the near-term growth prospects, the World Bank said its forecasts were still subject to \u201csubstantial downside risks\u201d. These included financial stress, rising protectionism and geopolitical tension. It expressed particular concern about the longer-term threats and challenges associated with weak productivity and slowing potential growth. \u201cFocus should now turn to the structural policies needed to boost longer-term productivity and living standards,\u201d the report said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Jeff Fairburn, the \u00a3110m chief executive of Persimmon, will have reflected long and hard about how it looks to receive such an enormous personal windfall at a time when executive pay and housebuilders, with their share prices inflated by help-to-buy subsidies for homebuyers, are in the political spotlight. He will have noted that Persimmon\u2019s chairman, and the head of the remuneration committee, resigned last month out of shame or embarrassment. The duo conceded, in effect, that they made a colossal error when they designed the 2012 incentive without putting a cap on rewards. They may also have been trying to exert some moral pressure on Fairburn and his executive colleagues to give up some of the gains or make a hefty public donation to charity. And here is Fairburn\u2019s considered response: I\u2019ll take the full whack, thanks, and, though I may give some to charity, that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but my own. The stance was expected, of course. But, please, spare us the bleat about how shareholders overwhelmingly approved the incentive scheme. So what if they did? City fund managers will vote for (almost) anything that implies a higher share price, but directors are meant to be able to take a broader view of a company\u2019s affairs. Persimmon is a FTSE 100 business that carries a small portion of the investments of most people saving for pensions in the UK. Closing your ears to the debate about boardroom pay shouldn\u2019t be an option. That is especially so when everybody can see that good luck played a huge role in inflating the value of the Persimmon\u2019s share price, and thus the value of the incentives. Yes, Persimmon\u2019s bosses still had to return \u00a31.5bn to shareholders but the difficulty rating fell from \u201ctricky\u201d to \u201ceasy\u201d once George Osborne unleashed help to buy, which is used in about half of the company\u2019s transactions. The Bank of England\u2019s push to ease the logjam in mortgage lending was also extremely helpful. After the Persimmon shambles, one hopes boards will remember to impose caps on long-term incentive schemes. But a better response would be to abolish long-term incentive schemes, or LTIPs, altogether. As argued here many times, LTIPs are a terrible way to measure executive performance. The value on the rewards is overly determined by the share price at the timing of the grant. Pay committees barely police the gaming of the system via share buy-backs. And, as Persimmon has demonstrated in spades, outside events introduce lottery-like features. \u201cWe conclude that LTIPs should be phased out as soon as possible,\u201d said the excellent report by the Commons business select committee last April. You will even find a few enlightened fund managers who share the view that LTIPs have failed to improve corporate performance one iota and are designed to spit out something whatever the weather. Unfortunately, the government, despite Theresa May\u2019s boasts about reforming corporate governance, then offered the most timid version of reform in its response to its own green paper. Quoted companies, it said, should \u201cprovide a clearer explanation in remuneration policies of the range of potential outcomes from complex, share-based incentive schemes\u201d. In other words, carry on much as before. Just get rid of LTIPs. Force remuneration committees to design schemes that don\u2019t produce perverse outcomes. Persimmon is an extreme example, but the whole LTIP system is rotten. City ministers hold a pointless portfolio Another year, another City minister. Stephen Barclay, now moving to health, was in post for slightly less than seven months. He was the eighth person since 2010 to hold the position, formally known as economic secretary to the Treasury. If the job is actually a non-job, why not admit as much and abolish the post? The City is hardly shy in making its views known to the Treasury and any self-respecting boss of a big bank would expect to be hauled in by the chancellor or the governor of the Bank of England, not by the City minister, in times of crisis. Besides, why is it deemed necessary for the City to have its own point-person in number 11? Isn\u2019t the Treasury supposed to managing the economy for everybody? No time for bears Albert Edwards of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is the City\u2019s best-known bearish analyst and his annual January presentation is normally a standing-room-only affair.

The duo conceded, in effect, that they made a colossal error when they designed the 2012 incentive without putting a cap on rewards. They may also have been trying to exert some moral pressure on Fairburn and his executive colleagues to give up some of the gains or make a hefty public donation to charity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/15/persimmon-bosses-must-decide-how-greedy-they-want-to-be\">Persimmon bosses must decide how greedy they want to be | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/09/persimmon-profits-chief-bonus-scheme\">And here is Fairburn\u2019s considered response</a>: I\u2019ll take the full whack, thanks, and, though I may give some to charity, that\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but my own.</p> <p>The stance was expected, of course. But, please, spare us the bleat about how shareholders overwhelmingly approved the incentive scheme.</p> <p>So what if they did? City fund managers will vote for (almost) anything that implies a higher share price, but directors are meant to be able to take a broader view of a company\u2019s affairs. Persimmon is a FTSE 100 business that carries a small portion of the investments of most people saving for pensions in the UK. Closing your ears to the debate about boardroom pay shouldn\u2019t be an option.</p> <p>That is especially so when everybody can see that good luck played a huge role in inflating the value of the Persimmon\u2019s share price, and thus the value of the incentives. Yes, Persimmon\u2019s bosses still had to return \u00a31.5bn to shareholders but the difficulty rating fell from \u201ctricky\u201d to \u201ceasy\u201d once George Osborne unleashed help to buy, which is used in about half of the company\u2019s transactions. The Bank of England\u2019s push to ease the logjam in mortgage lending was also extremely helpful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"965032d14e0f827f8596383ea95897a3470b5bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/965032d14e0f827f8596383ea95897a3470b5bd7/0_75_1800_2250/800.jpg\" alt=\"Persimmon chief Jeff Fairburn\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Persimmon chief Jeff Fairburn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Persimmon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the Persimmon shambles, one hopes boards will remember to impose caps on long-term incentive schemes. But a better response would be to abolish long-term incentive schemes, or LTIPs, altogether.</p> <p>As argued here <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/apr/05/theresa-boardroom-pay-mps\">many times</a>, LTIPs are a terrible way to measure executive performance. The value on the rewards is overly determined by the share price at the timing of the grant. Pay committees barely police the gaming of the system via share buy-backs. And, as Persimmon has demonstrated in spades, outside events introduce lottery-like features.</p> <p>\u201cWe conclude that LTIPs should be phased out as soon as possible,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/05/mps-excessive-pay-business-sports-direct\">said the excellent report by the Commons business select committee last April</a>. You will even find a few enlightened fund managers who share the view that LTIPs have failed to improve corporate performance one iota and are designed to spit out something whatever the weather.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the government, despite Theresa May\u2019s boasts about reforming corporate governance, then offered the most timid version of reform in its response to its own green paper. Quoted companies, it said, should \u201cprovide a clearer explanation in remuneration policies of the range of potential outcomes from complex, share-based incentive schemes\u201d. In other words, carry on much as before.</p> <p>Just get rid of LTIPs. Force remuneration committees to design schemes that don\u2019t produce perverse outcomes. Persimmon is an extreme example, but the whole LTIP system is rotten.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e96fc3f681b299a164cce78a58cfb29ded8be065\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e96fc3f681b299a164cce78a58cfb29ded8be065/0_132_2976_1786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"City of London skyline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There have been seven City ministers in eight years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>City ministers hold a pointless portfolio</h2> <p>Another year, another City minister.

      "bodyText": "The online takeaway company Just Eat has been criticised for introducing a 50p service charge on all payments days before its \u201crip-off\u201d fee for card transactions was due to be banned. The company, which is worth around \u00a35.4bn and has 9 million UK customers, was accused of \u201cdodging\u201d EU rules by imposing the new fee, which applies whether payment is made by cash or card. Some customers said they had deleted the Just Eat app in protest, while others called for a boycott. Just Eat makes millions of pounds a year in revenue from its 50p card payment fee \u2013 money that it was set to lose this weekend. Angry customers expressed their displeasure on Twitter and other social networks, with one claiming: \u201cAt least Dick Turpin wore a mask.\u201d The new 50p service charge took effect on Monday. The company said that applying the fee equally across the customer base \u201censures fairness for all\u201d. However, some commentators were quick to point out that the FTSE 100 firm\u2019s move comes just days before a ban on card fees takes effect. From 13 January, as a result of an EU directive, all extra charges added to payments for goods and services made with a credit or debit card will be outlawed. The Treasury has said that while so-called surcharging was common practice across the UK, these fees were \u201cunfair\u201d and a \u201crip-off\u201d. However, some commentators had warned that they expected many companies would either hike their prices to compensate for the loss of this money, or change the name of the fee to get around the rules. On Twitter, Hollie Borland claimed the new charge was a \u201csneaky way of getting around the ban on service charges for card payments\u201d, while Chris Allen said: \u201cIt just feels you\u2019re blatantly and deliberately forcing everybody to pay an additional 50p to cover the fact you can\u2019t charge those by card 50p.\u201d Just Eat revealed in 2016 that \u201cpayment card/admin fee revenue\u201d accounted for about 13% of its total revenue. With the company forecasting revenue for 2017 at between \u00a3500m and \u00a3515m, that suggests the loss of the card fee cash would have cost it more than \u00a350m. The new charge could generate even more revenue than the old one, as it applies to all orders, however they are made. The company said in a statement: \u201cAs of 8 January 2018 we have made a change to the way restaurants are charged to process Just Eat orders \u2013 a 50p service charge will be implemented for all orders. The 50p charge simply means that along with our restaurant partners, we can continue to deliver the best possible takeaway experience.\u201d Fees for paying with plastic \u2013 most commonly a credit card \u2013 are routinely levied on everything from low-cost flights and tax bills to cinema tickets and takeaway meals, but the Treasury has said these would be consigned to history from this Saturday. The ban affects official bodies and government departments as well as companies. HM Revenue &amp; Customs currently charges a fee for paying a tax bill using a credit card. It has decided that from 13 January it will no longer accept personal credit card payments. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

This year India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, will make the first speech at the event by an Indian leader. Clinton first attended the event in 2000, the forum\u2019s 30th anniversary.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With Wall Street roaring ahead again, European markets have ended the trading day on a positive note. The positive German economic data has helped sentiment in the eurozone, while the FTSE 100 has hit a new closing high thanks in no small part to a rise in retail shares. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 34.51 points or 0.45% at 7731.02 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.13% to 13,385.59 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.67% at 5523.94 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.7% better at 23,004.98 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.27% at 10,426.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.5% to 841.28 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 122 points or 0.49% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Healthcare and banking stocks are leading the way on Wall Street ahead of what is expected to be a strong reporting season. JP Morgan is the first big bank to report later this week. The UK\u2019s leading index has made it, closing at a new record high if not quite reaching an intra-day peak. The FTSE 100 finished up 34.51 points or 0.45% at 7731.02, beating last Friday\u2019s record close of 7724.22. The intra-day peak of 7733.39 was reached on Monday. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The London market has been helped along by the supermarkets as Marks and Spencer, Sainsburys and Morrisons are in demand on the back of the report from Nielsen which stated all of the \u2018big four\u2019 had a positive Christmas period. One of the main reasons for stock markets recovering so well since the financial crisis, of course, is the massive support provided by central banks in the form of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Now this support is being gradually and cautiously withdrawn, but could the process speed up, and what effect will it have on share prices? Chris Beauchamp, chief market Analyst at IG, says: Markets continue to make gains even as investors begin to consider the possibilities of more central bank tightening over the coming year and beyond. There are those wondering whether the Bank of Japan\u2019s moves overnight to ease back on bond purchases portends a bigger shift in global markets; if the world\u2019s most assiduous user of quantitative easing is itself easing back on the use of the proverbial punchbowl, will this mean that the others, especially the Fed and the ECB, will start to shift into a higher gear earlier than previously thought? At least it must be for the right reasons \u2013 only signs of real recovery would get the BoJ to move in the direction of tighter policy, and so for now stocks should remain the best way to play the global economic recovery. Meanwhile as the UK trading day enters its final straight, the FTSE 100 is tantalisingly near another record closing high. It is currently at 7725 which would not be an intra-day peak but would mark a new record close, just. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: While the FTSE ummed and ahhed over hitting new highs, the Dow Jones wasn\u2019t as shy, opening at a fresh record peak. The Dow wasn\u2019t that explosive after the bell rang on Wall Street. Yet, a 70 point rise left it tickling 25350, continuing its remarkable, seemingly unending climb. As for the afternoon\u2019s meagre data offerings, just like its non-farm cousin last Friday, the latest JOLTS job openings reading came in below estimates, at 5.88 million compared to the downward revised 5.92 million seen the month previous. The FTSE rose a half a percent throughout the day, fuelled by the Morrisons-led gains in the supermarket sector, sterling\u2019s 0.4% and 0.1% declines against the dollar and euro respectively, and a healthy set of commodity stocks. This once again leaves the UK index around the 7720 to 7730 mark, tantalisingly close to another record high \u2013 hopefully Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas update tomorrow will help the FTSE maintain the momentum it seems to have found today. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC varied in their enthusiasm. The former nudged just 0.1% higher despite a far better than forecast German industrial production figure; the latter, meanwhile, found itself trading at a 2 month peak after jumping half a percent. Bitcoin is on the slide despite the earlier comments from JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon that he regrets calling the cryptocurrency a fraud last September. Bitcoin is currently down nearly 2% at $14,708. On Monday two US companies withdrew proposals to launch bitcoin exchange-traded funds, citing concerns by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the FTSE 100 is not quite there, US markets have opened at new high. Bolstered by hopes of strong economic growth, the Trump tax reforms and the expectation of a positive reporting season which starts this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 0.26% to 25,345. The S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.13% at a record 2751 while the Nasdaq Composite is 0.24% better at a new peak of 7174. Oil prices continue to move higher, shrugging off reports that Iran\u2019s oil minister had said that Opec did not want to see crude much above $60 a barrel. At the moment, Brent crude is up 0.43% at $68.07 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is up 0.68% at $62.15. But the rally in oil prices to their highest level since May 2015 might fizzle out before too long, says Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com: Overnight saw the price of WTI crude hit its best level since May 2015, before falling back a little. Oil prices have hit the ground running at the start of this year, continuing their recovery from the middle of 2017, as global crude stockpiles fell from record high levels and due to good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and Russia. Given that the production agreement has been extended to the end of 2018 at OPEC\u2019s last meeting, the market clearly expects crude inventory levels to drop further. But with OPEC set to review the duration of oil output cuts based on fundamentals at its next meeting in June, there is a possibility they could end the agreement sooner than expected. What\u2019s more, oil prices are now at levels many regard as being high enough for US shale producers to accelerate drilling and production in the coming months. This could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their oil supply collusion until the end of the year, as many producers within OPEC itself won\u2019t be happy to lose further market share to the US. Thus, there is a risk that the agreement could end prematurely, potentially resulting in another supply war. Leading UK shares are edging to within a hair\u2019s breadth of a new intra-day peak, with the FTSE 100 up 0.47% at 7733.12. That would beat the record of 7733.39 set as long ago as .... yesterday. Retailers are leading the way after the better than expected Christmas trading update from Morrison while technology group Micro Focus has recovered some of the ground lost following disappointment with Monday\u2019s half year results. If it stays at this level it will manage a new closing high. The previous level is 7724.22, set last Friday. More retail news: troubled burger chain Byron\u2019s is reportedly planning to shut stores in a bid to cut its rental bill and keep operating. Sky News\u2019s Mark Kleinman reports: Sky News has learnt that the company will launch a so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) on Wednesday that will require the approval of creditors including landlords. The CVA is critical to Byron\u2019s future because a new injection of cash into the business, agreed last month, will only take place if the restructuring of its property interests is voted through. Sources close to the deal, which is being handled by KPMG, said the proposals were likely to involve the closure of around 15 poorly performing restaurants and a reduction of rental payments at approximately 20 others. CVA\u2019s are a popular way for struggling companies to ditch their worst-performing outlets and trim costs, making them financially viable. But if Byron\u2019s landlords reject the plan, the burger vendor could soon be out of the grill and into the fire.... Aid and development charity Oxfam has also had a good Christmas - and people in the poorest parts of the world should benefit My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Oxfam proved a Christmas hit with UK shoppers as vintage designer party clothing and first-edition books helped drive a sharp rise in online sales over the festive season. The charity said Burberry, Barbour, Gucci, Whistles and Boden were among the most popular clothing brands searched for on its online shop, where sales jumped by a third in the eight weeks to 23 December. Cameras, blankets and throws were also sought-after items. Oxfam\u2019s total sales over the period were \u00a316.9m, up 1.2% on the same period in 2016. The charity said the extra money raised was enough to provide clean, safe water for almost 200,000 people in an emergency. More here: JP Morgan\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, seems to have eaten some bitcoin humble pie. Dimon has told Fox News that he \u2018regretted\u2019 labelling bitcoin as a fraud last September - a comment that enraged (or amused) cyber-currency supporters. But while he acknowledges that the blockchain that underpins bitcoin has real uses, he insists he still isn\u2019t very interested in the whole issue of digital currencies. As Dimon put it: \u201cThe blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO\u2019s [initial coin offerings - or new digital coins] you have to look at individually. The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I\u2019m not interested that much in the subject at all.\u201d Dimon also backed Donald Trump\u2019s new tax reforms -- arguing that the president was right to almost halve US corporation tax to 21%. The old 40% tax rate was a \u201chuge disadvantage\u201d to America, Dimon argued, driving capital and skilled labour overseas. In the long run, the cut will help firms to grow their businesses and invest in research and development, Dimon insists. Critics of the tax reforms, though, argue that they will mainly benefit high-earners, and end up costing middle-class Americans in the long term. And here\u2019s a reminder of how bitcoin shrugged off Dimon\u2019s warning: Technology site The Register has a good scoop -- apparently Britain\u2019s City watchdog has (perhaps accidentally) banned workers across the financial services industry from using their own phones and computers for work. It\u2019s all to do with the new MIFID II directive; designed to prevent market abuse which came into force this week. The FCA seems to have enforced the new rules with excessive zeal. The Reg\u2019s Gareth Corfield explains: The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority has quietly transposed an EU rule without including a crucial bit of detail, thus effectively banning BYOD [bring your own device] policies in all financial services organisations across Blighty. The UK version of the rule, which came into force on January 1, prohibits any business regulated by the FCA from letting its employees communicate with each other or the outside world \u201con privately owned equipment which the firm is unable to record or copy\u201d. However, the original version of the rule, contained in the European Union\u2019s Market In Financial Instruments Directive (MIFID II), restricted this only to investment firms \u2013 not applying it to the entire financial sector. The FCA regulates financial services firms ranging in size from behemoths such as Goldman Sachs right down to independent financial advisers who tell ordinary folk where best to put their savings and investments. The body uses powers contained in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) to implement conduct and prudential rules, among these directives received from EU. It then sets out these rules in its handbook. This is how what should have been a BYOD rule affecting only part of the market has been turned into a blanket ruling on BYOD affecting everyone \u2013 right down to self-employed advisers. But before you chuck your phone in the bin, the FCA has since clarified that individuals can bring their own devices to work after all. However, bosses must take all reasonable steps to prevent them using them to send or receive unrecorded messages or calls. Another headache for the IT manager..... Germany\u2019s government is optimistic about growth prospects in 2018: The decline in eurozone unemployment will please the European Central Bank. ECB president Mario Draghi has often cited falling joblessness as a defence of his stimulus policies, which cut interest rates to record lows and pumped trillions of euros into the economy. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, reckons Draghi can feel vindicated, in the face of criticism from some politicians (particularly in Germany). But there could be more challenges ahead.... \u201cLower unemployment sets the field for wage growth and ultimately higher inflation, so the euro should be in demand with traders today. \u201cDraghi has successfully navigated the eurozone through a particularly tricky period, and its economic prospects look strong. However, with further political instability brewing in both Spain and Germany, not to mention uncertainty surrounding Brexit, some continue to ask what lies beneath this millpond?\u201d This is an significant moment: Unemployment among young people across the eurozone has also fallen, but the job isn\u2019t finished yet. The euro-area jobless rate dropped to 18.2% in November, down from 20.5% a year ago. But again, some countries are in much better shape than others: In November 2017, the lowest rates were observed in the Czech Republic (5.0%) and Germany (6.6%), while the highest were recorded in Greece (39.5% in September 2017), Spain (37.9%) and Italy (32.7%). The unemployment rate across the wider European Union has fallen to a nine-year low of 7.3%, down from 7.4%. Over the last 12 months, unemployment in the EU has dropped by 2.133 million people, and by 1.561 million in the euro area. But before anyone gets carried away, there are still 18.116 million men and women unemployed in the EU, including 14.263 million in the eurozone. Newsflash: Unemployment across the eurozone has hit its lowest rate on almost nine years. The euro-area jobless rate fell to 8.7% in November, down from 8.8% in October. That\u2019s the best reading since January 2009, when the global economy was crashing into recession. But... there are still sharp differences between euro-area members. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.5%), and Malta and Germany (both 3.6%). While in Greece, more than one in five people (20.5%) are out of work, followed by Spain with a 16.7% jobless rate. More to follow.... City analysts are welcoming today\u2019s strong German economic data, particularly the 3.4% jump in industrial production in November. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics says German seems to be ending 2017 \u201cwith a bang\u201d. She writes: \u201cNovember\u2019s surge in German industrial production is a welcome confirmation that the economy approached the end of 2017 in very good health and the surveys point to further strength to come. Mark Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees, saying: Better than expected German Trade and Production data affirmed what is already well known, i.e. that the German economy is in rude health. It\u2019s great to see Majestic Wine and Morrison\u2019s bosses praising their hard-working employees this morning. But a cynic might wonder whether they\u2019re partly motivated by a fear of losing them. Recruitment firms say that UK companies are finding it harder and harder to find skilled staff - putting a real premium on retaining workers. Kevin Green, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says it\u2019s the worst situation in at least a decade. \u201cWe have lists where recruiters cite the jobs they are currently finding it hard to fill, in permanent jobs there used to be six or seven areas. Now there are 50 or 60. It goes on and on and on. \u201cIt is comprehensive, you would have to say the skill and talent shortages are pervasive across the economy at the moment.\u201d This tightening labour market is good news for employees, as they should be able to negotiate significant pay rise. Warm words in the Christmas trading updates won\u2019t be enough! The Telegraph has the details: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on the brink of a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has gained 33 points to 7,729 points, just 4 point shy of yesterday\u2019s intraday peak. Majestic Wine is also highlighting its staff\u2019s cheerful nature in the face of customers seeking the perfect Pinot Grigio or Pomerol for the Christmas festivities. Britain\u2019s largest wine retailer grew its like-for-like sales by 4.1% over the 10-week Christmas period, including a 1.3% rise at its retail outlets. CEO Rowan Gormley says Majestic, which also owns online retailer Naked Wines, is on track to hit City forecasts: \u201cThe team performed brilliantly. The fact that we have been able to grow sales and maintain margins shows that our winning formula of fabulous customer service from delightful people and delicious wines at fair prices works even when times are tough. 15 months ago, Majestic Wine hit its shareholders with a profits warning, so Gormley hopefully enjoyed a better Christmas this time around. Christmas can be a stressful time for shoppers and shop-workers alike. So it\u2019s interesting that Morrisons reckons its staff\u2019s cheery demeanour boosted its sales over the festive period. It says: Customer satisfaction again improved year-on-year \u2212 we had more tills open, shorter queues, and customers noticed our colleagues\u2019 friendliness even at the busiest times. The Evening Standard\u2019s Alex Lawson doesn\u2019t sound convinced: Neil Wilson of ETX Capital is impressed by Morrisons\u2019 sales growth over Christmas. He suspects that investors who bet against Britain\u2019s fourth-largest supermarket will soon have burned fingers, following this morning\u2019s financial results. \u201cThe market has not really been buying into Morrisons\u2019 recent run of form, but yet another very impressive trading statement that has beaten expectations comfortably could turn the tide of opinion. Eight straight quarters of sales growth, yet shares were last trading c8% off the highs last February. That may change now and the shorts could face a big squeeze this morning. Short interest is quite high so this share could pop if they throw in the towel and finally buy into David Potts and co\u2019s strategy, which is clearly paying off. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says Morrisons has a \u201cmega\u201d Christmas: For the 10 weeks to 7th January the smallest of the Big Four supermarkets smashed expectations, posting a 2.8% surge in like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) against the 1.7% rise forecast Breaking down the figures further and Morrisons had plenty to smile about; its Best premium range jumped 25%, suggesting savvy branding on the supermarket\u2019s behalf, while online sales, which include those made through Amazon Fresh, were up 10%. These figures sent the Northern favourite nearly 4.5% higher to a 3 month peak, and set a high bar to clear for Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, all of whom report this week. Supermarket chain Morrisons has smashed City forecasts for the crucial Christmas period, sending its shares jumping. Morrisons grew its like-for-like sales by 2.8% over the last 10 weeks, beating expectations of 1.7% growth. The Christmas and New Year period was particularly strong, with sales surging by 3.7% CEO David Potts says his turnaround plan is bearing fruits: \u201cMore and more customers found more things they wanted to buy at competitive prices at Morrisons this Christmas. The hard work and friendliness of our colleagues continues to be key in delivering our strengthening performance, and I would like to thank them for everything they do for our customers.\u201d Shares have jumped by 4% in early trading, as Morrison\u2019s cements its place as a Christmas winner. More reaction to follow.... European stock markets have opened higher, with the jump in German industrial production cheering traders. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: European markets are trading higher as investors have reacted to positive German industrial data. The number was simply astonishing, and it printed the reading of 3.4% when the market was expecting a number of 1.8%. But Maxime Sbaihi of Bloomberg is a little more cautious: Germany\u2019s factory sector has staged a \u201cstrong comeback\u201d, says analyst Carsten Brzeski of ING. He points out that these industrial production figures have been volatile - but the trend is positive, suggesting Germany isn\u2019t being held back by pick-up in the euro exchange rate. Brzeski writes: German industry has gone through a small rollercoaster ride since the start of the summer. Disappointing numbers were followed by impressive rebounds. Behind the vacation and weather driven white noise of monthly data, however, there is a clear upward trend. Up to now, 2017 industrial production has had its best year since 2011. Contrary to earlier cycles, industrial production has been a lagging, rather than a leading indicator for the German recovery. The strengthening of the euro exchange rate since April 2017 has left the German export sector unharmed. The geographic diversity of German exports once again seems to be the key to success. Particularly, Germany\u2019s close and distant neighbours in the East have safeguarded this year\u2019s export revival. Germany currently exports as much to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic as it does to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Exports to China have also rebounded this year. At the same time, the US remains the single most important export destination, while exports to the UK are becoming less important. More here: We also have new German trade figures - and they\u2019re also stronger than expected. German companies grew their exports by a sparkling 4.1% in November, well ahead of forecast of a 1.2% gain. Imports also rose too, by 2.3%, ahead of forecasts of a 0.8% rise. The seasonally adjusted data suggests that German manufacturers and service companies benefitted from the growing global economy, and that domestic demand was also solid. Germany\u2019s foreign trade balance swelled to a surplus of \u20ac23.7bn in November 2017, up from \u20ac22.0bn a year earlier. It ran a surplus with its fellow EU members, and with the rest of the world. Here\u2019s the details: In November 2017, Germany exported goods to the value of \u20ac67.9bn to the Member States of the European Union (up 8%), while it imported goods to the value of \u20ac62.1bn from those countries (up 9.5%) Exports of goods to countries outside the European Union (third countries) amounted to \u20ac48.5bn in November 2017 (up 8.4%), while imports from those countries totalled \u20ac30.7bn euros (up 5.9%). On an annual basis, German industrial output growth hit a six-year high. Germany\u2019s economy has smashed forecasts this morning, with a big jump in factory output. German industrial production rose by 3.4% in November, new figures from statistics body Destatis show. That\u2019s the biggest monthly rise since September 2009, suggesting Europe\u2019s largest economy picked up pace late last year. Factories reported a surge in demand for heavy-duty machinery, vehicles and other equipment (capital goods), with consumer products also in demand. Destatis explains: Within industry, the production of capital goods increased by 5.7% and the production of consumer goods by 3.6%. The production of intermediate goods showed an increase by 3.0%. Energy production was down by 3.1% in November 2017 and the production in construction increased by 1.5%. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics is impressed: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today, we\u2019ll find out if supermarket chain Morrisons, drinks business Majestic Wine and floorings business Topps Tiles were festive winners and losers, as they report their Christmas trading figures. Housebuilder Persimmon is also updating the City. New eurozone jobless figures are due this morning, which may show that unemployment in Europe has hit a new eight-year low of 8.7%. Otherwise there\u2019s not much on the economic calendar. Stock markets remain at record levels again this morning, as the global rally in shares continues. City investors will also be digesting yesterday\u2019s cabinet reshuffle, which frankly looks like a mess after health secretary Jeremy Hunt dug his heels in and refused to move, and education secretary Justine Greening quit rather than take a new role. It wasn\u2019t exactly an exhibition of prime ministerial authority from Theresa May, says Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit. The agenda: 10am: Eurozone unemployment rate for November.",

The intra-day peak of 7733.39 was reached on Monday. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The London market has been helped along by the supermarkets as Marks and Spencer, Sainsburys and Morrisons are in demand on the back of the report from Nielsen which stated all of the \u2018big four\u2019 had a positive Christmas period. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54e854e4b034b6630d21b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T16:08:52.022Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the main reasons for stock markets recovering so well since the financial crisis, of course, is the massive support provided by central banks in the form of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Now this support is being gradually and cautiously withdrawn, but could the process speed up, and what effect will it have on share prices? Chris Beauchamp, chief market Analyst at IG, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets continue to make gains even as investors begin to consider the possibilities of more central bank tightening over the coming year and beyond. There are those wondering whether the Bank of Japan\u2019s moves overnight to ease back on bond purchases portends a bigger shift in global markets; if the world\u2019s most assiduous user of quantitative easing is itself easing back on the use of the proverbial punchbowl, will this mean that the others, especially the Fed and the ECB, will start to shift into a higher gear earlier than previously thought?</p> <p>At least it must be for the right reasons \u2013 only signs of real recovery would get the BoJ to move in the direction of tighter policy, and so for now stocks should remain the best way to play the global economic recovery.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54e315e4b043ead794bd64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T15:45:19.743Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile as the UK trading day enters its final straight, the FTSE 100 is tantalisingly near another record closing high.</p> <p>It is currently at 7725 which would not be an intra-day peak but would mark a new record close, just. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the FTSE ummed and ahhed over hitting new highs, the Dow Jones wasn\u2019t as shy, opening at a fresh record peak.</p> <p>The Dow wasn\u2019t <em>that</em> explosive after the bell rang on Wall Street. Yet, a 70 point rise left it tickling 25350, continuing its remarkable, seemingly unending climb. As for the afternoon\u2019s meagre data offerings, just like its non-farm cousin last Friday, the latest JOLTS job openings reading came in below estimates, at 5.88 million compared to the downward revised 5.92 million seen the month previous.</p> <p>The FTSE rose a half a percent throughout the day, fuelled by the Morrisons-led gains in the supermarket sector, sterling\u2019s 0.4% and 0.1% declines against the dollar and euro respectively, and a healthy set of commodity stocks. This once again leaves the UK index around the 7720 to 7730 mark, tantalisingly close to another record high \u2013 hopefully Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas update tomorrow will help the FTSE maintain the momentum it seems to have found today.</p> <p>Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC varied in their enthusiasm. The former nudged just 0.1% higher despite a far better than forecast German industrial production figure; the latter, meanwhile, found itself trading at a 2 month peak after jumping half a percent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a54df85e4b043ead794bd3d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T15:32:18.623Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bitcoin is on the slide despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/09/german-industrial-output-exports-eurozone-unemployment-morrisons-majestic-business-live?page=with:block-5a54ab6ee4b043ead794bad6#block-5a54ab6ee4b043ead794bad6\">the earlier comments </a>from JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon that he regrets calling the cryptocurrency a fraud last September.</p> <p>Bitcoin is currently down nearly 2% at $14,708.

But the rally in oil prices to their highest level since May 2015 might fizzle out before too long, says Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overnight saw the price of WTI crude hit its best level since May 2015, before falling back a little. Oil prices have hit the ground running at the start of this year, continuing their recovery from the middle of 2017, as global crude stockpiles fell from record high levels and due to good compliance with the production cuts by OPEC and Russia. Given that the production agreement has been extended to the end of 2018 at OPEC\u2019s last meeting<strong>, </strong>the market clearly expects crude inventory levels to drop further.</p> <p>But with OPEC set to review the duration of oil output cuts based on fundamentals at its next meeting in June, there is a possibility they could end the agreement sooner than expected. What\u2019s more, oil prices are now at levels many regard as being high enough for US shale producers to accelerate drilling and production in the coming months. This could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their oil supply collusion until the end of the year, as many producers within OPEC itself won\u2019t be happy to lose further market share to the US. Thus, there is a risk that the agreement could end prematurely, potentially resulting in another supply war. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T14:39:50.029Z\">at 2.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a54cb1de4b006063846c1d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T14:04:40.811Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Leading UK shares are edging to within a hair\u2019s breadth of a new intra-day peak, with the FTSE 100 up 0.47% at 7733.12.</p> <p>That would beat the record of 7733.39 set as long ago as .... yesterday.

It then sets out these rules in its handbook.</p> <p>This is how what should have been a BYOD rule affecting only part of the market has been turned into a blanket ruling on BYOD affecting everyone \u2013 right down to self-employed advisers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>But before you chuck your phone in the bin, the FCA has since clarified that individuals can bring their own devices to work after all.</strong> However, bosses must take all reasonable steps to prevent them using them to send or receive unrecorded messages or calls. </p> <p>Another headache for the IT manager.....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GazTheJourno/status/950307088928051200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Financial Conduct Authority &#39;gold-plates&#39; EU <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIFID?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIFID</a> II rule, bans BYOD across entire UK finance sector &lt;- exclusive by me <a href=\"https://t.co/9iHT4O6UFC\">https://t.co/9iHT4O6UFC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kUnTnaxVCz\">pic.twitter.com/kUnTnaxVCz</a></p>&mdash; Gareth Corfield (@GazTheJourno) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GazTheJourno/status/950307088928051200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 8, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:46:56.752Z\">at 11.46am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a54a14ee4b006063846c014\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:03:16.957Z\">11.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Germany\u2019s government is optimistic about growth prospects in 2018:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HandelsblattGE/status/950683947142348805\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Germany\u2019s government expects the economy to grow this year at around the same rate as last year, when it expanded by 2.2%. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/newsdesk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#newsdesk</a></p>&mdash; Handelsblatt Global (@HandelsblattGE) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HandelsblattGE/status/950683947142348805?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 9, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a549bd1e4b034b6630d1e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-09T11:01:33.251Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/09/german-industrial-output-exports-eurozone-unemployment-morrisons-majestic-business-live?page=with:block-5a5492e7e4b034b6630d1e18#block-5a5492e7e4b034b6630d1e18\">The decline in eurozone unemployment</a> will please the European Central Bank.</strong></p> <p>ECB president Mario Draghi has often cited falling joblessness as a defence of his stimulus policies, which cut interest rates to record lows and pumped trillions of euros into the economy.</p> <p><strong>Dennis de Jong</strong>, managing director at<strong> <a href=\"http://www.ufx.com/\">UFX.com</a>,</strong> reckons Draghi can feel vindicated, in the face of criticism from some politicians (particularly in Germany).

Behind the vacation and weather driven white noise of monthly data, however, there is a clear upward trend. Up to now, 2017 industrial production has had its best year since 2011.

Germany currently exports as much to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic as it does to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Exports to China have also rebounded this year.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon has insisted he deserves his \u00a3110m bonus because he has \u201cworked very hard\u201d to reinvigorate the housing market. Jeff Fairburn collected the first \u00a350m worth of shares on New Year\u2019s Eve from the record-breaking bonus scheme that has been described as \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201ccorporate looting\u201d. He will qualify for another \u00a360m of profits from the scheme this year. Speaking for the first time since the award was confirmed, he repeatedly refused to state whether or not he intends to donate any of the money to charity. \u201cI consider my plans for any charitable giving to be a private matter and I do not wish to comment any further on that,\u201d Fairburn said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put this into context of what has been achieved. I do fully accept that the potential payouts under the scheme for top individuals are very significant. \u201cThe scheme is about 140 individuals, and it\u2019s always a team effort,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course I\u2019m responsible at the end of the day and the business has done very well. We\u2019ve worked very hard as a team to get to where we are now, and we continue to be invigorated and we continue to push the business forward.\u201d The scheme \u2013 believed to be Britain\u2019s most generous-ever bonus payout \u2013 will hand more than \u00a3500m to those 140 senior staff. More than 80 are expected to receive payouts in excess of \u00a31m. The finance director, Mike Killoran, is to receive \u00a386m and the managing director, Dave Jenkinson, is in line for \u00a348m. The scale of Fairburn\u2019s bonus has drawn criticism from politicians, charities and corporate governance experts. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d, adding that it was an outrage that Fairburn could profit so much from a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d \u2013 a reference to the help-to-buy scheme introduced in 2013 by former chancellor George Osborne to help homebuyers. More than half the homes sold by York-based Persimmon last year went to help-to-buy recipients, meaning government money helped finance the sales. Persimmon\u2019s share price has nearly tripled since help to buy launched in April 2013. \u201cIt is reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored,\u201d Cable said. Garry White, the chief investment commentator at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, said the scale of the bonuses meant the Persimmon management \u201ccould easily be accused of corporate looting\u201d. Persimmon\u2019s chair, Nicolas Wrigley, resigned last month stating that he regretted not putting a cap on the bonus scheme and was leaving \u201cin recognition of this omission\u201d. Wrigley is understood to have put pressure on Fairburn to donate some of his bonus to charity. The Guardian has calculated that just a fraction of Fairburn\u2019s bonus could build enough homes to end homelessness in York. A donation of \u00a34.6m \u2013 just 4% of Fairburn\u2019s bonus \u2013 could provide a home for all of the 58 homeless families in the city. Fairburn said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the charitable causes Persimmon supports but was unable to name any of the charities. The company donated \u00a31.1m to charity last year, far below the average FTSE 100 company donation of \u00a33.8m. In a trading update on Tuesday, Persimmon said it had sold 16,043 homes last year for a total of \u00a33.42bn, a 9% increase on 2016. As a result of the increase in sales, \u201cwe anticipate our pre-tax profits for the year will be modestly ahead of market consensus\u201d, the company said. Analysts expect the company to post a 20% increase in full-year profits to about \u00a3957m, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Persimmon will publish its full-year results on 27 February.",

Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the \u201cscale of this bonus is obscene\u201d, adding that it was an outrage that Fairburn could profit so much from a \u201cgovernment subsidy\u201d \u2013 a reference to the help-to-buy scheme introduced in 2013 by former chancellor George Osborne to help homebuyers. </p> <p>More than half the homes sold by York-based Persimmon last year went to help-to-buy recipients, meaning government money helped finance the sales. Persimmon\u2019s share price has nearly tripled since help to buy launched in April 2013.</p> <p> \u201cIt is reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored,\u201d Cable said.</p> <p>Garry White, the chief investment commentator at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, said the scale of the bonuses meant the Persimmon management \u201ccould easily be accused of corporate looting\u201d.</p> <p>Persimmon\u2019s chair, Nicolas Wrigley, resigned last month stating that he regretted not putting a cap on the bonus scheme and was leaving \u201cin recognition of this omission\u201d. Wrigley is understood to have put pressure on Fairburn to donate some of his bonus to charity.<br></p> <p>The Guardian has calculated that just a fraction of Fairburn\u2019s bonus could <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/30/a-fraction-of-persimmon-bosss-110m-bonus-could-house-all-homeless-of-york\">build enough homes to end homelessness in York</a>. A donation of \u00a34.6m \u2013 just 4% of Fairburn\u2019s bonus \u2013 could provide a home for all of the 58 homeless families in the city.</p> <p>Fairburn said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the charitable causes Persimmon supports but was unable to name any of the charities. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.persimmonhomes.com/charity\">The company donated \u00a31.1m to charity last year</a>, far below the average FTSE 100 company donation of \u00a33.8m.</p> <p>In a trading update on Tuesday, Persimmon said it had sold 16,043 homes last year for a total of \u00a33.42bn, a 9% increase on 2016. As a result of the increase in sales, \u201cwe anticipate our pre-tax profits for the year will be modestly ahead of market consensus\u201d, the company said.</p> <p>Analysts expect the company to post a 20% increase in full-year profits to about \u00a3957m, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.

      "bodyText": "Fracking firm Cuadrilla has been given the go-ahead to explore for oil near a West Sussex village that was the site of the UK\u2019s biggest anti-fracking protests. The approval came as another shale company said it was planning a legal challenge against Scotland\u2019s fracking ban. Thousands of campaigners besieged Balcombe five years ago when Cuadrilla last tried to extract oil at the Lower Stumble site, igniting a national anti-fracking movement. The company eventually scrapped its plans but recently applied for planning permission to test how much oil will flow from an existing well. West Sussex county council\u2019s planning committee voted unanimously on Tuesday to approve the application, which opponents said defied local opinion. Brenda Pollack, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis is devastating news for villagers and everyone who wants a clean and safe environment to live in.\u201d Green party co-leader, Caroline Lucas, who was arrested during the protests at Balcombe in 2013, called the decision \u201cbad, bad news\u201d. Residents at the county hall meeting in Chichester spoke out against the tests, citing concerns over air and water pollution, and traffic. Balcombe parish council, which has voted unanimously against Cuadrilla\u2019s application, said the approval was against local people\u2019s wishes. More than 2,700 objections were received against the proposal, with 11 in favour. However, one local resident suggested traffic concerns were unfounded and there were probably more vehicle movements from deliveries of logs for people\u2019s wood burning stoves than from the well. Another resident, Rodney Jago, backed the proposal and said previous drilling in the village had not caused any damage. Cuadrilla told the meeting it had scrapped previous plans at the site because of the fall in oil prices in 2014, but was confident it would act this time. The approval by West Sussex county council, recommended by its planning officers, is not permission for fracking. Cuadrilla has said the site does not need fracking because the rock is naturally fractured. If it did want to frack, it would have to secure further consents. Under conditions imposed by the council, Cuadrilla will have to establish a community liaison group. Work is expected to start within two years, and the site will be restored to its original state afterwards. On Tuesday it also emerged that Scotland\u2019s fracking ban faces a legal challenge after energy company Ineos said it would seek a judicial review to overturn the moratorium. The Scottish government imposed the temporary ban last October, justifying it on the grounds that using fracking to extract oil and gas would have little economic benefit but undermine climate change efforts. Ineos has previously said the decision was not science-based, but the move towards legal action marks a considerable escalation. Tom Pickering, operations director at Ineos Shale, said: \u201cThe decision in October was a major blow to Scottish science and its engineering industry, as well as being financially costly to Ineos, other businesses and indeed the nation as a whole.\u201d Ineos believes it can win a case if the Scottish court of session approves a legal challenge, claiming the government made errors in the decision-making process. Of the 1.32m acres of shale licences held by Ineos, around 180,000 are in Scotland, with the rest in England. The petrochemicals firm owns Scotland\u2019s only crude oil refinery, at Grangemouth, and last year entrenched its interests in oil and gas, buying a North Sea pipeline and Danish oil rigs. Mary Church, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: \u201cIneos\u2019s legal challenge against the Scottish government\u2019s ban on fracking reeks of desperation from an industry that is failing to get results anywhere in Scotland, the UK or elsewhere in Europe.\u201d Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said: \u201cWe have taken a careful and considered approach to arriving at our preferred policy on unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.\u201d The Scottish Conservatives supported the move by Ineos. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Virgin Trains operates the west coast mainline, which includes trains from London to Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and Scotland. The Daily Mail was one of a limited collection of newspapers and magazines that the train operator sold in its on-board shop. But in an internal memo, it told staff it would stop stocking the title, saying its employees had raised concerns \u201cabout the Mail\u2019s editorial position on issues such as immigration, LGBT rights and unemployment\u201d. The Daily Mail hit back at Virgin Trains, say it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the company had announced it was \u201ccensoring the choice of newspapers it offers to passengers\u201d when the taxpayer was being forced to bail out Virgin\u2019s East Coast franchise. Virgin Trains is a separate rail franchise to Virgin Trains East Coast, however both are joint ventures backed by the transport company Stagecoach and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin. Stagecoach and Virgin are terminating their agreement to run the east coast line early, potentially saving the companies as much as \u00a32bn in payments to the government. Branson defended the move last week, saying Virgin and Stagecoach had lost more than \u00a3100m running the route and upgrades to the line promised by the government had been delayed. The Daily Mail has been critical of the government and Branson over the debacle. A column by Alex Brummer, the City editor, on 3 January was headlined: \u201cThe final insult after soaring rail fares? Now you\u2019ll pick up the bill for bailing out Branson!\u201d A spokesperson for the Daily Mail said: \u201cIt is disgraceful that, at a time of massive customer dissatisfaction over ever-increasing rail fares, and after the taxpayer was forced to bail out Virgin\u2019s East Coast mainline franchise \u2013 a decision strongly criticised by the Mail \u2013 that Virgin Trains should now announce that for political reasons it is censoring the choice of newspapers it offers to passengers. \u201cFor the record, Virgin used to sell only 70 Daily Mails a day. They informed us last November that to save space, they were restricting sales to just three newspapers: the Mirror, FT and Times. They gave no other reason, but it may be no coincidence that all those titles, like Virgin owner Sir Richard Branson, are pro-remain.\u201d The internal memo from Virgin Trains was first reported by the trade magazine PR Week. The memo said: \u201cDifferent viewpoints are often valuable, and it\u2019s certainly true that we choose to take our news from different sources depending on our view of the world. \u201cThousands of people choose to read the Daily Mail every day. But they will no longer be reading it courtesy of VT [Virgin Trains]. \u201cThere\u2019s been considerable concern raised by colleagues about the Mail\u2019s editorial position on issues such as immigration, LGBT rights, and unemployment. We\u2019ve decided that this paper is not compatible with the VT brand and our beliefs. We won\u2019t be stocking the Daily Mail for sale or as a giveaway.\u201d A spokesperson for Virgin Trains confirmed the move, saying: \u201cWe regularly review the products we have on sale for customers in the shop onboard our west coast trains and after listening to feedback from our people, we decided in November 2017 that we would no longer stock copies of the Daily Mail. When we stocked the Daily Mail onboard, we sold one copy for every four trains.\u201d Virgin Trains\u2019 decision to stop selling the Daily Mail comes after the stationery and greetings cards retailer Paperchase apologised for running a front-page promotion in the Daily Mail and pledged not to advertise in the newspaper again. The campaign group Stop Funding Hate had encouraged Paperchase customers to express their disappointment with the retailer after the promotion appeared. In response the Daily Mail said it was deeply worrying that Paperchase had allowed itself to be bullied by a \u201csmall group of hard-left Corbynist individuals seeking to suppress legitimate debate\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "UK shoppers spend \u00a31bn more on groceries at Christmas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumers spent \u00a31bn extra on groceries this Christmas as they shrugged off concerns about the economy to increase sales by 3.8%, slightly ahead of inflation. Aldi and Lidl were the biggest winners, both increasing sales by 16.8% in the three months to 31 December, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel. They were able to attract 1 million more shoppers over the period as people tried to reduce the effect of Brexit-induced inflation by seeking out cheaper versions of everyday essentials. The four major supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 all lost market share but still increased sales, partly thanks to food price inflation of 3.7% in the 12 weeks. They also benefited from a late rush. Shoppers parted with \u00a3747m on 22 December alone, making the Friday before Christmas the busiest groceries shopping day ever recorded, according to Kantar. Tesco was the fastest-growing of the big four supermarkets, with sales up 3.1% during overt the 12 weeks. This was the fastest sales growth the retailer had achieved since June, helped by a 6.4% increase in sales of its standard own-label products. Sainsbury\u2019s was the worst performer of the big four supermarket groups, according to Kantar. The chain is set to reveal its Christmas trading performance to the City on Wednesday, followed by Tesco on Thursday. Marks &amp; Spencer, which is expected to update the City on its festive trading on Thursday, held market share as it increased sales by 3.6% according to separate figures released by analysis firm Nielsen. On Tuesday, Morrisons said strong sales of premium foods, children\u2019s clothes and bags of vegetables helped it enjoy a better-than-expected Christmas. Sales rose by 2.8% in the 10 weeks to 7 January, well ahead of the 1.7% expected by analysts. Sales were even stronger in the last six weeks of that period, rising by 3.7%. The UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket said it had fought off cost inflation to hold prices steady on a basket of 100 key Christmas items including turkey crowns and mince pies. It increased the total number of items sold as it kept overallfood price rises in its stores below the average industry rate. Sales of Morrisons\u2019 premium The Best range soared by 25% and it sold 8.8% more bags of Christmas vegetables with a three-for-\u00a31 deal. Trade was also boosted by good sales of its Nutmeg range of children\u2019s and babies\u2019 clothes, and the expansion of its wholesale business through outlets at Rontec petrol stations and via Amazon. It also won new business in providing tobacco products to McColl\u2019s stores that were let down by the collapse of wholesaler Palmer &amp; Harvey in late November. Online sales increased by 10% as Morrisons began delivering to more parts of the country with its partner Ocado. The majority of Morrisons\u2019 online sales are delivered from Ocado\u2019s warehouse in Dordon, Warwickshire. \u201cThis is a good start for UK food retail,\u201d said Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research. But he said excitement should be tempered as it was not clear how much Morrisons had been helped by its recent move into selling non-food items, an area which many of its rivals have been exploiting for years. Despite the better than expected sales, Morrisons said it did not expect to exceed current predictions of a 10% rise in profits this year to \u00a3371m, as it had invested in keeping prices competitive. Morrisons chief executive, David Potts, said there was no obvious sign that Brexit had hit consumer sentiment but shoppers \u201cwere on the lookout for great value\u201d. \u201cWe feel well placed to provide that and the numbers appear to confirm it,\u201d he added. With three consecutive years of sales growth under its belt, Potts said Morrisons would look at opening a handful of new stores, after a period of closures. The growing wholesale business was part of the \u201cbroader, stronger Morrisons\u201d he wanted to build. He said: \u201cThis is the start of the journey.\u201d Morrisons has begun supplying McColl\u2019s with a range of own-label items under the Safeway brand, which Morrisons owns. It began deliveries to 25 stores and will add 25 more stores a week over the coming year. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "High street spending in the run-up to Christmas increased at the slowest rate since 2012 after spiralling prices forced shoppers to spend more of their earnings on food and essential items. Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) sent a worrying signal to non-food retailers, in a week of crucial trading updates for the sector, as they showed that consumers reined in their spending on furniture, clothes and footwear in December. Spending for the month inched ahead by 0.6% following a 2.6% jump in food sales, mostly to take account of higher prices in the shops, while the sales of non-food items were down by 2.2%. The BRC blamed the steep fall in purchases of non-food items on a collapse in demand for baby clothes and toys, furniture, footwear, household appliances and stationery. Early statements from some big names in non-food retail have pointed to a troubled Christmas, while a survey by the insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor has warned that tens of thousands of smaller retailers are in financial distress. Among the large players, Debenhams reported a steep fall in profits last week, sparking a near-20% fall in its share price, as rival House of Fraser admitted it is seeking to cut the size of stores in an effort to slash its rent bill after a tough Christmas. On Monday, Mothercare issued a profit warning as it flagged low consumer confidence. Marks &amp; Spencer will lead a flurry of retailers reporting their results on Thursday, leaving investors nervous about the possibility of a broader tumble in sales on the high street. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWith inflation outpacing income growth, shoppers continued to see more of their spending power absorbed by essential items, including food, leaving less left over for buying Christmas gifts. \u201cThat made this year\u2019s festive period all the more nail-biting for non-food retailers, many of whom offered deep discounts in the last weeks before Christmas in the hope of something to celebrate at the end of a year, which has seen, on average, zero growth in non-food sales.\u201d She said that over the three months to December, sales on the high street of non-food items declined 4.4% on a like-for-like basis, \u201cthe deepest since our records began in December 2012\u201d. Paul Martin, head of retail at the accountancy firm, KPMG, which conducted the survey, described the 0.6% rise in December as \u201cmeagre\u201d. \u201cGrocers benefited from festive feasts, but growth elsewhere on the high street was otherwise rather muted for the time of year,\u201d he said. There was also little to cheer retailers in IHS Markit\u2019s analysis of December figures from Visa, the payments firm. On an annual basis, Visa card purchases, which account for a third of all UK consumer spending, declined by 1%. Visa said: \u201cDecember\u2019s consumer spending figures confirm our earlier prediction that the UK would see its first fall in overall Christmas spending in five years.\u201d The Visa spokesman said that while some large retailers had signalled a strong Christmas performance, \u201cit is clear that the high street has suffered recently, while online spending has held up\u201d. He added: \u201cHotels and restaurants were again a bright spot in December\u2019s results. Consumers have been opting to spend on UK staycations as opposed to physical items and trips abroad. Interestingly, clothing and footwear, and household goods, two categories that might be expected to perform strongly in the lead up to Christmas, saw significant drops of -2.4% and -3.4%, respectively.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
