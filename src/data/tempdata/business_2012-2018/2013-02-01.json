The bank, he added, \"often seems to be seeking to gain advantage through the use of complex structures\".</p> <p>But was Protium a mere after-dinner mint? The explosive story in the FTon Friday was that UK authorities are investigating whether Barclays made a loan to Qatar which was then invested in Barclays' vital \u00a37.3bn fundraising in 2008.

If so, he could have told the chair of Barclays pay committee, Sir John Sunderland, promptly. On Wednesday \u2013 the precise middle of the working week \u2013 Sunderland was entertainingly duffed up by members of the banking standards commission as he gave <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/30/alison-carnwath-barclays-pay-bob-diamond-bonus\" title=\"\">a limp defence</a> of Bob Diamond's bumper \u00a32.7m bonus for 2011.

The dividend yield on Diageo shares is 2.5% but, crucially, the dividend is rising. Indeed, this week it was increased by 9%, the highest rate of increase in the 15 years since Diageo's formation. What's more, chief executive Paul Walsh has a spring in his step.</p> <p>There's no sign of recovery in southern Europe, where sales collapsed by 19%, but that's only one-twentieth of Diageo's business these days. Meanwhile, sales in the US are strengthening and South America and the Far East are booming for Diageo.</p> <p>Investors, understandably, are voting for shares \u2013 in Diageo and others. The FTSE 100 index has just enjoyed its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/01/europe-stock-markets-boom-gdp\" title=\"\">best January since 1998</a>, and on Friday the Dow Jones industrial average pushed through 14,000 for the first time since 2007. Can the optimism around shares last?</p> <p>Well, it could \u2013 at least for a while. If you avert your eyes from Spain and Greece, it's possible to think growth is back, at least for some multinationals. Unilever, another global titan, reported 11% earnings growth the other day, fuelled by its emerging markets interests.

First, the inflation bet is not a one-way affair. Yes, inflation at 5%, say, sounds comfortable for companies with the pricing power to pass it on.

Not so a 2013 market when most firms are international and many do very little business in the UK. Then there are the shareholders.</p> <p>UK pension funds own around \u00a33tn in assets, there are around \u00a325tn to \u00a330tn globally, which can be married with the \u00a330tn in sovereign wealth funds.

Economist Sony Kapoor, who runs the thinktank Re-Define, says the markets resemble those cartoon characters that run off a cliff, only to hang in mid-air with their legs still spinning. Europe is still toxic, goes the message, mired as it is in debt and with many big bumps along the road to recovery still to come.</p> <p>But talk to analysts and they will tell you that the UK's top companies are cheap in relation to their predicted forward earnings and with central bank support stretching over the horizon, now is the time to invest. Most of these earnings will be generated overseas and will be little taxed.</p> <p>After two years of repeated warnings about the disintegration of the eurozone (first a Grexit, then Spain and Italy leaving by the backdoor), doomsayer analysts are characterised as the boy who cried wolf. The sea is calmer and investors have set sail.</p>",

Since the crash, UK investment has declined from more than 12% of GDP to less than 9%. These factors would have halted a 1990s stock market. Not so a 2013 market when most firms are international and many do very little business in the UK. Then there are the shareholders. UK pension funds own around \u00a33tn in assets, there are around \u00a325tn to \u00a330tn globally, which can be married with the \u00a330tn in sovereign wealth funds. These are the main shareholders and their wealth is often characterised as a wall of money looking for a home. Much of it has sat on the sidelines during the euro crisis, stashed in low interest, safe haven bonds. Now it is on the march and stock markets are one of the chief targets. The IMF has warned that investors may be getting over-exuberant as markets move up across Europe and the US, given that lack of growth in most developed countries. Economist Sony Kapoor, who runs the thinktank Re-Define, says the markets resemble those cartoon characters that run off a cliff, only to hang in mid-air with their legs still spinning. Europe is still toxic, goes the message, mired as it is in debt and with many big bumps along the road to recovery still to come. But talk to analysts and they will tell you that the UK's top companies are cheap in relation to their predicted forward earnings and with central bank support stretching over the horizon, now is the time to invest. Most of these earnings will be generated overseas and will be little taxed. After two years of repeated warnings about the disintegration of the eurozone (first a Grexit, then Spain and Italy leaving by the backdoor), doomsayer analysts are characterised as the boy who cried wolf. The sea is calmer and investors have set sail.",

On Wednesday the Commerce Department announced that the US's economic recovery went into reverse in the final quarter of 2012. US gross domestic product declined 0.1% on an annual basis at the end of 2012, dragged down by the largest cuts in defense spending since the end of the Vietnam war and by businesses cutting back on inventories. GDP had risen 3.1% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>On Thursday the Labor Department reported a surge in the number of people filing first time claims for unemployment benefits. Initial jobless claims increased by 38,000 to 368,000 in the week ending January 26. It was the largest rise since the spike that followed Hurricane Sandy. The number remained below 400,000, the level at which most economists argue the jobs market is worsening.</p> <p>Deep government spending cuts, agreed as part of the fiscal cliff debate, are set to start on March 1. The military's budget will be cut by 7.3% this year and discretionary government programmes by 5%. Both are likely to have an impact on the jobs market in coming months.</p> <p>Economists said Washington's deadlock over the fiscal cliff had impacted the GDP figure as businesses scaled back.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-510bc61e95cbe8c3a3471588\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-01T13:41:50.724Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Taking a look at all the key figures from the US January jobs report:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Change in nonfarm payrolls:</strong> +157,000 vs. expectations of +165,000 (+155K in December)</li> <li><strong>Change in private payrolls:</strong> +166,000 vs. expectations of +168,000 (+168K in December)</li> <li><strong>Change in manufacturing payrolls:</strong> +4,000 vs. expectations of +10,000 (+25K in December)</li> <li><strong>Unemployment rate:</strong> 7.9% vs. expectations of 7.8% (7.8% in December)</li> <li><strong>Average hourly earnings:</strong> +0.2% vs. expectations of+0.1 percent month-over-month, +2.1 percent year-over-year, in line with expectations (versus +0.3 percent and +2.1 percent in December)</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-510bc51795cbe8c3a3471587\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-01T13:37:27.340Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/297337189874941952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>At 7.9%, the US unemployment rate is now comfortably above Britain's unemployment rate of 7.7%</p>&mdash; Ed Conway (@EdConwaySky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/297337189874941952\">February 1, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-510bc4dd95cbe8c3a3471586\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-01T13:36:29.542Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some immediate reaction from Twitter...&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/297336166930321409\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Market's not gonna be happy about this.

Earlier this week, the government auctioned the latest batch of bonds at the lowest rates in more than two years.</p> <p>The universal assumption seems to be that the centre-left, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, will top the poll and that, even if he fails to<br>get an outright majority in the upper house (where the system allows for a hung chamber), well there\u2019s always good old Mario Monti with whom to form a coalition.</p> <p>In fact, says the common investor wisdom, that would be even better. Monti could be finance minister (even though he has said that he won\u2019t join any future government except as prime minister) and apply business-friendly liberal policies (even though Bersani\u2019s coalition partner, Nichi Vendola, is dead against them).</p> <p>Well, today, for the first time since the start of the Italian<br>election campaign, a poll was published showing <a href=\"http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/politica/photogallery/2013/01/31/sondaggi_skytg24_tecne_elezioni_politiche_intenzioni_voto.html#2\">Berlusconi\u2019s alliance is less than five percentage points behind the centre-left</a>. <strong>The man whose hesitancy and backsliding took the eurozone to the brink of disaster is on a roll.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/politica/photogallery/2013/01/13/sondaggio_skytg24_elezioni_politiche.html\">As recently as January 13</a>, the same pollster showed the gap between the two main coalitions was almost 12 points. If he were to continue to catch up at this rate over the rest of the campaign, by my calculations, he\u2019d win by a comfortable 4% margin. That is still unlikely, but the odds on a near-tie are shortening (well, everywhere but in the markets).</p> <p>What has made the difference? Whatever his faults as a steward of Italy\u2019s debt-laden economy, Berlusconi is a campaigner of genius.</p> <p>But the biggest factor seems to have been the scandal involving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/31/eurozone-crisis-live-markets-falter-us-gdp-shock?INTCMP=SRCH#block-510a3f93b579511a2998b613\">Italy\u2019s biggest \u2018red\u2019 bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena</a>.<br>It may not help Berlusconi directly, but it does send disillusioned voters into the arms of the Five Star Movement, fronted by the ex-comedian Beppe Grillo whose central message is that all the traditional parties are the same \u2013 and equally corrupt. <a href=\"http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/politica/photogallery/2013/01/31/sondaggi_skytg24_tecne_elezioni_politiche_intenzioni_voto.html\">The effect can</a> <a href=\"http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/politica/photogallery/2013/01/31/sondaggi_skytg24_tecne_elezioni_politiche_intenzioni_voto.html\">be seen here</a>.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-21cf8a24-36aa-48fc-b050-0d4f0a3e5be6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/1/1359710475548/342e22ed-7517-4231-ac3f-a67e2a38f7fa-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Berlusconi has performed an astonishing comeback, exacting his political revenge while Monti is struggling badly to make a breakthrough in the campaign for the February elections.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Berlusconi has performed an astonishing comeback, exacting his political revenge while Monti is struggling badly to make a breakthrough in the campaign for the February elections.

      "bodyText": "After a buoyant January, February has also got off to a bright start. There was a mixed picture of the state of manufacturing in various eurozone countries but the overall European PMI hit an 11 month high. But it was a strong set of US figures - from manufacturing to non-farm payrolls to consumer confidence - which really put some life into the markets. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 70.36 points higher at 6347.24, up 1.12% \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.74% \u2022 France's Cac climbed 1.1% \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.59% \u2022 But Italy's FTSE MIB fell 0.69% as the scandal at Monte dei Paschi spread \u2022 The Athens market finished 0.96% lower \u2022 But the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.985, just below the 14,000 level it earlier breached for the first time since October 2007 And with that, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and see you all back here on Monday. Just to deflate some of the optimism pervading the markets at the moment, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said earlier that the eurozone crisis was not yet over. He told an international security conference in Munich the continent could not sit back. According to an AP report, he said: It would be wrong to believe that the problems are solved. The euro crisis is not over, but we are in a much better position than a year ago. Whether it's the downgrade rumours or worries about UK growth, the pound continues to fall sharply. The euro has risen to 87p, up 1.6% on the day and its highest level since October 2011. The single currency has also been helped by the better than expected eurozone PMI data. The pound also fell against the dollar, down 0.8% at $1.5731. But could sterling weakness prove another blow to cash strapped eurozone tourist centres? The global economy is better placed than it was six months ago, said New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley. In a speech to a gathering of bankers, he pointed to improvements in the economies of Europe, Japan and China to show the situation around the world is gradually improving (courtesy Reuters.) Back with Italy, and the fallout from the Monte dei Paschi scandal continues. The murky derivatives trading at the world's oldest bank already shows signs of influencing the forthcoming election, with Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right coalition seeming to be the main beneficiary. Now judicial sources have told Reuters that Italian prosecutors are investigating trades made by other large banks, as the scandal appeared to spread to other lenders. Dozens of people were said to be under investigation at UniCredit, Intesa Sanpaolo, BNL and Credem as well as Monte dei Paschi itself. If it's Friday afternoon there must be a rumour of a sovereign rating downgrade. And sure enough it's the UK's AAA rating - once more - said to be under threat. More positive economic news from the US. Consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in January, as the (albeit temporary) New Year resolution to the US fiscal cliff drama seemed to given Americans optimism about the outlook. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index roes from 72.9 in December to 73.8. Analysts had been expecting the index to fall to 71.5. Meanwhile another measure of manufacturing, the Institute for Supply Management index, rose to 53.1 in January from 50.2 the previous month. This too beat forecasts, and represented the highest level since April last year. The dollar gained ground on the news, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now up 139 points or just over 1%. As predicted, the US stock market has rallied on the jobs report, with the Dow Jones up 0.6%, or 78 points, since opening about six minutes ago. And the positive vibes have spread to the core countries in Europe, but notably not the periphery. UK FTSE 100: up 0.7%, or 47 points, at 6324 France CAC 40: up 1.2% Germany DAX: up 0.6% Spain IBEX: down 1.9% Italy FTSE MIB: down 1% And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. More from Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider, who gives a pithy summing-up of the US jobs report: One of the big concerns that the market faces is this idea that the Fed might tighten prematurely. But the unemployment rate is one of the primary datapoints the Fed uses to determine appropriate monetary policy, and unemployment ticked higher. So we got a fine current number, great backward revisions, and no improvement in unemployment, putting no pressure on the Fed. Back to the US and a troubling chart, which compares the trajectory of job losses and recoveries in various recession since WWII. Thanks to Bill McBride at Calculated Risk. Back to the eurozone, after that flurry of excitement over US data. It seems Greece has sold a portion of Corfu to US private equity fund NCH Capital for a whopping \u20ac23m. The deal is part of a wider plan to sell off assets in order to pay down the stricken country's huge debt pile. Athens has raised about \u20ac2bn since 2010 and is targeting proceeds of about \u20ac11bn by the end of 2016. For its money, NCH Capital will get the rights to 490,000 square metres of land in Kassiopi Corfu for 99 years. Greece's privatisation agency said the group intends to spend \u20ac75m to develop the land for tourism, creating hundreds of jobs. Here's Chris Williamson on the US non-farm payrolls. A solid gain in US employment provides welcome reassurance that the US economy is healthier than the surprise fall in fourth quarter GDP indicated and is not at risk of a renewed recession. However, policymakers will no doubt remain unimpressed at the pace of the job market recovery, suggesting there is no end is in sight for Fed stimulus. Now for the US manufacturing PMI, which is definitely good news. US manufacturing grew in January at its fastest pace in nine months and looks likely to drive economic growth in the first three months of this year. Markit said US manufacturing PMI rose to 55.8 in January from 54 in December. Chris Williamson of Markit said: [This] suggests the underlying health of the industrial sector continues to improve and rising production will help the economy return to growth in the first quarter, providing there are no set-backs in coming months. A pretty chart to display the US jobs data from David Yanofsky on Quartz. Follow the link for interactive data. As one fund manager notes, the jobs data is probably pretty good news for the stock markets, as they point to a relatively healthy economy but isn't so strong that the Fed considers halting its quantitative easing programme. But it's bad news for the man on the street. Market reaction to the US jobs data has been confusing, as Trend Macrolytics strategist Lorcan Roche Kelly notes. Crucially, the report made significant upward revisions to November and December's data. November was revised from +161,000 to +247,000. December was revised from +155,000 to +196,000. Joe Wiesenthal of Business Insider writes: These both have turned out to be impressive months. That means that right in the teeth of the Fiscal Cliff fight, amid all of the \"uncertainty\", employment was much hotter than expected. The uncertainty myth is nonsense. A quick look at the foreign exchange markets, where the dollar extended its losses against the euro following the weaker-than-expected jobs data. The euro moved from $1.3636 before the release of the data, to trade as high as $1.3658 afterwards. My colleague Dominic Rushe, out in the US, reports: The US has now added jobs for 28 months in a row but the pace of job creation remains historically weak compared to recoveries after other recessions. The news comes amid fresh signals of the fragility of the US's economic recovery. On Wednesday the Commerce Department announced that the US's economic recovery went into reverse in the final quarter of 2012. US gross domestic product declined 0.1% on an annual basis at the end of 2012, dragged down by the largest cuts in defense spending since the end of the Vietnam war and by businesses cutting back on inventories. GDP had risen 3.1% in the previous quarter. On Thursday the Labor Department reported a surge in the number of people filing first time claims for unemployment benefits. Initial jobless claims increased by 38,000 to 368,000 in the week ending January 26. It was the largest rise since the spike that followed Hurricane Sandy. The number remained below 400,000, the level at which most economists argue the jobs market is worsening. Deep government spending cuts, agreed as part of the fiscal cliff debate, are set to start on March 1. The military's budget will be cut by 7.3% this year and discretionary government programmes by 5%. Both are likely to have an impact on the jobs market in coming months. Economists said Washington's deadlock over the fiscal cliff had impacted the GDP figure as businesses scaled back. Taking a look at all the key figures from the US January jobs report: Change in nonfarm payrolls: +157,000 vs. expectations of +165,000 (+155K in December) Change in private payrolls: +166,000 vs. expectations of +168,000 (+168K in December) Change in manufacturing payrolls: +4,000 vs. expectations of +10,000 (+25K in December) Unemployment rate: 7.9% vs. expectations of 7.8% (7.8% in December) Average hourly earnings: +0.2% vs. expectations of+0.1 percent month-over-month, +2.1 percent year-over-year, in line with expectations (versus +0.3 percent and +2.1 percent in December) Some immediate reaction from Twitter... US non-farm payrolls have come in at +157,000 and unemployment has ticked up to 7.9%. That is below expectations of 165,000, while the 7.9% figure will be a nasty surprise for the vast majority expecting joblessness to stick at 7.8%. We'll have all the reaction here, as it comes in. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy will speak on Saturday about the allegations the ruling PP party ran a double-accounting system to evade tax. At a weekly news conference deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz said Rajoy's conduct had always been exemplary, reports Reuters. But the accusations have sparked protests against alleged tax cheating. (see 9.55) So the big-news this afternoon is the employment data out of the US, in the form of the non-farm payrolls. This measures the monthly change in employment, excluding the farm sector and is considered the most comprehensive measure of job creation in the US. The US jobs data is particularly significant as it appears to be driving Federal Reserve policy at the moment. Matthew Boesler of Business Insider reports: The Fed has stated that it will not consider raising benchmark interest rates until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent. Most don't expect this until 2015 or 2016. On the other hand, the Fed could end quantitative easing much sooner. FOMC members have said an unemployment rate around 7 percent by the end of 2013 may be sufficient to halt bond purchases. He provides a round-up of consensus forecasts, as follows. Change in nonfarm payrolls: +165,000 (versus +155K in December), with estimates ranging from 115,000 to 230,000 Change in private payrolls: +168,000 (versus +168K in December) Change in manufacturing payrolls: +10,000 (versus +25K in December) Unemployment rate: 7.8 percent (versus 7.8 percent in December) Average hourly earnings: +0.1 percent month-over-month, +2.1 percent year-over-year (versus +0.3 percent and +2.1 percent in December) Here's Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities on the LTRO repayments. I am very unsurprised, it never appeared likely to me that banks would take a piecemeal approach, but rather register for repayment on the first date, with the rest being \u201cdrips and drabs\u201d until the first repayment date for the \u20ac530bn second tranche on February 22nd. Today saw the second announcement from the ECB about the early repayment of money it lent at super cheap rates at the height of the crisis. Bond market followers will remember last week saw the announcement that a whopping \u20ac137bn would be repaid, beating most market expectations. But this week the number fell short of forecasts of \u20ac20bn, coming in at just \u20ac3.5bn. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research said the number itself did not mean a great deal and the estimates even less. Most economic forecasts are based upon prior history and data that in some way influences the figure you are estimating. The LTRO payback has no real history, there is no data we can look at that has an influence on it, so it's just people guessing. The euro fell on the news from $1.3667 to $1.3640. Over to Greece, where the unions have called for a general strike on February 20 to protest against austerity measures. In what seems like a never-ending cycle of walk-outs in different sectors, Greek seaman continued their 48-hour strike today, keeping ferries docked at ports across the country. But Capital Economics remains downbeat about the unemployment figures. Data published today showed that eurozone unemployment rose by 16,000 in December. While this was the smallest rise since April 2011, it still left the unemployment rate at a record high of 11.7%. Despite the recent rises in the survey-based measures of business activity and sentiment, note the surveys of firms\u2019 employment intentions have shown few signs of improvement and suggest that further falls in employment are likely. Here's Howard Archer on the economic data out of the eurozone this morning. By recent eurozone standards it has been a relatively encouraging day for economic news with unemployment rising at a much reduced rate in December and the purchasing managers reporting manufacturing activity contracted at the slowest rate for 11 months in January. Meanwhile, Eurozone consumer price inflation moderated to a 26-month low of 2% in January, which will help consumers\u2019 purchasing power. It will also give the ECB increased scope to lower interest rates should Eurozone economic activity fail to pick up over the coming months. The ECB appeared to shut the door to any near-term interest rate cut at its January meeting, as it was encouraged by recent improved financial markets and some better Eurozone surveys. Further improved survey evidence for January reinforces already strong belief that the ECB will sit tight at its 7 February policy meeting. However, if the euro continues to rise and starts to threaten Eurozone recovery prospects, the ECB may have to re-think its plans and an interest rate cut could re-appear on the agenda Taking a break from the economic data, it seems the Netherlands has nationalised SNS Reaal at a cost of \u20ac3.7bn, after a private rescue of the a bank and insurance group collapsed. Thomas Escritt and Anthony Deutsch of Reuters report: Another state rescue of a financial group will lead to a worsening in the Dutch budget deficit this year - which is already forecast to exceed European Union targets - and is likely to prompt a public outcry given the billions of euros of budget cuts and austerity measures in recent years. It is also a sign of how many European banks, five years on from the height of the global financial crisis, are struggling to turn a corner amid weak economies and tougher regulations. French bank Credit Agricole announced over $5 billion of charges on Friday, a day after Deutsche Bank also unveiled big writedowns. The Dutch government paid out nearly 40 billion euros to rescue the domestic financial sector in 2008 when it provided capital injections for ING, Aegon and SNS Reaal, as well as nationalising ABN AMRO. SNS Reaal, the fourth-biggest financial institution in the Netherlands with about 134 billion euros in assets last year, was hit by losses at its property unit and has been trying for months to sell assets and secure additional funding. The emergency bailout was necessary after SNS Reaal failed to meet a Jan. 31 deadline to come up with a rescue, Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a press conference. Inflation in the eurozone, meanwhile, fell more than expected in January, as companies slashed prices in a bid to draw in cash-strapped customers. Consumer price inflation in the euro area fell to an annual rate of 2% in January. That puts it near the ECB's target of close to, but below 2%, and gives the central bank room to cut rates again to drive the economy. Youth unemployment remained a major issue in the EU with only Germany and Austria recording jobless rates among young people of less than 10%. In December 2012, the youth unemployment rate was 23.4% in the EU and 24.0% in the eurozone. That compares with 22.2% and 21.7% respectively in December 2011. The eurozone unemployment figures are not, in fact, as bad as expected. But the jobless rate across the region remained stubbornly high at 11.7% in December. The official data from Eurostat showed the rate in the wider EU was 10.7%. Huge disparities between the members of the euro persist, with the lowest unemployment rates in Austria (4.3%), Germany and Luxembourg (both 5.3%) and the Netherlands (5.8%). While Greece (26.8% in October 2012) and Spain (26.1%) remain mired in a job market crisis. There were protests in Spain last night, after allegations in El Pa\u00eds that the ruling PP party ran a double-accounting system to evade tax. Although the PP denied the allegations forcefully, the Spanish people remained unconvinced and hundreds gathered at the headquarters of the PP in Madrid to show their disgust that those who are now busy hiking taxes and cutting spending are alleged tax cheats. Abandoning the eurozone briefly, the UK's manufacturing sector grew modestly in January and output powered ahead at its fastest pace since September 2011. The Markit/CIPS PMI inched down to 50.8 from a downwardly revised 51.2 in December, just short of forecasts for a reading of 51. The data will provide some solace to chancellor George Osborne, who faced heavy criticism last month after data showed the economy shrank in the final three months of 2012. If it shrinks again in the first three months of this year, the UK will fall into its third recession in four years. But manufacturing only accounts for 10% of the British economy and Markit said the impact of these figures on first quarter GDP would be limited. Rob Dobson of Markit said: The survey will do little to assuage fears of a triple-dip recession unless accompanied by an improvement in the services sector. A small gain in employment suggests that firms are less focused on cost reduction amid signs of improved order books, which should lead to further production growth in February. Sterling's weakness, plus indications of firmer demand in key export markets such as the eurozone, notably Germany, and emerging markets such as China should also help lift sales in coming months. The growing gulf between France and Germany is particularly stark when you look at Markit's output index. And for the overall eurozone manufacturing PMI, the data shows factories in the region had their best month in nearly a year in January. The news prompted analysts to herald a turnaround in the currency bloc's fortunes. The PMI rose to an 11-month high of 47.9 from December's 46.1, while the output index rose to a 10-month high of 48.7. Overall it suggests the downturn in manufacturing has passed its nadir. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: The January manufacturing PMI adds to the mounting evidence that eurozone economic activity turned the corner late in 2012, although a further modest decline in manufacturing output remains possible in the first quarter of 2013 after an apparent sharp drop in production in the fourth quarter of 2012. Manufacturers appear to be benefiting increasingly from a sustained easing of sovereign debt tensions (underpinned by the establishment of the European Central Bank\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions programme) reducing uncertainty and lifting business confidence. If this continues, businesses should become increasingly more prepared to place manufacturing orders that have been delayed or cancelled. It may also start to foster a pick-up in business investment. Back to Rome, where our correspondent John Hooper says market complacency over the Italian elections could be misplaced. The markets seem to take it as a given that Silvio Berlusconi cannot win the Italian general election campaign on February 24-25. Earlier this week, the government auctioned the latest batch of bonds at the lowest rates in more than two years. The universal assumption seems to be that the centre-left, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, will top the poll and that, even if he fails to get an outright majority in the upper house (where the system allows for a hung chamber), well there\u2019s always good old Mario Monti with whom to form a coalition. In fact, says the common investor wisdom, that would be even better. Monti could be finance minister (even though he has said that he won\u2019t join any future government except as prime minister) and apply business-friendly liberal policies (even though Bersani\u2019s coalition partner, Nichi Vendola, is dead against them). Well, today, for the first time since the start of the Italian election campaign, a poll was published showing Berlusconi\u2019s alliance is less than five percentage points behind the centre-left. The man whose hesitancy and backsliding took the eurozone to the brink of disaster is on a roll. As recently as January 13, the same pollster showed the gap between the two main coalitions was almost 12 points. If he were to continue to catch up at this rate over the rest of the campaign, by my calculations, he\u2019d win by a comfortable 4% margin. That is still unlikely, but the odds on a near-tie are shortening (well, everywhere but in the markets). What has made the difference? Whatever his faults as a steward of Italy\u2019s debt-laden economy, Berlusconi is a campaigner of genius. But the biggest factor seems to have been the scandal involving Italy\u2019s biggest \u2018red\u2019 bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena. It may not help Berlusconi directly, but it does send disillusioned voters into the arms of the Five Star Movement, fronted by the ex-comedian Beppe Grillo whose central message is that all the traditional parties are the same \u2013 and equally corrupt. The effect can be seen here. It was a very different story from Greece, where the factory sector remained mired in its more than three-year slump. The Markit PMI for Greek manufacturing \u2013 which accounts for 15% of the economy \u2013 ticked up to 41.7 in January from 41.4 in December. The fall in new orders came close to the worst reading in the survey's history, which dates back to 1999. Phil Smith at Markit said: A new year failed to bring any evidence that Greece's manufacturing sector might be heading for a recovery. January data suggested the downturn may worsen before it eases. In a sign of the growing disparity between the eurozone's two largest economies, data out of Germany suggests its economy is picking up again, after shrinking in the last quarter of 2012. The German manufacturing PMI rose to 49.8 in January, from 46 the previous month. So the sector contracted very slightly but output and new business grew. Tim Moore at Markit said: Germany's manufacturing sector saw a huge turnaround in momentum at the start of the year. A return to growth in manufacturing production is perhaps the strongest signal yet that Germany's economy has already swung back into expansion after the fourth quarter drop in GDP. But France's data is dire. The French manufacturing PMI dropped to a four-month low of 42.9 in January, down from 44.6 in December. New orders fell at the fastest pace since March 2009, when much of the world was mired in recession. Jack Kennedy of Markit said: The fact that new orders fell at the sharpest rate for nearly four years is a particularly concerning development and suggests further steep falls in output are likely as we progress throughout the first quarter. Confidence seems to have evaporated in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic environment, leading manufacturers to make sharper cuts to employment, purchasing and input stocks. Manufacturing accounts fora botu 11% of France's economy and has long been its weakest spot. The data will fuel fears that France is set to be the eurozone's next big casualty. As our economics editor Larry Elliott noted in this morning's paper: Should the eurozone crisis flare up again over the coming months, there is a real risk that its second biggest economy will be added to the list of countries where the public finances are deemed unsustainable. Over to Italy, where the factory sector continued to contract but again, at a slower pace. It was, in fact, its slowest pace since last March. The Markit/ADACI PMI rose for the second month to 47.8 in January from 46.7 in December. Back to the manufacturing, and now to the Swiss. Reuters reports: Swiss manufacturing grew for the first time in 17 months in January, suggesting companies were benefitting from a fall in the franc's value against the euro as hopes rise that the eurozone can ride out its debt crisis. The Swiss PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.5 points in January, from a revised 49.2 in December last year. And for a brief respite from the manufacturing figures, there are troubling signs in Italy that Berlusconi is gaining in the polls just three weeks ahead of the elections. We'll have more on that shortly. And over to Spain, where the news is (predictably) bleak but there are signs of improvement since December. Spanish manufacturing activity declined for the 21st month in a row in January, but at the slowest pace since June 2011 thanks to a boost in overseas business. The PMI came in at 46.1, still languishing below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction but a significant improvement from December's reading of 44.6. Andrew Harker of Markit said: The PMI data suggest that growth remains some way off, with the turning of the new year having provided little respite for firms. New orders fell for the 21st consecutive month but at a slower pace. Markit said this reflected a surge in exports, while the domestic market continued to flounder. Harker again: Higher exports are the one bright spot for the sector currently, but the recent rises have been insufficient to support a wider expansion. So to Ireland's PMI, which showed growth in its manufacturing sector slipped to a nine-month low in January, as new orders contracted for the first time in a year. Just to recap, the purchasing managers' index summarises the opinions of purchasing managers in the sector, who gauge future demand and adjust orders for materials accordingly. The Irish economy has been doing better since its bailout from the EU, IMF and ECB, but the recovery remains fragile. The NCB manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.3 in January from 51.4 in December last year. Philip O'Sullivan at NCB Stockbrokers said: While output remains in postivie territory and new export orders grew for a foruth successive month, other areas showed signs of weakness. Tying it all together... today's release points to a sluggish start to 2013. It seems it's not only European policymakers who like to kick the can down the road. Last night, the US senate passed a bill to extend the debt ceiling by three months to May 19th. AA Stocks Financial News reports: The US Senate gave its green light to holding the country's debt ceiling unchanged temporarily and the bill will be endorsed by President Barack Obama. The approval meant the US government can avert default at least for a short while. The Senate agreed to keep the debt ceiling unchanged at US$16.4 trillion for three more months through May 19, which will enable the government to continue borrowing money for spending. There were some mixed messages out of China overnight. Government data showed its vast factory sector grew slower-than-expected in January. The official purchasing managers' index came in at 50.4, down from December's 50.6 and short of forecasts for a nine-month high of 50.9. The reading is also edging closer to the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion. But, the HSBC PMI, which is also closely-watched, rose to a two-year high of 52.3. Overall, the data suggests China's vast factory sector managed only a weak rebound at the start of the year, as feeble foreign demand dragged on sales. Alistair Thornton at IHS Global Insight in Beijing said: January's PMI does raise some red flags about the state of the economy. Things look a little shaky. ... is full. China manufacturing PMI (January): 1am Ireland manufacturing PMI (January): 6.58am Spain manufacturing PMI (January): 8.13am Switzerland manufacturing PMI (January): 8.30am Italy manufacturing PMI (January): 8.43am France manufacturing PMI (January): 8.48am Germany manufacturing PMI (January): 8.53am Eurozone manufacturing PMI (January): 8.58am Greece manufacturing PMI (January): 8.58am Italy unemployment (December): 9am UK manufacturing PMI (January): 9.28am Eurozone CPI (January): 10am Eurozone unemployment (December): 10am US non-farm payrolls (January): 1.30pm US manufacturing PMI (January): 1.58pm US ISM manufacturing (January): 3pm Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis.

      "bodyText": "Manufacturing activity dropped back in January despite a strong rise in factory output that could indicate a sustained if slow recovery in the sector. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing index fell from 51.2 to 50.8 in January on the previous month, which was expected by economists after a surge in December. Employment rose slightly on the pre-Christmas period as output jumped to 54.2, where a figure above 50 shows an expansion in activity. A slowdown in new orders growth was the main blot on the sector's horizon, dragged down by a contraction in new export orders that stretches back to the first euro crisis in the summer of 2011. The unsettled picture across the continent has proved a major barrier to the manufacturing industry's recovery, alongside a fall in domestic demand. However, a slow recovery in the euro area in January following a string of improved figures, France notwithstanding, spells a more settled period for the sector and the potential for a more sustained period of growth. Annalisa Piazza, analyst at Newedge Strategy, said: \"Less pressures from the euro area will help a modest increase in activity in 2013 and UK companies will probably start to increase their stocks and revise their investment plans.\" James Knightley, UK economist at ING Bank, said that while the drop in activity was greater than expected, the increase in output \"offers hope that the GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012 will not be repeated in the first three months of 2013\". He said: \"Order books are also looking OK so we are hopeful of another positive manufacturing figure in February and March.\" Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' lobby group, said the PMI offered a brighter picture. \"There are reasons to believe this expansionary trend could be maintained in the coming months with European indicators at least stabilising, emerging market activity improving, and a weaker sterling helping some sectors in overseas markets,\" he said. \"Many manufacturers are also expecting to secure some growth this year from new product launches and, a continued push into markets outside Europe.

It said corn contamination in the summer - caused by a fungus - would hit profits by around \u00a37m. Third quarter profits would be lower than last year due to increased investment in its restructuring.</p> <p>So it expected \"modest progress\" in the full year, before the impact of exchange rates.

      "bodyText": "Tate and Lyle is leading the FTSE 100 fallers after a cautious statement from the sweeteners group. In a third quarter update, the company said it expected sucralose volumes to be lower than than last year and corn prices to remain high. It said corn contamination in the summer - caused by a fungus - would hit profits by around \u00a37m. Third quarter profits would be lower than last year due to increased investment in its restructuring. So it expected \"modest progress\" in the full year, before the impact of exchange rates. That was enough to send its shares down 27.5p to 785p. Analyst Martin Deboo at Investec said: We read the third quarter statement as cautious in tone and a downgrading influence on numbers. Sucralose volumes were weaker than expected in the quarter and the downside from aflatoxin contamination in US corn is being crystallised at \u00a37m.
