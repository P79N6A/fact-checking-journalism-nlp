      "bodyText": "Over in Athens there is more talk of early elections from senior government officials - despite attempts by the government spokesman to douse such speculation earlier today. Helena Smith reports from Athens The Greek government had hoped to quash reports of either early elections or a referendum being called to end Athens\u2019 stand-off with creditors. But on what soon became another explosive day in parliament, Nikos Filis, who is the governing Syriza party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, once again raised the prospect of early polls telling the 300-seat House that unlike their political opponents, the leftists were \u201cnot afraid of elections.\u201d \u201cThey said that elections would destroy the economy. It didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he railed. \u201cNow they are saying the same thing again. Some have every reason to fear elections. We don\u2019t fear them. If our political plan needs to be endorsed by public opinion, it will be. We want a compromise, but if this agreement needs to be legitimised by the people, we won\u2019t be afraid of it.\u201d Earlier in the day, the government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides staunchly denied that the coalition was entertaining \u201csuch scenarios.\u201d The Syriza led government has been frequently accused of making contradictory statements. Filis\u2019 assertion - only hours after Sakellarides had addressed the issue - was described as \u201ca bombshell\u201d by the Greek media. Peter Spiegel of the FT has confirmed that Slovenia suggested the eurozone could need to start preparing a Plan B, in case Greece\u2019s negotiations do not move fast enough to avert a default. The suggestion, slapped down by Yanis Varoufakis, is another sign that relations between the two sides have deteriorated badly. From Riga, Peter writes: Months of mounting tensions between Greece and its creditors boiled over at a high-level EU meeting on Friday with eurozone finance minsters angrily accusing their Greek counterpart of backtracking on commitments and failing to grasp the deep differences that still divide them. Athens is running desperately short of cash and many eurozone officials fear without an agreement to release some of the remaining \u20ac7.2bn in its bailout programme, the government could default as early as mid-May. Eurozone officials briefed on the closed-door, three-hour meeting said Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, specifically warned that cash was so tight that government coffers may run dry in a matter of weeks. The antagonism between Mr Varoufakis and other ministers became so severe during the eurogroup session that Slovenia\u2019s finance minister suggested if bailout talks did not progress more quickly the eurozone should prepare a \u201cPlan B\u201d to deal with a Greek default. According to three eurozone officials, other ministers from smaller, vulnerable economies expressed similar sentiments. The comments prompted a sharp rebuke from Mr Varoufakis, who accused his Slovenian counterpart of being \u201cundignified\u201d for raising the scenario and suggested the remarks were \u201cprofoundly anti-European\u201d. More here: EU frustration over Greece hits boiling point at eurogroup meeting Despite the ructions in Riga; the FTSE index of leading shares inched towards a new record high today. Chris Beauchamp of IG says some traders had already become exasperated with Athens\u2019 glacial reform pace: Signs of hope in the never-ending Greek drama were dashed this morning, and in spectacular style (for eurozone meetings at least). Most investors have long lost their patience with Greece, and it seems the eurozone\u2019s politicians are thoroughly fed up as well. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was denounced as a \u2018time-waster\u2019 and \u2018a gambler\u2019, as opinion hardened against Athens. Such an atmosphere makes it hard to envision any progress today \u2013 yet another deadline missed, the latest in a litany of missed opportunities to put the eurozone back on course. In the end, we\u2019ll just have to wait for the next instalment. The lack of progress in Riga is pushing Greek bond yields higher this afternoon; still below the highs set earlier this week. Bank of America Merrill Lynch have made their own contribution to the eurozone lexicon (grexicon?), warning that the Greek economy is heading south. Here\u2019s a flavour of their latest research note: Spain\u2019s finance minister has confirmed that Yanis Varoufakis was urged to make more progress, fast, at today\u2019s meeting. Here\u2019s the details of Varoufakis\u2019s comments this afternoon, via Reuters: Greece is willing to make compromises to reach a deal on its debt, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said on Friday after tense talks with his euro zone peers on this issue. \u201cWe want an agreement and we are willing to make compromises to achieve this,\u201d Varoufakis told reporters. \u201cThe cost of not having a solution would be huge for all of us, Greece and the euro zone.\u201d Varoufakis said the process to achieve to a deal was difficult but that \u201cwe will have a solution in the end.\u201d Another rumour important development from Riga.... Eurozone finance ministers have blasted Greece for failing to make more progress towards a bailout deal, at an acrimonious eurogroup meeting in Riga today. Ministers laid into Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis for not having reached agreement with creditors, two months after being given a four month extension to Greece\u2019s loan programme. Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters in Latvia that it was a \u201chighly critical\u201d meeting, given Greece has still not agreed a comprehensive list of reforms. Although there are positive signs, there are still \u201cwide differences to bridge on substance\u201d. We are all aware that time is running out...too much time has been lost. Dijsselbloem also warned that it is very hard to consider a new programme for Greece to cover its funding needs beyond June, given the lack of progress recently. And he ruled out giving Greece a slice of the \u20ac7.2bn bailout cash that is being held back until reforms are agreed. ECB president Mario Draghi also showed exasperation over the slow pace, and warned that the ECB could potentially impose tougher conditions in return for keeping Greek banks afloat. Draghi said: \u201cThe higher are the yields [on Greek bonds], the bigger is the volatility, the more collateral gets destroyed,\u201d \u201cTime is running out as the president of the Eurogroup said, and speed is of the essence.\u201d Ministers looked stern-faced as the meeting began: Insiders in Riga say that Varoufakis came under sustained fire behind the closed-doors meeting. According to Bloomberg, the academic-turned-finance minister was called \u201ca time-waster, a gambler and an amateur.\u201d Despite the bruising encounter, Varoufakis remains adamant that a deal will be reached in time to avoid Greece defaulting on its debts. Associated Press explains: Greece\u2019s Varoufakis conceded there were differences that still need to be bridged but insisted that a deal \u201cwill happen and will happen quickly as it\u2019s the only option we have.\u201d He also sought to counter claims that talks had not advanced. He said there\u2019s been a lot of progress on issues such as privatization, reforming the tax system, the judiciary, the bureaucracy and product markets. \u201cWe look at the last few weeks and what we see is convergence,\u201d he said. It\u2019s hard to believe that Varoufakis was at the same room as Malta\u2019s finance minister, Edward Scicluna. Scicluna emerged to declare: \u201cI would describe today\u2019s meeting as a complete breakdown in communication with Greece.\u201d There\u2019s now speculation that Greece\u2019s creditors could sent more technical officials back into Athens in an attempt to kick-start the process. With Greece\u2019s kicking out of the way, ministers and officials are now gathering for a photo op before vanishing for more meetings. Yanis Varoufakis looks unbowed: The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has heard that some eurozone officials want to move the negotiations back to Greece, rather than meeting in Brussels or (last weekend) in Paris. That must have been firmly resisted by the Greek side, who are adamant that the dsays of Troika officials stalking Athens were over. The lack of progress in Riga has wiped out the euro\u2019s rally this morning - it\u2019s back at $1.082, where it began the day. And the Greek stock market has also subsided - up just 1%, having jumped over 3% this morning. Here\u2019s a sign that the two side are still divided. Varoufakis has just suggested that the negotiation process would be speeded up if lenders would agree to a \u201cpartial disbursement\u201d in return for a \u2018narrower list of reforms\u201d But just minutes ago, Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem told the press conference this was not an option. Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s claim that the two sides are \u201cconverging\u201d is turning into a Twitter meme: Newsflashes from Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s press briefing in Riga just arrived: GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS THERE WAS A CLEAR INDICATION THAT THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION HAS CONVERGED IN LAST WEEKS GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS FORECLOSURES LAW DEMANDED BY CREDITORS IS ALSO COUNTERPRODUCTIVE GREEK FINANCE MINISTER VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREECE WANTS DEAL ON PRIMARY SURPLUSES WHICH DOES NOT UNDERMINE GROWTH, DIFFERS FROM CREDITORS GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS AGREEMENT WITH LENDERS WILL BE DIFFICULT BUT WILL HAPPEN, AND QUICKLY, AS THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREECE OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD SPEED UP TALKS GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS SAYS GREECE AND CREDITORS HAVE COME CLOSER ON MATTERS OF PRIVATISATION IN LAST TWO WEEKS, ON JUDICIARY Yanis Varoufakis is speaking to the media, and the Greek finance chief is undaunted by today\u2019s hoofing. He\u2019s declaring that he\u2019s still confident of a deal soon, despite having been blasted at today\u2019s \u2018highly critical\u2019 meeting: Efi Koutsokosta of Euronews is there, and reports: And that\u2019s the end of the Eurogroup press conference -- journalists are scrambling from the room, presumable in search of Yanis Varoufakis.... Last question: Is it true that you hammered Greece\u2019s finance minister today? \u201cTo be frank, it was a very critical discussion,\u201d replies Jeroen Dijsselbloem. He reminds reporters that Greece had been asked to make serious progress by the end of April, when it was given a four-month extension in late February. Today we had hoped to hear a positive result and an agreement, so we could take a decision.....and we are still far from that.\u201d So, no denial that Yaroutakis was \u201chammered\u201d at this morning\u2019s meeting. You say there has been progress, but can you tell us what exactly? No I can\u2019t, Dijsselbloem replies. That might upset the process. [Hmmm - that may also fuel fears that there hasn\u2019t been much progress at all.] There are still \u201cbig, big\u201d problems to resolve, he adds. Q: Is the eurogroup worried that Greece might default, if it doesn\u2019t get a deal soon? Dijsselbloem says he\u2019s confident that Greece is committed to all its financial obligations to its creditors. Could another eurozone meeting be called, to speed up the situation with Greece? That\u2019s the wrong way round, Dijsselbloem replies. We need to see progress, and an agreement, and then the eurogroup might meet \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lock ourselves up for weeks\u201d. Did any eurozone ministers argue that you should just give up on Greece? No, Dijsselbloem replies. We are all still determined to find a solution and support Greece. But it has to be a sustainable programme. Time is running out, and speed is of the essence, Draghi adds. Mario Draghi can\u2019t get away without saying anything - he\u2019s asked how long the ECB will keep supporting Greece\u2019s banks. Emergency liquidity will be given for as long as Greek banks are solvent and have adequate collateral, he says. But Draghi then points to the fragility of the situation, the ongoing outflows from Greece\u2019s banks, and the fact that Greek bond yields are now at their highest since 2012. The higher the yields, the bigger the volatility, the more collateral gets destroyed..... And that means the ECB might have to revisit the rules of the emergency liquidity, to demand more collateral from Greek banks. Next question: Given Greece\u2019s financial state, is there any chance of a partial disimbursment of funds? No, says Dijsselbloem. We are talking about a deal for these four months (March-June) Onto questions, and Peter Spiegel of the FT gets first crack at the officials. What happens if there is no deal in time? Will these negotiations about Greece\u2019s bailout extension run into a review on a new programme (a third bailout)? Dijsselbloem replies: You have a point.. as time runs out we get near to June and the end of the extension, we must start talking about what happens after. But first we must talk about these four months, before we can talk about the future. It is very hard to talk about the future if you can\u2019t agree about four months. We know what\u2019s coming next, right? Klaus Regling, head of the ESM, speaks next. He warns that money is only available to Greece until the end of June (when the bailout expires). Regling also points out that Greece has benefitted from debt relief in the past, which cut its debt servicing costs by around \u20ac8bn per year. Over to Mario Draghi, the most powerful central banker in Europe, whose emergency liquidity is keeping Greece\u2019s banking sector afloat. What does he have to say about the crisis? I have nothing to add to your words. Thanks Mario Moscovici is much more upbeat about Spain, congratulating Madrid for the progress is has made. No room for complacency, though. Here\u2019s the key quote from Moscovici on Greece: Pierre Moscovici is now speaking, in French... he says that it\u2019s wrong to say that no progress has been made in recent months. Today\u2019s meeting included a lot of talking, he says. Greece must now accelerate the pace of reforms, he insists. And then he switches to English to emphasis that \u201cTime is running out\u201d, but a deal can still be reached that it in the best interests of Greece and the eurozone. Dijsselbloem is also welcoming the news that Cyprus\u2019s bailout programme is back on track, with MPs agreeing to legislation to speed up foreclosures (repossessing houses). He\u2019s also pleased that capital controls have been lifted, two years after its bailout began. \u201cFree circulation of capital has now been restored.\u201d On Spain, the Eurogroup welcomes the signs of economic and financial improvement in Spain. But debt and unemployment is too high, so more work needs to be done, Dijsselbloem says. Dijsselbloem says the Institutions (Greece\u2019s lenders) informed us of the situation in Greece I must reiterate that we need to see a \u201ccomprehensive list of reforms\u201d. There are \u201cpositive signs, but still wide differences to bridge on substance\u201d. We are all aware that time is running out...too much time has been lost And the responsibility for closing the gap falls primarily on Greece, he adds. Dijsselbloem speaks first. He realises that \u201call eyes are on Greece\u201d, but the eurogroup actually discussed a range of issues including Cyprus, and Spain. Heads-up: The eurogroup press conference is starting now. On the stage, we have eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, ECB president Mario Draghi, and also Klaus Regling, who runs the European Stability Mechanism (the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund). It\u2019s being streamed live, here. And here: Malta\u2019s finance minister, Edward Scicluna, has reportedly told journalists in Riga that there was a \u201ccomplete breakdown\u201d in communication between the two sides today: Pierre Moscovici is also tweeting, suggesting that the meeting has ended Now hearing that the eurogroup meeting has ended (for the second time), so the press conference may start soon. It\u2019s official. European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis tweets that Greece has been told to \u2018urgently\u2019 speed up negotiations. Jeeze. Bloomberg are reporting that Yanis Varoufakis was accused of being \u201ca time-waster, a gambler and an amateur\u201d in Riga this morning, as the eurozone\u2019s patience ran out. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis was heavily criticized by his euro-area colleagues amid mounting frustration at his refusal to deliver measures to fix his country\u2019s economy and release financial aid, according to three people familiar with the talks. Euro-area finance chiefs said Varoufakis\u2019s handling of the talks was irresponsible and accused him of being a time-waster, a gambler and an amateur, one of the people said. Ministers are meeting in Riga, Latvia, to assess progress in negotiations over financial aid for Greece. Varoufakis Said to Take Hammering From Frustrated Euro Ministers Hello..... sounds like the eurogroup meeting has burst back into life.... We usually have to read between the lines of these EU briefings -- but \u2018hammering\u2019 doesn\u2019t require much interpretation. Could someone in Riga please pass Yanis Varoufakis a sponge and a towel? Sounds like he\u2019s had a bad morning. (that\u2019s a Bloomberg newsflash) Journalists are gathering in the press conference room in Riga... The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has heard that the meeting in Riga was \u201cpretty heated\u201d: Over in Athens prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government is now saying that it will enforce reforms just as soon as the country\u2019s credit crunch is solved Helena Smith reports: As eurozone finance ministers gathered for their meeting in Riga this morning, the Greek government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides felt fit to say that once a cash-for-reform deal was sealed with the debt-stricken nation\u2019s international creditors, Athens will set forth on implementing structural changes. \u201cWe are ready for reforms but are waiting for an agreement,\u201d he told Mega TV. Reforms, he insisted, would be impossible to make if \u201cthe country\u2019s liquidity has dried up. We want to resolve the issue of liquidity.\u201d Another step in the game of brinkmanship? Government insiders this morning say not, taking encouragement from Tsipras\u2019 positive meeting with the German chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday. Sakellarides said he was optimistic a deal could be reached by May 11 when euro area finance ministers hold their next scheduled meeting in Brussels - and for the first time vigorously denied that the anti-austerity government was preparing to solve the conumdrum Athens now faces by calling fresh elections or holding a referendum. \u201cGrexit is not a solution despite the pressure that is being exerted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not studying scenarios of holding a referendum or elections. We have no reason to put them on the table. With our policies we are enforcing our popular mandate against austerity.\u201d EU officials are giving Greece a tough time in Riga today, according to Eleni Varvitsiotis of the Kathimerini newspaper: A reminder of how the day began (for anyone just joining us) Benedict James, a lawyer at Linklaters, just emailed over his views on the Greece crisis, and the possibility of a default. Worth a read, as we wait for finance ministers to emerge from their talks in Riga: \u201cThere is a lot of loose talk, but there is no legal mechanism to force Greece to exit the euro, whether or not it defaults on its sovereign debt. Also, Greece doesn\u2019t seem to want to exit voluntarily so it\u2019s more likely that, at least for the time being, the government will simply run progressively out of euros. This is likely to lead to the imposition of capital controls and issuance of government IOUs as a sort of quasi-currency (as happened in Argentina and California). That may be a precursor to a full exit of the euro. The legality of capital controls is complicated under the EU treaties and the IMF framework, the imposition of a quasi-currency may be in breach of the eurozone rules, and departure from the eurozone would definitely be a breach of them. This would all therefore be a highly complex legal situation, both for the relevant countries, and for businesses and financiers trying to work out whether their contracts are enforceable, and if so in what currency.\u201d Although the euro has rallied this morning, City traders aren\u2019t expecting a major breakthrough today. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote, says: Today we do not expect much from this Euro Finance Ministers meeting in Riga as several of them already lowered their expectations, the next key date for Greece being the payment of \u20ac200m to the IMF on May 1, while on May 6 Greece has to find \u20ac1.4bn at its 26-week Bill [see our chart for details]. Eurozone finance chiefs looked pretty serious as talks began this morning in Riga: Back in Athens, Greek bank shares are now up almost 9% -- despite the cautious words from eurozone finance ministers this morning. Confused about how much money Greece can lay its hands on, and what debt repayments it faces? Worry not - my colleague Katie Allen has written the definitive explanation: And here\u2019s a handy chart: We\u2019re expecting eurozone finance ministers to emerge in about one hour\u2019s time for a press conference - it should be broadcast live here. Greek government bonds are inching up this morning, pushing down the yield on the debt. That suggests investors are slightly more confident of a deal soon. But bonds are still trading at dangerously levels. The yield on Greece\u2019s 2-year debt has fallen to 24.6%, from 25.4% last night. And the 10-year Greek bond yield has dipped to 12.27%, from 12.35%. Over in Riga, the press pack are hard at work too  . Open Europe analyst Vince Scarpetta sums up this morning\u2019s soundbytes: But today\u2019s meeting is still important, simply because Greece and its creditors are running out of opportunities to make progress. If you\u2019re just joining us, you might want to scroll back to 7am for live coverage of finance ministers arriving in Riga for today\u2019s meeting, and discussing the Greek crisis. With Eurozone finance ministers now locked in talks, here are some photos from the start of the meeting: There\u2019s a new sense of optimism in Athens this morning that Greece and its creditors will hammer out a deal in time. The Athens stock market has jumped by over 3% in early trading, with bank shares up 8%. Earlier this week, Greek stocks slumped to their lowest level since 2012, on fears of a disorderly default and exit. Apologies to anyone eating breakfast: First we had #Grexit, then #Graccident, then yesterday Citi coughed up #Grimbo. Now The Economist has got in on the act, warning that Athens is on the Gredge. In an editorial this morning, the newspaper warns that Greece is unlikely to reach a concrete deal in time. Here\u2019s a flavour: There are ways for Greece to defer disaster. It could save hard currency by issuing scrip, a type of IOU, in lieu of payments to its citizens. But that would be an open invitation to Greeks to take their remaining euros out of the banks. So the government could impose capital controls. Cyprus has had these for two years without leaving the euro, but that was done in concert with its partners. If Greece ever got to this stage\u2014a parallel currency in circulation, capital controls in place and bail-out cash withheld\u2014the gap between default and exit would be paper-thin. More here: On the Gredge The euro has hit a two-week high this morning, partly driven by hopes that the Greek crisis can be resolved in time. James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA, reckons the two sides won\u2019t reach any final agreement until June (when Greece\u2019s existing bailout expires): In July, Greece faces hefty repayments to the European Central Bank, meaning a third bailout will be needed by then (as it can\u2019t borrow in the financial markets today). Overnight, Yanis Varoufakis has announced that Greece will compromise on some key issues in order to reach a deal. In a new blogpost, Greece\u2019s finance chief says that the gap between the two sides is \u201cnot unbridgeable\u201d, and cites pension reforms and privatisations: Our government is eager to rationalize the pension system (for example, by limiting early retirement), proceed with partial privatization of public assets, address the non-performing loans that are clogging the economy\u2019s credit circuits, create a fully independent tax commission, and boost entrepreneurship. However.... the two side remain at odds over the impact of reforms on the Greek economy. Varoufakis is adamant that wages and pensions mustn\u2019t be cut further: Such measures will merely cause further damage to Greece\u2019s already-stressed social fabric, rendering it incapable of providing the support that our reform agenda desperately needs. Although this is a eurozone-only meeting, the UK has a presence at the table - Jonathan Hill, European Commissioner for Financial Services. Surely the addition of some UK nous will help them reach a deal? (that\u2019s Hill on the left) Here\u2019s a video feed from outside, and inside the eurogroup meeting, showing ministers arriving and taking their seats (you\u2019ll need scroll backwards a few minutes) There\u2019s no lack of urgency among the Greek delegation this morning. Yanis Varoufakis has taken his seat around the table and looking ready for business. Will the Greeks look any happier after the meeting? European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has arrived, and tells the press pack that progress with Greece are still \u201ctoo slow\u201d, although talks are also more consistent. And Austria\u2019s finance minister Hans Joerg Schelling is also cautiopus, saying he can\u2019t confirm whether the two side have made \u201cessential progress\u201d yet. Here\u2019s a video clip of Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem speaking as he arrived at the Eurogroup meeting a few minutes ago. He says: We will hear from our Greek colleague on the progress made. I hope there is a lot of progress to be reported, and then we\u2019ll talk to you later. Asked whether he\u2019s optimistic about a deal, Dijsselbloem says he\u2019s going to listen to the institutions first. He\u2019s heard some \u201cpositive news\u201d last week, but he wants to hear more.... Now Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, arrives at the eurogroup meeting. Sch\u00e4uble says he doesn\u2019t believe there will be \u201cdecisive progress\u201d today, but first he wants to hear the state of play from the institutions (formally known at the Troika). Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Kazimir, may be losing patience with Greece. He tells reporters in Riga that there is no more time for \u201cchit chat\u201d; but also suggests the crisis could drag on until the end of June. SLOVAK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS EUROGROUP AND GREECE HAVE 2 MONTHS TO REACH A DEAL SLOVAK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS STILL WAITING FOR SUBSTANTIAL REFORM PROPOSALS WITH DETAILS AND FIGURES FROM GREECE SLOVAK FINANCE MINISTER SAYS NO MORE TIME FOR POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC CHITCHAT WITH GREECE Disappointing! Yanis Varoufakis swept into the eurogroup meeting without speaking to the press. Here comes the head of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Dijsselbloem tells reporters in Riga that there is a \u201cgreat urgency\u201d to reach a deal with Greece. Asked about the prospects of a deal soon, Dijsselbloem says that \u201cApril isn\u2019t over yet\u201d. And then there\u2019s a kerfuffle as Yanis Varoufakis appears.... European vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has just arrived in Riga, and told reporters outside the Eurogroup that Greece must accelerate the work on its reform programme. Without a credible list, there is no chance of a deal today in Riga, Dombrovskis says. Everyone involved in the Greek negotiations must do everything they can to an \u201caccident\u201d, France\u2019s finance minister has warned. Michel Sapin told Reuters a few minutes ago that: \u201cEvery day that passes (without a deal) makes things more complicated....We must avoid an accident.\u201d And we\u2019re off.... Good morning. Greece\u2019s debt drama switches to Riga today. Eurozone finance ministers are gathering in the Latvian capital to discuss the crisis that is gripping Europe and worrying the financial markets again. A few weeks ago, this was seen as the crunch meeting that would decide if Greece received any of its outstanding bailout funds. But this deadline, like so many before, has slipped -- and we\u2019re not expecting a big breakthrough today. But the Eurogroup is still an important moment, with Greece running steadily short of funds as fresh funding demands loom. Politico sums up the mood: WHY DOES TODAY MATTER? BEGINNING OF THE LAST CHANCE SALOON: The new left-wing Greek government was supposed to present detailed reform plans today to eurozone and wider-EU finance ministers. This would have allowed lenders to unlock the next round of funds Greece needs to pay everything from creditors to pensions. No deal will happen today in Latvia, but all are desperate for signs of progress. Angela Merkel set the tone for the meeting last night, warning of the risk that Greece runs out of cash before a deal is done. The German chancellor was speaking after a sitdown chat with Greece\u2019s PM in Brussels. Alexis Tsipras urged to help speed up the negotiating process. Finance ministers are gathering in Riga right now, and we\u2019re expecting a press conference before lunchtime. We\u2019ll be tracking all the developments through the day...",

Also, Greece doesn\u2019t seem to want to exit voluntarily so it\u2019s more likely that, at least for the time being, the government will simply run progressively out of euros.</p> <p>This is likely to lead to the imposition of capital controls and issuance of government IOUs as a sort of quasi-currency (as happened in Argentina and California). That may be a precursor to a full exit of the euro. The legality of capital controls is complicated under the EU treaties and the IMF framework, the imposition of a quasi-currency may be in breach of the eurozone rules, and departure from the eurozone would definitely be a breach of them. This would all therefore be a highly complex legal situation, both for the relevant countries, and for businesses and financiers trying to work out whether their contracts are enforceable, and if so in what currency.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553a0893e4b0d91953a647f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-24T09:13:10.105Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/24/eurozone-finance-ministers-hold-greek-debt-talks-live-updates#block-5539eb89e4b01afff1aa82fe\">the euro has rallied this morning</a>, City traders aren\u2019t expecting a major breakthrough today.</strong></p> <p><strong>Arnaud Masset,</strong> market analyst at <strong>Swissquote</strong>, says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today we do not expect much from this Euro Finance Ministers meeting in Riga as several of them already lowered their expectations, the next key date for Greece being the payment of \u20ac200m to the IMF on May 1, while on May 6 Greece has to find \u20ac1.4bn at its 26-week Bill [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/24/eurozone-finance-ministers-hold-greek-debt-talks-live-updates#block-5539fff9e4b095bced12f9ca\">see our chart for details</a>].</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553a0488e4b01afff1aa8329\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-24T08:58:00.699Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">More photos from the Eurogroup</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eurozone finance chiefs looked pretty serious as talks began this morning in Riga:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b962a12d814cae613802820f63d1f210717c9190\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b962a12d814cae613802820f63d1f210717c9190/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"epa04718562 President of Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem (L) and Director Economic Affairs and Competitiveness at General Secretariat of the Council Carsten Pillath (R), during the Eurogroup tour-de-table at Informal Meeting of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) in Riga, Latvia, 24 April 2015.

Eurozone finance ministers are gathering in the Latvian capital to discuss the crisis that is gripping Europe and worrying the financial markets again.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, this was seen as <strong>the</strong> crunch meeting that would decide if Greece received any of its outstanding bailout funds. But this deadline, like so many before, has slipped -- and we\u2019re not expecting a big breakthrough today.</p> <p>But the Eurogroup is still an important moment, with Greece running steadily short of funds as fresh funding demands loom.</p> <p>Politico sums up the mood:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>WHY DOES TODAY MATTER? BEGINNING OF THE LAST CHANCE SALOON:</strong></p> <p>The new left-wing Greek government was supposed to present detailed reform plans today to eurozone and wider-EU finance ministers. This would have allowed lenders to unlock the next round of funds Greece needs to pay everything from creditors to pensions. No deal will happen today in Latvia, but all are desperate for signs of progress.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Angela Merkel</strong> set the tone for the meeting last night, warning of the risk that Greece runs out of cash before a deal is done. The German chancellor was speaking after a sitdown chat with Greece\u2019s PM in Brussels. <strong>Alexis Tsipras</strong> urged to help speed up the negotiating process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/enikos_en/statuses/591471839303479296\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Merkel: Must prevent Greece running out of cash -  <a href=\"http://t.co/CZhILG6Pm8\">http://t.co/CZhILG6Pm8</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/OrpsgrIG54\">pic.twitter.com/OrpsgrIG54</a></p>&mdash; enikos_en (@enikos_en) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/enikos_en/status/591471839303479296\">April 24, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/23/greece-bailout-deal-may-eurozone-growth-live\">Tsipras and Merkel make some progress over Greek bailout - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Finance ministers are gathering in Riga right now, </strong><strong>and we\u2019re expecting a press conference before lunchtime.</strong></p> <p><strong><em>We\u2019ll be tracking all the developments through the day...</em></strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-24T05:52:43.491Z\">at 6.52am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Dust down the steamer and practise a smooth hollandaise sauce: a combination of a fine, sunny summer last year, more planting by farmers and a warmer than average spring are promising a bumper crop of British asparagus this year. Last week\u2019s warm weather arrived just in time for the start of the two-month harvesting season, which traditionally starts on St George\u2019s Day, and continued warm weather could boost crops by 20%, according to supermarket buyers. Marks &amp; Spencer is expecting to sell 15% more British asparagus this year. Morrisons asparagus buyer David Bartle said: \u201cGrowing conditions look like they are going to be perfect. The good weather will not only affect the amount of asparagus grown but also the quality of the crop. We could have the most exceptional year since 2007.\u201d This year\u2019s crop will be boosted by a major expansion in the acreage devoted to the green spears. Since 2011 there has been a 24% rise in land devoted to asparagus production including a 2.5% rise this year alone. Farmers have been encouraged to plant more amid surging demand for home grown produce. In the last 10 years UK demand for the upmarket vegetable has soared by 540% according to market research firm Kantar. That growing taste for Asparagus has also spurred some British farmers to experiment with new varieties, which produce crops as early as February or in the autumn \u2013 offering an alternative to imports from Peru and elsewhere. Asparagus takes three years to reach maturity and the quality of any year\u2019s crop is partly influenced by the weather over the previous summer. British farmers harvest the green shoots between April and June and then leave plants to grow into ferns which build up energy in the root system to power the following year\u2019s shoots. \u201cLast summer was very very good, we all enjoyed it and so did the fern. That\u2019s nicely charged up the root system. The spears are coming up sweet and tender compared to other years.\u201d said Chris Chinn of the UK\u2019s biggest asparagus grower Cobrey Farms in the Wye Valley, which supplies Marks &amp; Spencer and other major grocers. Chinn has between 15% and 20% more acreage coming into production this year so expects a bigger crop but he said bumper yields were dependent on continued warm weather. Asparagus spears don\u2019t pop up until the temperature hits 10 degrees and grow more strongly closer to 25 degrees. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good year but its always dependent on the weather and we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. The Met Office is predicting that the UK is likely to enjoy above average temperatures between April and June but as we go into a cooler weekend a warm spring is not a certainty. David Shepherd of Evesham Vale Growers in Worcestershire, who now has 250 acres devoted to asparagus from none a few years ago, said the crop was difficult to predict because it was so dependent on the weather. \u201cOn a sunny day it can grow at an alarming rate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be like chasing chickens, trying to get enough people out into the field.\u201d Mark Diacono, the vegetable expert and former head of the garden team at River Cottage, said foodies were in for a treat if British farmers could reap a strong harvest. \u201cThe difference between English asparagus and foreign is immeasurable. The fullness of flavour is all about time from the plot to the plate. Most of us have got used to the Peruvian pencils but that\u2019s like squash whereas British asparagus is fresh juice.\u201d He said asparagus is best cooked on the griddle or steamed with a topping of boiled egg and chives. But he adds: \u201cIf you can get it fresh and tender then it\u2019s amazing completely raw.\u201d",

      "standfirst": "<p>World\u2019s third-biggest bank paid $2.4bn in UK taxes last year and is a symbol of the City\u2019s strength</p>", 
      "body": "<p>If HSBC left Britain it would deal the country a psychological as well as financial blow, according to an academic.</p> <p>The world\u2019s third biggest bank and the largest outside China, it has $2.6trn (\u00a31.7trn) of assets and its tax bill in Britain last year, including corporation tax, national insurance and the bank levy, came to $2.4bn (it reports in dollars).</p> <p>It earns its biggest slice of revenue in the UK \u2013 $16.1bn last year, compared with $13.7bn from Hong Kong, the bank\u2019s second-largest market. However, it reported a loss of $56m in Britain after $2.2bn in costs for fines and customer compensation. In Hong Kong by contrast, profit was $8.1bn.</p> <p>The bank employs about 48,000 people in the UK of 266,000 globally, according to its annual report. About 8,500 employees are based at the Sir Norman Foster-designed head office at Canary Wharf. Most of the bank\u2019s remaining UK staff work for HSBC\u2019s retail and commercial bank. </p> <p>But it is more than taxes and jobs. Despite recent damage to its reputation, such as the tax scandal at its Swiss operation, HSBC\u2019s presence helps support the idea that Britain is a big player in international finance.</p> <p>Peter Hahn, a lecturer in finance at Cass Business School, said there would be a big effect on the City\u2019s standing and also on the wider economy if HSBC left.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere would be a huge psychological effect. In HSBC leaving London you would start to wonder how long they would want to hold on to their UK bank,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are no big international banks from Britain, it isn\u2019t good for the rest of the economy. We are trying to get more small and medium-sized companies to export but we are going to have a banking system that is focused on making mortgage loans. Who is going to help successful middle-sized companies to export?\u201d</p> <p>HSBC has been a fixture in the UK for more than two decades but for most of its 150 years it made almost all its money in Asia. Last year, 78% of HSBC\u2019s $18.7bn group profit came from Asia.</p> <p>The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was founded in 1865 in Hong Kong to finance trade between Asia and Europe. The bank expanded throughout Asia and into the US but it was not until 1992 that HSBC gained a big presence in Britain. <br></p> <p>Under Sir Willie Purves, then chairman, it bought Midland Bank, which was in financial trouble, before the planned handover of Hong Kong to China. The deal to buy one of Britain\u2019s big four clearing banks was one of the largest in the industry. HSBC moved its headquarters to London the following year.</p> <p>By the late 1990s, HSBC had replaced Midland\u2019s Griffin logo with its own red and white hexagon design as HSBC branded itself \u201cthe world\u2019s local bank\u201d.</p> <p>HSBC has announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/24/hsbc-to-base-ringfenced-retail-banking-operation-in-birmingham\">that its UK retail bank\u2019s head office will move to Birmingham </a>because of the government\u2019s policy of dividing retail and investment banking.

      "bodyText": "If HSBC left Britain it would deal the country a psychological as well as financial blow, according to an academic. The world\u2019s third biggest bank and the largest outside China, it has $2.6trn (\u00a31.7trn) of assets and its tax bill in Britain last year, including corporation tax, national insurance and the bank levy, came to $2.4bn (it reports in dollars). It earns its biggest slice of revenue in the UK \u2013 $16.1bn last year, compared with $13.7bn from Hong Kong, the bank\u2019s second-largest market. However, it reported a loss of $56m in Britain after $2.2bn in costs for fines and customer compensation. In Hong Kong by contrast, profit was $8.1bn. The bank employs about 48,000 people in the UK of 266,000 globally, according to its annual report. About 8,500 employees are based at the Sir Norman Foster-designed head office at Canary Wharf. Most of the bank\u2019s remaining UK staff work for HSBC\u2019s retail and commercial bank. But it is more than taxes and jobs. Despite recent damage to its reputation, such as the tax scandal at its Swiss operation, HSBC\u2019s presence helps support the idea that Britain is a big player in international finance. Peter Hahn, a lecturer in finance at Cass Business School, said there would be a big effect on the City\u2019s standing and also on the wider economy if HSBC left. \u201cThere would be a huge psychological effect. In HSBC leaving London you would start to wonder how long they would want to hold on to their UK bank,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are no big international banks from Britain, it isn\u2019t good for the rest of the economy. We are trying to get more small and medium-sized companies to export but we are going to have a banking system that is focused on making mortgage loans. Who is going to help successful middle-sized companies to export?\u201d HSBC has been a fixture in the UK for more than two decades but for most of its 150 years it made almost all its money in Asia. Last year, 78% of HSBC\u2019s $18.7bn group profit came from Asia. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was founded in 1865 in Hong Kong to finance trade between Asia and Europe. The bank expanded throughout Asia and into the US but it was not until 1992 that HSBC gained a big presence in Britain. Under Sir Willie Purves, then chairman, it bought Midland Bank, which was in financial trouble, before the planned handover of Hong Kong to China. The deal to buy one of Britain\u2019s big four clearing banks was one of the largest in the industry. HSBC moved its headquarters to London the following year. By the late 1990s, HSBC had replaced Midland\u2019s Griffin logo with its own red and white hexagon design as HSBC branded itself \u201cthe world\u2019s local bank\u201d. HSBC has announced that its UK retail bank\u2019s head office will move to Birmingham because of the government\u2019s policy of dividing retail and investment banking. Now there is talk that HSBC could split off the retail bank, possibly under the Midland name, to refocus on Asia. At the turn of the millennium, HSBC vied with Citigroup of the US to be the biggest bank in the world with operations spanning Asia, Europe and the Americas. Despite its size and power, HSBC was regarded as a conservatively run commercial bank with little time for risky ventures. Purves was one of a long line of canny Brits \u2013 often Scots \u2013 with a military bearing to preside over the bank. That changed in the early 2000s when Sir John Bond, who replaced Purves in 1998, bought Bital, a Mexican bank, in 2002; Household International, a US subprime lender, the following year; and Republic, a private bank, from the billionaire banker Edmond Safra in 1999. Each of those deals came back to haunt HSBC. The Mexican operation became a hub for drug gangs\u2019 money laundering; Household lost billions in the subprime mortgage crisis; and Republic\u2019s Swiss operation was revealed by the Guardian to have enabled tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance by its rich clients.",

AstraZeneca wants to bring six new cancer medicines to patients by 2020.</p> <p>AstraZeneca\u2019s first-quarter results were slightly better than City analysts had expected, with revenues reaching $6.1bn, down 6% on a year earlier. Sales of heartburn pill Nexium, one of its blockbusters, fell 31% to $644m after the first generic version hit the US market. Core operating profits fell 8% to $1.8bn. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, revenues were up 1% and profits down 4%.</p> <p>The group reiterated its forecast of a low single-digit-percentage increase in 2015 core earnings, while sales are seen falling \u2013 with a return to sales growth not expected until 2017.</p> <p>Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cAstraZeneca delivered solid results in the first quarter, given the significant impact of currency movements and generic erosion of various legacy products. But the company\u2019s value is increasingly in its immuno-oncology pipeline, and this was enhanced further today by the deals with Innate Pharma and Celgene.\u201d</p> <p>But some analysts noted that earnings were improved by partially selling off a number of drugs. Alistair Campbell at Berenberg said: \u201cThis raises a concern that the company might be trading in long-term opportunities to protect short-term earnings.\u201d The Celgene deal attracted similar criticism, but Soriot insisted that it was about strategy, not cash. </p> <p>John Varley, the former Barclays boss who chairs AstraZeneca\u2019s remuneration committee, is due to retire from the board on Friday after nine years, and will be replaced by Graham Chipchase, chief executive of consumer packaging group Rexam. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/10/soriot-rewarded-with-5-pay-rise-after-repelling-pfizer-takeover-bid\" draggable=\"true\">Soriot saw his pay rise by 5% to \u00a33.5m</a> in 2014, despite a 62% fall in pretax profits. The AstraZeneca annual general meeting on Friday saw a pay revolt, with 16% of shareholder votes cast against the remuneration report. </p> <p>Soriot told journalists that changes had been made and targets were now disclosed on a regular basis, which he described as \u201cvery specific and very measurable targets\u201d over a three-year horizon. He said: \u201cClearly if we don\u2019t achieve these goals we will pay a price, and if we achieve them we will be rewarded.\u201d </p> <p>He acknowledged that investors had differing views, with some pushing for pay to be linked to the $45bn revenue target, while others said long-term share incentives should vest only when AstraZeneca\u2019s shares reach the spurned takeover price of \u00a355. The latter group included Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, who <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5e08c310-e0fa-11e3-b59f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3YDBWq07F\">wrote a letter to the Financial Times</a> last year.

They include lung cancer drug AZD9291 in coming weeks, cediranib for ovarian cancer and brodalumab for psoriasis. AstraZeneca wants to bring six new cancer medicines to patients by 2020. AstraZeneca\u2019s first-quarter results were slightly better than City analysts had expected, with revenues reaching $6.1bn, down 6% on a year earlier. Sales of heartburn pill Nexium, one of its blockbusters, fell 31% to $644m after the first generic version hit the US market. Core operating profits fell 8% to $1.8bn. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, revenues were up 1% and profits down 4%. The group reiterated its forecast of a low single-digit-percentage increase in 2015 core earnings, while sales are seen falling \u2013 with a return to sales growth not expected until 2017. Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \u201cAstraZeneca delivered solid results in the first quarter, given the significant impact of currency movements and generic erosion of various legacy products. But the company\u2019s value is increasingly in its immuno-oncology pipeline, and this was enhanced further today by the deals with Innate Pharma and Celgene.\u201d But some analysts noted that earnings were improved by partially selling off a number of drugs. Alistair Campbell at Berenberg said: \u201cThis raises a concern that the company might be trading in long-term opportunities to protect short-term earnings.\u201d The Celgene deal attracted similar criticism, but Soriot insisted that it was about strategy, not cash. John Varley, the former Barclays boss who chairs AstraZeneca\u2019s remuneration committee, is due to retire from the board on Friday after nine years, and will be replaced by Graham Chipchase, chief executive of consumer packaging group Rexam. Soriot saw his pay rise by 5% to \u00a33.5m in 2014, despite a 62% fall in pretax profits. The AstraZeneca annual general meeting on Friday saw a pay revolt, with 16% of shareholder votes cast against the remuneration report. Soriot told journalists that changes had been made and targets were now disclosed on a regular basis, which he described as \u201cvery specific and very measurable targets\u201d over a three-year horizon. He said: \u201cClearly if we don\u2019t achieve these goals we will pay a price, and if we achieve them we will be rewarded.\u201d He acknowledged that investors had differing views, with some pushing for pay to be linked to the $45bn revenue target, while others said long-term share incentives should vest only when AstraZeneca\u2019s shares reach the spurned takeover price of \u00a355. The latter group included Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, who wrote a letter to the Financial Times last year. Soriot concluded: \u201cWe believe we have a solution that satisfies the majority of our shareholders.\u201d Hundreds of animal rights activists are expected to march through Cambridge on Saturday to protest against the use of animals in scientific experiments at the university, as part of World Day for Laboratory Animals. They will also demonstrate against AstraZeneca\u2019s new headquarters in Cambridge, Cambridge News reported.",

      "bodyText": "Mounting tensions between Greece and other euro members have flared up at an acrimonious meeting in Riga, with finance ministers blasting the country\u2019s leftwing leaders for failing to make more progress towards a bailout deal. Ministers lambasted Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis for not reaching an agreement with creditors two months after the eurozone extended Greece\u2019s loan programme until the end of June.

Malta\u2019s finance minister Edward Scicluna declared: \u201cI would describe today\u2019s meeting as a complete breakdown in communication with Greece.\u201d ECB president Mario Draghi also betrayed his exasperation and warned that central bank could impose tougher conditions in return for keeping Greek banks afloat. Weeks ago, the Riga meeting had been pencilled in as the moment when the eurozone could sign off an aid payment for Greece, but in the event ministers vented their frustration with Varoufakis for Greece\u2019s failure to bridge the gap with creditors. Varoufakis said the talks were \u201cintense\u201d, but remained confident that the two sides will resolve their differences in time. \u201cWe agreed that an agreement will be difficult but it will happen and it will happen quickly because that is the only option we have,\u201d he told a press conference.

Shareholder after shareholder had asked whether London was the correct home for the bank.<br></p> <p>Flint said: \u201cI said at our informal meeting in Hong Kong on Monday, we are beginning to see the final shape of regulation and of structural reform, including the requirement to ring fence in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cAs part of the broader strategic review taking place, the board has therefore now asked management to commence work to look at where the best place is for HSBC to be headquartered in this new environment. The question is a complex one, and it is too soon to say how long this will take or what the conclusion will be; but the work is under way.\u201d</p> <p>The bank usually conducts a review of its head office location every three years. But the last one was in 2010 and it has not conducted one since because of the regulatory reforms imposed on banks after the 2008 financial crisis. This included the reforms to ringfence high street operations from investment banking arms \u2013 the Vickers reforms \u2013 and George Osborne\u2019s bank levy. <br></p> <p>Flint added: \u201cOne economic uncertainty stands out, that of continuing UK membership of the EU. In February we published a major research study which concluded that working to complete the single market in services and reforming the EU to make it more competitive were far less risky than going it alone, given the importance of EU markets to British trade.\u201d</p> <p>At the packed meeting Sir Simon Robertson, the deputy chairman, was forced to defend Flint and the chief executive Stuart Gulliver. \u201cI want to make it absolutely clear the board has full confidence in both Douglas and Stuart and the rest of the management team.\u201d </p> <p>But shareholders registered their disapproval, with almost a quarter of them voting against the bank\u2019s remuneration report. On the head office move, one shareholder asked: \u201cWhich country are you likely to go to? How many countries have you not committed illegal behaviour in?\u201d</p> <p>The bank employs 166,000 worldwide and about 48,000 are estimated to be in the UK, where HSBC moved its head office after the takeover of Midland Bank in 1992. Unions called for an urgent meeting to discuss the possible implications for staff.</p> <p>Flint also apologised for the scandals to hit the bank: \u201cI and my colleagues understand your disillusionment, share your frustration at having been let down, apologise for the inadequacies in controls that allowed unacceptable behaviours to occur undetected and accept responsibility for restoring HSBC\u2019s reputation and standing to where they should be.\u201d<br></p> <p>Flint has been on the board since 1995 and is facing scrutiny along with other directors about the activities in HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm between 2005 and 2007. Leaked account details showed how customers had been helped to avoid paying tax. This came after the bank was fined \u00a31.1bn from the US authorities for money laundering offences.</p> <p>Flint said: \u201cHSBC has paid a heavy price. Our reputation has been damaged and the financial burden of the unacceptable behaviour has been borne by you, our shareholders in fines, penalties, additional costs and the opportunity costs arising from diversion of management time - this is clearly wrong.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs new regulation which will clarify individual responsibility is embedded and fresh legislation comes into force that will widen the sanctions available to address the most egregious behaviour, I hope we will see much greater individual accountability visited on those directly responsible.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about HSBC, the prime minister, David Cameron said: \u201cLondon is the world\u2019s leading financial centre [and] has improved as a financial centre not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn\u2019t have to bail them out with taxpayers\u2019 money in future as the last Labour government had to do. </p> <p>\u201cBut it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro enterprise, pro business, pro employment policy in our country. We need to keep taxes low, make this an attractive place to invest. All the time I have been Prime Minister that is what we have been doing, [with] record levels of inward investment coming here.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "HSBC Britain\u2019s biggest bank, has issued a stark warning about the economic risks of the UK pulling out of the European Union as it revealed it was considering moving its headquarters out of London. The unexpected announcement of a full-blown review into where the bank should base its operations, just two week before the general election, was seized on by politicians on the campaign trail. HSBC said \u201cregulatory and structural reforms\u201d in the wake of the banking crisis had led to the decision. The chairman, Douglas Flint, also highlighted the economic uncertainty created by the risk of the UK leaving Europe \u2013 a blow to the Conservatives, who have pledged to hold an \u201cin-out\u201d referendum on the EU if they win the general election. HSBC has been hit hard the banking levy, which last year cost it $1.1bn (\u00a3730m), up from $200m in 2013. Flint denied playing politics, adding the board only decided to launch the review on Thursday after pressure from shareholders. \u201cHow other people interpret it is up to them,\u201d he told reporters after the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting on Friday. Its shares jumped over 3% after the statement. The rise added almost \u00a34bn to the value of HSBC \u2013 already one of the most valuable companies on the London stock market. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the warning over EU membership showed that the Conservatives were irresponsible in \u201cplaying fast and loose with the UK\u2019s membership of the EU\u201d. He said the bank would be expected to take account of the wider regulatory context when deciding where to base its business but the warning about the EU was a new dimension. The chancellor, George Osborne, said banks needed to be \u201cproperly regulated\u201d but added that Labour\u2019s policies would drive businesses overseas. \u201cIf we proceed in this country with an anti-business set of policies we are going to drive companies abroad, we are going to see jobs lost,\u201d he said. The HSBC board \u2013 under fire after leaks of the tax avoidance strategies used in its Swiss arm \u2013 took the decision on Thursday night after returning from an informal meeting of investors in Hong Kong, its base until 1992. Shareholder after shareholder had asked whether London was the correct home for the bank. Flint said: \u201cI said at our informal meeting in Hong Kong on Monday, we are beginning to see the final shape of regulation and of structural reform, including the requirement to ring fence in the UK. \u201cAs part of the broader strategic review taking place, the board has therefore now asked management to commence work to look at where the best place is for HSBC to be headquartered in this new environment. The question is a complex one, and it is too soon to say how long this will take or what the conclusion will be; but the work is under way.\u201d The bank usually conducts a review of its head office location every three years. But the last one was in 2010 and it has not conducted one since because of the regulatory reforms imposed on banks after the 2008 financial crisis. This included the reforms to ringfence high street operations from investment banking arms \u2013 the Vickers reforms \u2013 and George Osborne\u2019s bank levy. Flint added: \u201cOne economic uncertainty stands out, that of continuing UK membership of the EU. In February we published a major research study which concluded that working to complete the single market in services and reforming the EU to make it more competitive were far less risky than going it alone, given the importance of EU markets to British trade.\u201d At the packed meeting Sir Simon Robertson, the deputy chairman, was forced to defend Flint and the chief executive Stuart Gulliver. \u201cI want to make it absolutely clear the board has full confidence in both Douglas and Stuart and the rest of the management team.\u201d But shareholders registered their disapproval, with almost a quarter of them voting against the bank\u2019s remuneration report. On the head office move, one shareholder asked: \u201cWhich country are you likely to go to? How many countries have you not committed illegal behaviour in?\u201d The bank employs 166,000 worldwide and about 48,000 are estimated to be in the UK, where HSBC moved its head office after the takeover of Midland Bank in 1992. Unions called for an urgent meeting to discuss the possible implications for staff. Flint also apologised for the scandals to hit the bank: \u201cI and my colleagues understand your disillusionment, share your frustration at having been let down, apologise for the inadequacies in controls that allowed unacceptable behaviours to occur undetected and accept responsibility for restoring HSBC\u2019s reputation and standing to where they should be.\u201d Flint has been on the board since 1995 and is facing scrutiny along with other directors about the activities in HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking arm between 2005 and 2007. Leaked account details showed how customers had been helped to avoid paying tax. This came after the bank was fined \u00a31.1bn from the US authorities for money laundering offences. Flint said: \u201cHSBC has paid a heavy price. Our reputation has been damaged and the financial burden of the unacceptable behaviour has been borne by you, our shareholders in fines, penalties, additional costs and the opportunity costs arising from diversion of management time - this is clearly wrong. \u201cAs new regulation which will clarify individual responsibility is embedded and fresh legislation comes into force that will widen the sanctions available to address the most egregious behaviour, I hope we will see much greater individual accountability visited on those directly responsible.\u201d Asked about HSBC, the prime minister, David Cameron said: \u201cLondon is the world\u2019s leading financial centre [and] has improved as a financial centre not least by changing the way we regulate banks so that we wouldn\u2019t have to bail them out with taxpayers\u2019 money in future as the last Labour government had to do. \u201cBut it is an important reminder of how vital it is that we keep a pro enterprise, pro business, pro employment policy in our country. We need to keep taxes low, make this an attractive place to invest. All the time I have been Prime Minister that is what we have been doing, [with] record levels of inward investment coming here.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "HSBC has been dancing around the domicile handbag for about a decade. It used to run a review every three years. Then, in 2012, it postponed the question indefinitely, arguing that too many other things were happening \u2013 like regulators\u2019 evolving plans to ensure the next banking crisis does not have the damaging consequences of the 2007-2009 catastrophe. Now HSBC has waltzed back onto the dancefloor. \u201cWe are beginning to see the final shape of regulation and of structural reform,\u201d says chairman Douglas Flint. So yet another review has been ordered to answer this \u201ccomplex\u201d question. Is it really that complex? One point is very simple. Even in the new regulatory environment of fatter capital cushions, big banks need to be domiciled in big countries. If not, investors will worry that the home state can\u2019t fund a bailout in a crisis. Bondholders would then demand a higher price to lend. Iceland was bust by its banks. Royal Bank of Scotland would have done much the same to an independent Scotland. In HSBC\u2019s case, there are only two possible homes, other than the UK \u2013 the US or China/Hong Kong. The US is surely a non-starter. HSBC operates there under a deferred prosecution agreement, a result of its money-laundering for Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, for which it was fined $1.9n in 2012. It\u2019s hard to believe HSBC would wish to be American. That leaves China/Hong Kong, which is where the bank\u2019s roots lie. The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation moved to the UK in 1992 with its purchase of Midland Bank. The UK authorities demanded the redomicile but it was also seen as a smart piece of planning since Hong Kong was being handed back to China in 1999 with unknown consequences. So why is UK suddenly seen as less attractive? Flint\u2019s mention of \u201cthe shape of regulation\u201d is partly code for the bank levy, introduced by chancellor George Osborne. This is calculated on a UK-domiciled bank\u2019s global assets \u2013 not just those in this country \u2013 so an international operator gets hit disproportionately. All the main political parties are committed to the levy (and Labour is arguing for an increase) and analysts at Investec reckon HSBC\u2019s charge could rise from $1.1bn (\u00a3660m) in 2014 to $1.6bn in 2015 as a result of an increase in the budget in March. If HSBC was based in Hong Kong or Shanghai \u2013 and thus only its UK business was eligible for the levy \u2013 the bank would escape about two thirds of the charge. Flint also mentioned the UK\u2019s new ring-fencing rules today. These require a separation of the UK bank and dedicated capital cushions. HSBC\u2019s thought might be this: we are reorganising our UK business anyway and moving it from London to Birmingham, so why not go the full hog and shift the headquarters of the rest of the bank? The problem is this. The mists, as Flint calls them, are clearing around regulation but HSBC would he heading into a thick smog if went eastwards. In the UK, banks are regulated by a body accountable to a democratically elected parliament in a country that operates an open system of justice. Hong Kong may still love its financiers and tycoons but the UK\u2019s former colony comes under the increasingly watchful gaze of the Chinese Communist party. Could HSBC \u2013 or anybody \u2013 really know how the Hong Kong political landscape will look 20 years from now? That, at a minimum, is the horizon Flint &amp; co should be considering. No doubt there will be a strong lobby within HSBC arguing the case for Hong Kong or China. Most of the group\u2019s profits are made in Asia, and the locals feel HSBC never really left, spiritually speaking. But the costs and upheaval of such a move would be enormous. HSBC is vastly bigger than it was in 1992 and regulators\u2019 demands have multiplied. But the basic problem is straightforward: China and Hong Kong might look pretty today, but HSBC would risk making itself a slave to an undemocratic regime in Beijing. The idea seems mad.",

Athens is waiting for a further \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn) in rescue funds and without that money it is unlikely the country can pay almost \u20ac1bn due to the IMF in early May. Fears are growing that Greece will therefore default, precipitating the country\u2019s exit from the eurozone.</p> <p>Here we look at the near-term debt deadlines for Greece and what money it has left to meet them.

He notes that Greece has financial assets it can fall back on. The most up-to-date data, from September 2014, showed the Greek government had assets worth \u20ac86.6bn. Darvas adds:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if the \u20ac86.6bn has declined by a dozen or two, and even if not all of the remaining assets could be easily used to pay for obligations, there is still a lot, and much more than the \u20ac30bn assets the Greek general government had at the end of 1997 (see chart below).\u201d<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2c2f6b0c7e983d40ea7d192907ba1f01d7529c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/19/1429466960291/e2d8442a-89c2-4da9-b20b-eacd4375d0dd-460x219.png\" alt=\"Greece \u2013 Consolidated financial assets of the general government, \u20ac millions, December 1997 \u2013 September 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"219\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This chart shows consolidated financial assets of the general government in Greece, \u20ac millions, December 1997 \u2013 September 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruegel, using quarterly financial accounts for general government dataset from Eurostat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Darvas at Bruegel also notes asset holdings in Greece are \u201crelatively high\u201d by comparison with other European countries.

      "bodyText": "Crunch talks between Greece and its eurozone creditors are under way, but investors are growing increasingly sceptical that the country can reach an agreement on reforms and unlock the aid it needs from international lenders to avoid a debt default. Greece owes money to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union following its two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. Athens is waiting for a further \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn) in rescue funds and without that money it is unlikely the country can pay almost \u20ac1bn due to the IMF in early May. Fears are growing that Greece will therefore default, precipitating the country\u2019s exit from the eurozone. Here we look at the near-term debt deadlines for Greece and what money it has left to meet them. We also consider how quickly funds have been flowing out of Greek banks. Debt deadlines This covers repayments and the largest interest payments on debt due from Greece in coming months. The list includes Treasury bills, usually called T-bills for short, which are shorter-dated government bonds sold to domestic investors, such as Greek banks, and to a smaller extent to foreign investors. Greece has previously managed to convince bondholders to roll over their T-bill holdings, but with the country\u2019s position growing more uncertain this pattern will become harder to maintain. This chart from UBS sums up repayments for the rest of this year. What is left? On top of debt repayments and interest payments, Greece has to cover the usual costs of pensions and salaries for the public sector. Salary and pension payments due in late April are thought to come to around \u20ac1.7bn. There have been warnings that Greece faces a choice between meeting those commitments and its debt servicing - and that it cannot afford both unless the next lot of bailout funds is paid out. Unnamed finance ministry officials in Greece have tolds Reuters news service that Greece will need to tap all the remaining cash reserves across its public sector, a total of \u20ac2bn, to pay wages and pensions at the end of the month. But at the same time, and without providing any figures, Greece\u2019s finance ministry denied in a statement that it would need to tap remaining cash reserves to meet salary payments. Economists say some scepticism should apply to any claims the coffers are almost empty. Paolo Pizzoli , senior economist at ING in Milan comments: The Greek government has tried to squeeze money out of a variety of sources for a couple of months now. Capital expenditure has reportedly been trimmed, state payments to third parties have been postponed and reserve funds of public institutions tapped, but with scarce chances to get the relevant data evidence. Furthermore, the \u2018running out of funds\u2019 rhetoric has often been used instrumentally to affect negotiations by parties involved, adding to the noise. Bottom line, we, or at least I, don\u2019t now how much money the country has now available, but I suspect that there is not much left in the coffers. Zsolt Darvas at the thinktank Bruegel also urges caution about any warnings that Greece is about to run out of cash. He notes that Greece has financial assets it can fall back on. The most up-to-date data, from September 2014, showed the Greek government had assets worth \u20ac86.6bn. Darvas adds: Even if the \u20ac86.6bn has declined by a dozen or two, and even if not all of the remaining assets could be easily used to pay for obligations, there is still a lot, and much more than the \u20ac30bn assets the Greek general government had at the end of 1997 (see chart below).\u201d Darvas at Bruegel also notes asset holdings in Greece are \u201crelatively high\u201d by comparison with other European countries. As a share of financial assets in GDP, Greece ranked seventh among the 28 EU countries in September 2014, as shown here: What is happening at Greek banks? Growing uncertainty about Greece\u2019s position in the eurozone and fears of rising political instability have prompted savers to take their money out of Greek banks and instead keep it at home or move it overseas. Banks suffered deposit outflows of some \u20ac25bn between December and February, according to the latest figures. The capital flight continued in March but the pace slowed somewhat with net withdrawals at \u20ac3bn, according to a report by news service Bloomberg. Gabriel Sterne at the consultancy Oxford Economics comments: The big surprise, if anything, is it still remains more of a bank jog than a bank run. It wouldn\u2019t take much, however, for confidence to go and the run to accelerate.\u201d Given deposits are the basic source of funding for banks, their depletion is seen representing a significant risk for the Greek financial system. So far, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been prepeared to step in and fill the funding gap for Greek banks by increasing the cap on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). However, as the name the implies, this was never intended to be a long-term measure to keep a eurozone country afloat.
