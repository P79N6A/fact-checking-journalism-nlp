The three companies \u2013 and Statoil of Norway \u2013 have all promised to co-operate fully. Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, confirmed that an official from the OFT accompanied colleagues from Brussels on the unannounced raids. But he specifically mentioned that the investigation was not \"directly linked\" to the allegations of gas market manipulation raised last November by the Guardian, which Ofgem and the main City regulator, the FCA, are continuing to review. The way petrol prices in Britain remain high even after falls in the value of global wholesale oil have long been a source of deep anger and frustration for motorists and motoring groups such as the AA. Four months ago the OFT ruled out a full investigation into allegations of petrol price fixing after finding that competition in the sector was \"working well\" and that there was \"very limited evidence\" that pump prices rise quickly when the wholesale price goes up but fall more slowly when it drops. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, described the alleged behaviour of the oil companies as shocking, while Robert Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, called for prison sentences for any executives found to have overseen any price fixing. He told the BBC: \"Last year we urged the Office of Fair Trading to launch a full inquiry into alleged price fixing by oil companies.

Had economists been asked five years ago to predict the level of unemployment in the event that the economy would crash and then recover at a snail's pace, they would have predicted joblessness at 3.5 million or higher. Looking back at what happened in the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s that would have been a reasonable assumption. What has happened is that workers have managed to stay in their jobs or find work by accepting real cuts in living standards. As Wednesday's data from the Office for National Statistics showed, average earnings are rising by 0.8% a year, the lowest on record, and well below the current 2.8% inflation rate. Labour is cheap. This process has its limits, though. Firms have been content to hire part-time employees or keep them on temporary and zero-hour contracts \u2013 but only for so long. Unless there is some hope the economy is recovering sustainably, employers will reassess their labour needs, with the casualised bit of the workforce feeling the heat first. The latest figures suggest that is precisely what happened in early 2013. This might prove a temporary phenomenon if there is a growth spurt. But with wages lagging prices there seems no obvious reason why this should happen during 2013. And even if it does, firms will respond initially by getting full-time workers to work a bit harder.

      "bodyText": "It was a low-key exit. Those expecting Sir Mervyn King to draw comparisons between his 21 years at the Bank of England and Sir Alex Ferguson's 26 years at Old Trafford were disappointed. There was a quip about Che Guevara, once governor of Bank of Cuba, and a suggestion to a Slovenian journalist that her country might like to quit the euro and join the sterling zone. But for the most part King was happy to drone on about monetary policy trade-offs, GDP fan charts and spare capacity. Happy also to be able to pass on the baton to the new governor, Mark Carney, with growth a bit higher and inflation a bit lower than was envisaged three months ago. King has not been able to boast of that since early 2007, days of innocence when the world had yet to hear of sub-prime mortgages, credit default swaps and quantitative easing. A recovery is in sight, King said, on the back of forecasts that the economy will follow 0.3% growth in the first quarter of 2013 with 0.5% expansion in the second quarter. But by historical standards, not that much of a recovery. The Bank expects growth of a little more than 1% this year, but it will not be until next year that the economy regains the ground lost since the start of the recession in early 2008. Meanwhile, if the Bank is right and inflation rises above 3% in June one of Carney's first jobs will be to write a letter to George Osborne explaining why Threadneedle Street has once again failed to keep the cost of living in check. King provided an explanation on Wednesday: hitting the 2% target would have required higher interest rates and a deeper recession. Much has changed since King arrived at the Bank of England back in 1991. Robin Leigh-Pemberton was in charge at Threadneedle Street, John Major was prime minister, Stars by Simply Red was the biggest selling album of the year, and Black Wednesday was still 18 months in the future. Britain was driven out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on 16 September 1992 by the speculative activities of George Soros, leaving a policy vacuum that King helped fill with inflation targeting. The next decade a half were the good times, a long 15-year stretch, when the UK looked as if it had finally cracked it. Growth was strong, unemployment fell and inflation was low. In more than 60 consecutive quarters there was not a single incidence of negative growth. King dubbed it Nice \u2013 an acronym which stood for non-inflationary continual expansion. In truth, the UK had not cracked it. The period since August 2007 has been anything but Nice. Indeed, it's been positively nasty. On King's watch, Britain suffered the first run on a high street bank since the collapse of Overend and Gurney in 1866. The government was forced to put billions of pounds of taxpayers money behind RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. Worst of all, the economy suffered from a recession deeper and longer than anything witnessed in the post-war era. History will show that King was slow to spot the dangers, taking an over-academic approach when the financial markets froze up in 2007 and waiting too long to ease policy in 2008 when the economy was nosediving towards the slump. Yet it will also show that once the penny dropped he became a full convert to monetary activism. That unprecedented level of stimulus will remain in place long after King retires on 30 June. He seems happy to go. The past five years have been gruelling and he has had enough.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "UK unemployment starts to rise again", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unemployment jumped and average wage rises dropped to their lowest rate on record in the three months to March, underlining concerns at the slow pace of the UK's recovery. There was an increase in unemployment of 15,000 in the first quarter of the year, while during the same period regular pay rose by just 0.8%. Total pay rises, which include bonuses, came in even lower than average pay rises, said the Office for National Statistics, increasing by only 0.4% at a time when inflation remains stubbornly high at 2.8%. The worsening unemployment picture sent the jobless rate up from 7.7% to 7.8% and left the total number unemployed at 2.52 million. Chancellor George Osborne has come under increasing pressure to stimulate economic growth from a wide range of critics, though they differ in their remedies, especially in areas such as construction. A report for the London Assembly this week found that there are 150,000 skilled construction workers in the capital claiming jobseeker's allowance, at a cost of \u00a32.1bn in benefits. A similar picture of empty and half-built construction sites is repeated across the country as the industry, which accounts for 7% of economic activity, remains in the doldrums. Martin Back, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the labour market data provides \"something of a reality check\" following recent positive news on the economy. \"There was a triple whammy of bad news, with employment in the three months to March down by 43,000 and unemployment, on the ILO measure, up by 15,000. Meanwhile, the squeeze on real earnings has intensified, with average earnings including bonuses falling by 0.7% year on year in March, the first drop since 2009.\" The employment minister, Mark Hoban, conceded there had been a \"disappointing increase\" in the headline rate of unemployment, but said other indicators showed the government was making progress. \"There are record numbers of women in work, fewer young people unemployed and more vacancies available for those looking for work. We are also seeing continuing falls in the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance, which is positive.\" The number of job vacancies rose in the three months to March to 503,000, the highest total since 2008, though well down on the 950,000 jobs on offer in 2007. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in April fell to its lowest level since May 2011 at 1.52 million, down 7,300 from March 2013 and down 67,800 from a year earlier. Analysts said some of the drop in the claimant count could be ascribed to the slight improvement in the economic picture this year and the success of benefit offices in shifting workers back into work. Hoban said: \"These statistics also show that the UK's employment rate, which currently stands at around 71%, compares favourably to the US, where it is 67%, and the EU and the eurozone, where it is even lower \u2013 at 64%.\" Louise's story Louise Thomasson never imagined she would still be doing her part-time student job six months after graduating with a first in English. Since last autumn, the 22-year-old from Bolton has applied for more than 100 jobs, but is still looking for that elusive break into graduate work in marketing. \"I've put a lot of effort getting a first because I though it would at least help my CV stand out a bit from all the other grads that are applying, but it doesn't seem to have made any difference.\" Thomasson, who has \u00a324,000 in debts, expects not to be as well off as friends who didn't go to university when she lands a job. The young graduate was given yet another reminder of how tough the labour market is when she went to an assessment day for an admin assistant job paying the minimum wage. \"When I turned up, it looked like the boardroom of The Apprentice. There were people there who had done masters. There were people who had come from prestigious universities. One of them had set up their own charity. It was quite intimidating and I was sort of startled by the kind of calibre of the people who had turned up.\" She didn't get through to the next round, and for now continues to work 20 hours a week in a sales job at an electrical equipment superstore and do two days a week volunteering. Although she finds her situation bleak, she is not giving up. \"I did work very hard in my degree and I do have a passion for what I do.\" Selling televisions would be a welcome break for Lisa Brownlie, who has not had a job since she left school without qualifications two years ago. \"The jobs I have been applying for have been any job I can get hold off supermarkets, sales, anything.\" She has been called to interview only twice, failing both times because she lacks school certificates. \"Me with no qualifications against 10 other people that have something, I've got no chance,\" she said. Brownlie recently passed a maths NVQ and is close to finishing two courses in English and customer service at Rathbone, a Manchester-based charity that helps young people not in education, work or training. Although the charity gives her \u00a340 a week to meet lunch and travel expenses and she lives rent free with a friend's parents, money is tight. Once she has finished her exams, she hopes to study childcare. \"I would like to focus on younger children because I think the first couple of years of a child's life are the most important.\"",

      "body": "<p>Unemployment jumped and average wage rises dropped to their lowest rate on record in the three months to March, underlining concerns at the slow pace of the UK's recovery.</p> <p>There was an increase in unemployment of 15,000 in the first quarter of the year, while during the same period regular pay rose by just 0.8%.</p> <p>Total pay rises, which include bonuses, came in even lower than average pay rises, said the Office for National Statistics, increasing by only 0.4% at a time when inflation remains stubbornly high at 2.8%.</p> <p>The worsening unemployment picture sent the jobless rate up from 7.7% to 7.8% and left the total number unemployed at 2.52 million.</p> <p>Chancellor George Osborne has come under increasing pressure to stimulate economic growth from a wide range of critics, though they differ in their remedies, especially in areas such as construction.</p> <p>A report for the London Assembly this week found that there are 150,000 skilled construction workers in the capital claiming jobseeker's allowance, at a cost of \u00a32.1bn in benefits. A similar picture of empty and half-built construction sites is repeated across the country as the industry, which accounts for 7% of economic activity, remains in the doldrums.</p> <p>Martin Back, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the labour market data provides \"something of a reality check\" following recent positive news on the economy. \"There was a triple whammy of bad news, with employment in the three months to March down by 43,000 and unemployment, on the ILO measure, up by 15,000. Meanwhile, the squeeze on real earnings has intensified, with average earnings including bonuses falling by 0.7% year on year in March, the first drop since 2009.\"</p> <p>The employment minister, Mark Hoban, conceded there had been a \"disappointing increase\" in the headline rate of unemployment, but said other indicators showed the government was making progress. \"There are record numbers of women in work, fewer young people unemployed and more vacancies available for those looking for work. We are also seeing continuing falls in the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance, which is positive.\"</p> <p>The number of job vacancies rose in the three months to March to 503,000, the highest total since 2008, though well down on the 950,000 jobs on offer in 2007.</p> <p>The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in April fell to its lowest level since May 2011 at 1.52 million, down 7,300 from March 2013 and down 67,800 from a year earlier.</p> <p>Analysts said some of the drop in the claimant count could be ascribed to the slight improvement in the economic picture this year and the success of benefit offices in shifting workers back into work.</p> <p>Hoban said: \"These statistics also show that the UK's employment rate, which currently stands at around 71%, compares favourably to the US, where it is 67%, and the EU and the eurozone, where it is even lower \u2013 at 64%.\"</p> <h2><strong>Louise's story</strong></h2> <p>Louise Thomasson never imagined she would still be doing her part-time student job six months after graduating with a first in English. Since last autumn, the 22-year-old from Bolton has applied for more than 100 jobs, but is still looking for that elusive break into graduate work in marketing.</p> <p>\"I've put a lot of effort getting a first because I though it would at least help my CV stand out a bit from all the other grads that are applying, but it doesn't seem to have made any difference.\"</p> <p>Thomasson, who has \u00a324,000 in debts, expects not to be as well off as friends who didn't go to university when she lands a job. The young graduate was given yet another reminder of how tough the labour market is when she went to an assessment day for an admin assistant job paying the minimum wage. \"When I turned up, it looked like the boardroom of The Apprentice. There were people there who had done masters. There were people who had come from prestigious universities. One of them had set up their own charity. It was quite intimidating and I was sort of startled by the kind of calibre of the people who had turned up.\"</p> <p>She didn't get through to the next round, and for now continues to work 20 hours a week in a sales job at an electrical equipment superstore and do two days a week volunteering. Although she finds her situation bleak, she is not giving up. \"I did work very hard in my degree and I do have a passion for what I do.\"</p> <p>Selling televisions would be a welcome break for Lisa Brownlie, who has not had a job since she left school without qualifications two years ago. \"The jobs I have been applying for have been any job I can get hold off supermarkets, sales, anything.\" She has been called to interview only twice, failing both times because she lacks school certificates. \"Me with no qualifications against 10 other people that have something, I've got no chance,\" she said.</p> <p>Brownlie recently passed a maths NVQ and is close to finishing two courses in English and customer service at Rathbone, a Manchester-based charity that helps young people not in education, work or training. Although the charity gives her \u00a340 a week to meet lunch and travel expenses and she lives rent free with a friend's parents, money is tight.</p> <p>Once she has finished her exams, she hopes to study childcare. \"I would like to focus on younger children because I think the first couple of years of a child's life are the most important.\"</p>",

However, the US retail giant has created its own agreement, which it claims goes beyond the current accord that was drafted by labour groups and campaigners. The company, which also owns the UK's third biggest supermarket, Asda, said the deal signed by its rivals was \"unnecessary to achieve fire and safety goals\" and questioned the \"governance and dispute-resolution mechanisms\". Instead, Walmart has agreed its own deal to inspect all 279 factories it uses in Bangladesh within six months, and has promised to publish the findings immediately. Bosses claim this goes beyond the UNI Global Union and IndustriALL deal, pointing out the agreement requires 65% of inspections instead of 100% inspections taking place and argue its own deal means results are published straight away rather than within 45 days. However, the Walmart deal is not legally binding, does not require the company to offer financial support for fire and safety regulations or blacklist factories unwilling to comply. The agreement has been criticised by campaigners as a \"business as usual\" approach, which fails to address the core problems that led to the Rana Plaza factory collapse. Sam Maher from Labour Behind the Label, said: \"Walmart's so-called new programme is simply more of the same ineffective auditing that failed to prevent the Rana Plaza disaster, or the deaths of 112 workers at Tazreen, who were producing Walmart goods. \"The changes demanded by the IndustriALL accord include ensuring that factories are provided with the incentives and investment needed to actually make factories safe and are essential for any real change to occur.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone suffers its longest downturn ever as France sinks back into recession - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That's all for today. Thanks for reading, and for all the great comments. Just to recap the two main events of the day: \u2022 The eurozone is in its longest recession since it was created, after GDP fell by 0.2% in the first three months of 2012. Downturns in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands drove the downturn, while Germany grew by a meagre 0.1%. Full story here: 1.19pm How the events unfolded: from 6.44am \u2022 In the UK, the Bank of England declared that Britain's economy is on the road to a modest recovery. It raised its growth forecast for the first time since the financial crisis began, as Mervyn King marked his last Quarterly Inflation Report with an attack on the financial transaction tax. See 10.36am onwards for highlights of the press conference Thanks all, and goodnight. GW The deepening eurozone recession didn't prevent Europe's stock markets closing higher, with the FTSE 100 sneaking up 7 points to a new five-and-a-half year high of 6693. Here's the closing prices (and the latest from Wall Street, where the Dow and the S&amp;P are up too) As Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG Index, points out, the \"yawning disconnect between stock markets and growth fundamentals\" was on display again. She predicts markets will probably be pushed higher by the promise of future central bank action: Given that Mario Draghi is ready to act if necessary, the key upshot is that as long as the poor data continues to flow, central banks will keep flooding the markets with liquidity. Hence more multi-year highs for many European benchmark indices are likely to materialise. Sir Mervyn King's attack on the upcoming eurozone financial transaction tax has been welcomed by the CBI, but criticised by the Robin Hood campaign which has long fought for its introduction. As reported at 11.50am, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England claimed that the FTT was a pretty bad idea, and one that little genuine suport within the European central banking world. Matthew Fell, CBI director for competitive markets, agrees: We agree with Sir Mervyn that a Financial Transaction Tax is a bad idea. It would harm growth, jobs and investment here in the UK and that\u2019s why the Government was right to opt out of it in the first place. If other countries want to press ahead with this ill-conceived tax then it should only impact on them. The FTT tax will mean a small levy on all euro denominated transactions, and eleven countries have signed up. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign,was unimpressed by King's comments: Given the damage the Square Mile wreaked on the UK economy during his time in Threadneedle St, it's rather surprising that Mervyn King is still backing the interests of the City against those of the rest of us. The fact is that 11 countries have had the courage to take on the lobbying power of the financial sector rather than letting it off scot-free as the UK is intent on doing. Mervyn King himself has said that it's ordinary people who are paying the price of the financial crisis, yet now he's taking a sideways swipe at a proposal that could put that right. France's lurch back into recession today prompted EC president Jose Manuel Barroso to press Paris to speed up its economic reforms, at a press conference with president Francois Hollande. Barroso warned that the French government needs to commit to new structural reforms in return for being given an extra two years to get its deficit in order. Pointing to France's \"the exorbitant weight of debt\", Barroso declared that France must make up for two decades of lost economic competitiveness. Both men said they agreed that growth must be a top priority (unfortunately, achieving it is rather harder) Barroso also threw France a carrot, as Reuters reports: In a gesture of support, Barroso also said the European Commission would not negotiate away France's \"cultural exception\" - a system of subsidies supporting its entertainment industry - in any future EU-U.S. free trade agreement. Barroso said he sensed in Hollande a \"genuine will\" to push reforms but declined to say what recommendations the Commission would make on May 29 when it sets out its view on what France must achieve in return for the two-year deficit reprieve. (ps: sorry about the slowdown in posting -- a quick trip out of the office (!) to chat about the crisis). Italy looks like it has been successful with a new \u20ac6bn 30 year bond, which will help the country extend the average maturity of its debt. It booked more than \u20ac12.7bn of orders for the bond this morning and Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The Italian Tesoro is now taking advantage of still favourable market conditions for ultra-long periphery debt and today's sale will help to increase the duration of the Italian debt after last year's considerable reduction. Europe isn't the only place reporting bad economic data today. US industrial output fell by 0.5% in April, according to figures just released. The fall was driven by a drop in utilities output, and also lower production from manufacturing firms. Economists had expected a decline of just 0.2%. Here's a video clip of Sir Mervyn King announcing that the Bank of England has raised its growth forecasts for the UK economy... Over on the FT, Michael Steen has pulled together 'five quick takeaways' from today's GDP data. They include: that the ECB was right to cut borrowing costs last week, that Germany exporters aren't as strong as expected, and that EC's growth forecasts may now be too optimistic. Here's another view on today's eurozone GDP figures, from Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at CEBR. A big factor in the disappointing if predictable result is that the French economy again contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2013. We expect that this situation will persists for a while and given the weight of France in Europe the rest of the currency union will be affected. The other major Eurozone economy, Germany, is estimated to have grown in Q1 2013, but at only 0.1% quarter on quarter. It, too, borders on the brink of a downturn. Finland, another nation considered part of the economically solid Eurozone core, also entered recession with a second consecutive quarter of negative growth. A rare piece of good news in the latest Eurostat release came from Portugal, where the pace of output declines slowed from -1.8% in Q4 2012 to -0.3% in Q1 2013. Also, Austria narrowly avoided recession with stable GDP in Q1 after a fall at the end of 2012. In terms of monetary policy, the latest GDP figures are unlikely to shift the stance of the European Central Bank significantly following its cut in the interest rate from 0.75% to 0.5%. A further reduction in interest rates is possible but unlikely at present. The purchase of government bonds in a quantitative easing-type policy will probably be reserved for a crisis situation in which the bond markets turn against a country such as Italy or Spain that is of systemic importance. In sum, the Eurozone continues to struggle as the public and private sectors deleverage and structural reform continues slowly. For next year we expect the Eurozone\u2019s GDP to remain roughly stable and further ahead slow growth still looms while internal devaluation hampers the economy in the periphery. The eurozone has slumped into its longest recession ever, after economic activity across the region fell for the sixth quarter in a row. Economic output across the single currency area fell by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013, statistics body Eurostat reported today (see 10.10am). France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands all saw their economies shrink as the economic crisis in the eurozone continued to hit its largest economies. Eurostat\u2019s figures showed that the eurozone economy has now contracted by 1% over the last year, putting further pressure on leaders as unemployment climbs to new record highs. The 0.2% contraction in the first quarter of 2012 was an improvement on the 0.6% drop recorded between October and December, but analysts warned that the eurozone\u2019s economic outlook is darkening. Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, commented: What seems incontrovertible, on this evidence, is that the member-states of the euro zone are on the wrong track. The costs of the zone\u2019s one-size-fits-all strategy are becoming brutally apparent. France was dragged back into recession by a 0.2% drop in GDP, announced on the first anniversary of Francois Hollande being sworn in as president (see 6.44am) Pierre Moscovici, French finance minister, denied that Paris\u2019s forecast of 0.1% growth this year was too optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m sticking to the figures,\u201d Moscovici told reporters, adding that the EU must prioritise growth over tackling budget deficits. There was also disappointment that Germany only eked out growth of 0.1%, worse than economists had expected. The Dutch economy shrank by 0.1%. Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy was also concerned: The bottom line is that both the German and French economies, which together account for half the eurozone\u2019s output, are in the doldrums. Add in the persistent recession in the Netherlands, which accounts for a further 6.5% of eurozone GDP, and the core and semi-core of the eurozone are in significantly worse shape than a year ago. Italy\u2019s new prime minister, Enrico Letta, was given an early reminder of the challenge he faces, with Italian GDP falling by 0.5%. Italy\u2019s economy has now been shrinking for the last seven quarters, its longest recession since at least 1970. Portugal's recession continues, with a 0.3% drop in GDP - a much smaller decline than the 1.8% slump recorded in the last quarter of 2012. Beyond the eurozone, the Czech Republic suffered a 0.8% decline in GDP during the quarter. Eurostat\u2019s figures also showed that the European Union shrank by 0.1% during the last quarter, despite the UK growing by 0.3%. Figures released last week showed that Spain\u2019s economy contracted by 0.5%. ...... Meanwhile, in the UK, the Bank of England has raised its growth forecasts for Britain's economic growth for the first time since the financial crisis began. Sir Mervyn King, who steps down as governor this summer, said a modest recovery was in sight, but cautioned that the eurozone was a key risk. King told reporters in London that: This hasn\u2019t been a typical recession and it won\u2019t be a typical recovery. Nevertheless, a recovery is in sight. King also attacked plans for a transaction tax in the eurozone, claiming that he wasn't anyone within the European central banking world who supported it. You can track the highlights from the BoE press conference, from 10.36am. Back to the eurozone recession, and this chart from Eurostat shows euro area GDP has been shrinking for the last six quarters: A striking divergence from America over the last two years... Sir Mervyn King has launched a strongly critical attack on Europe's plans for a financial transaction tax... saying that: Within Europe, I can't find anyone in the central bank community who thinks it is a good idea. He also claims that he has privately heard concerns about the levy on euro transactions from people who publicly support it. Eleven eurozone countries are introducing the FTT, but it has been thown into some doubt by the UK government launching a legal challenge. And the press conference then ends, with veteran hack Bill Keegan of the Observer thanking the Bank of England governor for his efforts at Threadneedle Street over the years. King looks terribly touched. More from Larry: King is clearly uncomfortable that bank rate has been 0.5% for past four years. He wants to get them back to more \"normal and healthy\" levels, by which he means around three points above inflation. But he says that pushing rates up now would drive economy back into recession. Markets think it will be 2016 before rates go above 1pc. King said could be sooner if economic outlook improves. And asked about the impact on pensioners, King remarks that \"as a pensioner myself, I understand totally why they are concerned\". King declines to say whether the economy he is handing over to star signing Mark Carney is challenging for the Champions League, a mid table team or battling against relegation. \"I am very optimistic about the future\", he tells our own Larry Elliott, adding that he sees a very successful season ahead. More highlights from Mervyn King's press conference: King says the government has not given up on rebalancing economy. We have to do it, he says. Recent performance of economy made worse by weak North Sea oil production and poor performance of construction sector. On negative interest rates (under discussion at the European Central Bank for commercial bank desposits), King says that the financial system is better prepared to cope with such a move, but adds there are \"good reasons\" not to implement them in the UK. Sir Mervyn King plays down the suggestion that the UK and the IMF are at odds over the issue of George Osborne's fiscal plans: Here's the key quote (via Reuters) One of the issues that always comes up when discussing across the US or the IMF is that their automatic stabilisers are much, much weaker than ours, hence in order to have any flexibility they need to take discretionary fiscal action. That's not true here. Our automatic stabilisers are very large. So these things automatically occur and has had a big effect on the deficit. And the scale of it is much bigger, I think than the quibbling at the margins that seems to come out in the debate to which you refer. Our economics editor Larry Elliott gives some instant reaction to the quarterly inflation report: Inflation is forecast to rise above 3% in June so when figures are released in July one of Mark Carney's first jobs may be to write a letter to George Osborne explaining why it is more than one percentage point above target. Larry adds: King seems quite relieved to be stepping down after the trials and tribulations of the last five years. A moment of rare levity, when a journalist from Slovenia TV takes the microphone in a room dominated by the UK economics press. \"Welcome,\" says Sir Mervyn King, adding: by all means think of joining the sterling area. The invitation is politely declined. But has Sir Mervyn got demob happy? (the context, of course, is that Slovenia is trying to avoid becoming the next member of the eurozone to seek a bailout) Richard Edgar of ITV News reminds the chancellor that inflation is rising four times faster than wages (see 9.40am) Mervyn King denies that there's an easy answer, pointing out that the cost of living is being pushed up by a variety of factors - not all within his controls (oil prices, for example, which push up utility cossts The only way we could bring inflation down would be to drive wages down. There's no easy way through this, and it's silly to pretend there is, King adds. Next question, about Britain's record low borrowing costs (interest rates haev been just 0.5% for over four years). King warns that the return to a more normal world will be difficult, and could involve \"asset price falls\" as real interest rates rise. Did the Bank of England have enough discretion to control inflation during King's time, asks Stephanie Flanders of the BBC. After all, the UK government has announced plans to adjust its remit. King denies that he needed more discretion, but says that what was \"left hanging\" in 1997 (when the Bank was handed control of UK interest rates) was flexibility. What the chancellor is doing will not give us more room for maneuver, but will let us be more transparent over the discretion we are exercising. First question from Sky's Ed Conway: is the Bank of England worried that the government is fuelling an unsustainable housing boom through its new support for homebuyers? Sir Mervyn King replies that a schem that increases the number of transactions is \"helpful\", but cautions that George Osborne's new \"funding for lending\" scheme is only temporary: What is most important is that, when we get back to normality, we do not have a system of taxpayer guarantees for mortgages. That, King adds, would be a very bad thing.... King finishes by telling the media that after 89 quarterly inflation reports, it's time to hand over to \"the next generation\" (Canada's Mark Carney). The Bank of England has also predicted a faster fall in UK inflation, but still expects CIP to be above its 2% target for most of the next two years. Here's the key quote from today's quarterly inflation report: The economy is likely to see a modest and sustained recovery over the next three years... [but will] remain weak by historical standards. And it also predicts growth of 0.5% in the current quarter, up from 0.3% in the first three months. Sir Mervyn King also warned that monetary policy cannot solve all the world's problems, and repeats a familiar theme - that the global economy must be rebalanced. The Bank of England has raised its forecast for UK GDP growth, in its new quarterly inflation report. Sir Mervyn King, speaking now, says that this is the first time he's been able to predict a \"brighter economic outlook\" since the financial crisis began. The BoE governor, who steps down this summer, pointed to the 0.3% rise in GDP in Q1 2013. A recovery is in sight. But King adds, though, that the main downside risk to UK GDP comes from overseas, and singles out the eurozone. More to follow Correction: France is not, it appears, actually in a triple-dip recession. It's certainly back in recession, but its now clear that previous data has been revised, wiping out an earlier contraction in the first half of 2012. As CNBC explains, the flash estimates for the first and second quarter of 2012 were -0.1 percent before being adjusted up to zero percent. This seemed to catch a lot of people out. Apologies More here: Le Big Debate: France Triple-Dip or Not? Greece and Cyprus also kept shrinking in the first quarter of the year: Here's the full details. The eurozone economy shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of this year, as its recession dragged on -- dragged down by contractions in France, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. The wider EU economy shrank by 0.1% during the quarter. This follows a 0.6% drop in eurozone GDP in the last quarter of 2012, and a 0.5% fall acoss the EU. So, the pace of decline is slowing. But the data means the the eurozone economy is 1% smaller than a year ago, while EU GDP is 0.7% smaller. The full details, from Eurostat, are here Breaking News: The eurozone recession has deepened, with a 0.2% drop in GDP in the first three months of this year. Amid the GDP gloom, Greek bonds are rallying in value this morning. This comes after rating agency Fitch raised its credit rating last night to B-, having concluded that the risk of the country exiting the euro has diminished. The yield (measure of borrowing costs) on Greek 10-year bonds has tumbled by a whole percentage point to 8.34%. That's a really big move, as the Financial Times's Chris Adams breathlessly points out: Last summer, Greek 10-year bonds were yielding 30% - so any fund manager who bought then is sitting on quite a profit. But for Greeks, the economic position is still very, very tough. As Yiannis Baboulias wrote in the New Statesman last Friday: The government's decision to increase taxation on heating oil did not only leave many Greeks unable to heat their homes last winter, but also caused general revenue from taxes to drop by \u20ac291m, after consumption fell by 68.7%. Since the beginning of the year, due to this and other tax hikes, tax revenues were lower than the targets set by the government and the Troika in the first three months of 2013. The most terrifying prospect Greece faces in the next few months though, is the devastating unemployment. Overall unemployment in Greece is now 27% while it goes up to 28.7% in certain regions. Here's a great graph, showing how Europe's five largest economies have performed since the financial crisis began. Germany leading the recovery, France stagnating for more than two years, the UK struggling to grow, and deep declines in Spain and Italy.... Britain's unemployment rate has fallen to 7.8% in the three months to March, down from 7.9% a month ago*. The Office for National Statistics also reported a drop in the UK claimant count also dropped, with 7,500 fewer people claiming jobless benefit in April. * - that's 7.9% in the three months to February. Today's data is also a rise compared to the 7.7% in the October-December period. But the data also showed that wages are lagging well behind the rising cost of living in the UK. Average weekly earnings rose by just 0.8% in the first quarter of the year - the lowest on record. UK inflation is currently running at 2.7%. Something for the Bank of England governor, Sir Mervyn King, to discuss at his final press conference at 10.30am.... Joe Bond, vice president of trading at City firm Abshire Smith, said the wage data was awful. The British economy, for once, is outshining its European neighbours. We learned two weeks ago that UK GDP grew by 0.3% in the first quarter of this year, avoiding another recession. That performance looks even more creditable now, given the economic traumas across the Channel. But America did better still, growing around 0.6% on a quarterly basis. With most eurozone countries having now reported their GDP data, it looks very likely that the region is still in recession. Linda Yueh, the BBC's chief business correspondent, points out that Spain's economy is also still shrinking (its GDP data was released last week) Italy is now in its longest recession since at least 1970, after its economy shrank again. Italian GDP fell by 0.5% in the first quarter of this year, meaning its economy contracted by 2.3% over the last 12 months. Italy has now been shrinking for seven quarters in a row -- the longest recession since quarterly records began 43 years ago (according to Reuters). The French recession (see 6.44am) could deepen the split between Paris and Berlin, Paul Donovan of UBS has predicted. He believes Francois Hollande could now renew his push for Europe to ease its fiscal plans: The worst of times seem in evidence in the Euro area, where French GDP fell 0.2% on the quarter (the third time in four years France has had two consecutive quarters negative GDP). The real threat here is this spurs the French government to push for policies that are odds with those of Germany. France has already been promised another two years in which to bring its deficit below the 3% target. The Dutch economy has contracted again, with GDP falling by 0.1% in the first quarter of this year. The Netherlands entered recession three months ago, with unemployment rising and its housing market bubble having burst. Once one of the strongest-loooking members of the eurozone, the Netherlands is now feeling the full force of the region's decline (there's a good piece on Spiegel here). Hungary has bucked the trend this morning, roaring back to growth with a 0.7% rise in GDP in January-March. Ironic, given Budapest has been at war with the European Union over the last year: And as Bloomberg explains, the Hungarian government made a series of spending cuts last year and imposed high banking taxes: Prime minister Viktor Orban sacrificed growth last year to reduce the budget gap and remove the threat of cuts in European Union funding less than a year before parliamentary elections. The government boosted revenue from Europe\u2019s highest bank levy and taxes on energy, retail and telecommunication industries, which damaged lending and investments. Gloomy data from the Czech Republic this morning -- GDP shrank by 0.8% in Q1 2013. That follows a 0.2% contraction in Q4 2012. The Czech Republic has now been in recession for more than a year... Austria's economy flatlined in the first three months of 2013. Data just released showed that its GDP was unchanged at 0.0%. That follows a 0.2% decline in the last quarter of 2012. European stock markets have fallen in early trading. The French CAC shed 0.4%, the Italian FTSE MIB lost 0.45% and the Spanish IBEX fell 0.3%.In London the FTSE 100 is down just 4 points. France's economy is now 0.4% smaller than a year ago. Here's how its economic outlook fared over the last four quarters. Q1 2013: -0.2% quarter-on-quarter Q4 2012: -0.2% q/q Q3: 2012: +0.1% q/q Q2: 2012: -0.1% q/q We find out at 10am BST if the eurozone is still in recession, when overall GDP for the region is published. Economists had expected a small contraction, of 0.1%. Today's weak data from France (6.44am) and Germany (7.06am) suggests the true figures might be worse... If so, expect fresh calls for Eurozone leaders to adopt new growth measures, as a matter of urgency, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets commented: Today\u2019s latest Q1 GDP numbers are expected to show that the European economy is far from on the right track as EU leaders continue to argue about the merits or otherwise of banking union while economic growth continues to remain elusive and unemployment continues to explode higher, especially for those under 25. This is the third time France has fallen into recession since the financial crisis began, my colleague Angelique Chrisafis flags up. It's an ignominious way for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to mark his first anniversary of being sworn in power, as the BBC's Gavin Hewitt flags up: Disappointing GDP data from Germany, which posted growth of just 0.1% in the first quarter of 2013. That's rather weaker than the 0.3% growth expected. The German contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012 has also been revised downwards to -0.7% (from -0.6%). So the eurozone's largest economy has only just struggled back from its winter torpour. This graph shows how the French economy has struggled since the start of 2011. That's from INSEE, the French statistics agency, which announced this morning that France was in recession. INSEE reported that manufacturing output was at a \"standstill\", while household expenditure was \"sluggish\" Here's the full statement. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other events in the world economy. France has fallen into recession, as Europe's second largest economy is dragged deeper into the eurozone slump. Data just released showed that its economy shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013, following a 0.2% contraction at the end of last year. Economists had expected a 0.1% drop. The figures pile more pressure on Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who already faces falling public support, record unemployment and pressure from Brussels to reform the French economy. We'll find out this morning if the eurozone itself is still in recession, with GDP data from several other countries due this morning - including Germany in a few minutes. it's going to be a busy day... with UK unemployment at 9.30am and the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report -- Sir Mervyn King's last one -- at 10.30am. I'll be tracking all the news and reaction through the day...",

We expect that this situation will persists for a while and given the weight of France in Europe the rest of the currency union will be affected. The other major Eurozone economy, Germany, is estimated to have grown in Q1 2013, but at only 0.1% quarter on quarter. It, too, borders on the brink of a downturn. Finland, another nation considered part of the economically solid Eurozone core, also entered recession with a second consecutive quarter of negative growth.</p> <p>A rare piece of good news in the latest Eurostat release came from Portugal, where the pace of output declines slowed from -1.8% in Q4 2012 to -0.3% in Q1 2013. Also, Austria narrowly avoided recession with stable GDP in Q1 after a fall at the end of 2012.</p> <p>In terms of monetary policy, the latest GDP figures are unlikely to shift the stance of the European Central Bank significantly following its cut in the interest rate from 0.75% to 0.5%. A further reduction in interest rates is possible but unlikely at present. The purchase of government bonds in a quantitative easing-type policy will probably be reserved for a crisis situation in which the bond markets turn against a country such as Italy or Spain that is of systemic importance.</p> <p>In sum, the Eurozone continues to struggle as the public and private sectors deleverage and structural reform continues slowly. For next year we expect the Eurozone\u2019s GDP to remain roughly stable and further ahead slow growth still looms while internal devaluation hampers the economy in the periphery.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51937c53e4b0540c70ebe7c1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-15T12:19:58.929Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The eurozone has slumped into its longest recession ever, after economic activity across the region fell for the sixth quarter in a row.</strong></p> <p>Economic output across the single currency area fell by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013, statistics body Eurostat reported today (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/15/eurozone-crisis-france-germany-recession-gdp#block-5193511be4b0113935230d30\">see 10.10am</a>).</p> <p>France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands all saw their economies shrink as the economic crisis in the eurozone continued to hit its largest economies.</p> <p>Eurostat\u2019s figures showed that the eurozone economy has now contracted by 1% over the last year, putting further pressure on leaders as unemployment climbs to new record highs.</p> <p>The 0.2% contraction in the first quarter of 2012 was an improvement on the 0.6% drop recorded between October and December, but analysts warned that the eurozone\u2019s economic outlook is darkening.</p> <p>Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Securities, commented:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What seems incontrovertible, on this evidence, is that the member-states of the euro zone are on the wrong track.</p> <p>The costs of the zone\u2019s one-size-fits-all strategy are becoming brutally apparent.</p> </blockquote> <p>France was dragged back into recession by a 0.2% drop in GDP, announced on the first anniversary of Francois Hollande being sworn in as president (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/15/eurozone-crisis-france-germany-recession-gdp#block-51931ff5e4b0113935230d17\">see 6.44am</a>)</p> <p><strong>Pierre Moscovici,</strong> French finance minister, denied that Paris\u2019s forecast of 0.1% growth this year was too optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m sticking to the figures,\u201d Moscovici told reporters, adding that the EU must prioritise growth over tackling budget deficits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-52ef620c-ee8f-437a-8f4a-f0a2a951663e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/15/1368620278231/27f1838c-8a73-42b5-a857-0e863e7f1706-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Eurozone GDP\" width=\"363\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters (via the Financial Times)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also disappointment that Germany only eked out growth of 0.1%, worse than economists had expected.

Fourteen people died, most of them first responders, and 200 more were injured. The Insurance Council of Texas <a href=\"http://www.kvue.com/news/Group-Texas-plant-blast-loss-likely-exceeds-100M--204601481.html\">estimates that damage</a> to surrounding homes and businesses totals $100m. Of the 157 homes in the area closest to the plant, building inspectors <a href=\"http://www.wacotrib.com/news/business/homes-deemed-unsafe-uninhabitable-in-area-closest-to-west-blast/article_72d4bcce-e8df-55fd-8d71-0e70869f2699.html\">determined that only three </a>were safe for habitation.</p> <p>Investigators will announce tomorrow what caused the fire and explosion. What has already been uncovered, though, indicates that this tragedy likely could have been prevented. And that there are plenty of places throughout Texas and the US where such a disaster could happen again. So why doesn't the national media seem to care? </p> <p>For one, the failures in regulation and oversight are complex and can make for a dry story. That doesn't mean that story should go untold.</p> <p>On 7 May, the Texas State Fire Marshal's office <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/07/us-usa-explosion-texas-idUSBRE9460GP20130507?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;utm_source=feedly\">announced that they had determined</a> that ammonium nitrate stored at the plant had exploded that night, leaving a 93-foot crater in the ground. Ammonium nitrate has a high level of nitrogen, which makes it excellent for plant growth and, when heat is applied to it and <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2013/04/18/ammonium-nitrate-fertilizer-is.html\">there is enough of it</a>, a combustible explosive. It was the cause of one of the largest industrial disasters in US history when it exploded in <a href=\"http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lyt01\">Texas City</a> in 1947, leaving nearly 600 people dead. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh used an ammonium nitrate bomb to blow up the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City killing 168 people. </p> <p>Following the Oklahoma City bombing, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) created a <a href=\"http://www.atf.gov/explosives/programs/ammonium-nitrate-security/index.html\">voluntary program</a> with The Fertilizer Institute to encourage people in agriculture to report any suspicious behavior or thefts around sites that housed the compound (no one has reported that ATF was ever contacted about West <a href=\"http://www.kvue.com/news/Texas-fertilizer-plant-targeted-by-thieves-in-past-206018191.html?utm_source=feedly\">even though</a> \"sheriff's deputies were called more than 10 times to West Fertilizer in the 11 years before the blast\" with \"multiple calls involv[ing] suspicion that anhydrous ammonia was being stolen\"). More recently, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/ammonium-nitrate-security-program\">proposed </a>the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program in order to keep better track of large supplies of ammonium nitrate so that it did not end up being used in an act of terrorism. </p> <p>Adair Grain told the Texas Department of Health Services in late February that its plant in West had the capacity to store 270 tons of ammonium nitrate, which is, <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/20/17838304-red-flag-texas-plant-had-1350-times-amount-of-chemical-that-would-trigger-oversight\">according to Reuters</a>, \"1,350 times the amount \u2026 that would normally trigger safety oversight by\" the DHS. The plant had no sprinklers, no fire walls, and no deluge systems, <a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/business/business_markets/2013/04/safety_rules_limited_for_small_fertilizer_plants\">according to the Associated Press</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.kvue.com/news/national/206107811.html?utm_source=feedly\">insurance policy</a> on the plant was only for $1m. Texas <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/west-explosion/headlines/20130508-texas-makes-bounce-house-operators-carry-liability-coverage-but-not-plants-like-west-fertilizer.ece?utm_source=feedly\">does not have liability insurance mandates for plants</a> like the one in West in case people are injured or killed. It does, however, require those liability mandates for all kinds of businesses like those that rent out inflatable bounce houses for kids' birthday parties and air-conditioner repair outfits. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20130417-west-fertilizer-plant-said-in-report-that-it-presented-no-risk.ece\">Adair Grain's 2011 report</a> to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it stated \"no\" under fire or explosive risks. The worst possible scenario, the report said, \"would be a 10-minute release of ammonia gas that would kill or injure no one\". This report was filed after Adair Grain <a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/news/texas-news/Documents-show-West--203543061.html\">had received a $2,300 fine</a> in 2006 from the EPA for \"failing to have a risk management plan that met federal standards\". The EPA has said that it does not expect plants to disclose levels of ammonium nitrate because the compound does not affect the Clean Air Act, which is its concern. </p> <p>The Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA) had not been to the site since 1985, when it fined the plant $30 for \"a serious violation for storage of anhydrous ammonia,\" a gas that also has the potential to explode and which was on stored at the plant. OSHA not inspecting the site more regularly is no surprise. According to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/04/19/1893601/update-last-inspection-of-west-texas-fertilizer-plant-was-in-1985/\">Bryce Covert at Think Progress</a>, \"a workplace only gets a visit from OSHA inspectors every 99 years on average, with some state programs even worse\". Due to Texas' more lax oversight, a plant there \"can only expect an inspection every 126 years\". </p> <p>Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) inspected the site only two years ago and <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/04/22/1904381/how-the-west-texas-fertilizer-plant-slipped-through-the-regulatory-cracks/\">fined Adair Grain over $10,000</a> for \"for missing placards, transporting anhydrous ammonia in non-specification tanks, and not having a security plan in violation of Hazardous Materials Regulations.\" The company was also fined in 2011 by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for not having the correct licensing. Donald Adair, the current owner of the plant, has owned it since 2004.</p> <p>Another reason the national media may not be paying much attention to West is that a lot of it is a Texas story. Conservative politicians have responded as many expected \u2013 that there is no reason to increase regulation or oversight \u2013 thus feeding an idea that this tragedy could only happen there (or in states with similar permissive laws).</p> <p>There are no state laws in Texas that regulate how close buildings, including residences and schools, can be constructed around a potentially dangerous site like the one in West. Local governments make those decisions.</p> <p>The director of the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), Steve McCraw, testified before the Texas House Committee on Homeland Security and Public Safety on 1 May and told them that it is not his agency's job to alert residents of those possible dangers. That is up to local officials. When pushed on existing oversight, <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2013/05/01/explosion-west-gets-house-committee-hearing/?utm_source=feedly\">McCraw told the committee</a>, \"too many threats and too little time\". Within the state of Texas, 112 facilites house ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrate-based chemicals, 44 have significant amounts of the former (at least 10,000 pounds), and 2 sites have as much ammonium nitrate on site as the plant in West did (over 500,000 pounds). On top of it all, a significant amount of plants at risk for explosion have never been inspected by state or federal agencies for emergency preparedness. </p> <h2>What to do with all of this failure? </h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/west-explosion/headlines/20130504-from-washington-to-west-system-failed-to-protect-texas-town-from-tragedy.ece?utm_source=feedly\">Governor Rick Perry says nothing</a>, that no more regulation would have stopped this tragedy. Republican Texas State Senator Donna Campbell echoed these thoughts in <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/2013/05/10/after-west-other-chemical-stockpiles-come-under-sc/?utm_source=feedly\">an interview with the Texas Tribune</a>. She said that there is \"a point at which you can overregulate\" companies. \"I think we're doing a good job,\" she said. \"Just periodically something happens that's not predictable.\" </p> <p>Some experts disagree. Richard John Smythe, a PhD chemist with 40 years of experience investigating fires and explosions in Canada and the US, told the Dallas Morning News, </p> <blockquote> <p> \"You would think Texas would have learned its lesson from Galveston,\" referring to the 1947 Texas City disaster. \"This is not rocket science. We've had this happen so many times.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Beyond Texas, there is also an important national story here. Bryce Covert at Think Progress <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/04/23/1910071/fertilizer-industry-groups-have-been-lobbying-against-safety-regulations/\">reported soon after the explosion</a> that the Fertilizer Industry has pushed at the federal level for more lax regulations on safety, specifically trying to weaken the EPA's ability to regulate sites that blend fertilizers, sites like the one in West. Additionally, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/04/30/1940111/chemical-facilities-risk-greater-west-texas/\">Covert reports that across the US</a> there are </p> <blockquote> <p> \"nearly 7,000 facilities \u2013 6,985 to be exact \u2013 report that they pose a risk to populations greater than 1,000, with 90 that could impact more than 1 million people in a worst-case scenario. 4,425 would likely impact a population similar to the town of West, or between 1,000 and 9,999 people.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>It may seem like this could only happen in Texas but that simply isn't true. And yet, West has made very small waves in the national media. One potential outcome of the media's failure to draw attention to the complicated systemic problems that the West explosion unveiled is that it has a left a gaping hole in our collective understanding of what happened there.

The deputy prime minister highlighted the fact that action was being taken by this particular regulator given the debate inside the coalition over Europe, but the government was also forced to explain why a British regulator had given the petrol market a clean bill of health barely four months ago. \"I'm pleased that the European commission is taking this as seriously as they are,\" said Clegg standing in for David Cameron at prime minister's question time in the House of Commons. \"I think it is very important on all of our behalves, and certainly on the behalves of all of our constituents for whom petrol and diesel and fuel prices are an incredibly important part of the weekly and monthly household budget, that those companies now engage seriously in looking at the allegations put to them by the European commission.\" BP, Shell and the oil price reporting agency, Platts, all had their London offices raided on Wednesday by competition competition investigators who are concerned about collusion and manipulation of oil and biofuel product markets. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said later that officials from the UK financial regulator, the FCA, were helping the Brussels authorities but he stressed that the investigation was not \"directly linked\" to the allegations of gas market manipulation first raised last November by the Guardian and which Ofgem and the Financial Conduct Authority are continuing to review. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) four months ago ruled out a full investigation into allegations of petrol price fixing after finding that competition in the sector was \"working well\" and there was \"very limited evidence\" that pump prices rise quickly when the wholesale price goes up but fall more slowly when it drops. Davey said he had welcomed the OFT inquiry and understood that it had not not received any evidence that markets were being rigged but had urged anyone who did have information to come forward. But Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, urged a new UK inquiry saying manipulation could have a \"huge impact\" on the market and said he himself had evidence of problems. \"Last year we urged the Office of Fair Trading to launch a full inquiry into alleged price fixing by oil companies,\" he told the BBC. \"I had a whistleblower approach me with a dossier which we put up on our website called petrolpromise.com and sadly nothing was done. \"The Office of Fair Trading did a limp-wristed lettuce leaf-type inquiry and they should have had a full inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Some 14,000 more jobs are at risk at HSBC as its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, wields an axe to reduce costs, boost profitability and pay bigger dividends to shareholders. By 2016 he expects HSBC to employ around 240,000 staff, compared with the 300,000 who worked for the bank when he was promoted to chief executive at the start of 2011. Still implementing reforms prompted by a record-breaking \u00a31.2bn fine from the US authorities for helping Mexican drug barons launder money, Gulliver said the changes he had made to the UK's biggest bank since being promoted from running its investment banking arm was making the organisation easier to manage. \"HSBC is now simpler and easier to manage,\" he said, adding the bank would \"de-risk our operations in higher risk locations\". \"We will continue to exert tight cost discipline whilst streamlining processes and procedures. This enables us to invest in growth and global standards,\" Gulliver said in this third annual strategy day. Adopting a motto for staff of \"courageous integrity\", Gulliver had cut the workforce to 260,000 by the first quarter of this year, and since then a further 6,000 roles have gone \u2013 split between Panama and the UK, where 3,166 job cuts announced last month were described by the bank as \"demising\" roles. When he first set out his proposals to cut costs by axing jobs in 2011, he said 30,000 jobs would go by the end of this year but he is ahead of target, with 26,000 having been cut through cost reduction measures and 14,000 through businesses being sold off. He is not, however, on track to meet his target to increase the return on equity \u2013 a key measure of performance for shareholders \u2013 from 8.4% to between 12% to 15%. By noon on Wednesday the shares were up 1% at 754p. The job cuts are part of a plan to seek additional cost savings of $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) between 2014 and 2016 but even so Gulliver loosened a key efficiency measure \u2013 the cost-income ratio \u2013 from the 48% to 52% range he had set previously to \"mid 50s\". Unlike many European-based banks which are under pressure to find ways to build up more capital, HSBC is now preparing the way to pay out larger dividends to shareholders and might begin share buybacks. HSBC is already the second largest dividend payer in the FTSE 100 \u2013 paying out \u00a34.4bn last year \u2013 second only to oil company Shell. But the bank would need approval from the Prudential Regulation Authority to pay more dividends and conduct share buybacks, probably after asking shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting next May. Gulliver is focusing the bank on faster-growing markets with a focus on commercial banking rather than high street banking. The proportion of earnings retained for capital is being reduced to 45% from 50% allowing 40%, rather than 35%, to be paid out to shareholders and 15% being used to pay bonuses to the remaining staff. Share buybacks could start in the middle of next year as the bank attempts to control the number of shares in issue because 30% of its shareholders, particularly in Hong Kong, receive their dividends in shares (known as a scrip dividend) rather than cash.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England signalled modestly higher growth this year and a faster fall in inflation, as the governor Sir Mervyn King took a swipe at proposals for a Europe-wide financial transaction tax. Speaking at his last quarterly inflation report press conference, King said discussions among Europe's central bank chiefs revealed a huge amount of opposition to a transaction tax despite public backing from politicians. A long-time critic of the so-called Tobin tax, he said a charge on individual financial transactions, which several EU countries have supported in principle, was still year's away. \"Even politicians who are publicly in favour have misgivings,\" he said. His intervention is bound to upset anti-poverty campaigners who have succeeded in persuading 11 eurozone countries to introduce the tax on stock, bond and derivatives transactions next January, raising up to \u20ac35bn (\u00a329bn) a year. King said the tax remained several years from implementation as there remained little agreement on which transactions to tax. The governor said the outlook for the UK economy had improved with growth likely to reach 0.5% in the second quarter of 2013, in addition to the 0.3% registered in the first three months of the year, giving an overall 1% rise of this year. The central bank gave no sign it was on the verge adding further stimulus, describing policy as \"highly stimulatory\". \"The economy is likely to see a modest and sustained recovery over the next three years,\" the central bank said, though it added that the recovery would \"remain weak by historical standards\". This represents the cheeriest outlook for a couple of years during which it has steadily downgraded its growth forecasts. It said the recovery was likely to be \"slow but sustained\". Britain has been suffering its slowest economic recovery in decades, and the Bank forecast that GDP was more likely than not to remain below its pre-crisis level for another year or so. \"The main risks to the recovery continue to emanate from abroad,\" the BoE said. Figures earlier on Wednesday showed that France's economy shrank in the first three months of 2013, and weak demand in the eurozone as a whole has been a major headwind for Britain's exporters in recent years. The central bank forecast that inflation in two years' time was likely to be around its 2% target \u2013 down from the 2.3% it forecast in February \u2013 and that inflation would average below 2% for the rest of the forecast period. Inflation has exceeded the central bank's 2% target since December 2009, which is one reason why the BoE has not increased bond purchases under the quantitative easing programme (QE) past the \u00a3375bn reached in October. The Bank generally sets monetary policy with the aim of ensuring that inflation has returned to its 2% target within two to three years, and the chancellor, George Osborne, has recently encouraged the bank to take a flexible approach. Incoming bank governor Mark Carney \u2013 who takes over from King in July \u2013 is also a fan of long-term interest rate guidance to stimulate the economy. Howard Archer, chief economist at analysts IHS Global Insight, said it was likely the Bank will expand QE in the coming months. \"It is notable that in his opening remarks, King said 'this is no time to be complacent \u2013 we must press on to ensure a recovery and bring down unemployment'. \"We suspect that Carney will be keen to try and build up escape velocity from the economy's extended softness and will be keen to quickly establish his presence after arriving at the start of July. \"Of course, Carney will only have one vote out of nine in the MPC as does King, but we suspect that he will be able to carry a majority of MPC members with him should he favour more help for the economy.\"",

Rowland, who began running the business in 1963, was adored by a legion of small shareholders, and fought a longstanding and ultimately unsuccessful battle with Mohammed Al Fayed for control of department store Harrods. In Rowland's hands Lonrho moved from mining to hotels to textiles to newspapers (including the Observer), but some of the company's activities during Rowland's tenure were described as \"the unacceptable face of capitalism\" by then-prime minister Edward Heath. Shortly before Rowland's death in 1998 - five years after he was ousted from the company - its mining assets were spun off as Lonmin, and the remainder became a mini-conglomerate focusing on Africa, keeping the Lonrho name.

      "body": "<p>The water company Severn Trent has rejected a preliminary approach that valued it at about \u00a35bn, saying it was undervalued.</p> <p>The earlier news of the potential bid drove shares in the FTSE 100 company \u2013 which supplies water and sewerage services to 4.2m businesses and households in the Midlands and mid-Wales \u2013 almost 14% higher to close at \u00a320.77. The potential takeover comes from a consortium of the state of Kuwait's investment arm, a Canadian infrastructure investor and one of the UK's largest pension funds.</p> <p>The company, formed in 1989 as part of the process to privatise the UK water authorities, met with the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), Borealis Infrastructure Management and the Universities Superannuation Scheme.</p> <p>\"At that meeting, a conditional proposal was tabled by the consortium at only a modest premium to the share price before the announcement of May 14. The board of Severn Trent has reviewed the proposal with its advisers and concluded that it completely fails to recognise the existing and potential value of Severn Trent,\" the company said.</p> <p>The consortium faces a final deadline of 11 June to make a firm offer.</p> <p>The KIO is the London branch of the Kuwait Investment Authority, which manages the state's vast oil revenues.</p> <p>Canada's Borealis has other investments in the UK, including High Speed 1, Associated British Ports, and Scotia Gas Networks.</p> <p>Analysts said water companies made attractive takeover targets because of their large customer bases, guaranteed income streams and cash generation.</p> <p>Howard Wheeldon, an independent analyst, said water companies were considered \"mini safe havens\".

      "bodyText": "The water company Severn Trent has rejected a preliminary approach that valued it at about \u00a35bn, saying it was undervalued. The earlier news of the potential bid drove shares in the FTSE 100 company \u2013 which supplies water and sewerage services to 4.2m businesses and households in the Midlands and mid-Wales \u2013 almost 14% higher to close at \u00a320.77. The potential takeover comes from a consortium of the state of Kuwait's investment arm, a Canadian infrastructure investor and one of the UK's largest pension funds. The company, formed in 1989 as part of the process to privatise the UK water authorities, met with the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), Borealis Infrastructure Management and the Universities Superannuation Scheme. \"At that meeting, a conditional proposal was tabled by the consortium at only a modest premium to the share price before the announcement of May 14. The board of Severn Trent has reviewed the proposal with its advisers and concluded that it completely fails to recognise the existing and potential value of Severn Trent,\" the company said. The consortium faces a final deadline of 11 June to make a firm offer. The KIO is the London branch of the Kuwait Investment Authority, which manages the state's vast oil revenues. Canada's Borealis has other investments in the UK, including High Speed 1, Associated British Ports, and Scotia Gas Networks. Analysts said water companies made attractive takeover targets because of their large customer bases, guaranteed income streams and cash generation. Howard Wheeldon, an independent analyst, said water companies were considered \"mini safe havens\". Ronnie Chopra, head of strategy at Tradenext, said the bid for Severn Trent \"highlights the value among other utilities, especially United Utilities, which has been touted as a bid target for many years\". \"United has constantly generated very strong cash flow and is backed by one of the highest dividend yields in the FTSE 100.\" United Utilities shares rose 2.8% to 760.5p yesterday. Tina Cook, analyst at Charles Stanley, said despite the appeal of UK listed water companies to overseas investors and infrastructure funds, the timing of the approach for Severn Trent was \"surprising\". \"The timing of the potential deal is somewhat surprising in that it comes just ahead of the UK water sector's next regulatory price review 2015-20, which is currently underway and due to be finalised next year. This inevitably creates some mid-term risk across the sector,\" she said. Last month Severn Trent announced that its chief executive, Tony Wray, had told the board of his intention to step down in Spring 2014 after seven years in the role and nine at the company. The company said it was announcing his retirement to allow the necessary time to a search for his successor, as well as an \"orderly handover\". If a deal does materialise, it would make Severn Trent the latest UK water company to be bought by foreign investors. Thames Water was acquired in 2006 by a consortium led by Australian investment group Macquarie for \u00a38bn. A year later the owner of Yorkshire Water, Kelda Group, was sold to a group of buyers including Citigroup, HSBC, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Infracapital Partners. Severn Trent was formed in 1974 as a regional, publicly owned water authority based in Birmingham and providing services around two of Britain's largest rivers - the Severn and the Trent. Severn Trent Water operates from the Bristol Channel to the Humber and from mid-Wales to the East Midlands, while Severn Trent Services \u2013 a supplier of water and waste water treatment solutions - operates in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Asia Pacific. Wealth of resources The Kuwait Investment Office, the London branch of Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund, has investments worth more than \u00a315bn in 100 UK listed companies and holds a stake in Gatwick airport via private equity funds. Through its property company St Martins, the Kuwaiti state invests its oil wealth in upmarket offices in the City of London and Canary Wharf. Borealis Infrastructure has interests in Associated British Ports, the UK's largest ports company with 21 ports, as well as HS1, the UK's only high-speed railway line, linking London to Brussels and Paris. The Canadian group also holds a 25% stake in Scotia Gas, which provides fuel to 5.7 million people in Scotland and the south of England. The Universities Superannuation Scheme has invested UK higher education workers' pensions in bonds in the UK's Affinity Water and South East Water, and infrastructure projects in continental Europe and Australia.",
