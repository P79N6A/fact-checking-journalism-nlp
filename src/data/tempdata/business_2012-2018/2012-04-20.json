      "bodyText": "Britain has pledged a $15bn (\u00a39.3bn) loan to the International Monetary Fund to help the organisation boost its war chest to $400bn to cope with a fresh outbreak of financial turmoil. Christine Lagarde, the fund's managing director, was poised on Friday night to announce that she had cobbled together enough contributions to build a bigger firewall after Australia, Singapore, South Korea and some leading developing countries agreed to take part. Announcing Britain's contribution, George Osborne said the UK had always been a supporter of the IMF and was willing to be part of a \"global effort\" to provide an increase in resources. The chancellor said the loan, which at just under \u00a310bn will not require a vote in parliament, was in line with sums being pledged by countries that were not part of the eurozone. The deal was struck after a brief rally in European stock markets following the IMF's commitment to step in with bailout funds and a better than expected business survey in Germany. The Ifo survey of German business sentiment edged up for the fifth straight month despite the continuing crisis, which has recently centred on the ability of Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece to survive their second deep recessions in three years. Spanish bond yields jumped above the crucial 6% level for the second time this week as prime minister Mariano Rajoy's rightwing government debated a further \u20ac10bn (about \u00a38bn) package of spending cuts and increased charges in education and health. \"It's necessary, imperative because at this moment there is no money to pay for public services,\" Rajoy said. The situation worsened in Greece after two of its top banks reported historic losses for 2011 after huge writedowns on loans to the Athens government. A sovereign debt swap, orchestrated by Brussels and a group of international banks, blew holes in their balance sheets. Alpha Bank and Eurobank together posted losses of \u20ac9.3bn, about 10 times more than they are currently worth in the market. The losses left Alpha's core capital reserves at 3%. At least \u20ac50bn of Greece's second bailout is earmarked to rescue its banking sector, with some of the money coming from the IMF. It is not known if widespread bank losses will force a fresh round of fundraising. Although Lagarde has said the $400bn in new loans is for use in any of the fund's 188 members, the increase in firepower is seen by the US, Canada and emerging market economies as a fighting fund for the eurozone. Labour and some Conservative MPs oppose the loan, but Osborne said it would be a sign of a \"dysfunctional world\" if member countries did not provide the fund with the resources it needed. \"This is a loan not a gift,\" he said. No country had ever lost money by lending to the IMF. Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said the IMF was the \"only fire brigade available to the global economy\". Britain's contribution was vital. Labour's Treasury spokesman, Ed Balls, said the chancellor needed to impose tougher conditions before providing more funds. \"The IMF has a vital role to play in the global economy and should have the resources to do that job, but it should not be bailing out the eurozone when the euro area countries are not doing their own bit to help themselves,\" he said. The chancellor said the four conditions he had set for a UK contribution had been met \u2013 that any loans disbursed by the IMF would be subject to the normal tough conditions, that the money would be spent helping countries rather than currencies, that other members chipped in and that the euro zone reinforced its own firewall. Osborne said the loan would come from the UK's reserves, was not money that would otherwise have been available for public spending and would not add to the national debt. Lagarde's appeal for resources exposed divisions within the IMF's membership. South Korea said it would match Britain's contribution, Australia pledged $7bn and Singapore $4bn. The US and Canada have refused to take part, while Brazil linked its support to changes in the IMF's governance to provide a greater say for the fast-growing emerging economies. Canada said that European members of the IMF's board should decide how to use the $200bn in the war chest provided by the eurozone, but that non-European members should set the conditions if the amount pledged by non-euro countries was also needed.",

      "body": "<p>In a bad week for several leading high street names, <strong>Dixons Retail</strong> was a bright spot.</p> <p>The company hosted a drinks reception for analysts on Wednesday with new chief executive Sebastian James, where it was reportedly upbeat about trading. It has recently benefited from good sales of the new Apple iPad, as well as customers buying new televisions ahead of the digital switchover. With the final stage of the changeover in the capital last week, it reported a 349% year on year rise in demand for digital products in its London stores during the last seven days.</p> <p>Analyst Eithne O'Leary at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> The visit to the Fulham store on Wednesday evening revealed that Dixons Retail is enjoying current market conditions.

Under private ownership Comet appears to be struggling to secure supply and as a result it is presenting little challenge to Dixons in the UK at the moment.   The short term uplift in demand for TVs is helpful but difficulties elsewhere in the group remain. We have little doubt that sales in Italy continue to be very difficult and we expect trading losses there to grow. A similarly grim picture can be painted for Greece. However, the strength of Elkjop's market position across Scandinavia means that profits there will remain strong.  Following a better than expected Christmas, better momentum in the UK will ensure that Dixons can make its bond repayment of \u00a3160m in November 2012. We expect the shares to continue to make progress. </blockquote> <p>Dixons shares ended 0.11p lower yesterday at 17.84p, but they were up 2.5% on the week.</p> <p>Other retailers did not fare as well. <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> disappointed the market with a 0.7% fall in fourth quarter sales, after buying mistakes left it with shortages of coats, knitwear, blouses and even ballet pumps.</p> <p>Investec yesterday cut its recommendation from hold to sell and its price target from 325p to 295p. In a note entitled <em>Off the Mark &amp; lacking Spark</em> analyst Bethany Hocking said:</p> <blockquote> We are bearish for three reasons. Firstly, we do not expect a recovery in the UK consumer in the near term. Secondly, we viewed 2013 cost guidance as disappointing. We note the recent history of under-promising and over-delivering on this front, however, and so our 2.7% assumption is below the guidance range of 3%-5%. Finally, the jury is still out on the success, or otherwise, of the strategic plan. </blockquote> <p>Marks ended 7p higher yesterday at 362.6p, down 7p on the week. <strong>Tesco</strong> added 1.8p at 321.85p but disappointed investors on Wednesday after it reported a 1% fall in UK profits to \u00a32.5bn. More bad news for the supermarket came as Moody's downgraded its credit rating from A3 to BAA1, albeit with a stable outlook</p> <p>One of the biggest casualties of the week was <strong>SuperGroup</strong>. The fashion retailer's shares slumped 217.7p yesterday to 351.8p after yet another profit warning, partly blamed on \"arithmetic errors.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile retail sales for March rose 1.8% from the previous month, better than expected but helped by panic buying of petrol.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 27.60 points higher yesterday at 5772.15. It recorded its biggest weekly rise - up 2.1% - since the first week of February. The increase, after four weekly declines in a row, came despite the eurozone crisis dragging on, with Spain and Italy both coming into spotlight again on worries about their financial position. But with the IMF successfully boosting its level of funding as officials and politicians met in Washington, investors preferred to concentrate on the positive. But Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> There's no reason to be complacent as we've seen in the past these rallies don't always last that long and we could quickly see the gains snuffled out in an instant especially if the situation in the eurozone starts to get out of hand again. </blockquote> <p>Banks were in demand yesterday, with <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> 0.81p better at 30.1p after a buy note from Investec. Analyst Ian Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> It's hardly a ringing endorsement, but we are starting to take comfort from the fact that not only is Lloyds increasingly adopting a \"warts and all\" approach to disclosure, much of the sellside froth has come out of near-term consensus expectations too. Revenue decline continues apace, reflective of balance sheet shrinkage and net interest margin decline (for which 2012 may conceivably represent the bottom). Return on equity recovery will be painfully slow, but (whisper it quietly) the worst looks to be behind us now. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Man</strong> recovered some of its recent weakness which was caused by worries about its growth prospects following a fall in the weekly asset value of its key AHL fund. Its shares added 2.3p to 95.7p after analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch repeated their buy recommendation, albeit with a reduced target price. Merrill's Philip Middleton said:</p> <blockquote> Historically, AHL was very good at delivering performance fees above our trend assumptions, albeit with some volatility. The last couple of years have been an anomaly here. Assuming AHL reverts to trend, at some point, Man is extremely undervalued. <br> We reiterate our buy on Man, with a price objective of 230p, down from 255p, reflecting the diminution of long run earnings power from the recent product performance. </blockquote> <p>Credit Suisse was also positive on the hedge fund manager:</p> <blockquote> We believe over the medium term AHL performance will recover and the suite of products offered by Man Group is attractive particularly as demands for funds in liquid formats increases. Consequently we view the share price capitulation as a longer term buying opportunity. Our target price is reduced to 130p from 175p reflecting lower earnings but still offers around 40% potential upside, hence we retain our outperform rating. </blockquote> <p><strong>Prudential </strong>put on 7p to 762.5p on talk it could be looking at a bid for the insurance business of Thailand's Thanachart Bank, in what would be a $500m deal. Earlier in the week analysts at Pru's joint broker UBS suggested the insurer could benefit by spinning off its Asian operations into a separate company.</p> <p>Engineer <strong>IMI</strong> added 18p to 992p following a positive trading update.</p> <p>But <strong>Arm</strong> lost 22.5p to 585p after recent weakness at the chipmaker's customer Apple, and concerns about supply issues after a warning from US group Qualcomm. Ahead of its second quarter results next week, analysts at Liberum issued a sell note:</p> <blockquote> We expect Arm to report a quarter on quarter decline in its first quarter results, in line with market expectations. The recent strength in licensing is expected to moderate to a more sustainable level. We expect Arm to continue to de-rate on the back of increasing competition from Intel on smartphones and uncertainty on the ramp of Windows on Arm. Sequentially weak first quarter results are unlikely to trigger outperformance. </blockquote> <p>Satellite company <strong>Inmarsat</strong> soared to the top of the mid-cap index, rising 18.7p to 440.4p after receiving a delayed payment from US partner LightSquared.</p> <p>The US business has run into trouble when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/mar/06/inmarsat-us-worries-ftse-down?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">its plans to build a new network were thrown into disarray on worries about signal interference</a>.

In return phase two has been suspended until March 2014, and LightSquared will not be required to make a payment of $29.6m which is also overdue. The moves will allow the US company extra time to secure the necessary regulatory consents to develop its proposed network.</p> <p>The bid battle for <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, </strong>down 2p to 32p<strong>,</strong> continued to develop. India's Tata Communications pulled out of the running ahead of Thursday's deadline, which was subsequently extended until Monday to give Vodafone more time to decide its next move. Analysts said this meant Vodafone was likely to make an offer, but it could well be a lowball one. Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> We believe Vodafone could easily argue a deal is accretive to its own shareholders up to about 50p per share but, in the absence of a bidding war with Tata or another late entrant, Vodafone may not have to pay as high a price for CWW. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong>, demerged from CWW in 2010, added 0.79p to 31.29p after a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove. The bank moved from neutral to overweight, suggesting it could benefit from making disposals. It said:</p> <blockquote> Having sold off by a third from its February high, we see a value-led opportunity. With CWC now trading on a dividend yield of 16%, expectations for a cut appear broadly held. We forecast CWC meeting its 8 cents dividend guidance for 2011/12, then halving it going forward. <br> As well as dividend coverage, the other likely barrier to investor interest is geographic complexity (36 markets, with scale in Panama, Macau, Bahamas, Jamaica, and Maldives). Further disposals could carry triple benefits: simplify the story; show liquidity of assets; and reduce gearing. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Daily Mail &amp; General Trust</strong> dropped 3.2p to 420.4p.

It also won European approval for its asthma treatment Flutiform.</p> <p>Some of the smaller oil explorers caused excitement. <strong>Borders &amp; Southern</strong>, which is drilling in the Falklands, added 8p to 131p, on hopes of a positive update from its Darwin well.</p> <p>An upbeat statement lifted <strong>Desire Petroleum</strong>, 0.25p better at 29.5p.</p> <p>But <strong>Rockhopper Exploration</strong> fell 29.5p to 351.75p on concerns about the size of its Sea Lion field in the Falklands, and a lack of news on a potential development partner.</p> <p>Finally mining group <strong>Beowulf </strong>lost 2.5% to 14.125p.

There is also a profit shortfall of \u00a32m in the same division as a result of demand for stock from franchisees and wholesale customers coming later than expected, although the bulk of these sales will be pushed into the 2012-13 year. More importantly, a further \u00a32m shortfall was caused by more shoppers buying goods on the eBay clearance site or at discount outlets. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, called the latest warning a calamity. John Stevenson, retail analyst at Peel Hunt, advised clients to sell the shares, saying: \"Against very weak comparatives last year \u2013 we calculate that like-for-like sales fell 8% against a strong clothing market \u2013 we view this as a worrying result.\" Operating costs have gone up too, partly linked to the hiring of new executives, but SuperGroup (and the City) hope new finance director Shaun Wills \u2013 who starts on Monday - along with Susanne Given in the newly created post of chief operating officer will sort out problems in reporting systems and operational issues. SuperGroup said retail sales were on target and projections for 2012-13 should not be affected. But house broker Seymour Pierce still cut its forecast to \u00a356m from \u00a364m. Stevenson lowered his forecast even further, to \u00a345m: \"With another profit warning that questions management control and market communication, we struggle to see the shares as being investable.\" SuperGroup also issued a profit warning last October, blaming the botched implementation of a warehouse IT system upgrade that left stores short of stock. Several analysts, including Oriel's Pritchard and analysts at Singer Capital Markets, who had been buyers of the shares, put their ratings under review.",

      "standfirst": "Each week we look at retailers competing in the same sector. This week we pitch John Lewis and Debenhams into battle", 
      "body": "<p>Each week we are looking at two shops competing in the same sector and reviewing what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are, to the best bargains currently on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>In order to get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job, other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, department stores behemoths Debenhams and John Lewis go toe to toe. Please continue to tell us which stores you would like us to go to.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/\" title=\"John Lewis website\">John Lewis</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Having grown from a single drapery shop in 1864, John Lewis now covers most major UK cities, with 29 traditional stores and seven John Lewis at Home outlets. Across the past century-and-a-half the group has purchased a number of local department stores with the majority, like this former Bainbridge store, rebranded as John Lewis in 2002.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 11.30am, 18 April 2012, Newcastle.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Clothes, cosmetics, homewares and electrical goods.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> Lying inside the Eldon Square shopping mall, this branch of John Lewis has several entrances, with the most prominent leading into the cosmetics and perfume department. Despite having no windows it feels bright and airy throughout its four floors and contains an espresso bar, cafe and brasserie for customers looking for lunch.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> The staff in each department were able to talk confidently about the range of products on offer and gave good advice to potential customers, although a couple of those working in the electronics department were unnecessarily pushy.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A 52\" Sony 3D/HDTV had a hefty \u00a3350 discount, reducing it from \u00a31,999 to \u00a31,649.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume (50ml), \u00a340.50; John Lewis 100% cotton white shirt, \u00a325; Dyson DC19db multi floor cylinder vacuum cleaner, \u00a3259. It also has the John Lewis price promise, offering to match prices charged by high street rivals.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were numerous tills located throughout the store, meaning customers didn't have to stray far to pay for their shopping.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> A vast and excellent shop with a huge range of products all well presented and easy to navigate. It oozed quality, with the messages explaining the John Lewis product guarantees and customer service particularly reassuring. There were always members of staff on hand and eager to help, even at a busy time of day.</p> <p>The only major criticism is that its clothes range is largely pitched at older people. While these are clearly John Lewis's core customers, some younger fashion ranges would be a good addition. Even so, it provides an almost flawless shopping experience.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 9/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.debenhams.com/\" title=\"Debenhams\">Debenhams</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> With a history dating back to 1778 when William Clark opened a drapery shop in London's West End, Debenhams has proved to be one of the country's most enduring brands. It took on its current name at the start of the 20th century and has since expanded to become a global brand with 167 stores in the UK and Ireland and a further 61 outlets in 24 countries around the world.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 12.45pm, 18 April 2012, Newcastle.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Clothes, cosmetics, homewares and electrical goods.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> Open for just two years, the shop has a high quality finish with an imposing glass entrance outside and another into the shopping mall on the opposite side of the store. The clothing department is divided by brand rather than by item, with high street names like Wallis alongside numerous Debenhams-owned brands. There is a coffee shop on the ground floor and a restaurant upstairs, both of which were popular with customers. The store was busy on the lower levels, with fewer people browsing the menswear section on the third floor.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Very helpful \u2013 when an item I asked for was not available they immediately offered to order it in.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A range of coloured Morphy Richards toasters and kettles were reduced from \u00a360 to \u00a345.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume (50ml), \u00a345; Thomas Nash 100% cotton white shirt, \u00a325; Dyson DC19db multi floor cylinder vacuum cleaner, \u00a3259.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were tills across the store's four floors.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> Since leaving the Nectar scheme in 2008 there has been no general loyalty card, although a Beauty Club card allows shoppers to earn points on beauty and fragrance purchases.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> Debenhams' range was small but solid in most departments, with a larger selection of clothes and accessories taking up around half the store. The electrical department on the top floor was a little lacklustre compared to John Lewis's, but contained a decent range of products at competitive prices.</p> <p>There was a wealth of special offers available: a blue cross sale offered 70% discount on selected clothing lines, while a separate 20% off sale covered several other areas of the store and included everything from photo frames to frying pans.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> Both shops offered a very good shopping experience and were clean and well presented. The staff in both were helpful, although the number of employees in John Lewis far outnumbered its rival.</p> <p>John Lewis also had a far bigger range, particularly in its electrical department, but Debenhams won on choice in cosmetics and beauty, although a random price comparison suggested they were slightly dearer than John Lewis.</p> <p>Debenhams' clothing section was generally good, but was confused by the number of different own brands on offer in certain areas.

      "bodyText": "Each week we are looking at two shops competing in the same sector and reviewing what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are, to the best bargains currently on offer. Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing. In order to get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops. Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job, other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend. This week, department stores behemoths Debenhams and John Lewis go toe to toe. Please continue to tell us which stores you would like us to go to. John Lewis Background Having grown from a single drapery shop in 1864, John Lewis now covers most major UK cities, with 29 traditional stores and seven John Lewis at Home outlets. Across the past century-and-a-half the group has purchased a number of local department stores with the majority, like this former Bainbridge store, rebranded as John Lewis in 2002. The visit 11.30am, 18 April 2012, Newcastle. What it sells Clothes, cosmetics, homewares and electrical goods. First impressions Lying inside the Eldon Square shopping mall, this branch of John Lewis has several entrances, with the most prominent leading into the cosmetics and perfume department. Despite having no windows it feels bright and airy throughout its four floors and contains an espresso bar, cafe and brasserie for customers looking for lunch. What were the staff like? The staff in each department were able to talk confidently about the range of products on offer and gave good advice to potential customers, although a couple of those working in the electronics department were unnecessarily pushy. Best bargain A 52\" Sony 3D/HDTV had a hefty \u00a3350 discount, reducing it from \u00a31,999 to \u00a31,649. What does it charge? Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume (50ml), \u00a340.50; John Lewis 100% cotton white shirt, \u00a325; Dyson DC19db multi floor cylinder vacuum cleaner, \u00a3259. It also has the John Lewis price promise, offering to match prices charged by high street rivals. Where can I pay? There were numerous tills located throughout the store, meaning customers didn't have to stray far to pay for their shopping. Is loyalty rewarded? No. Lasting impressions A vast and excellent shop with a huge range of products all well presented and easy to navigate. It oozed quality, with the messages explaining the John Lewis product guarantees and customer service particularly reassuring. There were always members of staff on hand and eager to help, even at a busy time of day. The only major criticism is that its clothes range is largely pitched at older people. While these are clearly John Lewis's core customers, some younger fashion ranges would be a good addition. Even so, it provides an almost flawless shopping experience. Overall rating 9/10. Debenhams Background With a history dating back to 1778 when William Clark opened a drapery shop in London's West End, Debenhams has proved to be one of the country's most enduring brands. It took on its current name at the start of the 20th century and has since expanded to become a global brand with 167 stores in the UK and Ireland and a further 61 outlets in 24 countries around the world. The visit 12.45pm, 18 April 2012, Newcastle. What it sells Clothes, cosmetics, homewares and electrical goods. First impressions Open for just two years, the shop has a high quality finish with an imposing glass entrance outside and another into the shopping mall on the opposite side of the store. The clothing department is divided by brand rather than by item, with high street names like Wallis alongside numerous Debenhams-owned brands. There is a coffee shop on the ground floor and a restaurant upstairs, both of which were popular with customers. The store was busy on the lower levels, with fewer people browsing the menswear section on the third floor. What were the staff like? Very helpful \u2013 when an item I asked for was not available they immediately offered to order it in. Best bargain A range of coloured Morphy Richards toasters and kettles were reduced from \u00a360 to \u00a345. What does it charge? Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume (50ml), \u00a345; Thomas Nash 100% cotton white shirt, \u00a325; Dyson DC19db multi floor cylinder vacuum cleaner, \u00a3259. Where can I pay? There were tills across the store's four floors. Is loyalty rewarded? Since leaving the Nectar scheme in 2008 there has been no general loyalty card, although a Beauty Club card allows shoppers to earn points on beauty and fragrance purchases. Lasting impressions Debenhams' range was small but solid in most departments, with a larger selection of clothes and accessories taking up around half the store. The electrical department on the top floor was a little lacklustre compared to John Lewis's, but contained a decent range of products at competitive prices. There was a wealth of special offers available: a blue cross sale offered 70% discount on selected clothing lines, while a separate 20% off sale covered several other areas of the store and included everything from photo frames to frying pans. Overall rating 7/10 Adam's verdict Both shops offered a very good shopping experience and were clean and well presented. The staff in both were helpful, although the number of employees in John Lewis far outnumbered its rival. John Lewis also had a far bigger range, particularly in its electrical department, but Debenhams won on choice in cosmetics and beauty, although a random price comparison suggested they were slightly dearer than John Lewis. Debenhams' clothing section was generally good, but was confused by the number of different own brands on offer in certain areas. In men's shirts, for example, several Debenhams-owned brands sat next to each other despite having little discernible difference in quality or price; in comparison John Lewis had a single own-brand offering which was easily recognisable against the famous labels. Overall, both stores were very good, but Debenhams couldn't match the range and expertise on offer in John Lewis. Last time The battle of the home improvement specialists saw B&amp;Q trounce Homebase with 70.6% of the 942 votes cast. whodhavethoughtit had this to say about the two rivals: \"All the branches of Homebase I have ever visited always look as though they are about to go into liquidation at any moment: limp, dying plant specimens in the garden section; swathes of empty shelves; nothing I want is ever in stock; bored listless staff (if you can find one - and of course they may be worried about their future employment). I could go on but I won't. In comparison B&amp;Q is excellent and their policy of employing older workers who know what they are talking about is a real plus point.\" Cheesyrider, on the other hand, didn't recognise our reviewer's experience of B&amp;Q: \"The ones near me (North London) are non-descript tin sheds with no staff in them (tellingly the ones on duty are generally dealing with refuds).\" Many of you thought both B&amp;Q and Homebase expensive, and had good things to say about other DIY outlets, with Screwfix in particular getting a few shouts. Glide, for example, said: \"I wouldn't bother with either as first port of call, as they're both expensive in my opinion. B&amp;Q trade is also expensive. Electricals breathtakingly so.

Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said the discount would have been a key factor for IAG in closing the deal. \"They would have been a lot less willing to do the deal if Lufthansa was not going to bear those costs.\" He added: \"The reduction in price is effectively Lufthansa paying for the cost of the losses of these two units, and quite possibly the cost of closing them down.\" It is estimated that bmibaby and bmi Regional lose a combined total of \u20ac100m (\u00a382m) per year, with bmi mainline losing the same amount. Oliver Richardson, national officer at the Unite trade union, urged BA not to close the smaller carriers. \"If BA is not commited to retaining bmi regional and bmibaby and the 800 jobs which are at stake, it must find a viable buyer. BA must do everything possible to give these two businesses and the workforce a long-term future in the UK aviation industry.\" Bmi Regional flies from airports including Aberdeen, Glasgow, Manchester and East Midlands to 14 destinations. Bmibaby, a low-cost operation, operates from East Midlands, Birmingham and Belfast City to 36 destinations, including Ibiza, Corfu and Dubrovnik. In February, bmi said it was close to selling bmibaby to a \"UK-based company\". However, the deal has not been completed.",
