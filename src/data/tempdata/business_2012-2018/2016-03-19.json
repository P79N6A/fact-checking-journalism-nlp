      "bodyText": "Alton Towers reopened its main rollercoaster ride on Saturday, nine months after a crash that caused appalling injuries to five passengers. The Staffordshire theme park was beginning its first season since 16 people were injured in the Smiler accident, with its owner hoping to make a fresh start in spite of opposition from some of the victims. These include 21-year-old Vicky Balch, whose leg was amputated after one of the ride\u2019s carriages smashed into another at high speed. She has criticised Alton Towers for putting \u201cmoney before safety\u201d and called for the ride to remain closed. But the crowds who queued outside the park from 7am had different ideas. When the gates opened at 10am, dozens of people sprinted from the turnstiles to the Smiler\u2019s entrance. Among them was James Butler, a 21-year-old acting and theatre student from Staffordshire University, who visited the park more than 60 times last year. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were all running down the hill and screaming and shouting. I just wanted to be here. It\u2019s the first time it\u2019s run since the accident. I loved the ride, even after the accident. It\u2019s the safest ride in the world now.\u201d Neil Charteris, a 53-year-old maintenance engineer from Cannock, who has friends who have worked at the park, went on with his daughter Laura. He said had \u201cno nerves. The safety issue doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s re-opened, so we can carry on.\u201d Park owner Merlin Entertainments says it has \u201csought to learn every possible lesson\u201d from the events of 2 June, with extra training for the ride\u2019s operators and new safety procedures. Another season-pass holder, James Bowman, said the precautions convinced him the ride was safe. The 33-year-old carer from Tamworth said: \u201cThey\u2019ve added extra platforms and supports. I would have thought there would have been more reinforcement at the front. There\u2019s really thin metal there. But I think they\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d Not everyone was convinced. Lizzy Lee, a 22-year-old carer from Salford, stood watching the rides for more than an hour while her boyfriend queued to go on the Smiler. \u201cI do like rollercoasters but I\u2019m not keen on the upside down thing,\u201d she said. Last year\u2019s tragedy was a \u201cput-off\u201d, she added. The Health and Safety Executive is prosecuting Merlin Attractions Operations over the incident, with a hearing due at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 22 April. Five people were seriously injured and another 11 suffered whiplash in the crash. An empty carriage was left on the track while another was sent out around the 14 loops at speeds of 50mph in some places. When the carriage filled with passengers hit the stationary car, a metal barrier at the front smashed into the legs of the four passengers at the front. Eyewitnesses said the second cart was pushed up the track, then fell back down, hitting them again. In addition to Balch, Leah Washington, 18, needed surgery to amputate her leg, while Joe Pugh, aged 19, suffered serious damage to his kneecaps, and Daniel Thorpe, 28, and Chandaben Chauhan, 49, were badly injured. An internal investigation by Alton Towers found that the crash was the result of human error, because an operator decided to override a safety system. After last summer\u2019s incident, visitor numbers to the park dropped significantly. Merlin made 190 redundancies at Alton Towers, where it employs around 2,000 people. But the group, which also owns Legoland, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye, enjoyed a slight increase in 2015 profits to \u00a3250m. The group is hoping that visitor numbers pick up, and regular guests said the park was about as busy yesterday as it was last year. Queues for the Smiler were advertised at 90 minutes by 1pm yesterday, although most of the other rides were much less popular. Rollercoasters including Thirteen, Rita and Oblivion had queues of 30 minutes while Nemesis, another popular ride, had wait times of only 15 minutes. Alton Towers staff are pinning hopes on a virtual-reality rollercoaster to improve visitor numbers. Passengers on the Galactica ride will wear headsets that, says the park, make them feel as though they are flying through space. They will be able to look at planets and asteroids while hanging from the rollercoaster harness at up to 46mph.",

      "bodyText": "Forty million years ago a group of ants sat on a tree trunk watching another ant at work. A drop of sap welled over them; the rest is palaeontology. The ants\u2019 story has come alive in Poland where a pendant featuring the Tertiary Period work scene is one of the main attractions of Amberif, the annual amber trade fair. In the past five years, amid soaring interest from China, the gram price of amber has overtaken that of gold. But now there are fears the Chinese economic downturn is about to impose an ice age chill on the sector. Amber jeweller Andrzej Wiszniewski, who has been in the trade for 20 years, said: \u201cAmber prices have increased between 800% and 1,000% in the past five years due to Chinese interest. We do not know what is going to happen next. It makes it difficult and risky to plan ahead.\u201d Buyer Huoyan Yan of China Amber Market \u2013 which has more than 150 outlets in China \u2013 sounded a reassuring note: \u201cChinese people will always love amber. The Ming dynasty prized amber and, today, Chinese people still believe it brings luck and good health. The price has soared and will probably fall gently, like a car going at high speed that takes time to stop.\u201d At Amberif, deals are struck in euros or dollars, cash. The organisers will not reveal the estimated turnover of the four-day fair because \u201cwe do not want an armed robbery\u201d, says spokeswoman Ewa Racho\u0144. Much of the chatter in the alleyways of the fair is in Chinese. Gda\u0144sk\u2019s shipyard employed 17,000 people when the Solidarity trade union was born in this northern Polish port in 1980. Only 1,000 people still have jobs at the yard. But amber, which is fished in nets on the Baltic shore \u2013 a pre-ice age pine forest \u2013 has saved the city. Two decades ago the resin had the image of a low-value tourist trinket. Now it provides an estimated 10,000 jobs, says Racho\u0144. Amber is also extracted commercially in the Baltic states, the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and in Ukraine. The boom has also brought criminality. The war in Ukraine has pushed new \u2013 and not always professional \u2013 individuals into the trade. Last Wednesday, at the Dorohusk border post with Ukraine, Polish customs seized a record 1.5 tonnes of amber, including some rough rocks the size of ostrich eggs. The Polish authorities estimate the seized amber is worth an estimated \u20ac6m. A Polish lorry driver and his Ukrainian co-driver were arrested. Among buyers at Amberif are small-scale cutters and traders, including Arben Kolaj, 38, who has driven 1,200 miles to Gda\u0144sk from Kosovo. \u201cPeople buy it as an investment in Albania, just as they would buy gold,\u201d said Kolaj. \u201cThe amber market has always been subject to fluctuations,\u201d said Wiszniewski, whose company is based in Bialystok, in eastern Poland. \u201cIn 1990 Russia opened the rough market at Kaliningrad. The demise of the monopoly led to the price falling by 70%. Then, five years ago, came the Chinese phenomenon.\u201d Chinese buyers, he says, like the deep cherry coloured amber they call mila and the white amber, baimi. The Gda\u0144sk trade fair attracts a broad range of buyers, including jewellery wholesalers and department stores looking for new designers. Amber has also spawned its own beauty industry \u2013 facial creams and washes \u2013 as many people believe amber acid has medicinal qualities. Gemologists also come to the Gda\u0144sk fair looking for rocks with rare inclusions. Marta Siemionko, whose Gda\u0144sk-based jeweller husband, Marcin Weso\u0142owski, discovered the ants in a rock he was about to work on in November, said the pendant he has made is on sale for at least \u20ac1m. She said: \u201cThis is like a precious diamond; you do not find two Cullinans in a century. It was real luck that we cut it in such a way that we did not destroy the inclusion. We initially counted 14 ants. When we took it to the specialists at Gda\u0144sk University they said there were 20 of them.\u201d She said Chinese buyers \u201clove inclusions\u201d but that she would not mind if no buyer came forward. The family firm, NAC Jewellery, would then probably donate it to Gda\u0144sk\u2019s amber museum. \u201cWe have mixed feeling about the Chinese dominance of the market. They became interested in amber after their jade became exhausted, and things have just gone mad. \u201cThe Chinese started going straight to our suppliers and this is what prompted the speculation to begin. The high price also makes the raw material more expensive for us. Chinese design tastes are different from ours. This means many designers may change their approach just to suit that market. It is a mixed blessing,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Until it closed its doors in January, BHS had had a department store in Carlisle city centre for more than 30 years. The retailer, which was once British Home Stores and can trace its origins back nearly 90 years, was an anchor tenant of the Lanes shopping centre when it opened in 1984, and gave BHS a prime site right in the heart of the city. The closure has caused controversy, not just because of the loss of 50 jobs but because it has emerged that BHS was paid more than \u00a35m to leave the shop, with about a quarter of that coming from Carlisle city council. The council and the owner of the shopping centre were desperate to replace BHS with Primark, which will pay far more rent and potentially attract more visitors. The events in Carlisle shine a rather different light on the problems facing BHS than its bosses have outlined. Not only does it have huge financial problems, it also has to reinvent a business regarded as old-fashioned or, as one analyst said, \u201cirrelevant\u201d, with no obvious place on the modern high street. The retailer claims that it is struggling and desperately needs to restructure its finances because the rent it is paying on its shops is too high. BHS is trying to push through a company voluntary arrangement \u2013 an insolvency procedure \u2013 that will see rents cut at more than half of its 164 stores, with as many as 40 closing. Creditors will vote on the vital CVA on Wednesday. BHS needs 75% of creditors to vote in favour of the proposals and has warned that it will collapse into administration if it is rejected. Documents filed at the high court as part of the CVA show that BHS has debts of more than \u00a31.3bn, including a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. All BHS\u2019s creditors, including suppliers, will have a vote in the CVA, despite landlords being the only ones asked to accept cuts. Darren Topp, chief executive of BHS, says he is confident of winning the vote, with a number of votes already posted to the company. \u201cWe are confident but are not complacent about that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be grateful if they do. We believe we have a compelling story and a compelling turnaround. I think they [the creditors] do buy into it.\u201d That turnaround plan is designed to reinvent BHS, modernising stores, installing food departments, cutting the number of promotions in favour of lower everyday prices, and focusing on a smaller number of own-brand ranges. However, the CVA document also underlines the true scale of the task facing Topp and his team even if creditors back the rent-reducing proposals. It shows that BHS still needs extra funds to be able to trade beyond 25 March and that it is trying to raise up to \u00a3100m. This includes a \u00a360m loan, likely to come from restructuring firm Gordon Brothers, which will be secured against stock and debtors. BHS also needs to raise \u00a330m from property, either by selling sites, sub-letting them or raising loans against them. Its flagship shop on Oxford Street in London and a site in Milton Keynes are thought to be part of a deal. The final tranche of the \u00a3100m will come from the release of up to \u00a310m tied up with letters of credit and deposits held by suppliers. This cash was handed to BHS\u2019s suppliers after they had their credit insurance cut last year. Insurers who cover the possibility of a retailer going bust withdrew cover for BHS\u2019s suppliers, leaving them with no financial protection if the retailer collapsed before bills were paid. BHS said this had a \u201csubstantial negative impact\u201d. The need for this extra funding shows that cutting costs is only part of the problem for BHS. The brand also needs to prove that it still has a place on the high street \u2013 and that will cost money. \u201cThis has not happened quickly. It has happened over many years. BHS has been losing money for five years and more,\u201d said Richard Hyman, a retail consultant. \u201cI think it has become progressively irrelevant and it is a massive challenge to change that. I think the place to start is with understanding the customer better and editing the offers to become more relevant. It doesn\u2019t have a place on the high street as it is. It has to change. It will need to invest money in these changes. It is not rocket science. I wouldn\u2019t like to put a number on it, but it is going to be really tough, they have a mountain to climb.\u201d British Home Stores, as it was originally known, was founded in Brixton, south London in 1928 by a group of American entrepreneurs who wanted to create a UK version of Woolworths. Nothing was priced at more than a shilling (5p), though this increased to five shillings a year later when the business moved into furnishings. It floated on the stock market in the 1930s before merging with Mothercare and Habitat in 1986 to become Storehouse, which was led by Sir Terence Conran. Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, bought BHS for \u00a3200m in 2000, turning it into part of his Arcadia empire. Green paid more than \u00a3400m in dividends to his wife, Tina, during his 15-year ownership, but he struggled to revive the brand and it remained deep in the red. The billionaire sold BHS last March, for just \u00a31, to Retail Acquisitions Limited, a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants. Since then concerns about the future of the retailer, which now employs more than 10,000 staff, have only grown. The man who led the buyout, Dominic Chappell, has twice been declared bankrupt and the Guardian recently revealed that the new owners took a \u00a38.4m loan out of BHS in the days after the takeover, with \u00a33m going to four directors of Retail Acquisitions, including Chappell, handing them a multimillion-pound windfall. Retail Acquisitions explained the loan was for \u201cprofessional fees\u201d. Chappell is also understood to be getting paid \u00a3540,000 a year, which is more than Topp. When contacted by the Observer, Chappell offered only a brief comment about the CVA. \u201cWe are very positive on a good outcome,\u201d he said. He has previously said that he has always acted correctly in the eyes of the law. But a lot is at stake for BHS\u2019s 10,000 staff and the 20,000 members of its pension scheme. The voluntary arrangement has triggered a process that is likely to lead to the scheme and its \u00a3571m pension deficit entering the Pension Protection Fund. For those yet to reach retirement, this means a cut of 10% to their benefits. Chris Martin, chairman of the trustees of the BHS pension scheme, said: \u201cOur focus is on clear communications with the members. I can\u2019t speak for members, but from the trustees\u2019 perspective a defined benefit scheme, when combined with a sponsoring employer with a weak covenant, is almost the perfect storm for pensions.\u201d The Pensions Regulator has the power to pursue parties that it believes should contribute to underfunded schemes, and experts believe that it is considering whether to pursue Green. John Ralfe, a pensions consultant, said: \u201cThe regulator has legal powers to make a claim up to \u00a3571m against some of the companies in the Taveta Group, controlled by Lady Green and her immediate family. \u201cLooking at what the regulator has done in other cases, once the BHS pension schemes enter the PPF it will start the legal process. Although this will take years to work through the various courts, the amounts at stake are so huge the regulator will be prepared to spend as much time and money as it takes.\u201d It has been reported that Green has made an offer to put \u00a380m into the pension scheme, with \u00a340m in cash and \u00a340m from a loan against the assets of Green\u2019s Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Evans empire. If BHS does go bust, Green will be at the front of the queue to reclaim debts. The CVA shows Arcadia is one of BHS\u2019s secured creditors and is owed \u00a335m, though Green has written off another \u00a3215m of debts. This means Green still has influence over the company and it is understood he has played a role in talks with landlords about the CVA. This week is pivotal for BHS. Even if the CVA is approved, as expected, the 88-year-old brand has a long battle ahead if it wants to enjoy a bright future on Britain\u2019s high streets. RISE AND FALL \u201cIf I give you my plane, right, and you tell me you\u2019re a great driver and you crash it into the first fucking mountain, is that my fault?\u201d So said Sir Philip Green after he sold BHS for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt. The comment was Green\u2019s response to questions about whether his reputation would suffer if BHS collapsed under its new owners. Green owned BHS for 15 years after buying it for \u00a3200m in 2000. He initially sparked new life into the department store chain, but the online shopping revolution and the rise of new high street rivals such as Primark has taken its toll on BHS, which has lost money for several years in a row. If BHS does collapse then its disappearance from the high street would have a similar impact to the recent failure of two other town centre stalwarts, Woolworths and Comet. British Home Stores was launched in 1928 as an attempt to build a UK version of Woolworths. A group of entrepreneurs from the US, where the original Woolworths was founded, opened a shop in London. The retailer went on to become one of the best-known names on the high street. Today it has 164 stores and 67 franchise stores across 16 countries, employing more than 10,000 people. Despite its problems, the chain still generates one million transactions a week. Green bought the department store chain from Storehouse, a collection of retail brands put together by Sir Terence Conran, the designer. Storehouse, which also owned Habitat and Mothercare, led the international expansion of the brand.",

      "bodyText": "It was about 12 hours after the Sunday papers went to press last weekend that the Reverend Paul Flowers got in touch. \u201cThe Sunday Mirror has had a mild go at me today,\u201d began the email, inviting me to interview him about how he had ended up in the tabloids once more, after yet another male prostitute secretly filmed him at what was described as a drug-fuelled party in his Salford home. The double-page feature included a picture of the methodist minister and former chair of the Co-op bank asleep, half naked, with crisps balanced on each nipple, and the headline: The Crispal Methodist. It was a pun on the nickname he was given the first of the three times his peccadilloes have been publicly exposed in recent years, when he was caught on camera buying crystal meth in November 2013, six months after quitting the Co-op when a \u00a31.5bn black hole was revealed in its balance books. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t want or need money!!!\u201d ran the breathless email, giving his home phone number. I rang him up. He sounded oddly euphoric, cracking jokes about his new boyfriend, whom, he said, was \u201ca refugee from the nightclubs of Manchester\u201d. He would get this young beau to do the gardening in the nude for the paparazzi later, he said. The following day I drove to his house. I was unsure he would even answer the door: he didn\u2019t the last time he invited me round a few months after he had been fined \u00a3525 for drugs charges in May 2014. I arrived then at the anointed hour, rapping the bishop-shaped door knocker, but no one stirred. Opening the letter box, I could hear music. I was pretty sure he was home. All of the upstairs windows were flung wide open. I waited outside for eight hours before I started to seriously worry that he might be dead. He only replied to my texts the following day, when I said I was so concerned about him that I was going to ring the police if he didn\u2019t send signs of life. He was terribly apologetic, blaming new medication prescribed for his \u201csevere clinical depression\u201d, which he said was causing him to sleep up to 15 hours at a time. This time he opens the door with a flourish. He is wearing a lilac shirt and khaki slacks, full of regret for standing me up last time. He couldn\u2019t have talked then, he says: he would have been \u201clargely incoherent\u201d. The new boyfriend, a sweet, skinny lad from the West Country who doesn\u2019t want to be named, is in the back garden, where the previous weekend the Sunday Mirror claimed a \u201csordid hot tub party\u201d had taken place. The Jacuzzi was rented, the boyfriend explains: they had been celebrating his 25th birthday party with friends, including the young n\u2019er-do-well who covertly filmed the lot and sold the footage to the Sunday Mirror. Flowers, now 65, wants the world to know how he ended up in such a mess. He figured it out at the Priory in Birmingham, where he spent 28 days at the end of 2013 after his drug use and sexual proclivities were revealed in the Mail on Sunday. It had not been a good year. He had stepped down as chairman of the Co-op in early June, shortly before the bank was taken over by two US hedge funds. In the November he was summoned to parliament to appear in front of the treasury select committee. It did not go well. \u201cI made an ass of myself,\u201d he says of how he came to underestimate the bank\u2019s assets by \u00a344bn (he thought they were worth just \u00a33bn). How a Labour councillor and Methodist minister ended up chairing one of the UK\u2019s most respected banks is still a little hard to fathom \u2013 especially when taken with his less than saintly past, which included convictions for cottaging and drink-driving, and an ignominious departure from Lifeline, a Manchester drugs charity he chaired for 16 years, after being accused (and then cleared) of dodgy expenses. But Flowers still insists he wasn\u2019t out of his depth. Chatting in his conservatory, surrounded by books, including Johann Hari\u2019s investigation of failed drug prevention policies, Chasing the Scream, he says he beat five others in an \u201copen competition\u201d to get the gig, and his appointment was twice \u201caffirmed\u201d in interviews with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). When Flowers first contacted me, in the summer of 2014, he said he wanted to correct the \u201csloppy journalism\u201d that implied one of the reasons he left the Co-op was his drug use. He said police trawled through 38,000 of his emails and found nothing in his time as chair of the bank that they would wish to use in a drugs prosecution. But he now admits that during his chairmanship, which began in 2010, he was \u201cvery occasionally\u201d taking drugs, usually cocaine and sometimes ketamine, and having sex with male prostitutes in Manchester\u2019s Renaissance hotel. He did cocaine alone at home in Bradford in the days leading up to his disastrous select committee appearance. It was behaviour that began in 2009, he said, when he was on the Co-op board and he started to spend more time in Manchester, where the bank has its headquarters. He suggests \u2013 via the second person he often employs when discussing his chequered past \u2013 that it was the stress of the job that led him to trawl the internet for paid sex: \u201cYou had nights when you had been battling through the issues of the day, then the senior officers had to entertain the troops in the evening and I was bloody well worn out. That was part of the job, but you were knackered. And like many thousands of other people \u2013 judges, lawyers, journalists, people of all professions and none \u2013 I sought intimacy among escorts.\u201d I ask how many escorts he has used over the years. More than 10? \u201cOh yes.\u201d More than 20? He pauses. \u201cI think it would be almost salacious to put a number on it, forgive me. Just say that I have, over the years, at points where I was often spending three or four nights a week in one particular hotel in Manchester, often sought comfort and solace.\u201d Flowers prides himself on finding out who the escort \u201creally\u201d is. \u201cOften they have been in care, often they have suffered different kinds of abuse, whether physical or mental, and they struggle with their demons, too.\u201d He has his own peculiar justification for paying for sex: \u201cIf I could be terribly blasphemous for a moment, as somebody who tries to be, please don\u2019t laugh too horribly, someone who tries to be a decent Christian person, I would like to use that little mantra that is often beloved of evangelicals, though that is not the evangelical camp from which I come at all. They often use the mantra: \u2018WWJD \u2013 What would Jesus do?\u2019\u201d He\u2019s midway through a long lecture about the Bible before I realise that he has just compared himself to the son of God, who befriended Mary Magdalene and other female prostitutes. He doesn\u2019t see the contradiction between his own acknowledgement of the vulnerability of the escorts and the fact that he may be exploiting it. \u201cWith respect, I often ended up in counselling sessions with them,\u201d he says. Who was counselling whom? \u201cI was counselling them, because I listened to them. And lots of them would tell you, if you bothered to ask, that I had a reputation for being a very kind person who listened to people I spent time with, in a way that they were never listened to before.\u201d The man who secretly filmed the hot-tub party earlier was an escort, too. \u201cHe\u2019s gay for pay,\u201d says Flowers\u2019 boyfriend, who adds that lots of his friends are escorts. He and Flowers contest some of the account the escort gave the Sunday Mirror, but far from all of it. Flowers admits in a roundabout way that he had taken drugs at the party, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t happen to be a criminal offence of taking them in my own home\u201d. I challenge his misunderstanding of the law, but he stands firm. He won\u2019t tell me what he ingested, only that he has never, ever tried crystal meth. \u201cI know I have this reputation as the Crystal Methodist, my dear,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause when they [the companion of Flowers who supplied the phone camera footage to the Mail on Sunday] filmed me in that car I was purchasing ... crystal meth.\u201d But he insists he has never inhaled anything in his life, including cigarettes: \u201cI cannot take things down my throat.\u201d In the first video that got him in so much trouble, the man filming was the one for whom he was buying crystal meth, he says. He\u2019s just too generous with his cash: he says he gave \u00a3200 to the escort who turned him over at the weekend, too. The Sunday Mirror implied the money was for sex, or at least company. Not so, says Flower: \u201cI\u2019m a generous person so I lent him some money. But, a bit like Bill Clinton my dear, I did not have sex with that person.\u201d It was in the Priory, tasked with writing his own life story as part of his therapy, that Flowers remembered a long-buried incident that took place at theological college in the early 1970s, when he says that he was raped by another student. He never told a soul, but believes now that the trauma stopped him from developing \u201cprofound\u201d relationships with men. He has never been closeted, he says, but nonetheless has never managed to forge lasting romantic relationships beyond about two months. Growing up in Portsmouth, his family knew he was gay. They were used to it: his grandma had both a gay brother and sister, and Flowers\u2019 only sibling, his younger brother, Ian, was gay too. He died in 1993 from an Aids-related illness. Flowers says it is only now, at 65, that he is experiencing true love. He gazes adoringly at his willowy partner, who brings us drinks throughout the interview and has scrubbed the downstairs loo ahead of my arrival. He knows some will disapprove of his relationship with a man 40 years his junior, but he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cI have found profound happiness now in a relationship that the world will look at and think, \u2018He\u2019s a dirty old bugger.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t give a tiddler\u2019s fuck what they think.\u201d It\u2019s not his fault that the Co-op has lost customers, he says, moving into the third person. \u201cThey\u2019ve not taken their accounts away because six months after Paul Flowers had resigned from office he was charged with this minor offence of possession, which would not have got into the public press at all if I had not been Paul Flowers, former chair of the Co-op bank. They didn\u2019t do it because of that. There is no convergence between the time I chaired and the other issues I had. The personal peccadilloes of someone who seeks intimacy and support has sod-all to do with the issues of whether or not we soundly or properly tried to run a bank.\u201d The conversation turns back to drugs. He insists he is not an addict because he doesn\u2019t crave them and can go weeks or months without. I suggest that there is another contradiction: that he says he took drugs to deal with loneliness and lack of love, but here he is telling me that he is blissfully in love and yet is still hoovering coke up his nose in the tabloids. \u201cAt each stage in our development, we do things to get by,\u201d he says, by which he means drugs. \u201cAnd then at some stage, you discover something quite interesting about the way in which they help your connections to other people. And you then do things because you enjoy them, all right? A lot of your readers will identify with that too.\u201d He is still furious about his 2014 conviction, claiming that one of the officers who dealt with him after his arrest apologised for what was a \u201cmedia-led investigation\u201d and that the Crown Prosecution Service was under pressure from 10 Downing Street to press charges. There is no evidence to substantiate this claim. He has been suspended from the Methodist Church since his drug use was made public in November 2013, but has yet to attend a tribunal because his doctors say he is too unwell. Meanwhile, he has begun working on his memoirs, and thinks he may soon be strong enough to face the panel. He is optimistic about its outcome. \u201cMy experience of the Methodist Church is that you are treated with great kindness and gentility, and you are treated like a human being,\u201d he says. \u201cMy past experience of being involved in some of these processes is that grace operates, rather than law, and that they will be inclined to be considerate and kind. They understand that human nature is such that we make mistakes. It\u2019s how we learn from these mistakes and turn them positively for good.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 March 2016. An earlier version said a man who filmed Paul Flowers buying drugs in 2013 was an escort commissioned by the Mail on Sunday. The Mail on Sunday would like to make clear that it did not commission the man, who was not an escort. He approached the Mail on Sunday after he had shot the footage.",

I arrived then at the anointed hour, rapping the bishop-shaped door knocker, but no one stirred. Opening the letter box, I could hear music. I was pretty sure he was home. All of the upstairs windows were flung wide open. I waited outside for eight hours before I started to seriously worry that he might be dead. He only replied to my texts the following day, when I said I was so concerned about him that I was going to ring the police if he didn\u2019t send signs of life.

A lot of your readers will identify with that too.\u201d</p> <p>He is still<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/07/co-op-bank-paul-flowers-court-drug-charges\"> furious about his 2014 conviction</a>, claiming that one of the officers who dealt with him after his arrest apologised for what was a \u201cmedia-led investigation\u201d and that the Crown Prosecution Service was under pressure from 10 Downing Street to press charges. There is no evidence to substantiate this claim. He has been suspended from the Methodist Church since his drug use was made public in November 2013, but has yet to attend a tribunal because his doctors say he is too unwell. Meanwhile, he has begun working on his memoirs, and thinks he may soon be strong enough to face the panel. He is optimistic about its outcome. \u201cMy experience of the Methodist Church is that you are treated with great kindness and gentility, and you are treated like a human being,\u201d he says. \u201cMy past experience of being involved in some of these processes is that grace operates, rather than law, and that they will be inclined to be considerate and kind. They understand that human nature is such that we make mistakes. It\u2019s how we learn from these mistakes and turn them positively for good.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 March 2016. An earlier version said a man who filmed Paul Flowers buying drugs in 2013 was an escort commissioned by the Mail on Sunday. The Mail on Sunday would like to make clear that it did not commission the man, who was not an escort. He approached the Mail on Sunday after he had shot the footage.<br></p>",
