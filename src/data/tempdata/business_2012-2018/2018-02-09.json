      "bodyText": "The new Holden Commodore \u2013 the first to be made overseas \u2013 is a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d to launch a high-profile electric or hybrid car in Australia, according to pro-renewables groups. The 2018 Commodore has been launched after the last operational Holden plant in Australia, in Elizabeth, South Australia, closed on 20 October last year. The German-made car has fewer cylinders than previous models (between four and six instead of eight) and is an all-wheel rather than rear-wheel drive. It is Holden\u2019s most fuel-efficient and low-emissions Commodore, at 5.6L per 100km and 148g of C02 per km for certain models. Environmental groups said the flagship car could have been a powerful statement to promote electric cars in Australia, but an underlying lack of government investment, and \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d was putting local manufacturers off bold steps. \u201cIt would have been good to see Holden pursue electric vehicle technology,\u201d said Clint Steele, from the Alternative Technology Association. \u201cBut I understand why they decided to take the path they took. It comes back to the local market being misinformed when it comes to electric vehicles.\u201d Australian consumers have been slow to embrace electric cars. But recent moves from the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, state governments and companies such as Tesla have tried to kickstart the industry. In January, British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta announced plans to buy assets from Holden\u2019s closed Elizabeth factory and set up an electric car plant in South Australia. The state treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, wrote to Holden\u2019s owner, General Motors, and strongly urged them to sell to Gupta. In the same month, Frydenberg declared the electric car \u201crevolution\u201d imminent in an opinion piece in the Sydney Morning Herald, but faced immediate backlash from Coalition colleagues. Compared to the rest of the world, Australia lags significantly behind \u2013 with fears of poor charging infrastructure, and unaffordable models behind the reticence. In 2016, according to the Electric Vehicle Council, only 0.1% of new car sales were electric, compared to 29% in Norway, 6% in the Netherlands and 1.5% in the UK, China and France. Steele said this underlying situation was the reason companies such as Holden were discouraged from promoting electric cars. \u201cThe new Commodore is a well designed car,\u201d he said. \u201cHolden has done the best they can with the leadership and engineering tools they have. But if we want to see more electric cars here, then we need to wait for companies like Tesla to lead the way, a new local electric vehicle company to start up or see more government support. \u201cYou need a campaigner or crusader running a company, or a supportive government. Elon Musk is such a crusader. Henry Ford would have likely made an ideal crusader at this time too. However, each time electric vehicle technology is discussed by current established automakers, there is this fear of the unknown.\u201d A Holden spokesman told Guardian Australia that low demand and the high price of electric vehicles was the reason why new models were not electric. \u201cAlmost all [of electric cars sold in 2016] were well over $60,000,\u201d he said. \u201cCommodore has been an affordable Australian family car for 40 years and its accessibility and value is an important part of its DNA. \u201cHolden did in fact introduce and market an electric vehicle, Holden Volt, in 2012. This was an affordable, high-tech electric vehicle with extended range capability. However, due to very low sales and lack of appetite for electric vehicles in Australia, it was later withdrawn. \u201cHolden will continue to analyse electric vehicles in Australia, however due to customer demand and the necessary large infrastructure investment, mass-market electric vehicles are still a few years away.\u201d Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, said in January that the industry could boom if the government introduced a temporary tax exemption as an incentive to buy electric cars. Frydenberg also said the problem lay with pricing. \u201cThe lack of takeup is not because of a lack of consumer interest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat holds them back are issues relating to price, range and infrastructure. But on each count, there are good things happening, with more to come.\u201d Western Australia and New South Wales have launched large charging station programs, and Queensland\u2019s state government has announced a 2,000km superhighway of chargers, from Cairns to Coolangatta.",

      "bodyText": "US stock markets continued their wild ride on Friday, ending one of the most volatile weeks in trading since the financial crisis as international stock markets continued to fall, spooked by fears of more rapidly rising interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost more than 1,000 points on Thursday, rose 30 points on Friday morning as the more broadly based S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq also moved into the black only to shortly lose those gains. By noon the Dow was down over 200 points and then rallied to end up over 300 points. Despite the rally, the Dow fell 5% over the week, one of its biggest one-week drops since the recession. World stock markets have dropped sharply from recent record highs over the past week. The rout started last Friday after the latest US jobs report was released. The report indicated stronger-than-expected growth in wages, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise rates in order to head off inflation. In London, the FTSE 100 closed down 1%, while Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC also lost ground. The moves came after falls on the Asian exchanges, with Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 down 2.3% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng down 3.1%. The sell-off extended to oil prices, with US crude futures down $1.98, or 3.24%, at $59.18 a barrel on the New York mercantile exchange. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, said the volatility in financial markets was likely to continue. \u201cThis is typical of a market that has not yet fully corrected,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are seeing here is uncertainty and investors selling into the rallies.\u201d A jump in the yield on 10-year US treasury bonds \u2013 a key indicator of inflationary pressure and the likelihood of higher interest rates \u2013 appears to be a major factor in the latest sell-off. Early on Friday morning Congress signed a $400bn short-term funding bill to keep the US government open and Cardillo said that move too was likely to add to volatility. The general economy remains robust with strong jobs growth and corporate earning. \u201cBut what has changed is that the president has signed a new stopgap bill to reopen government and with that comes a price \u2013 a lot of spending. Markets are fearful that increasing deficits mean a more hawkish Fed.\u201d The deal comes after Donald Trump pushed through an overhaul of the US tax system that is expected to cost $1.5tn. The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates that the new funding deal adds $420bn with interest to the national debt over 10 years and that if it and the tax cuts are extended, the US\u2019s annual deficit is on course to reach $2.1tn by 2027. Marc Goldwein, senior vice-president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the US government was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d. In the near term, he said, it was hard to speculate what drove \u201cevery bump and bounce\u201d in the markets but increasing deficits over the long term were likely to have major ramifications for the stock market and the wider US economy. \u201cThese kinds of debt level are unsustainable,\u201d he said. Stock markets are now 10% down from the highs they reached in late January \u2013 a drop known as a correction. Markets would have to fall another 10% for them to enter a \u201cbear market\u201d where pessimism outweighs optimism in the financial markets.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>World stock markets have dropped sharply from recent record highs over the past week.

      "bodyText": "The parcel company DPD threw an all-expenses paid dinner for hundreds of its managers with entertainment by the comedian Rob Brydon just 24 hours after the funeral of Don Lane, the courier who died after he was charged \u00a3150 because he missed a shift for a medical appointment. Details of the black-tie event in Birmingham last Thursday emerged after days of growing concern at the treatment of Lane, 53, who collapsed twice into diabetic comas while at the wheel of his DPD van in the months before he died. He missed several appointments with kidney specialists partly because he was afraid of being charged \u00a3150 per day by DPD if he could not find cover, his widow Ruth said. Brydon is paid between \u00a325,000 and \u00a335,000 per performance, an industry source said, and with many managers also put up in hotels, the cost of the event is likely to increase concern at the contrast between how DPD treats its employed managers and the self-employed couriers. Ruth Lane said she had not been offered any financial assistance by the company following her husband\u2019s death and said: \u201cThese events are not for the drivers who are making the money. I doubt if they had a minute\u2019s silence for the franchisee who died.\u201d A spokesman for DPD, which made more than \u00a3100m in profits last year, said: \u201cThe annual business conference is one of a number of ways we communicate with our team. We do cover travel and accommodation costs as we are asking staff from across the UK to join us for a full day at the conference, but the budget is carefully controlled.\u201d DPD has launched a wholesale review of its business following Lane\u2019s death, which triggered anger from MPs and trade unions and concern from major customers Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis. The \u00a3150 charges are part of a controversial system that DPD applies to most of its self-employed couriers if they cannot find cover. Dwain McDonald, the chief executive of DPD, said: \u201cDon Lane was incorrectly charged \u00a3150 for not providing services when in fact he was attending a hospital appointment. This was a mistake and we are profoundly sorry. No one should ever be made to feel like they are unable to attend appointments relating to their health. \u201cLike all companies, we need to learn from our mistakes. As a result, we are carrying out an extensive consultation with our depots and drivers as part of a strategic review of our arrangements. When we have completed the consultation and collected all the feedback, we will be making further announcements. \u201cIn the meantime, I can confirm that no franchisee driver will be charged for attending healthcare appointments and I will be ensuring that this is the case.\u201d The business secretary, Greg Clark, described Lane\u2019s death as \u201ca terrible tragedy\u201d on Wednesday, while Downing Street\u2019s adviser on modern work, Matthew Taylor, said it was shocking. DPD is separately facing an employment tribunal claim brought by couriers with the support of the GMB trade union arguing that they are bogusly classed as self-employed and should be treated as workers with rights to holiday pay and the minimum wage. A spokesman for M&amp;S, one of the courier firm\u2019s biggest clients, said earlier this week: \u201cThe circumstances will be raised as part of our ongoing discussions with courier providers.\u201d John Lewis indicated it wanted answers from DPD, which is ultimately owned by GeoPost, part of the French company La Poste. McDonald said: \u201cWe are all devastated by the news of Don Lane\u2019s passing and our thoughts and condolences go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.\u201d The decision to launch a review also follows anger from road safety campaigners after it emerged that McDonald had boasted at a business conference about how he broke the law by driving along the M62 motorway while using his phone to take a photograph of a DPD van.",

      "bodyText": "New electricity cables across the Channel to France and Belgium will be a key part of keeping Britain\u2019s lights on during winter in the early 2020s, after their owners won backup power subsidies in a government auction this week. For the first time, interconnector operators successfully bid for a slice of hundreds of millions\u2019 worth of contracts in the capacity market. That will help cut costs for consumers and squeeze out old coal power plants. Three new interconnectors are currently being built to Europe, almost doubling existing capacity, with one along the Channel Tunnel and two on the seabed: one between Kent and Zeebrugge and one from Hampshire to Normandy. The interconnectors were success stories in this week\u2019s capacity auction, which saw power firms bid to provide backup electricity in the winter of 2021/22. Prices for the four-year contracts hit a record low of \u00a38.40 per kilowatt per year, which analysts described as a shock and well below expectations. One industry source said the figure was \u201cmiles away\u201d from what is needed to encourage companies to build big new gas power stations, which some argue are necessary to fill the gap when the UK\u2019s ageing nuclear reactors close over the next decade. While bad news for those firms, the low price is good for consumers. The subsidies will add about \u00a3525m to energy bills, or \u00a35.68 for the average household, compared with \u00a311 for the year before, according to analysts Cornwall Insight. Existing gas power stations scooped up most of the contracts, but new gas ones lost out, as did several coal plants. Battery storage plants, a standout success in the last auction, fared comparatively poorly after changes to the rules. Experts at Bernstein bank said the the misses by coal meant that around half the UK\u2019s remaining coal power capacity could close from October 2019, when existing capacity market contracts run out. Chaitanya Kumar, policy adviser at thinktank Green Alliance, said: \u201cCoal\u2019s exit from the UK\u2019s energy system just moved a step closer as coal contracts fell by half compared with last year.\u201d Tom Edwards, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said that more interconnectors were likely to bid into future rounds of the capacity market, such as the cable being laid between Norway and the UK. Relying on foreign power supplies was fine, he said, provided Brexit did not make energy trading more difficult and the interconnectors delivered at times of need. However, one industry source, who wants to see new gas plants built in the UK, said the results showed that the system was not working. \u201cThat self-sufficiency doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority at a time when we\u2019re breaking away from Europe is a bit weird,\u201d they said. But the prospects for new gas plants in future rounds of the capacity market look bleak. They will very likely face a new source of competition next year, if energy regulator Ofgem approves a proposal to allow renewables to compete too.",

Have those geniuses in the back offices of investment banks really baffled themselves \u2013 and a lot of investors \u2013 with complexity again? The short answer to the second question is: yes. The chart shows one of the most spectacular blow-ups you could hope to see. This is the XIV \u2013 it is actually the snappier name for the Credit Suisse VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term exchange traded note \u2013 since the start of 2016. It was a beautiful investment until, suddenly, it was a disaster. What is the XIV? It was a way to bet that the S&amp;P 500, the main US stock index, would be tranquil \u2013 in other words suffer few outbreaks of volatility. The measure of volatility is called the VIX and it is compiled and published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange by noting the prices of various option contracts in the market and then applying a mathematical formula. The VIX is more famously known as the \u201cfear index\u201d. In itself, the VIX is just a number \u2013 its long-term average is about 20, more than 30 is a worry, and more than 40 could herald a crisis. For much of last year it was between 10 and 12 but on Tuesday it hit 50, before recoiling back to around 30 currently. The fun starts when products are invented to trade and speculate on how the VIX will perform. Conventional futures contracts came first. Then ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, a low-cost product that has taken the financial world by storm in the last couple of decades, followed. The XIV is slightly different (it\u2019s a note, rather than a fund) but it comes from the same school. By trading S&amp;P 500 options, or contracts to buy and sell the S&amp;P at points in the future, it was structured to do the exact opposite of the VIX. If volatility in the stock market was low \u2013 as it was throughout 2016 and 2017 \u2013 owners of the XIV would do well. In the jargon, they were \u201cshort vol\u201d. But, if volatility exploded, then the XIV would fall. The best that can be said about the product is that it did exactly what it said on the tin: XIV was virtually wiped out with Monday\u2019s 4% market fall in the US. But here\u2019s the intriguing question. Did the sheer weight of \u201cshort vol\u201d bets in the market, via XIV and its imitators, cause the volatility? And, once the selling started, were the pressures intensified because all those \u201cshort vol\u201d positions had to be reversed in a hurry? Was the market feeding on itself? Sandy Rattray, who jointly devised the formula to trade futures contracts tied to the VIX back in 2003, thinks so. He told the FT this week that this wasn\u2019t merely a case of the tail wagging the dog. \u201cWhat happened on Monday was the tail grabbed the dog and gave it a swing around the room,\u201d he said. Rattray is not alone in thinking inverse VIX products, and those that spice up profits and losses by using leverage, are ridiculous. \u201cThey are not liquid and, under stress, do not perform like plain-vanilla ETFs tied to physical securities,\u201d said BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, which refuses to sell them. It agrees that leveraged \u201cshort vol\u201d investment products \u201cmagnified a downdraft\u201d in stock markets. So is this just a story of dumb investors, who should have heeded the many warnings that the stock market wouldn\u2019t stay quiet for ever, getting their comeupance? One worry is that the problems go deeper. A big concern is that the two years of calm in the VIX encouraged investors to believe it was safe to make risky bets in their never-ending search for income. Alex Brazier, the Bank of England\u2019s executive director for financial stability, gave a well-timed speech at the start of this month in which he likened \u201cshort vol\u201d to selling insurance. \u201cIf markets stay stable, as the insurer is betting they will, no payout is made and the insurance collects a premium. If markets stay stable, it\u2019s a nice little earner for the insurer.\u201d But there could be two knock-on effects. First, betting on low volatility could become self-fulfilling as buyers of the insurance contracts hedge their positions in market; that encourages more people to sell insurance. Then, because the world seems less risky, investors take on more risk \u2013 which is the dangerous part. \u201cTaking on more risk because implied volatility is low is the equivalent of ignoring the road conditions and driving faster because your insurance got cheaper as a herd of new entrants flooded the car insurance market,\u201d said Brazier. \u201cWhen accidents start to increase, the whole thing can go into reverse.\u201d Is that what happened this week? It certainly looks to be part of the explanation. A relatively small move in the US bond market, triggered by worries over inflation, created a huge reaction in the stock market. The good news (sort of) is that the drama has been confined so far to share prices. The CDO and ABS blow-ups a decade ago were a similar debacle in mispricing risk but they were so damaging because they caused banking collapses, which inflicted pain on the real economy. With the VIX-related silliness, it could just be a matter of removing the dead speculators from the pitch and getting back to proper work. If those \u201cshort vol\u201d bets only amount to $5bn or so \u2013 as some analysts estimate \u2013 the numbers aren\u2019t big enough to have serious consequences. Are they that small, though? The parallel worry is that the popular, and briefly lucrative, \u201cshort vol\u201d trade has been mirrored in ways yet to be revealed. Has a decade of cheap money provoked other dangerous forms of risk-taking? If central bankers, fretting about inflation again, are raising interest rates, are investors dressed for a change in the financial weather? That debate will rage and may not be settled quickly \u2013 in which case volatility is back.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The best that can be said about the product is that it did exactly what it said on the tin: XIV was virtually wiped out with Monday\u2019s 4% market fall in the US.</p> \n<p>But here\u2019s the intriguing question.

      "bodyText": "The takeover of Ladbrokes Coral by GVC, the Isle of Man-based firm behind Foxy Bingo, could trigger up to 1,600 job losses, the companies said, as they published fresh details of a deal worth up to \u00a33.9bn. Online casino company GVC and bookmaker Ladbrokes said up to 6% of their combined 26,800 workforce \u2013 around 1,608 staff \u2013 could lose their jobs. Most would be in the UK but the cuts are not expected to affect staff until next year The jobs likely to be affected are in areas including marketing, customer services and administrative functions. Ladbrokes\u2019 network of high street bookmakers is not likely to be affected. Ladbrokes Coral\u2019s head office in central London is likely to close, with some of those roles moving to GVC\u2019s head office, also in the capital. The forecast of job cuts came as the two companies outlined the terms of a tie-up worth up to \u00a33.9bn and Ladbrokes handed its shareholders a surprise dividend payout worth \u00a378m. The eventual price tag of the deal to create the UK\u2019s largest public betting firm depends on the government\u2019s review of the maximum permitted stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). GVC\u2019s offer is worth up to \u00a33.9bn, but could fall by \u00a3800m if the government opts to slash the maximum permitted FOBT stake to \u00a32. This is because the machines bring in more than half of bookmakers\u2019 revenues and GVC does not want to pay the top price if a big chunk of Ladbrokes\u2019 income could disappear. More takeovers among gaming firms could follow, with William Hill, online casino 888 and Mecca Bingo firm Rank all potential merger or acquisition candidates. Ladbrokes also posted an update of its recent trading, revealing that revenues rose 12% in the final quarter of the year after a string of unexpected football results.",

He made millions from his fund\u2019s bet on a financial apocalypse. From his office overlooking the Colorado river in Austin, Texas, Cole runs Artemis Capital, a hedge fund that, since 2012, has been betting on a repeat of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. Cole\u2019s Artemis Vega fund, which he started with $1m and has now attracted nearly $350m of investors\u2019 cash, is designed to \u201cgenerate opportunity from chaos\u201d \u2013 and he believes there is far more chaos coming. His bets paid off this week as global stock markets collapsed, rallied and then fell again. Artemis is designed to benefit from such periods of turmoil and volatility. Market volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility index known as Vix or the \u201cfear index\u201d, spiked 84% on Monday \u2013 the biggest one-day increase since the 1990s. It hit 50 on Tuesday and was around 30 on Friday, far higher than it has been for the last two years when it only poked above 15 a couple of times. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good week,\u201d Cole said in a interview with the Guardian. \u201cThe explosion in the Vix and the rise in volatility is something we have been predicting, and waiting for, for a long time. We were well prepared to benefit from it.\u201d Cole was unable to say exactly how many millions his fund has made this week due to regulatory constraints, but he thought his investors would be \u201cvery pleased\u201d. He said Wall Street investors had been calling up all week to congratulate him on calling the market collapse. But Cole reckons that this week\u2019s 1,500 point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d. \u201cThe entire global financial system is an Ouroboros \u2013 a snake eating its own tail,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Stock markets are ending the week on another volatile note. After overnight falls on Wall Street and in Asia, European markets headed lower, although the falls were reduced once US markets opened in positive territory. The FTSE 100 was, for once, not much helped by renewed weakness in sterling. The pound fell back against both the dollar and the euro following comments from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that a transition deal was not a given. On the economic front, there was a mixed picture from the UK\u2019s latest manufacturing, construction and trade figures. But think tank NIESR issued a positive estimate of UK GDP for the three months to January. And in corporate news, Trinity Mirror finally unveiled its long awaited deal to buy rival Northern &amp; Shell, owner of Express Newspapers. On that night, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments and we\u2019ll be back next week. After the latest plunge in US markets drove them into correction territory, Wall Street has got off to a better start, as indicated by the futures earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 310 points (although not all the constituents are trading yet), while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.1%. It may be too early to buy the dips, and more wild swings are possible, sayd Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group: US benchmark share indices falling into correction territory (down over 10% from record highs) has ignited concern the bull market has ended. There has been a spike in volatility, which has resulted in a blow-up in low-volatility strategies and a sharp dive in negatively correlated US index ETFs. The question is whether this is the technical trigger for wider market contagion or just a long overdue \u201chealthy\u201d pullback for an over-extended market. We would make the point that the stock market can deviate massively from economic fundamentals in the short term. Fear of rising bond yields can easily produce a bear market (down 20% from 52-week highs) despite a healthy global economy. In fact, that is usually how it happens because the stock market is a future-discounting mechanism. Another argument for a bigger move lower is that much of what has helped keep the stock market moving higher is momentum, which is now reversing. We would liken the outlook for the US stock market to making a tackle in sports, \u201cthe bigger they are the harder they fall.\u201d A 10% market correction historically happens on average every 18 months, marking it a very \u201cnormal\u201d phenomenon. The key point this time around is that market conditions since 2009 have been very abnormal thanks to unprecedented central bank support. We would interpret these latest market moves as a part of a significant transition. It is most likely a transition to a more \u201cnormal\u201d resumption of the bull market with higher volatility but the risk of it being a swift transition to a bear market should not be underestimated. We maintain, but are more cautious of our year-end forecast of the S&amp;P 500 at 2,900. Right now, there is a \u2018shake out\u2019 taking place as bulls and bears battle for dominance. The Dow Jones has found near term support above 23,000. We suspect more mean reversion will take the Dow below its 200-day moving average near 22,850. In conclusion, it may be a bit early to buy the dip but wild swings, potentially as high as 26,000 will provide ample opportunities for day traders. Here\u2019s a reminder of the falls we\u2019ve seen through the bull market, from analyst Barry Ritholtz: This market fall is a dose of reality after \u201cgreed ran unchecked\u201d, says Mark Dowding, co-head of investment grade at BlueBay Asset Management: The equity market reversal this week, may well serve to be a healthy event. Greed was running unchecked in January and so markets were due a dose of reality, or else the party risked getting out of hand.. this is no bad thing at all and may well serve to make life easier for investors over time. There could be worse to come for the pound following today\u2019s falls, suggests Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: Every single bit of optimism afforded to the pound on the back of Governor Carney\u2019s comments on interest rate increases and upgraded growth and wage forecasts has been lost this morning following the comments from Michel Barnier that the transitional period is \u2018not a given\u2019. For sterling, nothing is more important in the short term than a transitional deal that extends the UK\u2019s membership of the Single Market and Customs Union. The CBI has been vocal on the need for clarity for its members and small and medium sized businesses who we speak to every day have echoed those sentiments. So far, the broad swings in equity and volatility markets that have made headlines this week have not been felt in currency markets but if they do there are a fair many more currencies that would be seen as a \u2018safer\u2019 bet than sterling given the political atmosphere. The market falls appear to be getting worse in Europe, as the Dow futures lose much of their earlier gains. The FTSE 100 is now down 61 points or 0.86%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.7% and France\u2019s Cac 1.6%. The Dow futures are now indicating a 47 point rise at the open, down from nearly 300 points. The pound is coming under pressure on the latest Brexit developments. A post-Brexit transition deal is not a given, according to the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier after the latest set of talks. He said Britain had raised substantial issues with the EU\u2019s proposal, and said some of the EU positions were not negotiable. He said: If these differences persist, a transition is not a given. If these disagreements were to persist there would undoubtedly be a problem. I hope we will be able to resolve these disagreements in the next round. The sooner the UK makes its choices, the better. The news has sent the pound down 0.63% against the euro to \u20ac1.1279, while against the dollar sterling is 0.78% lower at \u00a21.3803. But economies and markets do not necessarily go hand in hand, says Justin Urquart-Stewart of Seven Investment Management: The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to January, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The think tank said this was the same as the official figures for the final quarter of 2017. Up until now surveys had suggested a slowdown at the start of the year. NIESR expects UK GDP to grow by 1.9% this year and next, but warned there would be a marked slowdown if Brexit talks failed. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said: We estimate that economic growth was steady at 0.5 per cent in the 3 months to January. Activity picked up in the second half of 2017 after a period of subdued growth in the first half of the year. The recovery was driven by both the manufacturing and the service sectors, supported by a buoyant global economy, while construction output continued to lag. We are forecasting GDP growth of close to 2 per cent this year assuming a soft Brexit scenario. At this speed the economy could start to overheat unless the Bank of England withdraws some of the stimulus that it has injected by raising the policy rate. Our forecast assumes a 25 basis point increase in May and then every 6 months until Bank Rate reaches 2 per cent by mid-2021. If instead, Brexit talks fail, the UK economy will in our view suffer a marked slowdown with damaging longer term consequences. The Dow futures are off their best but are still indicating a higher open on Wall Street after the latest plunge. But the futures have not been the best guide to what happens. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: US futures are trading slightly in the green ahead of the open on Friday, a day after stock markets once again tumbled leaving indices in correction territory. As we saw on Thursday, this isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of calm returning to the markets. The Dow recorded declines of more than 1,000 points for the second time this week, having never done so before, despite futures prior to the open being relatively unchanged on the previous days close. Clearly there remains a lot of volatility and nervousness in the markets and I don\u2019t expect this to ease up heading into the weekend. Stock markets will likely remain vulnerable to further shocks heading into today\u2019s close and possible even next week. That said, with a 10% correction having now completed, I wonder whether investors will now start looking to buy the dips as the fundamental backdrop remains strong. A positive move is that the US Congress has passed a funding bill which will avoid a government shutdown, but Erlam is not convinced this will have much impact on shares: Markets haven\u2019t been too concerned about the prospect of a shutdown since the start of the year despite two having now taken place so I don\u2019t expect to see any boost now that a deal has been reached. This is merely just another self-inflicted risk that\u2019s been temporarily averted. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent seems relatively relaxed about the recent stock market falls. In his tour of BBC studios, he told the Today programme: Equity markets go up and down, you have a correction of this size roughly every 18 months on average, so it\u2019s not terrifically unusual....If you\u2019re suggesting that this is somehow parallel to what happened in 2007, then I would say no. I think there are some very big differences and as I pointed out, the equity markets, particularly in the US, have risen a lot over the last 12 months and indeed, even today, we are roughly back where we were a couple of months ago. (That may be true of Wall Street, but not the FTSE 100 according to the charts.....) Here\u2019s a useful chart of the UK trade figures: European markets remain fairly calm, although of course that may all change once Wall Street reopens. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European stocks are lower this morning, but are holding up relatively well when you consider the magnitude of the declines in Asia overnight and in the US last night. Investor are clearly nervous in this part of the world, and there are still concerns things could turn sour again. The erratic moves that have taken place in the US are unsettling investors here, and the sentiment in Europe could change when trading in New York resumes. Here\u2019s the British Chambers of Commerce on the day\u2019s UK data. Its head of economics Suren Thiru said: The sharp deterioration in the UK\u2019s net trade position in December was disappointing and means that trade is likely to have been a drag on UK growth in the final quarter of the year. This deterioration reflects a significant increase in imports in the quarter, more than offsetting the rise in exports. Although there was a surprise pick-up in construction output, the sector remains a concern and together with the widening in the UK\u2019s trade deficit and weakening industrial output indicates that economic conditions are becoming more sluggish. While many exporters are benefiting from stronger growth in key trading markets, imports continue to grow at a solid pace with businesses continuing to report little in the way of import substitution despite their high cost. If this trend continues as we expect, the contribution of net trade to UK GDP growth over the near term is likely to be limited at best. As we move through the Brexit process more needs to be done to provide clarity on what the future trading relationship with the EU will look like. Action is also needed to address the longstanding issues, from the UK\u2019s skills gap to our creaking digital and physical infrastructure, that continue to undermine the UK\u2019s trade performance. The UK data has been little help to the pound: Back with the UK data, and economist James Knightley at ING Bank says the latest figures suggest fourth quarter growth could be revised downwards: Softer December trade and production data coupled with downward revisions suggest the potential for fourth quarter GDP growth to be revised down to 0.4% quarter on quarter [from 0.5%] UK industrial production fell 1.3% month on month in December, worse than the 0.9% consensus while there was a 0.1 percentage point downward revision to November. The December softness relates to the shutdown of the North Sea Forties pipeline for unplanned maintenance (oil and gas output fell 24.2% month on month) and should rebound in January, but it does suggest the risk of a very modest downward revision to fourth quarter GDP. Manufacturing rose 0.3% month on month, in line with expectations, while November was revised down two-tenths of a percentage point to 0.2% growth. There was also disappointment in the December trade balance. It showed a deficit of \u00a34.9bn [for total goods and services] \u2013 the worst reading since September 2016, which is a pretty poor story given the competitiveness boost sterling\u2019s big declines should have provided and the stronger economic activity data we have seen globally. Today\u2019s data reinforces the message that the UK continues to underperform other developed market economies, growing at around half the rate of the US and the Eurozone. As such, while the Bank of England is clearly hinting at the potential for a May rate hike, we remain cautious on the longer term path for rates, particularly given the Brexit related uncertainty. The latest GDP estimates from the NIESR think tank are due around lunchtime. Here\u2019s the latest view from Chris Iggo, chief investment officer fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, on the current markets: Volatility is back and those that bet on it never coming back have had a tough week. Why is it back? It\u2019s back because the macro fundamentals are evolving in a way that many of us have expected but some have denied. Growth is strong, inflation is not dead and interest rates are rising. This is spooking the bond market and the bond market spooks everyone else. The veracity of the moves in equities are explained by the existence of structured trades, algorithms and leverage, but the reason that valuations are being challenged is because the discount rate is rising and is not going back down any time soon. Bond investors might start to be tempted to buy US Treasuries as we approach a 3% yield but the cat is out of the bag \u2013 we are in a higher yield environment than we have been for the last three years and that is a bit of a problem \u2013 not a terminal problem \u2013 but a bit of a problem for equities. Back to the markets and the subdued performance so far in Europe despite the hefty falls on Wall Street and in Asia. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta said: A renewed, deep, sell off on Wall Street and in Asia overnight ensured a heavy drop was on the cards for European bourses this morning.... Interestingly the selloff in Europe is less exaggerated than that in the US and that is because in Europe we continue to see dividend yields outpacing government debt yields. Meanwhile that dynamic is reversing at a rapid rate in the US which is not working in the favour of US equities despite solid economic data and a strong earnings outlook. There has just been a spate of UK economic data, and it\u2019s a mixed picture. Industrial production fell sharply in December, hit by a shutdown of the Forties north sea oil pipeline. After a 0.4% month on month rise in November, it fell 1.3% the following month, worse than the 0.9% decline expected. But manufacturing output was in line with forecasts, up 0.3% month on month. The year on year rise of 1.4% was the weakest since April 2017. But there was a better than expected performance from the key construction sector, with output up 1.6% month on month compared for forecasts of a flat performance. To complete picture, the trade deficit was also higher than expected. The goods trade balance came in at -\u00a313.576bn in December, up from the -\u00a311.6bn expected and the biggest deficit since September 2016. The Dow futures are still indicating a positive start for US markets. But US bond yields are on the rise again, which could throw a spanner in the works: At the risk of tempting fate, it seems a little bit calmer in the markets so far. The FTSE 100\u2019s decline is hovering at around 32 points or 0.4%, while there are similar dips on the German and French markets. The mood is probably being helped by the futures market suggesting an opening bounce on the Dow Jones Industrial Average of up to 270 points after yesterday\u2019s slump. But it is early days yet, and in such volatile markets it is dangerous to take anything for granted. More on the BBC interview with the Bank of England\u2019s Ben Broadbent. He said the low level of interest rates reflected global factors and said there was no fixed path for tightening policy: But nor do I think if there were to be a couple of 25 basis point rises in a year, that that would somehow be a great shock. Reuters has a report here. And another big gainer. Hogg Robinson shares have surged 50% to 117p after the business travel group received a 120p a share or near \u00a3400m takeover offer from American Express. At the same time it has agreed to sell its payments technology business to Visa. News of the deals has sent its shares up nearly 50% to 116p. One company to buck the downward trend is Trinity Mirror. Its shares have climbed 10% following news that it has finally completed the long-awaited takeover of rival Northern &amp; Shell, owner of Express newspapers. Our report on the deal is here: As expected, the sell-off on Wall Street and in Asia has spilled over into Europe, but so far there has not been a dramatic decline. The FTSE 100 is down around 30 points or 0.4% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 0.1%, France\u2019s Cac is 0.2% lower and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has fallen 0.57%. Tony Blair\u2019s old theme song \u201cThings can only get better\u201d seems to have been taken up by the Bank of England\u2019s Ben Broadbent. On Thursday the Bank hinted strongly that interest rate rises were on the way, sooner perhaps than people expected. This of course fed into the markets\u2019 current concerns about dearer borrowing costs and the withdrawal of central bank stimulus. Today Broadbent has told the BBC\u2019s Wake up to Money that the worst of the squeeze on real wages was over and the economy is improving: The worst of the squeeze was about a year ago and if you look at what happened to real household incomes during the second half of last year they were flat, and if you ask me what\u2019s happening right now in the first quarter, they are starting to rise. The squeeze from that depreciation is coming off, the path from higher important prices is probably at its peak and we are starting to see wage growth improve. So things will get better from that point of view. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a grim start to the day weatherwise in London and it looks like its going to be a grim start for European stock markets, as the sell-off which began in earnest a week or so ago looks set to continue. If you\u2019re just joining us, Wall Street and Asian markets suffered renewed falls as the concerns about rising interest rates continues to spook investors. With signs of inflation returning, central banks are increasingly withdrawing the measures - low interest rates, quantitative easing - which have been supporting markets since the financial crisis. And markets do not like it. The sell-off has been exacerbated by the growing prevalence of program trades which exaggerate market moves, and a number of bets on the volatility index staying low which have gone wrong. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second-biggest one-day points fall, down 1,032.89, while the S&amp;P 500 hit correction territory, ie a 10% decline from its recent peak. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index lost 2.32% while the turmoil spilled over into China, with the Shanghai Composite closing down 4.1% in one of its worst days for two years. Positive economic data and hints from the Bank of England that interest rates could rise in May put pressure on bond prices, and in turn equities. Here\u2019s our overnight blog giving all the developments: And our latest markets story: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: It would appear that the brief respite for stocks seen in the middle of the week turned out to be the eye of the storm as once again rising bond yields prompted a further bout of selling across the board, not only in the US last night but in Asia again this morning. Concerns about rising interest rates weren\u2019t helped by an unexpectedly hawkish inflation report from the Bank of England yesterday, while the latest Chinese trade data suggested that the Chinese economy appeared to be ticking along nicely, even if the trade surplus did shrink quite sharply as a result of a big jump in imports. US weekly jobless claims also dropped sharply to 221k, once again reinforcing the tightness of the US labour market which in turn could well put further upward pressure on wages in the months ahead. As a result US bond yields started edging higher again with the 10 year yield once again looking to retest the 2.9% level and a four year high, with the 3% level now a very realistic probability. A US government shutdown which started at midnight isn\u2019t helping sentiment either. While this continued optimism about how the US economy is likely to perform is a good thing, for US stocks whose valuations are still at elevated levels, they may not be particularly good news given that yield differentials are no longer working in their favour, unlike in Europe where dividend yields are still higher than the yields on government debt. This may help explain why the Dow and S&amp;P500 once again closed sharply lower again, with the Dow losing over 1,000 points, and in the process closing in correction territory, while the VIX once again popped higher. As a result of last night\u2019s sell-off in the US, and this morning\u2019s weakness in Asia, European markets look set to follow suit this morning and open lower, while the Nikkei 225 also slid into correction territory as it tested its long term 200 day moving average. So here are the opening calls for Europe from IG: Almost incidentally there are a few bits of economic data due, including UK trade and industrial production figures.

There has been a spike in volatility, which has resulted in a blow-up in low-volatility strategies and a sharp dive in negatively correlated US index ETFs. The question is whether this is the technical trigger for wider market contagion or just a long overdue \u201chealthy\u201d pullback for an over-extended market.</p> <p>We would make the point that the stock market can deviate massively from economic fundamentals in the short term. Fear of rising bond yields can easily produce a bear market (down 20% from 52-week highs) despite a healthy global economy. In fact, that is usually how it happens because the stock market is a future-discounting mechanism. Another argument for a bigger move lower is that much of what has helped keep the stock market moving higher is momentum, which is now reversing. We would liken the outlook for the US stock market to making a tackle in sports, \u201cthe bigger they are the harder they fall.\u201d</p> <p>A 10% market correction historically happens on average every 18 months, marking it a very \u201cnormal\u201d phenomenon. The key point this time around is that market conditions since 2009 have been very abnormal thanks to unprecedented central bank support. We would interpret these latest market moves as a part of a significant transition. It is most likely a transition to a more \u201cnormal\u201d resumption of the bull market with higher volatility but the risk of it being a swift transition to a bear market should not be underestimated. We maintain, but are more cautious of our year-end forecast of the S&amp;P 500 at 2,900.</p> <p>Right now, there is a \u2018shake out\u2019 taking place as bulls and bears battle for dominance. The Dow Jones has found near term support above 23,000. We suspect more mean reversion will take the Dow below its 200-day moving average near 22,850. In conclusion, it may be a bit early to buy the dip but wild swings, potentially as high as 26,000 will provide ample opportunities for day traders.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7da62be4b0365be5168a8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-09T13:47:11.890Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a reminder of the falls we\u2019ve seen through the bull market, from analyst Barry Ritholtz:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ritholtz/status/961932705502871553\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Memory is famously short during bull markets.

Stock markets will likely remain vulnerable to further shocks heading into today\u2019s close and possible even next week. That said, with a 10% correction having now completed, I wonder whether investors will now start looking to buy the dips as the fundamental backdrop remains strong.</p> </blockquote> <p>A positive move is that the US Congress has passed a funding bill which will avoid a government shutdown, but Erlam is not convinced this will have much impact on shares: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Markets haven\u2019t been too concerned about the prospect of a shutdown since the start of the year despite two having now taken place so I don\u2019t expect to see any boost now that a deal has been reached.

This deterioration reflects a significant increase in imports in the quarter, more than offsetting the rise in exports.</p> <p>Although there was a surprise pick-up in construction output, the sector remains a concern and together with the widening in the UK\u2019s trade deficit and weakening industrial output indicates that economic conditions are becoming more sluggish. While many exporters are benefiting from stronger growth in key trading markets, imports continue to grow at a solid pace with businesses continuing to report little in the way of import substitution despite their high cost. If this trend continues as we expect, the contribution of net trade to UK GDP growth over the near term is likely to be limited at best.</p> <p>As we move through the Brexit process more needs to be done to provide clarity on what the future trading relationship with the EU will look like.

It showed a deficit of \u00a34.9bn [for total goods and services] \u2013 the worst reading since September 2016, which is a pretty poor story given the competitiveness boost sterling\u2019s big declines should have provided and the stronger economic activity data we have seen globally. </p> <p>Today\u2019s data reinforces the message that the UK continues to underperform other developed market economies, growing at around half the rate of the US and the Eurozone.

A US government shutdown which started at midnight isn\u2019t helping sentiment either. </p> <p>While this continued optimism about how the US economy is likely to perform is a good thing, for US stocks whose valuations are still at elevated levels, they may not be particularly good news given that yield differentials are no longer working in their favour, unlike in Europe where dividend yields are still higher than the yields on government debt. </p> <p>This may help explain why the Dow and S&amp;P500 once again closed sharply lower again, with the Dow losing over 1,000 points, and in the process closing in correction territory, while the VIX once again popped higher. </p> <p>As a result of last night\u2019s sell-off in the US, and this morning\u2019s weakness in Asia, European markets look set to follow suit this morning and open lower, while the Nikkei 225 also slid into correction territory as it tested its long term 200 day moving average. </p> </blockquote> <p>So here are the opening calls for Europe from IG:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/961850031631249408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7126 -0.62%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 12236 -0.20%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5143 -0.17%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 22461 -0.03%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 9707 -0.51%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/961850031631249408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 9, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Almost incidentally there are a few bits of economic data due, including UK trade and industrial production figures.</p> <p><strong>Agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.30 GMT: UK industrial production</p> <p>9.30 GMT: UK trade figures</p> <p>9.30 GMT UK construction output</p> <p>12.00 GMT: NIESR economic growth forecast</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-09T08:40:23.695Z\">at 8.40am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s trade position with the rest of the world worsened in December as rising global oil prices pushed up the cost of importing fuel, while the continuing weak pound failed to lift sales of UK-made goods abroad. The difference between the total value of goods and services imported to Britain and sold overseas widened by \u00a31.2bn from November to \u00a34.9bn in December, according to the Office for National Statistics. While there was an increase in goods export volumes, it came at less than half the pace of imports. The latest trade figures should temper hopes that the economy is rebalancing away from domestic consumption by shoppers on the high street and shifting towards greater levels of global trade and exports. They are also likely to disappoint ministers seeking to expand trade with the rest of the world as Britain leaves the EU. The monthly trade deficit was the worst reading since September 2016, and was labelled by City analysts as \u201cpretty poor\u201d given that exporters should have benefited from the lower level of the pound since the Brexit vote and rebounding global economic growth. The increase in the trade deficit came amid an increase in imports from non-EU countries at a faster rate than exports. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: \u201cThe UK continues to underperform other developed market economies, growing at around half the rate of the US and the eurozone.\u201d An increase in fuel imports and lower levels of fuel exports were the main culprit in pushing up the trade deficit in the final three months of 2017, made worse by the rising oil price, which has driven up the cost of importing crude to Britain. The weaker month for trade will probably have acted as a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter, with economists reckoning the net trade position with the rest of the world could subtract about 0.5 percentage points from GDP growth \u2013 after having made a neutral contribution over the first three quarters of the year. The initial estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter from the ONS was for the fastest pace of expansion in 2017 at 0.5%, though economists now say that could be revised down. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said British manufacturers were not getting as much of the benefit from the drop in sterling because they source their raw materials from elsewhere around the world \u2013 with the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum having pushed up these costs. He said this was \u201coffsetting virtually all of the competitiveness boost from the depreciation\u201d. The disappointing figures come after the Bank of England sounded a more positive note over the health of the British economy on Thursday, hinting that interest rates would need to rise as early as May to counter inflation that is expected to pick up as the economy begins to overheat. Threadneedle Street reckons the speed limit of the economy has slowed since the Brexit vote, meaning much lower growth rates are still likely to cause rising inflation. Separate figures on industrial production from the ONS showed the fastest slowdown in December since 2012, due to the shutdown of the Forties pipeline in the North Sea, which carries oil to the Scottish mainland at Kinneil, near Grangemouth. The pipeline was shut in mid-December for three weeks after the discovery of a crack. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimates the pace of economic growth held steady at 0.5% in the three months to the end of January from the level seen in the final quarter of 2017. NIESR said Britain\u2019s manufacturing and services sectors were being supported by the buoyant global economy.",

      "bodyText": "So who has bought what? Trinity Mirror owns the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People national newspapers, the Sunday Mail and Daily Record in Scotland, and more than 100 regional titles including the Manchester Evening News and Birmingham Post. It has now forked out \u00a3200m in a deal for Richard Desmond\u2019s publishing assets, which include the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star, Daily Star Sunday, the magazines OK!, New! and Star, plus the Irish Daily Star. Why has this deal been done? Digital-savvy readers are turning away from printed newspapers, which still provide most revenues for publishers from paper sales and advertising. The shift to digital has proved to be exceptionally difficult as Facebook and Google hoover up the vast majority of online advertising revenue. Trinity Mirror wants to grow bigger to give it the scale to drive revenues from traditional newspaper operations, and to better fight for digital advertising against the Silicon Valley rivals. \u201cThe background to this deal is a recognition of the need for consolidation in our industry and the vision for creating and sustaining a stronger newspaper group,\u201d Desmond told staff in an email. Will Labour-backing Mirror titles meddle with the Brexit-backing Express stable? No. At least not according to Simon Fox, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, who said: \u201cThe Mirror is not going to go rightwing and the Express is not going to go leftwing. They will absolutely all have editorial independence\u201d. Really? Surely such deals aim to cut costs by merging operations? Trinity Mirror has said the takeover will lead to \u00a320m in annual savings, which means job cuts and the pooling of resources. Fox said that while certain areas will be sacrosanct, such as political writers, others such as sport will be subject to merger. One pool of writers will provide content for all five national newspapers. So what happens next? The competition regulator will scrutinise a deal of this size, which will give the enlarged Trinity Mirror group control of 24% of UK national newspaper sales. It may look to implement an initial enforcement order (IEO) to stop the two publishers integrating operations for a period of time while it looks at the deal. The culture secretary also has the option of intervening if there is considered to be a public interest issue such as media plurality. Trinity Mirror shareholders also have to approve the deal. Is this the end of Desmond\u2019s time as a media mogul? Pretty much, yes. Part of the deal will see him become Trinity Mirror\u2019s third-largest shareholder, but the sale will end his 44 years as a publisher, as he refocuses on property development. In his 18 years as owner of Express Newspapers, Desmond has made almost \u00a3450m in pay, dividends, rent, and the proceeds of the Trinity Mirror deal. He bought the papers for \u00a3125m in 2000.",

      "bodyText": "Eurostar direct rail services between London and Amsterdam will begin on 4 April, the company has announced, in an eagerly awaited move expected to spark a price war with airlines. Tickets for the two daily trains \u2013 starting from \u00a335 one way \u2013 will go on sale on 20 February. The services will allow passengers to travel from St Pancras station in central London direct to the Netherlands in three to four hours. More than 4 million passengers a year fly between London and Amsterdam, making it one of Europe\u2019s busiest air routes as the Netherlands grows in popularity as a key business and tourism hub. The cross-Channel rail operator is set to challenge established airlines on the route, including British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair. It will target potential converts by saying a London-Amsterdam Eurostar journey emits 80% less carbon than the equivalent flight. Plans for the service were first announced in September 2013 but the official start date has been subject to numerous delays while immigration and passport controls were agreed. These issues mean direct services returning to London will not be in place until the end of next year. Passengers travelling from Amsterdam and Rotterdam will have to connect through Brussels for passport controls and security screening until the two governments complete an agreement allowing passport checks to be conducted in the Netherlands. Nicolas Petrovic, the outgoing chief executive of Eurostar, said the Netherlands service heralded a new era in international high-speed rail. \u201cWith direct services from the UK to the Netherlands, France and Belgium, we are transforming the links between the UK and three of Europe\u2019s top trading nations.\u201d The launch follows the completion of testing on the Dutch high-speed network and construction of Eurostar terminals in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The journey time will be 3hr 01min between London and Rotterdam and 3hr 41min between London and Amsterdam. New e320 trains, which have been operating between London and Paris since 2015, will be used on the route as their technology is compatible with the Dutch railway system.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owner of the Mirror newspaper group has sealed a \u00a3200m deal with Richard Desmond to buy his Express and Star national titles, as well as the celebrity magazine OK! Trinity Mirror, the publisher of the Labour-supporting Daily and Sunday Mirror as well as the Sunday People, has paid \u00a3126.7m for Desmond\u2019s Brexit-supporting titles. The company has also agreed to invest \u00a370.4m in staff pension schemes through to 2027. The company\u2019s share price surged nearly 15% in early trading, with investors buoyed by the financial benefits and cost saving opportunities of one of the most significant mergers among British national newspapers in decades. Simon Fox, the chief executive of Trinity Mirror, said the five national newspapers would remain editorially independent. \u201cThe Mirror is not going to go right-wing and the Express is not going to go leftwing,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThey will absolutely all have editorial independence. Decisions on what goes into each title will be entirely down to the editors.\u201d However, Trinity Mirror wants to make \u00a320m in annual savings, with \u00a39.3m from \u201ccontent generation\u201d. This will mean job cuts, the pooling of some editorial resources and considering the viability of magazines such as New and Star. Fox gave the example of creating a single sports team to serve all the papers, although in areas such as politics the teams would remain separate. \u201cRather than sending many reporters to cover the same football games, we can cover more games, more sports and offer deeper and wider content,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it will be down to the editors as to what content they want to use.\u201d Canary Wharf-based Trinity Mirror does not have the capacity for the estimated 900 new staff (about 350 editorial) in its offices, and has agreed a 10-year lease, with a five-year break clause, to continue to use part of Northern &amp; Shell\u2019s Lower Thames Street offices. Fox said no decisions had been made about the movement of staff between the sites. He added that he did not expect the enlarged group to run foul of the competition regulator. Fox said the combined circulation of Trinity Mirror\u2019s national titles would still be less than that of the Sun, and similarly they would not control too much of the national newspaper ad market. Enders Analysis says that the Competition Markets Authority will scrutinise the deal. As part of the deal, Desmond will receive 25m Trinity Mirror shares, worth about \u00a320m, giving him a 9.4% stake and making him the third-largest shareholder. Desmond is known for his outspoken views, but Fox said he did not expect any problems. \u201cI have no reason to believe he will be anything other than a supportive shareholder,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want a seat on the board, none of our shareholders have one \u2026 He wants skin in the game and believes very much in the group.\u201d The deal marks the end of the billionaire\u2019s 43-year publishing career, which he acknowledged in an internal email announcing the deal to staff. Desmond said he remained a \u201cgreat believer\u201d in the titles and that Trinity Mirror was the \u201cperfect home to make the most of their potential\u201d. Under the deal, Desmond, who still owns businesses including the Health Lottery, has agreed to spend \u00a332m over the next five years on advertising in Trinity Mirror titles. As the owner of Northern &amp; Shell, Desmond will pocket most of the \u00a3106.7m cash portion of the deal. Desmond started in publishing in 1974, aged 23, with two music titles. In 1983, he won the UK licence to publish Penthouse and then several other pornographic titles, including Horny Housewives. The launch of OK! in 1993 shook up the celebrity magazine world. In 2000, Desmond bought Express Newspapers for \u00a3125m. Trinity Mirror, which owns a large regional newspaper portfolio including the Manchester Evening News and Birmingham Post, employs more than 5,300 staff. About 2,200 are in editorial; 700 on the national titles and 1,500 on the regionals. The deal still needs approval from Trinity Mirror shareholders, who will vote on it in the next two weeks. Newspaper circulations for Trinity Mirror and Northern &amp; Shell\u2019s national titles in December, according to ABC\u2019s monthly newsbrands report: Daily Mirror 581,877 Sunday Mirror 493,069 Sunday People 191,188 Daily Express 364,933 Sunday Express 317,893 Daily Star 391,509 Daily Star Sunday 239,853",

Investors in Asia were spooked after a big drop in the Dow Heavy losses across Asia Pacific, notably in Tokyo and Shanghai FTSE100 set open down 0.24%; the Dax in Germany up 0.2% Weak inflation numbers and overseas selling heaped pressure on Chinese bourses The Vix fear index hit 33.46, creating \u2018uncertainty\u2019 for traders Veteran US investor Jim Rogers says the next bear market will be the \u2018worst ever\u2019 Sentiment also crimped by another US government shutdown Those numbers in full: Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.32% (close) Hang Seng: DOWN 3.2% ASX200, Sydney: DOWN 0.91% (close) Shanghai Composite: DOWN 4.1% (close) Kospi, South Korea: DOWN 1.82% (close) FTSE100: DOWN 1.5% at 7,170.69 (close) Dow Jones: DOWN 4.2% at 23,860.46 (close) S&amp;P 500: DOWN 3.8% at 2,581.00 (close) Nasdaq: DOWN 3.9% at 6,777.16 (close) Pound/dollar: UP at $1.394 from $1.3912 Brent crude: DOWN 46 cents at $64.35 per barrel I\u2019m off now \u2013 thanks for joining me for the day. My colleague in London, Nick Fletcher, has started a new blog here, so you don\u2019t have to miss any of the action as European markets grind into gear. The Chinese market has had one of its worst days for two years. the leading Shanghai Composite index has fallen 4.1%. At one point it was down nearly 6%. Today\u2019s sell-off coincided with lower than expected inflation numbers, suggesting that the world\u2019s second biggest economy is slowing down after a strong 2017. Sentiments mentioned earlier about volatility are echoed by another market watcher, David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney. He said the markets were \u201cskittish\u201d and said the Bank of England governor\u2019s comments on Thursday that rates might have to rise again may have influenced Wall Street, however unusual that situation might be. David says: What\u2019s amazing is that the overnight sell-off came off the back of relatively little new fundamental news, and highlights the continued skittishness of market sentiment and hyped up concern with regard to bond yields. Indeed, it\u2019s not often the Wall Street sells off 4% due to an apparent tightening bias announced by the Bank of England! As we\u2019ve said, China has been hit hard for the first time in this sell-off. Analysts have been discussing why this might have happened. Yang Weixiao, an analyst with Founder Securities, told Reuters that it was possible foreign investors were having an impact for the first time by selling up in the wake of the broader global dumping. The Shanghai Composite could drop another 15-16% to 2,600 points from its current mark at around 3,100. Yang says: We could see impact from the foreign participation that has become a more significant force in the A-share market, as a global selloff could prompt foreign investors to dump stocks in China. Investors will be very cautious for the moment, and we expect the Shanghai index to drop to 3,000 points, or even further to 2,600 points. Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale in Hong Kong, said Chinese shares slid mostly because of the US correction but he had some China-specific worries. He said he now is neutral on China equities \u201cdue to two concerns: valuations on China-consumer related industries and execution risks on deleveraging\u201d. And here\u2019s Daniel again on the Tokyo close: Here in Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index has finished trading for the day. It closed down 2.32% at 21,382.62 points. That marks a slight improvement from morning trade when it had sunk as low as 3.5%. For a full wrap of the overnight events, my colleague in Tokyo, Daniel Hurst, has just filed this story: If you\u2019re just waking up in Europe here is a ready reckoner on the overnight market moves. There has been a big sell-off in Asia, with the Chinese mainland hit the hardest. The Shanghai Composite index is down nearly 5%. The Nikkei in Tokyo is off 3%. Australia\u2019s benchmark ASX200 index closed down 0.91%. The FTSE100 is seen opening down around 0.5% while the pound has risen slightly against the US dollar. Veteran US investor Jim Rogers thinks the next bear market will be worst he\u2019s ever seen Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.95% Hang Seng: DOWN 3.3% ASX200, Sydney: DOWN 0.91% (close) Shanghai Composite: DOWN 4.93% Kospi, South Korea: DOWN 1.82% FTSE100: DOWN 1.5% at 7,170.69 (close) Dow Jones: DOWN 4.2% at 23,860.46 (close) New York - S&amp;P 500: DOWN 3.8% at 2,581.00 (close) New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 3.9% at 6,777.16 (close) Pound/dollar: UP at $1.394 from $1.3912 Oil - Brent: DOWN 46 cents at $64.35 per barrel It\u2019s stumps on the Australian market where the AsX200 has lost 0.91%, or 53.7 points to stand at 5,837 points. That\u2019s around $20bn in value. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at the online trader IG in Melbourne, says volatility is the enemy in the markets at the moment. The Vix volatility index \u2013 also known as the \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 has spiked sharply this year and created uncertainty loathed by investors. Chris told the blog: The Vix volatility index is trading above 30% and that means there is no confidence about going out and filling your boots with stocks. You could wake up and the Dow is down another 1,000 points, or it could be up. There\u2019s no certainty. Markets like certainty but the only certainty at the minute is of a big move but that could be up or down. The fiasco that is the US federal budget process has produced another government shutdown. Funding for the government machine will lapse at midnight US eastern time tonight (that\u2019s in about 25 minutes) after Republican Senator Rand Paul stalled a key vote. Read the full story here: Having said that we shouldn\u2019t get carried away, let\u2019s just get carried away again. Jim Rogers, the veteran US stock picker, reckons that the next bear market will be the worst he\u2019s ever known. The reason he feels so pessimistic is that there\u2019s so much debt around. While a lot of experts talk up the strong fundamentals in the global economy, he says a lot of the upside has been built on debt. He told Bloomberg: When we have a bear market again, and we are going to have a bear market again, it will be the worst in our lifetime. Debt is everywhere, and it\u2019s much, much higher now. He thinks the selling will go on until the Fed raises rates in March. I\u2019m very bad in market timing. But maybe there will be continued sloppiness until March when they raise interest rates, and it looks like the market will rally. Things have eased slightly since this tweet. For example, the Shanghai Comp is now off only 4.11%. But you\u2019ve got to love the redness. Before we get carried away with doom and gloom, this chart from Commsec is quite good. It shows the trajectory of US and Australian stocks since Trump was elected. Indexed to 100 from November 2016, you can see that the Dow Jones had added almost 50% in the 14 months or so up to last week. That is an enormous rise, so even if the current spate of selling continues there is still clearly a lot of froth to wipe off the top, as it were. There are quite a few theories about what has sparked the latest selling. We know that last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs and wages figures strengthened the feeling that inflation was on the up and that interest rate rises would not be far behind. That had been prefigured, it must be said, by the weeks-long rise in US bond yields which pointed to higher long-term rates. This is a good roundup on those factors. However, there are also human factors at large. Earlier today Craig James, chief economist at Commsec in Sydney, told ABC radio that profit-taking \u2013 where investors see the dip and think that they may as well cash in some recent gains \u2013 was one reason for the renewed selling. Doug Cote, meanwhile, who is chief market strategist at the US firm Voya Investment Management, told Bloomberg News that some traders had been caught out by the prospect of up to four rate hikes by the US Federal reserve this year. He even used the \u201cp\u201d word. \u201cThere\u2019s some big-money players that have really leveraged to the low rates forever, and they have to unwind those trades. They could be in full panic mode right now. The sell-off is intensifying around Asia. The Nikkei closed for the lunch break down 3.22%, or more than 700 points. But the biggest hit is in China where the Shanghai Compsoite has taken a real battering, losing 5.6% so far. The biggest comapnies have suffered most. The Hang Seng is off 4.25% and Seoul 2.16%. Back to Australia. Earlier we heard from Michael McCarthy at CMC markets who said that traders wouldn\u2019t pay much heed to local data today and would instead be driven by the moves on Wall Street. I think we can assume, though, that the local news would not have had an upward effect on the markets either as mortgage approvals missed expectations by quite a long chalk. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the number of home loan approvals for owner occupiers fell 2.3% in December, short of forecasts for a decline of 1.0%. The value of total housing finance also fell by 1.6 per cent to $32.88bn. The value of new mortgages for owner-occupiers was down 1.0% compared with November, while investor loans were off 2.6%. Time for roundup of the stock market moves in Asia Pacific today: Nikkei - DOWN 2.64% ASX200 - DOWN 1.16% Kospi (Seoul) - DOWN 1.58% Hang Seng - DOWN 2.64% Shanghai Composite - DOWN 2.68% Talking of China, we haven\u2019t heard much from there during this mini-market meltdown. Back in the northern summer of 2015 a devaluation of the yuan triggered all sorts of mayhem on global markets. You might remember it. Things are much calmer on that front and in fact the yuan has been moving steadily upwards ever since that crisis eventually cooled in January 2016. Back then, investors were having kittens as the yuan hit nearly 7 to the US dollar and the talk was of currency manipulation to make Chinese exports cheaper. A certain US presidential candidate made a lot of the issue. The yuan has since appreciated to 6.3, confounding Trump\u2019s rhetoric, but yesterday it actually had its biggest one-day fall since August 2015. Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note earlier today that the drop possibly reflects discomfort in Beijing about the continued strength of the currency. The People\u2019s Bank has ways of influencing the unit,including capital controls and using the state press to talk it down a bit. As Mark wryly observes at the end of his note: In the eyes of the People\u2019s Bank, this is all consistent with the longstanding aim of allowing the currency\u2019s value to reflect market fundamentals. Policymakers just reserve the right to decide what those fundamentals are. The sell-off in Asia is continuing in Hong Kong where the market opened a few minutes ago. The Shanghai Composite is down even more with a drop of 2.7%. It\u2019s down 2.5%, taking it below 30,000 points. Here\u2019s some heavyweight commentary from Mohammed El-Erian, the man who once controlled the $2 trillion assets of Pimco, the world\u2019s largest bond trader. He\u2019s got advice about the markets in two helpful stages, which goes roughly like this: 1) don\u2019t panic, and 2) seriously folks, don\u2019t panic. And secondly: As Michael McCarthy notes below, the Aussie has slipped a bit in the last few hours as more cautious investors sought the safe haven of the US dollar and commodity prices were under pressure. It\u2019s sitting at a six-week low of US78c this lunchtime having dropped to US0.77.83 earlier. Westpac\u2019s Imre Speizer says the Australian dollar was among the worst performing currencies in the offshore session. Defensive currencies and the British pound were the best performers on the day, the AUD and NZD the worst. The USD was resilient, perhaps displaying its defensive qualities, (with) the US dollar index up 0.1 per cent on the day. Ah yes, the pound. It\u2019s on $1.39 at the moment. Losses on the Australian market have eased slightly since the 10am open. The ASX200 is now off 1.5%, or 87.4 points, at 5,801.7. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, in Sydney, says that the markets have returned to \u201cextraordinary volatility\u201d as the re-pricing of assets resumed in the light of concerns about possible higher interest rates in the US. It leaves Asia Pacific investors facing a torrid trading today. Ten year bond yields in the US, Germany, the UK and many other countries are at multi-year highs as nascent inflation emerges in key economies. In accelerating declines US indices shed 4% last night, the sum of the previous week. Ironically investors favoured the more certain earnings streams of utilities and property stocks despite their obvious sensitivity to rising interest rates. The contradictory investment logic indicates markets have much to resolve and volatility will continue to bite. A stronger US dollar weighed on commodity markets. Commodity currencies like the Aussie dollar fell with oil, copper and gold. However the safe haven status of the Japanese yen attracted buyers and it was the most sought currency overnight. The strong relationship between USD/JPY and the Nikkei index could see more value destruction in Tokyo than other regional centres. Corporate results and Australian home lending data are unlikely to shape trading, despite the high relevance to financial stocks. Traders will instead monitor the out of hours trading of US futures markets to calibrate their responses. Ouch. And in case you missed the earlier action on Wall Street here\u2019s a chart that tells the story of the official correction in the market. Good morning Asia Pacific market watchers! This Martin Farrer in Sydney taking over from the blogtastic Graeme Wearden. It\u2019s been a busy day and night in the world of finance but now all eyes are on the markets in this time zone. As we\u2019ve already seen, it\u2019s been a rough start in Australia and Japan. But take heed, perhaps, of a point by respected AMP economist Shane Oliver, who says there\u2019s really no need to panic \u2013 \u201ccorrections of 5-15% are normal\u201d. Newsflash: Japan\u2019s stock market has opened, and it\u2019s following Australia\u2019s lead downwards. The Nikkei has shed almost 3% to 21,245.50 points. The Topix index is down 2.8%. After today\u2019s slide, America\u2019s stock market is on track for its worst week in over two years, reports my colleague Dominic Rushe: Another day of wild swings in the financial markets saw more than 1,000 points wiped off the Dow Jones industrial average \u2013 a loss for the day of over 4%. It was the third drop of more than 500 points for the Dow in the last five days and the Dow is now down 10% from its peak on 26 January, a fall known as a \u201ccorrection\u201d. The more broadly based measure of US share prices \u2013 the S&amp;P 500 \u2013 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index were also sharply lower as traders reacted nervously to concerns about rising inflation in the world\u2019s biggest economy.... \u201cThings haven\u2019t quietened down. Things are all over the place. The market is trying to find a bottom to this madness,\u201d said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group. \u201cNow we are having acute attention on what happens in the bond markets, so when yields move up there is an unsettling feeling in the equity market.\u201d Every sector of the Australian stock market is down this morning: Here are the biggest fallers on the ASX 200: Australia\u2019s stock market has hit its lowest level in nearly four months. With trading fully underway, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index has shed 1.7%, inflicting fresh losses on shareholders. It\u2019s now down at 5,789 points, the lowest since 12 October 2017: Breaking: Australia\u2019s stock market has fallen by more than 1.5% at the start of trading, following the losses in New York a few hours ago. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index is down 97 points at 5,793, as the global stock market turmoil enters a new day. New Zealand\u2019s market is also under pressure, falling 1.7% at the open. Asian traders are clearly jittery, having heard that the Dow Jones industrial average has now fallen into a correction. Financial spreadbetting firm IG predicts that Japan\u2019s Nikkei index could tumble by 3% on Friday. It also sees chunky losses in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, India and China. Australia\u2019s stock market will become the first to react to Wall Street\u2019s fall into a correction, in just 25 minutes. Tension is already building, with shares expected to fall sharply. As well as being 10% off its peak, the Dow is also down almost 3.5% during 2018. But, the benchmark index is still up around 30% since Donald Trump won the US election in November 2016. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, makes an important point over Twitter. During the bull market, shares and bonds both rose. Now in this crash, they\u2019re both falling: [In a \u2018normal\u2019 market, you\u2019d expect bonds and shares to move inversely - with investors pushing shares up when they felt confident, but rushing into the safety of bonds when they were nervous] The surge in market volatility this week may force speculators who had bet on calm markets to unwind their positions -- potentially driving shares even lower. Bloombeg has a good take: \u201cFor a market that hadn\u2019t fallen 3 percent from any high in more than a year, the week\u2019s action was enough to rattle even the biggest equity bulls. Accustomed to buying the dip, that wisdom is now in question when more selling by speculators may be imminent. \u201cThere\u2019s some big-money players that have really leveraged to the low rates forever, and they have to unwind those trades,\u201d said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management. \u201cThey could be in full panic mode right now.\u201d Asia-Pacific stock markets are expected to suffer fresh losses when investors return to work for Friday\u2019s trading session. Australia\u2019s main stock index, the ASX200, is being called down 1.5% or 82 points, as traders take their cue from the Dow\u2019s plunge into correction territory at the end of Thursday\u2019s session. That\u2019s a blow to hopes that the market might be bottoming out - on Thursday, bargain hunters lifted Australian stocks a little. This latest slide on Wall Street shows that markets haven\u2019t reached the bottom of this current correction. Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners in New York, expects further volatility.... \u201cThe dust hasn\u2019t settled yet, and I think both buyers and sellers are trying to figure out what this market really wants to do. I would think that this continues to happen for the next few trading sessions for everything to kind of get flushed out.\u201d Here\u2019s how financial types are reacting to the news that America\u2019s stock market is now in a correction, after four days of wild swings: Fears over falling government bond prices - and the prospect of higher interest rates - seem to have sparked today\u2019s selloff. Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Utah\u2019s Albion Financial Group, says: \u201cWe are having acute attention on what happens in the bond markets, so when yields move up there is an unsettling feeling in the equity market. Things haven\u2019t quietened down... \u201cAs rates rise, things, as far as equity investors are concerned, are getting worse.\u201d Here\u2019s Reuters closing market report: US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall St. sinks further in volatile trading as bond yields rise U.S. stocks plunged anew on Thursday in another trading session with big swings, as equities remained in a tug-of-war with bond yields, volatility remained high, and investors saw no relief ahead in finding the bottom of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,032.89 points, or 4.15%, to 23,860.46, the S&amp;P 500 lost 100.58 points, or 3.75%, to 2,581.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 274.83 points, or 3.9%, to 6,777.16. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has posted its second-biggest points slump ever. The Dow has closed down around 1,032 points, a fall of over 4%. It\u2019s the second quadruple-point dip this week (and ever). The S&amp;P 500 also suffered another bad day. Reuters is reporting that the S&amp;P and the Dow are now both now in a correction (more than 10% off their peak). Yikes..... the sell off is intensifying, as Wall Street gets the last-minute jitters again.... An Update: A late surge of selling is pushing shares lower on Wall Street. With 10 minuted to go, the Dow is off over 3%, or over 800 points..... It was another day of declines for stock markets, with the falls accelerating as the day progressed. The growing fear of interest rate rises which has spooked investors over the last few days was given additional impetus by the Bank of England\u2019s hawkish tone after its latest meeting and the better than expected weekly US jobless claims. The VIX volatility index was also higher, adding to the downbeat mood. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stocks are offside today as traders undo the positive move from yesterday. Investors remain unconvinced that panic has disappeared from the markets. The aftermath of a major decline usually leaves traders in limbo as the fear another leg lower is around the corner. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 108.73 points or 1.49% at 7170.69 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.62% to 12,260.29 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.98% at 5151.68 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.26% to 22,466.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.21% at 9756.3 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.01% to 841.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 570 points or 2.2%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Adding to the prospects of interest rate rises and thus the market decline - the Dow is off 550 points at the moment - New York Fed president William Dudley has been telling Bloomberg TV that three hikes in 2018 seems reasonable. But: The Dow has now dropped 543 points or just over 2%. It is on track for its worst weekly fall since January 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 430 points or 1.72%, and if US bond yields continue to rise markets could fall even further, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX: The equity market sell-off has spooked investors and led many to speculate that the Fed may decide to pull back from hiking rates aggressively this year. However, this week Bill Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dismissed the stock market sell-off as being of little consequence to central bankers. Meanwhile Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told the Financial Times that market volatility could be healthy and that he was sticking with his forecast of three rate hikes in 2018. So, the implication is that it would take a lot more than a doubling of volatility and a 1,000-point sell-off to throw the Fed off its current path of monetary tightening. Anyway, what if the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening in the form of rate increases and balance sheet reduction is going to happen anyway, no matter what the inflation and growth outlook? What if the Fed is thinking ahead to the next recession and is desperate to build up ammunition for when it must slash rates again in response? Also, this market was already selling off on the back of rising bond yields before Friday\u2019s rout. In the space of a month the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note had risen from below 2.5% to close to 2.9%. While this week\u2019s sell-off in equities saw yields drop back sharply as investors sought out safety of US Treasuries, the 10-year yield is once again approaching 2.9% and giving every indication the new key level of 3.0% is about to be tested. If so, then we can expect global equities to take another hit as investors panic about the prospect of higher rates on highly leveraged and over-indebted markets. One Wall Street economist points to the earlier US jobless claims as a reason for the Wall Street slide: The VIX volatility index is also higher, up around 6% at 29.41 although it is still well below the 50 level it reached earlier in the week. Markets continue to be spooked by the prospect of higher interest rates and the removal of the wall of money provided by central banks since the financial crisis. The Bank of England\u2019s more hawkish tone has only served to reinforce the view that rates are going to continue rising. The market falls are accelerating again. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 220 points or 0.9%. The FTSE 100 has fallen just over 1%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 1% lower. The prospect of a UK rate rise continues to support the pound, which is up just over 1% against the dollar at $1.4030. In turn, the FTSE 100 remains in the red, packed as it is with overseas earners which benefit from a weaker sterling. At the moment it is down more than 1%, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 is 1.2% lower. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: Both the FTSE 100 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 took Thursday\u2019s notice that rates were on the up as negative and traded lower. However, further out, we expect recent evidence of a weakened pound/stocks correlation to become clearer. This should enable equities to participate in the return to the \u2018new normal\u2019 for UK markets as well. Back with the Bank of England and the suggestion of a May interest rate rise, economist Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit Bank is not entirely convinced: We retain our forecast for the MPC to remain on hold this year, largely because we expect economic activity and inflation to be weaker than the BoE expects. The main uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is how businesses and households react to progress in Brexit negotiations. On the one hand, any resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty is likely to boost confidence and demand On the other hand, any progress on Brexit negotiations will not become binding until ratified as part of the whole \u201cwithdrawal agreement\u201d, which won\u2019t be until Spring next year, and meanwhile the impact of uncertainty could increase as the potential cliff-edge of 29 March 2019 draws nearer and businesses act on their contingency plans. In addition, the November rate hike is still working its way through the economy and there are signs that the pace of slowing in the housing market has accelerated, with mortgage approvals dropping sharply in December and the Halifax house price index falling for two consecutive months. In our view, this provides sufficient reason for caution. But, as we have previously flagged \u2013 and in light of today\u2019s \u201chawkish\u201d Inflation Report \u2013 the risks are increasingly skewed towards an earlier hike, possibly as soon as May. After Wall Street\u2019s last minute drop into negative territory last night, US markets are on the back foot once more. With bond prices falling and yields continuing to rise, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points or 0.46% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.04% lower while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.23%. There has been increasing talk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates by four times this year, more times than previously expected. But Patrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said: The public should heed the Bank\u2019s warning that rates will probably rise soon, says Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk: \u201cThe base rate may have remained the same today, however borrowers and savers should remain alert. \u201cThe word on the street suggests rate rises may be seen on the horizon for later in the year so now is the time to shop around with your borrowing and lock in your fixed deals at a low rate. \u201cThe previous rate rise meant some people now pay more on their mortgage. Homeowners on variable rate deals should check whether they could save money by switching to a fixed rate or, if you have significant savings, offset mortgage; this may give you some protection against subsequent rate hikes and the difference could be thousands so it\u2019s worth exploring.\u201d Over to the US, and earlier there were more signs of a stronger economy with the latest weekly jobless claims. The number of Americans claiming benefits fell unexpectedly last week by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts were forecasting an increase to 232,000. Here\u2019s a quick wrap-up of the Bank of England\u2019s press conference, after it voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that UK interest rates are not heading back to pre-crisis levels, despite hinting that borrowing costs will be hiked soon. Carney insisted that interest rate rises will be gradual and limited, and that borrowing costs won\u2019t hit the 5% level. But he also reiterated that the UK is running out of \u2018spare capacity\u2019, creating pressure to raise borrowing costs. In order to bring it (inflation) back to target over a more conventional horizon which means moving it in from that three year horizon that it will be necessary, likely to be necessary,to raise interest rates to a limited degree in a gradual process but somewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November.\u201d Carney warned that UK inflation could rise over 3% in the near term, but also offered optimism that wages will rise this year. The Bank has also hiked its growth forecasts a little for the next few years. The governor was sanguine about the recent market turmoil, pointing out that volatility had been unusually low recently. On Brexit, the governor pointed out that there have been benefits and costs... Investment is being restrained by Brexit related uncertainties. This remains the shallowest investment recovery in the UK for more than half a century. British exporters are in a sweet spot with sterling down 16% overall and around 20% against the euro in anticipation of a Brexit that has not yet happened.\u201d He also made a plea for those making forecasts about Brexit to release their underlying methodology and assumptions, so they can be properly interrogated. Carney refused to agree that interest rates are likely to rise in May, as many forecasts expect. But traders are already reacting. The pound has now jumped almost two cents today, to $1.4060. Government bond yields have weakened, though, while the FTSE 100 is down 0.8% or 60 points lower at 7219. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta explains: Whilst policy makers at the Bank of England are unlikely to be considering 3 or 4 hikes this year, the possibility of two hikes across 2018 appears to be increasing. This brings forward the possibility of interest rates being hiked as early as the Spring with May being the most likely month, then an additional increase potentially in November. As the pound has strengthen, the FTSE has come under increased pressure. A stronger pound is less favourable for the international firms that make up 70% of the FTSE. Banks are one of the few sectors to move higher on the FTSE, as they stand to benefit from a higher interest rate environment. Perhaps a May hike is not nailed on: Jeremy Cook of World First has neatly summed up the Bank\u2019s new forecasts: Q: Are you worried that Brexit will undermine confidence in economic forecasting - as any assumptions you make tend to look political. Mark Carney says that forecasters need to be \u201ctransparent, up front\u201d about the assumptions that underpin any Brexit forecasts. He also says it\u2019s important to release the model used when, say, comparing the impact of different trading relationships on the economy, along with the underlying assumptions. That means that people can \u2018interrogate\u2019 them. Brexit forecasts are a big issue in Britain today, after the government\u2019s secret analysis was leaked. The governor then argues that some of the excitement over economic forecasts has been \u201coverplayed\u201d. They can\u2019t be compared to weather forecasts -- unlike weather forecasters, we help make the weather, he points out. Carney concludes: The big picture there is something in these forecasts that tell people about how the economy is going to respond. But the challenge will come over the next year, when policymakers and the public become \u201ca lot better informed\u201d about Brexit. The bank, he pledges, will be \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d about its forecasts, to provide a reference point to help us all understand the situation. The press conference is now over. Fidelity International\u2019s global economist is not impressed by the Bank: The chief economist at the EY Item Club is not changing his rate forecasts despite today\u2019s hawkishness from the Bank: Q: When you raised rates in November, you said you expected banks to pass it on. But many savers haven\u2019t seen the benefits.... Mark Carney says the pass-through has been similar to previous rate increases. Q: Little seems to have changed between November\u2019s inflation report and today\u2019s one, so why are you so much more hawkish? Mark Carney denies that little has changed -- today\u2019s forecasts is \u201cslightly stronger\u201d. But the future path of interest rates depends how the economy develops. Q: What\u2019s your take on the recent turmoil in the markets? Mark Carney says he won\u2019t give a running commentary, but points out that he and other policymakers have recently observed that volatility was extremely low. It is healthier when markets have two-way risks around prices, the governor explains. He doesn\u2019t want to say the recent jump in volatility is welcome, but it\u2019s \u201cnot an entirely surprising development\u201d. Q: Would there be a material impact on your forecasts if Britain and the EU don\u2019t agree a transition deal by the end of March? Fair question, Mark Carney replies. It all depends on the impact on consumer confidence, business confidence and activity -- and whether a transition deal was agreed later than March, or not at all. Our forecasts is based on two Brexit factors - that there is \u201ca smooth transition\u201d, and that it leads to an \u201caverage of potential outcomes\u2019, Carney says. Q: Is there a chance you\u2019re being too pessimistic about productivity, governor? Recent figures have shown it picking up (which would remove some pressure to raise interest rates) Carney says there is a risk either way, joking that the Bank has been \u201cmaking the case\u201d for a pick-up in productivity, but the economy hasn\u2019t played ball. Another clip from today\u2019s report: Good point..... Q: Will making companies report their gender pay gap help to fix this problem? Yes, Mark Carney replies. Extra transparency should force organisations and individuals to think about this issue and bring in policies to fix it. On a personal level, Carney says the Bank has found that it gets \u201cbetter judgements\u201d when there is more diversity. This message is slightly undermined by the fact that today\u2019s press conference has a certain \u2018male, pale\u2019 feel to it: Carney insists the BoE is making progress. Thirty percent of senior managers are women, up from 20% five years ago. Q: Household consumption has fallen since the referendum, productivity is low, Brexit is causing uncertainty, and the markets went into meltdown this week -- so is this really a good time to wean the UK off cheap money? Mark Carney says some of these problems are linked. For example, Britain\u2019s productivity problems mean the economy can\u2019t grow as fast as it used to without generating inflation. The speed limit of the economy has changed. It\u2019s lower. And UK household spending is being driven by incomes, not debt -- so as real wages fall, people have had less money to spend. The governor then defends the Bank\u2019s stimulus measures - saying it has helped the economy ride out the storms. We have been providing a significant amount of support to this economy during very difficult periods. That\u2019s one of the reasons unemployment is at a 40-year low, with more people in work than ever before. It\u2019s one of the reasons why some adjustment of policy is necessary. Bad news for households: Mark Carney has warned that inflation could accelerate again in the next few months. During today\u2019s press conference, he said: It\u2019s possible that inflation could rise back above 3%, temporarily, in the short term. That\u2019s due to higher import prices caused by the weak pound, he added. Q: Many experts are saying that an May interest rate rise is now \u2018in play\u2019. Are they correct? Carney repeats that he won\u2019t be tied down. He then embarks on a long explanation about how market expectations have evolved in recent months, as the spare capacity within the UK economy has been used up. But the degree, and the exact timing, of interest rate rises, depends on how the economy develops. Carney then points to the European Union issue, saying \u201cThis is a crucial year for the Brexit negotiations. We will all be better informed by this time next year about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, he adds -- the impact could be positive, negative or neutral, though. Q: The markets think interest rates will be 1.25% by the start of 2020 - do you agree? Mark Carney says the Bank won\u2019t tie its hands. But he says people need to remember that the current interest rate cycles will be unlike those of the past. If you look before the financial crisis, bank rate was 5% on average, says Carney, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about going back to those levels.....And we\u2019re not talking about going at that pace [as seen in previous cycles]. Asked about the government\u2019s Brexit scenarios, Carney says that business are reacting to the uncertainty. Households, though, are reacting to the squeeze in their real incomes - rather than Brexit\u2019s long-term effects, the governor says. Q: Are you warning us that interest rates are going to rise faster than we thought? Our message is that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, interest rates will likely rise \u201csomewhat sooner, and to a somewhat greater extent\u201d than forecast in November, Carney clarifies. But it will still be a gradual process, with rates rising to a limited extent, he insists. On Brexit... Carney says the Bank has been setting monetary policy to balance its inflation targeting while protecting jobs and growth. It will keep doing that through the ups and downs in the financial markets, and the \u2018twists and turns\u2019 of Brexit. Good news for workers -- Mark Carney says the Bank is increasingly confident that growth in wages and unit labour costs will pick up. Carney gets to the key message - the Bank of England thinks there is very little spare capacity in the UK economy. That\u2019s why the BoE thinks that monetary policy will be tightened \u201csomewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u201d than it expected three months ago. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, begins the press conference - with deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden. Carney says it\u2019s 25 years since the Bank first created an inflation report. The backdrop to today\u2019s report is that the global economy is strong. And that\u2019s helping Britain -- net trade is contributing substantially to the UK economy British exporters are in a \u201csweet spot\u201d, with a lower currency helping them sell overseas, Carney continues. But....business investment is being held back by Brexit uncertainty. It\u2019s growing, but much weaker than in previous economic cycles -- the shallowest recovery in 50 years. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to discuss today\u2019s interest rate decision, and the latest quarterly inflation report. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, predicts there will be at least one UK interest rate rise this year - and possibly two or three. \u201cInflation remains significantly above target and will only fall back gradually as we move through this year, as the Bank of England recognises in its latest forecasts. Global inflationary pressures are building - with rising energy and food prices. And with the unemployment rate at its lowest level for over forty years, we could see some gradual rise in wage inflation. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency markets analyst at Caxton, says speculation of a May rate hike is building. \u201cThe pound has rallied sharply towards 1.40 against the dollar and 1.14 against the euro after the BoE raised its economic growth and inflation projections and said it may need to increase rates earlier and to a \u201cgreater extent\u201d than thought in November. While markets had been pricing in a hike in November, speculation has been building recently that the BoE could move as soon as May, and today\u2019s hawkish language shift will likely increase that speculation. A rate hike earlier in the year could help the pound maintain higher levels, but Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty remain a significant risk. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there are some \u201ckey takeaways\u201d in the Bank of England\u2019s new inflation report: Firstly, the expected \u2013 a unanimous vote to leave interest rates on hold for now. The Bank raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade in November, and as such was fully expected to wait until later this year before considering a further upward move. However, the Bank upgraded its forecast for the UK economy slightly today, citing stronger global conditions. It now expects 1.8% growth this year, as against 1.6% forecast in November. Policymakers also said they will try and bring inflation back to their 2% target more quickly than previously, which means rates could rise faster and further than investors had expected. The Bank\u2019s rhetoric echoed that of September\u2019s meeting minutes, which preceded the November rate hike. It now looks like the next rise could happen as soon as May \u2013 the next time the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts are due to be updated. Prior to today\u2019s announcement, markets were factoring in a 50% chance of a rate rise in May, and an 80% chance they\u2019ll be higher by the end of the year. You can read the minutes of this week\u2019s Bank of England meeting online, here. Here\u2019s a flavour, explaining why the MPC left rates on hold: On the upside, momentum in global growth might persist for longer and the boost to UK demand from global factors could prove greater than anticipated. Global inflationary pressures had also shown signs of building. The tightness of the domestic labour market could result in faster wage and unit labour cost growth. The predicted pickup in productivity growth was not assured. On the downside, some business survey indicators of output had weakened. Recent housing and retail sales data had softened and, more generally, consumers might still respond to the past squeeze in real incomes to a greater degree than anticipated. And UK net trade could benefit by less from the pickup in global demand than had been the case recently. There was a possibility that the contribution of imported inflation pressures would diminish more rapidly than in the central projection. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, predicts that the next UK interest rate hike could come in May. \u201cIf the UK improves on wage growth and unemployment rates remain stable, then it\u2019s almost certain that the MPC will rethink their strategy in Q2. It\u2019s \u2018as you were\u2019 for now but, pending Brexit developments in the new few months, don\u2019t be surprised to see Mark Carney take the plunge and raise interest rates for only the second time in a decade come May.\u201d UK government debt is also weakening, sending Britain\u2019s borrowing costs to their highest level in over a year. The pound has jumped by a whole cent against the US dollar, following the Bank of England\u2019s unexpectedly hawkish announcement. It\u2019s now trading just below $1.40. The Bank of England has also raised its growth forecasts - predicting that the economy will expand faster than expected over the next couple of years. The Bank of England has warned that interest rates may rise sooner than previously expected. In the minutes of today\u2019s meeting, the BoE also warns that rates could rise higher than it forecast three months ago. That\u2019s a clear warning to households and businesses to expect rising borrowing costs - even though the BoE resisted hiking at this month\u2019s meeting. Here\u2019s the key section from the report: Were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report. Breaking: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. It\u2019s a unanimous decision too, with all nine policymakers voting to leave borrowing costs at their present level. More to follow! Tension is building in the City ahead of the Bank of England interest rate decision, due in 15 minutes. Although borrowing costs aren\u2019t expected to move, traders are wondering whether the Bank will use the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting to hint at future rate hikes. Mihir Kapadia \u2013 CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cAmidst a volatile week for the markets, traders are bracing themselves for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision today. The BoE\u2019s decision comes at a time when concerns over rising inflation and the possibility of more central banks tightening monetary policy is a key driver of the markets. Although most analysts expect that rates will be unchanged , traders will be watching for clues about the probability of the timing and probability of a future interest rate rise. The FTSE 100 is still in the red (down 63 points right now), while the pound is unchanged against the US dollar at $1.388. European central bank policymaker Yves Mersch is putting the boot into bitcoin. In a speech in London, Mersch compares digital currencies to \u2018will-o\u2019-the-wisps\u2019 -- mysterious lights in the marsh that would lead unsuspecting travellers to their doom. He says: With the draining of marshes to make way for agricultural land, will-o\u2019-the-wisps are rarely sighted nowadays. But there remain plenty of distant flashing lights to distract travellers with promises of riches. As with the previous incarnation, these flashing lights often turn out to be just like bubbles of marsh gas \u2013 insubstantial and foul-smelling, but also flammable and sometimes able to burn things around them. The most recent beguiling wisps are named variously \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d \u2013 to denote the use of cryptographic methods and technology \u2013 or \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d (VCs) \u2013 to denote their lack of legal recognition. He then hits out at Bitcoin\u2019s inferiority to current payment systems. Bitcoin transactions generally require confirmation from six miners. With each block taking around ten minutes to mine, you would expect transactions to take an hour to process. But with recent network congestion, the average time for one confirmation can easily exceed several hours. At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with Bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed. Mersch says regulators need to \u2018urgently\u2019 look at how virtual currencies are being used, but also concedes that the underlying technologies may yet have a bright future. The speech is online here. Newsflash: Another 101 Carillion workers have just lost their jobs, following the company\u2019s collapse last month. The Official Receiver announced the latest redundancies this morning, alongside the better news that 1,221 jobs have been \u2018safeguarded\u2019. A spokesperson says: We have continued to review Carillion\u2019s contracts, as well as core divisions of the business, and I can confirm that we have safeguarded a further 1,221 jobs. These roles are connected to the delivery of both public and private contracts and cover services for a city council, as well as a range of facilities management services. This means so far, we have been able to save more than 2,000 jobs. \u201cRegrettably, we are also announcing that 101 roles have been made redundant. These are a mix of back-office functions and engineering support roles that new suppliers no longer require. Greece\u2019s public debt management agency (PDMA) has decided to press ahead today with the sale of a new seven-year bond. The auction, Greece\u2019s boldest foray yet onto international markets, had been put on ice by this week\u2019s market turbulence, but is now back on! Helena Smith explains: The government hopes to bring in at least \u20ac3bn from the markets \u2013 a significant addition to the \u20ac6.5bn cash buffer it has already built up to cover debt repayments when its third EU-IMF sponsored bailout programme ends. The seven-year euro benchmark had been postponed on account of market volatility with the sell off Monday. Now that markets have calmed down, the PDMA had decided to go ahead with the issue. Insiders say they expect the bond, which matures on February 15, 2015, to yield around 3.75%. The EU economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has begun a visit to Greece voicing optimism that the debt stricken country is well on the way to exiting its third international bailout programme. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Holding talks with Greece\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavalopoulos, the Frenchman not only expressed optimism that Athens was on the right track but went further still -- pinpointing a date by which the Euro zone\u2019s problem child will have exited its last economic adjustment programme. Once a fourth compliance reform review was over, \u201cGreece could conclude its exit from the program by June 21,\u201d he said. Moscovici, who will be holding closed-door talks with Athens\u2019 finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos this afternoon, has long seen himself as a champion of Greece. Before arriving in Athens, he told the country\u2019s state run news agency that his priority was to see Greece become a \u201cnormal euro area member state.\u201d \u201cNow is the time for a final effort to complete the programme successfully and move to a more peaceful and bright future, \u201c he said, adding that discussions has already begun on restructuring Greece\u2019s staggering \u20ac320bn debt load. \u201cTechnical work has already begun on a debt relief mechanism linked to economic growth, an idea first proposed last year and supported by the Eurogroup [of finance ministers] in June 2017\u201d. Brexit fears are also looming over the City today. Nicky Morgan MP has heavily criticised the government for failing to publish its \u201cposition paper on financial services\u201d, leaving banks in the dark about the future. That comes hot on the heels of the news that a hard Brexit could cost Britain \u00a380bn, with the north-east and the West Midlands hit particularly hard. Today\u2019s sell-off leaves the FTSE 100 hovering around 7220 points. Earlier this week it hit a 13-month trough, below 7,100, before Wednesday\u2019s rally clawed back some ground. Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says: The rebounds of yesterday certified, as we suggested, that so far it is too early to call an inversion and the right word to call this movement is still \u201ccorrection\u201d after an important bullish rally. The scenario could change if FTSE 100 goes below 7,000 points and DAX below 11,950. Mining companies are pushing the FTSE 100 deeper into the red. After two hours trading, the blue chip index is down 60 points, or 0.8%. BHP Billiton, Antofagasta and Glencore are all among the top fallers. It would be worse apart from food company Compass, which posted decent results this morning, and pharma firm GlaxosmithKline which beat expectations yesterday. David Madden of CMC Markets says City traders have been booking profits after yesterday\u2019s rally: The weak finish in the US last night left traders feeling uneasy on this side of the Atlantic, and the optimistic sentiment that dominated yesterday has subsided. Traders are often nervous about holding a firm long position in the wake of a severe sell-off, and today\u2019s move is proof we are not out of the woods yet. At midday in the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) update will be closely watched as it may add volatility to the pound. Equities (shares) have born the brunt of this week\u2019s volatility - with heavy losses in New York on Monday, then Europe and Asia on Tuesday. Larry Hatheway, group head of investment solutions at asset manager GAM, says there has been a rush to the exits, as traders who\u2019d bet on low volatility were suddenly badly hit. So, with interest rates likely to rise in the months ahead, Hatheway predicts that shares will continue be buffeted around: The most outstanding feature of the adverse market movements has been the discrepancy between shifts in equity prices and those of other assets. Long equity and short equity implied volatility were among the most crowded trades, meaning that risk management manoeuvres in response to the initial market action accelerated the sell-off. Nevertheless, while technical factors may have contributed to the extent of the adjustment, the source of it appears to have been driven by fundamentals as market participants come to terms with the beginning of the exit from the so-called \u201cnew normal\u201d. With the prospect of rising inflation both crimping corporate profits and making forthcoming monetary policy less predictable, we believe that expectations for equity returns need to be revised lower while implied volatility will rise from previously depressed levels. The team at ING have made a handy crib sheet showing what the Bank of England could do, and how the markets might react: UK department store group Debenhams has become the latest retailer to slash jobs. Debenhams is cutting 320 in-store management roles, as part of a push to \u201creduce cost and complexity\u201d This comes a month after the company hit shareholders with a profits warning, following a disappointing Christmas. Several analysts are predicting that one or two Bank of England policymakers will vote to raise UK interest rates today. Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty are the most likely hawks, out of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the vote could move the markets today: \u201cThe rise to 0.75% is expected to come at some point in the next few months, with many thinking that the UK economy is performing well enough to shoulder a rate hike in May. \u201cWhat will be scrutinised most by traders is the composition of Thursday\u2019s vote. Any more than two thumbs up for a rate rise could see the pound make significant gains, while ears will then tune into any remarks Mark Carney follows up with. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale thinks the Bank might pave the way to a rate hike in three months. The UK MPC meets today with the market universally expecting no change in policy, but also expecting an element of hawkishness in preparation for a hike this spring. The market prices a 50% chance of a May hike and anything which pushes those expectations back leaves GBP (the British pound) a little vulnerable. Most analysts are sticking to the idea that the markets are going through a healthy correction, not a panicky crash. So investors have to decide whether to plunge in and buy some shares, or keep safely on the sidelines until things calm down. It\u2019s a great time to be a daredevil speculator, but long-term investors may not be enjoying the ride. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, predicts markets could shed another 10%: Many contrarians would like to follow Baron Rothschild\u2019s advice: \u201cBuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d. As of now, I do not see any blood, but a healthy correction which has been overdue for a long time. From a valuation perspective, the forward price to earnings ratio on the S&amp;P 500 has dropped from 20 at the beginning of the year to below 18, suggesting that prices are still expensive when compared to historic averages. Deciding to buy, sell, or hold is a tough one in such circumstances, but if investors believe the global economy and corporates will continue firing on all cylinders, the downside risk is likely to be limited from current levels. However, another 5-10% correction should not be ruled out. Fixed income markets have started looking attractive and if the surge in bold yields resumes, there will be more incentives to pull out from stocks to bonds. That\u2019s why bond markets, particularly in the U.S. will play a major role in how much further the correction may continue. Down we go again.... Trading is underway in London, where the FTSE 100 has dropped 28 points to 7251. The other European markets are also down, with the Stoxx 600 benchmark losing around 0.4%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s another nervous day on Europe\u2019s trading floors. Shares are expected to fall back, unravelling Wednesday\u2019s recovery, as the wild swings that have dominated this week continue. Wall Street suffered a late wobble last night, with the Dow Jones surrendering all its gains to close slightly lower (down 19 points). That\u2019s going to feed through to the City, where the FTSE 100 is being called down around 0.6%. Worries over rising inflation and bond yields continue to drive the markets, with traders wondering how fast central banks will tighten monetary policy. That means the Bank of England will be centre stage today. The BoE will set interest rates at noon today, and also release its latest quarterly inflation report -- packed with new economic forecasts. One or two policymakers may vote for a rate hike -- but the majority will almost certainly vote to leave rates at 0.5%. The big question is whether the BoE is inching closer to raising borrowing costs in May. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says governor Mark Carney will face plenty of questions about the UK economic outlook: Today\u2019s interest rate decision isn\u2019t expected to offer too many surprises on the rates front, the main steer for the next move in the pound will come from Governor Carney\u2019s assessment of the UK economy, which he has already stated is suffering from under investment as a result of the uncertainty being generated by the Brexit talks. Markets will also be looking for any further steers on the outlook for wages growth, as well as productivity which has also started to show signs of improving. It will be in the area of wages that markets could well focus most of their attention, particularly in light of last week\u2019s strong US wages numbers, which has made bond markets globally particularly susceptible to how policy makers view the outlook for them. Several other central bankers are speaking today, which should keep the markets on their toes. The agenda 10.30am GMT: ECB executive board member Yves Mersch speech on Digital Currency.

However, this week Bill Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dismissed the stock market sell-off as being of little consequence to central bankers. Meanwhile Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told the Financial Times that market volatility could be healthy and that he was sticking with his forecast of three rate hikes in 2018. So, the implication is that it would take a lot more than a doubling of volatility and a 1,000-point sell-off to throw the Fed off its current path of monetary tightening. </p> <p>Anyway, what if the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening in the form of rate increases and balance sheet reduction is going to happen anyway, no matter what the inflation and growth outlook? What if the Fed is thinking ahead to the next recession and is desperate to build up ammunition for when it must slash rates again in response? Also, this market was already selling off on the back of rising bond yields before Friday\u2019s rout. In the space of a month the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note had risen from below 2.5% to close to 2.9%. While this week\u2019s sell-off in equities saw yields drop back sharply as investors sought out safety of US Treasuries, the 10-year yield is once again approaching 2.9% and giving every indication the new key level of 3.0% is about to be tested. If so, then we can expect global equities to take another hit as investors panic about the prospect of higher rates on highly leveraged and over-indebted markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c7d82e4b05abd28aabd7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T16:41:14.334Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One Wall Street economist points to the earlier US jobless claims as a reason for the Wall Street slide:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/961639300327763968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Catalyst for today\u2019s sell off?

It now expects 1.8% growth this year, as against 1.6% forecast in November. Policymakers also said they will try and bring inflation back to their 2% target more quickly than previously, which means rates could rise faster and further than investors had expected. The Bank\u2019s rhetoric echoed that of September\u2019s meeting minutes, which preceded the November rate hike.</p> <p>It now looks like the next rise could happen as soon as May \u2013 the next time the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts are due to be updated.

      "bodyText": "Spooked investors caused Asian markets to plummet on Friday following what some described as panic selling on Wall Street which saw the Dow Jones drop by more than 1,000 points for the second time in a week. A mass sell-off spread to China for the first time in the current crisis as the Shanghai Composite index fell by 5.6% at one stage and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped more than 4%. The rout on Asian markets came as traders digested the news of the Dow\u2019s fall and analysts noted that both it and the S&amp;P500 had now declined about 10% from their late January highs, signalling a correction. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell by as much as 3.5% in morning trade, but the losses were pared back to 2.3% at the close of trade. South Korea\u2019s Kospi was down about 1.9% in mid-afternoon trade, while Australia\u2019s benchmark ASX200 index ended the day down 0.9% \u2013 a loss of $A20bn. \u201cThere\u2019s some big-money players that have really leveraged to the low rates forever, and they have to unwind those trades,\u201d Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management, told Bloomberg News. \u201cThey could be in full panic mode right now.\u201d Chris Weston, chief market strategist at the online trader IG in Melbourne, said volatility was the main problem. He said the Vix volatility index \u2013 also known as the \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 had spiked sharply this year \u201cand that means there is no confidence about going out and filling your boots with stocks\u201d. \u201cYou could wake up and the Dow is down another 1,000 points, or it could be up,\u201d Weston said. \u201cThere\u2019s no certainty. Markets like certainty but the only certainty at the minute is of a big move and that could be up or down.\u201d Analysts in Japan suggested that the correction in equities could last until March. \u201cTokyo shares had fallen to a level that was attractive for buying, but investors refrained from doing so after seeing a wild correction in the US market,\u201d Masahiro Ichikawa, a senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co. told Kyodo News. In another drama during afternoon trading in Asia, expectations rose of another US government shutdown. Kentucky Republican senator Rand Paul stalled a vote on a budget agreement as he complained about \u201creckless\u201d deficit spending, paving the way for a shutdown at midnight local time. However, the Senate is tipped to resolve the standoff in the early hours of Friday morning. Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners in New York, said further volatility was likely in coming days. \u201cThe dust hasn\u2019t settled yet, and I think both buyers and sellers are trying to figure out what this market really wants to do,\u201d Corpina said. \u201cI would think that this continues to happen for the next few trading sessions for everything to kind of get flushed out.\u201d Last Friday\u2019s strong US jobs and wages figures strengthened the feeling that inflation was on the rise and that interest rate increases would not be far behind. The Bank of England signalled on Thursday that an interest rate hike was coming from as early as May. Jim Rogers, the veteran US investor, said he expected the selling to continue until the US Federal Reserve raises rates in March. Without predicting the timing, Rogers also issued a more general warning about the next big market crash. \u201cWhen we have a bear market again, and we are going to have a bear market again, it will be the worst in our lifetime,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cDebt is everywhere, and it\u2019s much, much higher now.\u201d",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/16/donald-trump-republican-tax-cuts-us-economy-rock\">tax reform bill</a>, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chris Weston, chief market strategist at the online trader IG in Melbourne, said volatility was the main problem.</p> \n<p>He said the Vix volatility index \u2013 also known as the \u201cfear index\u201d \u2013 had spiked sharply this year \u201cand that means there is no confidence about going out and filling your boots with stocks\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou could wake up and the Dow is down another 1,000 points, or it could be up,\u201d Weston said. \u201cThere\u2019s no certainty.

The move also relieves pressure on the Queensland Labor government to veto a second Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) funding proposal, after killing off Adani\u2019s hopes of a $1bn federal loan during the November state election campaign. In a statement released on Friday, the chief executive of Aurizon, Andrew Harding, said that while the company supported developing the Queensland mining site there were no clients to build the rail line for. \u201cWe believe Aurizon can play a key role in helping facilitate a multi-user, open access rail solution for the various new mines in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, while we are in ongoing discussions with several Galilee Basin mine proponents, we have not yet progressed to definitive contractual arrangements with any proponent. \u201cOur Naif application, is, in part, predicated on having customer contacts secured. Given this is unlikely to occur in the near future, we believe it is prudent to withdraw the Naif funding application. \u201cIf market circumstances change and our discussions with potential customers progress to commercial arrangements, we will look at all possible funding arrangements to develop the rail solution.\u201d The Palaszczuk Labor government had been under pressure from activists to announce it would also veto any Aurizon Naif funding deal, amid an intensifying campaign to prevent Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine from going ahead. The rail line is seen as crucial to opening up the remote Galilee Basin to development \u2013 GVK Hancock and Clive Palmer have also shown interest in the region. At the federal level, Labor has begun shifting its position on Adani\u2019s Queensland mining interest, following Guardian Australia\u2019s story that the mining group is suspected of altering a laboratory report in a current environmental pollution case with the Queensland department of environment. The mine is yet to receive financing for its Queensland project, which remains delayed despite having received approval. A Naif spokesman confirmed that Aurizon had formally withdrawn its application on Friday. \u201cAs such, Naif will no longer be considering that Aurizon request for financial assistance,\u201d he said. Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Nikola Casule said: \u201cAurizon has joined a long list of banks and services companies walking away from the Adani project. This is a huge win for the movement of people all across Australia that has stood up to stop Adani\u2019s destructive plans. \u201cAurizon\u2019s decision reflects the wider public sentiment, which has become increasingly hostile amid revelations of the Adani Group\u2019s tainted environmental and corporate record.\u201d",
