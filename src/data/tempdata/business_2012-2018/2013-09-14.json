      "bodyText": "Three hours. That was how long Stephen Hester was given to decide if he would like to become the boss of Royal Bank of Scotland. It was just after 7pm on Friday 10 October 2008 when he took the call from Sir Tom McKillop, then chairman of the failing bank. With Treasury officials embarking on a 48-hour operation to rescue the Edinburgh-based bank before the markets opened on Monday morning, McKillop told Hester he needed to know that night if he would take over from Fred Goodwin. Hester put down the phone, discussed it with his family, then called McKillop to say he would. In an interview to mark the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehman \u2013 which led to the bailout of the UK banking system 28 days later \u2013 Hester says he is not the sort of person who \"agonises\" over such decisions. His one caveat was that he wanted assurances about the plans of the then Labour government, assurances that he would be \"a chief executive rescuing a company, not a quasi civil servant running a government department\". The newly appointed City minister, Lord Myners, was dispatched to put him at ease and Hester agreed to take on the task that he has since likened to defusing a time bomb \u2013 and one with a balance sheet, at \u00a32.2 trillion, that was bigger than the annual output of the UK economy. Yet while Hester can recall the moment he was offered a job that was to catapult him on to television and radio news bulletins, newspaper front pages and their gossip columns, and into the middle of a political storm over bankers' pay, he struggles to recall the night Lehman Brothers collapsed. When it happened, Hester was running property company British Land, having started his career at Credit Suisse and then turned around the troubled Abbey National. He was, however, preparing to attend his first board meeting of RBS as a new non-executive director. The meeting was held on 23 September, eight days after the Lehman collapse. His memories about that first board meeting are more about what had gone wrong following RBS's takeover of ABN Amro a year earlier than the implications of the Lehman collapse. \"Nothing was thought to be life-threatening,\" Hester says. In the following fortnight, before RBS was put on taxpayer-backed life support, the board was regularly updated about urgent meetings taking place at the Treasury with bank bosses. But Hester says that the board was learning after the event about the rapid outflow of funds that eventually forced the bank to accept a bailout by 13 October 2008. The then chancellor, Alistair Darling, has vividly recalled how on 7 October McKillop had called him to tell him the bank would run out of cash in two to three hours. Board meetings during that crucial week were dominated by a debate about the bank's capital position: \"There was huge controversy in the board about the scale of support we needed, from some thinking it was not very much, almost a token [amount] to others thinking it should be a lot.\" Hester reckoned RBS needed a lot more capital, but \"it never got quite as high I wanted it to go\". By the end of 2008 some \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds was used to buy shares in RBS; by the end of 2009 the total had risen to \u00a345bn \u2013 money that has yet to be unlocked through a share sell-off. Hester had hoped to stay on until the shares were sold, but has been forced to leave at the end of this month \u2013 with the bank half the size it was five years ago. During his tenure, his own bonus payments became a focus for politicians mindful of an electorate enduring the biggest wage squeeze since the 1870s. In January 2012 Labour leader Ed Miliband called a debate about Hester's pay, prompting the furious RBS boss to waive the potential payment. Hester, however, doesn't take personally either the political rows over money, or the decision to force him to quit: \"Political goals don't sit easily with business goals for very long.\" Old and new bosses overlapped briefly, and Hester says he doesn't recall his predecessor being the domineering bully that has since been portrayed: \"Fred was quieter than I thought he would be. He was supposed to be this tyrannical figure. He never was in my presence.\" But he adds: \"The interesting thing about the financial crisis is that the problems were staring you in the face.\" Economies were unstable and banks were, in general, mispricing risk. RBS, specifically, had taken over ABN Amro in autumn 2007, just as the credit crunch hit. Some of Hester's plans were later frustrated by government policy: the investment bank is now 20% of the business rather than the third he had been aiming for. And he is unconvinced that ringfencing high street from casino banking will make a rerun of 2008 any less probable. He notes that the Co-op, currently asking bondholders to take losses to avoid a taxpayer bailout, has no casino operations. \"My regret is that the world of regulation and politicians hasn't been as fast as it might be in understanding all this, and has taken a whole load of blind alleys \u2013 like ringfencing \u2013 which won't do anything to stop it.\"",

The conference \u2013 notable for the sight of Britain's captains of industry sitting in the Royal Albert Hall's cheap seats, tucking into the IoD's so-called gourmet packed lunch \u2013 features many of the usual suspects. Chancellor George Osborne, shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and, inevitably, Sir Richard Branson will all be present. But London mayor Boris Johnson, also on this year's bill, usually provides some amusement, whether intentionally or not. The IoD even plays up to this, reminding us he was voted favourite speaker at the 2009 conference and promising he will deliver \"a controversial and memorable address\". Pretty safe bet there. Meanwhile, to prove the IoD has hauled itself kicking and screaming out of the last century, there will be an appearance from Joanna Shields, formerly of AOL and Bebo and now chief executive of Tech City, the technology hub in east London which aims to attract international IT companies to the capital. Also up before the delegates is Dan Cobley, managing director of Google UK and Ireland. No naughty questions about tax avoidance, please. Asos still fashionable in the City Another big event already well under way is London fashion week. No doubt online clothing retailer Asos will be keeping one eye on the catwalk, specialising as it does in bringing the latest trends to its teen and twentysomething customers. But from a City point of view, the key fashion event of the week is Asos's fourth-quarter update on Thursday. The business has not been without setbacks recently \u2013 Primark announced it was ending a trial to sell its clothing ranges on the Asos site. But shares retain their heady valuation and analysts remain positive: they expect a strong performance from the company's UK operations, with quarterly sales up about 39%. But Asos is also growing internationally, with Australia and the US doing well and initial teething problems in Russia seemingly ironed out. It is close to launching a site in China, perhaps by next month, and analysts believe other country sites could be on the agenda. Barclays analysts estimate international sales rose 44% in the last three months of the financial year. The bank sums up: \"Asos remains the best-placed company, in our view, to continue benefiting from the structural shift towards online.\" Reading between the lines of Barclays' offer Barclays is due to issue a prospectus for its \u00a35.8bn rights issue early this week. Much of the detail is already known \u2013 investors will be offered one new share at 185p for every four they own, with dealings due to start on 3 October \u2013 so the points of interest may lie elsewhere. For a start, analysts will be scouring the documents for any updates on the legal issues facing the bank. It is being investigated by City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, as well as the Serious Fraud Office, for its controversial cash-raising from Qatar in 2008, a move which allowed it to avoid a UK government bailout during the financial crisis. The bank was also caught up in the alleged manipulation of the Libor market, while it has said it would defend itself against fines levied by US authorities over claims it manipulated electricity markets in California. The cash call itself came as a direct result of the Prudential Regulation Authority telling the bank it had a \u00a312.8bn hole in its balance sheet that needed plugging. But analysts believe shareholders could get the money back again before too long. Esp\u00edrito Santo predicted last week that \"potentially all the proceeds of the rights issue will be available to be returned to shareholders by 2015\". Which seems a bit Alice in Wonderland.",

The mother-of-three scoots around in her private jet and likes to practise yoga and keep fit, but Hargreaves-Adams must now shape up two ailing brands as well as nurture Damsel in a Dress, the mid-market fashion label she has also invested in.</p> <p>Hargreaves-Adams has pumped more than \u00a35.4m of her own money into Farhi and Fenn Wright Manson, both of which were in administration when she stepped in. She believes they have appeal in the fast-developing Asian market if they can be tweaked to suit the right kind of shopper. She also intends to increase the volume of products sold online.</p> <p>Hargreaves-Adams started work in the clothing industry as a Saturday girl in one of her dad's stores aged 14. She went on to run her own boutique in upmarket Southport in Merseyside for a couple of years in the 1980s, before being appointed head of womenswear at Matalan in the late 1990s. She reckons that CV has given her the experience to turn the companies around.</p> <p>\"Starting at the bottom, I feel my experience is very broad. I have covered so many specific areas that I can really contribute to growing these businesses from the core,\" she says. Nevertheless, running her own business is \"scary\" and she believes women still have to work harder than men to prove themselves.</p> <p>But she likes being in the driving seat: \"Running your own business is empowering in that you are ultimately making the decisions, [but] you have to be pretty confident that you are capable.\"</p> <p>Industry observers seem to think that she is. \"She likes a laugh and a joke but she's a Liverpudlian. She's hard as nails,\" one source told <em>Retail Week</em> magazine.</p> <p>While some former colleagues suggest Hargreaves-Adams has lost touch with ordinary women given her super-rich lifestyle, she herself says she is still down to earth and approachable: \"I am ego-free and I will listen to advice, but I don't feel duty bound to follow it.\"</p> <p>Its hard to gauge the real Hargreaves-Adams, as she insisted this interview be carried out via email so that her words could be checked. It all seems rather precious: but having been chased by the tabloids following rumours of a close friendship with Prince Andrew after separating from her husband six years ago, perhaps it's no surprise that she is cautious.</p> <p>It is a trait she may have inherited from her father \u2013 whom she unsurprisingly rates as her biggest influence \u2013 as he is also intensely private.</p> <p>\"To witness him in action is awe-inspiring,\" she says. \"He had a vision that no one in the UK had at the time and he brought that vision to life.\"</p> <p>The eldest of three children, she was born while her dad was still running a market stall in Liverpool. He set up a business named Jaymax, named after his two eldest children, before being inspired by a trip to the US to set up Matalan, an out-of-town discount chain, in 1985. It was indeed a brave move \u2013 out-of-town was not yet in fashion.</p> <p>Maxine was educated at the local Maghull high school in Merseyside and left early, just like her father, to join the family business. While she is no longer involved with Matalan, brother Jason recently became chief executive of the retailer, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange for several years before being bought back by Hargreaves senior in 2006 for \u00a3817m.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if Hargreaves-Adams can follow her father's success by turning around her new fashion labels. She certainly has her work cut out.</p> <p>Nicole Farhi collapsed into administration with \u00a320m in debts earlier this year after passing through several private equity owners since its sale by former parent company French Connection in 2010. While it appeared during London Fashion Week in the spring, the label's finances suffered after losing its founding designer in a tough market.</p> <p>Hargreaves-Adams has taken on six of its stores, including the flagship branch in Mayfair in central London, as well as concessions in Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser and Selfridges. She added those to eight Fenn Wright Manson stores and a string of John Lewis concessions that she also bought from administrators, saying she wanted to honour a heritage of \"stylish pieces with exceptional quality\".</p> <p>She says of the two labels: \"The potential is in giving them back an identity which they've lost.\" Whether that involves adding a little of her trademark bling remains to be seen.</p>",

She believes they have appeal in the fast-developing Asian market if they can be tweaked to suit the right kind of shopper. She also intends to increase the volume of products sold online. Hargreaves-Adams started work in the clothing industry as a Saturday girl in one of her dad's stores aged 14. She went on to run her own boutique in upmarket Southport in Merseyside for a couple of years in the 1980s, before being appointed head of womenswear at Matalan in the late 1990s. She reckons that CV has given her the experience to turn the companies around. \"Starting at the bottom, I feel my experience is very broad. I have covered so many specific areas that I can really contribute to growing these businesses from the core,\" she says. Nevertheless, running her own business is \"scary\" and she believes women still have to work harder than men to prove themselves. But she likes being in the driving seat: \"Running your own business is empowering in that you are ultimately making the decisions, [but] you have to be pretty confident that you are capable.\" Industry observers seem to think that she is. \"She likes a laugh and a joke but she's a Liverpudlian. She's hard as nails,\" one source told Retail Week magazine. While some former colleagues suggest Hargreaves-Adams has lost touch with ordinary women given her super-rich lifestyle, she herself says she is still down to earth and approachable: \"I am ego-free and I will listen to advice, but I don't feel duty bound to follow it.\" Its hard to gauge the real Hargreaves-Adams, as she insisted this interview be carried out via email so that her words could be checked. It all seems rather precious: but having been chased by the tabloids following rumours of a close friendship with Prince Andrew after separating from her husband six years ago, perhaps it's no surprise that she is cautious. It is a trait she may have inherited from her father \u2013 whom she unsurprisingly rates as her biggest influence \u2013 as he is also intensely private. \"To witness him in action is awe-inspiring,\" she says. \"He had a vision that no one in the UK had at the time and he brought that vision to life.\" The eldest of three children, she was born while her dad was still running a market stall in Liverpool. He set up a business named Jaymax, named after his two eldest children, before being inspired by a trip to the US to set up Matalan, an out-of-town discount chain, in 1985. It was indeed a brave move \u2013 out-of-town was not yet in fashion. Maxine was educated at the local Maghull high school in Merseyside and left early, just like her father, to join the family business. While she is no longer involved with Matalan, brother Jason recently became chief executive of the retailer, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange for several years before being bought back by Hargreaves senior in 2006 for \u00a3817m. It remains to be seen if Hargreaves-Adams can follow her father's success by turning around her new fashion labels. She certainly has her work cut out. Nicole Farhi collapsed into administration with \u00a320m in debts earlier this year after passing through several private equity owners since its sale by former parent company French Connection in 2010. While it appeared during London Fashion Week in the spring, the label's finances suffered after losing its founding designer in a tough market. Hargreaves-Adams has taken on six of its stores, including the flagship branch in Mayfair in central London, as well as concessions in Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser and Selfridges. She added those to eight Fenn Wright Manson stores and a string of John Lewis concessions that she also bought from administrators, saying she wanted to honour a heritage of \"stylish pieces with exceptional quality\". She says of the two labels: \"The potential is in giving them back an identity which they've lost.\" Whether that involves adding a little of her trademark bling remains to be seen.",

    "webTitle": "Five years after Lehman, could a collapse happen all over again?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Seventy-five years before the trillion-dollar bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Franklin D Roosevelt had used his 1933 inauguration speech \u2013 in the depths of the Great Depression \u2013 to declare that the \"money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation\". He went on: \"We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.\" In 2008, in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse, the words of the New Deal president were often quoted by those keen to rein in the excesses of Wall Street and the City. After Lehman there was no shortage of ideas on ways of restoring the temple, including breaking up the big banks into retail and investment arms, as they had been in the US under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The reformers were not confined to the Occupy movement protesters who set up camps on Wall Street and by St Paul's cathedral. Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, supported moves to prevent banks engaging in speculative trading that did not benefit their customers, while in the UK the coalition government backed plans to force banks to ringfence high street operations from their investment banking activities. The aim was to eradicate what Lord Turner, when he was chairman of the Financial Services Authority, had called the \"socially useless\" parts of the City and rein in the risk-taking that might one day require another taxpayer bailout. Five years on from the tumultuous collapse of Lehman \u2013 which prompted a near meltdown of the global financial system \u2013 Turner admits the socially useless activity he was concerned about has been only temporarily restrained. Indeed, to the public, the perception is that the City has got away lightly, especially compared with what happened to those blamed for the 1978-79 winter of discontent. Five years after that winter, when the trade unions were deemed to have taken Britain to the brink of economic chaos, the Thatcher government had taken a series of steps to tame organised labour. But capitalism's winter of discontent in 2008-09 led to no such seismic shift. Just six months after the mayhem caused by Lehman's collapse \u2013 which quickly led to the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds, the bailout of Bradford &amp; Bingley and the near-demise of RBS \u2013 an industry that loves acronyms had created a new one: BAB, standing for \"bonuses are back\". Five years on, the view of former City minister Lord Myners is that not a lot has changed: \"The banks are still too big, too interconnected and too undercapitalised.\" He is not alone in fearing that too little has changed to prevent another crisis, and that lessons have not been learned. Turner, too, fears that history could repeat itself, and Alistair Darling, chancellor at the time of the bailouts, agrees: \"As long as people think they can make money out of nothing, it will happen again.\" That is not to say there have not been changes. The Lehman crisis and the subsequent economic crisis led to a change in the political order and, in May 2010, to the first coalition government since the second world war. Bankers' heads rolled: Fred Goodwin \u2013 now plain Mr after being stripped of his knighthood last year \u2013 was the first to go, paying the price for the October 2008 bailout. The top bosses at HBOS were not far behind, and shortly afterwards those of Lloyds and Barclays were gone. The regulatory system discredited by the crisis has also been overhauled: the Financial Services Authority watchdog was shut down and replaced with a new Prudential Regulation Authority inside the Bank of England and a Financial Conduct Authority in the former offices of the City regulator. But this is not enough for some. Myners sees the regulatory changes as largely cosmetic. He says he never believed the regulatory architecture was to blame for the banking crisis, and adds that these changes are \"quite modest\". Modest they may be, but they are causing confusion. The debate about the structure of the banking industry and the amount of capital banks should hold is still raging. The government is still trying to decide whether RBS \u2013 bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayers' money in 2008 and 2009 \u2013 should be broken up. And there's still no clear answer on how much capital banks should be required to hold, although a level was set in an international agreement known as the Third Basel Accord (Basel III), hammered out in Switzerland and scheduled to be introduced from this year. Turner, who has in the past said that banks' capital ratio should be higher (Basel is aiming at a minimum 7% by 2019; more for big firms), now says former Bank of England governor Lord King was correct in his obsession with this issue. \"Mervyn was always a capital hawk, saying banks needed a lot more capital,\" Turner says. \"In retrospect, he was right\u2026 If I was a benevolent dictator of a greenfield global economy, free to make decisions without worrying about either international negotiations or transition difficulties, I would go for much higher capital ratios even than Basel III.\" Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition's review into the future of banking and came up with the idea of ringfencing, last week called for capital ratios of 20% \u2013 four times the amount of capital RBS was holding when it nearly collapsed, and more than double that required under international rules. But debate is still raging about how to measure that capital. The focus has shifted from a straightforward capital ratio \u2013 which allows banks to use their own models to measure the risks they run \u2013 to a leverage ratio, where banks are not allowed to make judgments about whether some assets are riskier than others. At the moment, that ratio is set at 3%. The debate has blown up a into row between the regulators and the banks, the latter arguing that being forced to hold more capital means they lend less to businesses and households. Using the leverage ratio has forced Barclays into a \u00a35.8bn cash call \u2013 the prospectus for which is due this week. This sum is less than the bank needed to find to escape a government bailout in 2008, but is still one of the largest ever by a UK bank. Myners and others, however, reckon that even this leverage requirement is too low. \"A 3% leverage ratio is still very thin, yet the banks have been able to convince the media that it will cause them to reduce their lending [if it is any higher],\" says Myners. He reckons that a mere 3% capital requirement (which enables a bank to lend more than 30 times as much as the capital it holds) is \"simply planning for failure\". Darling laments that the international call to action made in the immediate aftermath of the crisis has lost urgency as memories of the panic fades. Darling says: \"My biggest regret is that the collective will that was there in 2008-09 had disappeared by 2010.\" Since the crisis, the reputation of bankers has been damaged even further by a range of scandals such as those over mis-sold payment protection insurance in the UK, the repossessions that followed the US sub-prime mortgage bond debacle and the rigging of Libor. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC \u2013 which was itself hit with a \u00a31.2bn fine for breaching money laundering rules in the US \u2013 says the problems are more deep-seated: \"The focus has been on capital because we can measure it. But the real issue is about culture.\" Attempts to change that culture focused on the bonus system. When the crisis hit, the finger was pointed directly at bankers' bonuses, which had encouraged a culture of risk-taking: bankers stood to earn huge potential rewards, but with no penalty for making losses and no threat of losing payments if deals went bad years later. The City regulator was one of the first in Europe to stop all-cash bonuses and demand that a proportion be paid in shares and spread over three years \u2013 the rationale being that this will make bankers think more carefully about their long-term actions. Even so, in the first official audit of City pay, published in 2010, the regulator revealed that more than 2,800 topfinancial staff had been paid more than \u00a31m in the year after the bailouts. Since then, data published by the European Banking Authority has shown that more than 2,400 bankers were paid more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3870,000) in 2011. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that bonuses in the finance and insurance sector are heading back towards levels seen during the 2006- 07 boom, when they reached close to \u00a320bn. And in the year to April 2013, some \u00a314bn was paid out in bonuses in the financial sector. But another way to change banking culture is to change the ways banks operate. The Vickers proposals currently weaving their way through parliament require a ringfence to be erected between high street banks and \"casino\" investment banks. HSBC's Flint says this will show exactly where the risks lie. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the bank of England, welcomes the ringfence plan but adds: \"It's not the answer on its own.\" While the Vickers proposals were more radical than many had expected after the May 2010 election, they are moderate compared with the Glass-Steagall reforms of the post-Depression era in the US, where full separation between investment banks and high street banks was mandatory \u2013 a reform that lasted until 1999, when lobbying by investment banks saw it swept away. Yet even people who were directly involved in bailing out the banks have argued against such separation. Darling points out that a ringfence would not have stopped the collapses of Northern Rock or HBOS \u2013 \"bog-standard high street banks that got into trouble\". Many now fear that more trouble is brewing. Myners says: \"We would be naive to say we could not have another crisis in the next 10 years or so.\" Darling does not set a timeframe for a further crisis but fears it will come: \"People will forget,\" the former chancellor says. \"Once the people who were there in 2008 have left [their jobs], the banks will lose their institutional memory.\" Senior Bank of England director Andy Haldane is also concerned about a forgetful City. In a speech this month he said: \"Financial crises underscore the importance of a policymaker with institutional memory. This reduces the risk of disaster myopia, of ignoring worrying dots on distant horizons, of being information-rich yet attention-poor, of forgetting fat tails. To misquote Mark Twain, although crises do not repeat themselves, they do rhyme.\" Areas of concern now include the shadowy, unregulated banking sector in China and the weak lenders in the eurozone, many of which are still being kept afloat by the European Central Bank. \"In Europe there is complete failure to deal with the banks apart from on a piecemeal basis,\" says Darling. He points out that much of the money was lost because of good old-fashioned lending errors rather than \"fancy footwork\". This means there is reason to fear such mistakes could be repeating themselves \u2013 in, for example, the schemes created by Chancellor George Osborne to get the housing market moving. As much as he insisted last week that he was not creating a housing bubble, a record number of people are now employed in the estate agency business, housebuilders are once again reporting queues to snap up new homes and prices are rising at their fastest rate since the 2006 peak. Business secretary Vince Cable last week said Osborne should consider postponing the next stage of Help to Buy. Darling is not impressed either: \"The risk is putting more in people's pockets to chase the housing stock that's there. I am worried that will create another housing bubble where people think houses are worth more than they are.\" Turner puts its more bluntly: \"The cure for this hangover, it seems, is the hair of the dog that bit us.\"",

In a speech this month he said: \"Financial crises underscore the importance of a policymaker with institutional memory. This reduces the risk of disaster myopia, of ignoring worrying dots on distant horizons, of being information-rich yet attention-poor, of forgetting fat tails. To misquote Mark Twain, although crises do not repeat themselves, they do rhyme.\"</p> <p>Areas of concern now include the shadowy, unregulated banking sector in China and the weak lenders in the eurozone, many of which are still being kept afloat by the European Central Bank. \"In Europe there is complete failure to deal with the banks apart from on a piecemeal basis,\" says Darling.</p> <p>He points out that much of the money was lost because of good old-fashioned lending errors rather than \"fancy footwork\". This means there is reason to fear such mistakes could be repeating themselves \u2013 in, for example, the schemes created by Chancellor George Osborne to get the housing market moving. As much as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/26/george-osborne-help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">insisted last week that he was not creating a housing bubble</a>, a record number of people are now employed in the estate agency business, housebuilders are once again reporting queues to snap up new homes and prices are rising at their fastest rate since the 2006 peak.</p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable last week said Osborne should consider postponing the next stage of Help to Buy. Darling is not impressed either: \"The risk is putting more in people's pockets to chase the housing stock that's there. I am worried that will create another housing bubble where people think houses are worth more than they are.\"</p> <p>Turner puts its more bluntly: \"The cure for this hangover, it seems, is the hair of the dog that bit us.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ben Bernanke may finally announce on Wednesday that he is about to start weaning the world off quantitative easing. If so, no one can claim to be surprised. He has spent the past four months carefully laying the groundwork for the idea that the Federal Reserve's monster bond-buying spree can't last forever. Most Fed-watchers believe any first move towards \"tapering\" is likely to be symbolic, rather than drastic: perhaps a $10bn or $15bn reduction in the size of monthly spending on Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Tapering would be a vote of confidence by the Fed's decision-makers: the US housing market appears to have turned and new jobs are being created at a steady rate. But a decision to start withdrawing the drug of super-cheap money is also partly a recognition that, as the Bank of International Settlements warned recently, it may be doing more harm than good. QE on the unprecedented scale unleashed by the world's central banks since the 2008 crisis was always a vast and risky experiment. Withdrawing it is the next, equally untried, step, and there are hazards on all sides. It could go wrong in at least four ways. First, while Bernanke plans to control the process carefully (that's why it's called a taper), markets trade on prediction and extrapolation, and tend to run ahead of themselves. The moment tapering is under way, there is always a risk that investors will \"run for the door,\" as the International Monetary Fund put it earlier this year \u2013 dumping bonds, forcing up interest rates and choking off the recovery the Fed had hoped to nurture tenderly. The second risk relates to another current in the market: the so-called \"commodity supercycle\". Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting suggested last week that, with Chinese growth easing, there is early evidence that the supercycle may be coming to an end. While it has been impossible to disentangle the influence of QE from other causes of high raw-materials prices in the past couple of years, it seems certain that at least some of the billions poured into Wall Street must have found their way into commodity speculation. If the \"supercycle\" turns, Jones argues, central bankers could find themselves confronting the risk of deflation with few tools left to fight it. Third, on the flipside, tapering may be so modest that it will barely be noticed by consumers and businesses out in the real economy, away from the frenzy of Wall Street. If confidence continues to flood back, reawakening Americans' animal spirits, the Fed could find itself rushing to catch up as inflation takes off: and while it can ratchet up interest rates rapidly, flogging off trillions of dollars' worth of assets to suck the stimulus of cheap money back out of the economy can't be done overnight. Monetary policy is always a balancing act; but as HSBC's chief US economist Kevin Logan pointed out last week, after collecting assets for much of the past five years the Fed's balance sheet, at close to $3tn, is now so huge as to create problems of its own \u2013 not least the risk of sustaining huge losses if bond prices plummet. Indeed, he suggested that this concern may contribute to any decision to taper this week. \"As time goes on, the balance-sheet costs and risks increase. That gradually lowers the bar for what is acceptable in terms of progress on job gains and economic growth.\" The fourth reason to be wary \u2013 as has already been vividly illustrated by the chaos inflicted on a succession of emerging markets since tapering was first mooted in May \u2013 is that there are likely to be painful unintended consequences thousands of miles away. India, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil: governments across the emerging world have been battling to contain the risks of a full-blown financial crisis as the hot money that poured in as a result of QE drains back out again. To some extent, it's not Bernanke's job to worry about that, and it will be left to the IMF to clear up the mess with loans if the worst does happen. But as the events of 2008 and 2009 showed so clearly, the inevitable consequence of globalisation is that causation flows every which way through the world economy. An isolated ripple or two in countries with specific, well-known challenges, such as India, might be containable (though domestically devastating); a more widespread downturn among emerging economies, prompted by the financial turmoil, would be likely to hit the US itself, potentially forcing the Fed to reverse course. Bernanke's successor is expected to be announced in the next couple of months, with the frontrunner being Larry Summers, the Teflon Ivy League professor who was a cheerleader for financial deregulation, but has won Barack Obama's support with his staunch defence of the president's economic stimulus policies. For Bernanke, who built his reputation on studying the policy pitfalls that marked the runup to the Great Depression and the \"lost decade\" in Japan, it would be a neat swansong to announce the beginning of the end for QE, which he was instrumental in dragging out of the textbooks and into the real world. But it would be a mistake to regard an announcement as anything but the start of a very long road. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, appeared to be one of those lucky policymakers who got out just in time, waltzing out of the Fed in 2006 \u2013 but he didn't escape opprobrium when the bubble he helped inflate spectacularly burst. If phasing out QE doesn't go smoothly, Bernanke too may find his reputation tarnished long after he has returned to the safety of his ivory tower.",
