      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote has battered consumer sentiment in the UK, a survey has found, highlighting worries about the economic outlook and fears over inflation. The market researcher GfK recorded the biggest slide in consumer confidence for 21 years in its one-off poll following the referendum on 23 June. The group, which has been monitoring UK consumer confidence since the 1970s, said measures of confidence about the economic outlook, people\u2019s personal finances and big purchases, had all fallen, according to the post-referendum poll of 2,002 people run between 30 June and 5 July. The headline confidence index fell to -9 after the poll from -1 in the regular June survey carried out before the referendum. The compilers said that by splitting the results as to how people said they had voted, they had found that those who had opted for remaining in the European Union were at -13, while leavers appeared more optimistic, at -5. \u201cDuring this period of uncertainty, we\u2019ve seen a very significant drop in confidence, as is clear from the fact that every one of our key measures has fallen, with the biggest decrease occurring in the outlook for the general economic situation in the next 12 months,\u201d said Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK. Six in 10 respondents, or 60%, expected the general economic situation to worsen in the next 12 months, up from 46% in June. Only 20% of consumers expected it to improve, down from 27% in June. The proportion of people who believed prices would increase rapidly in the next 12 months jumped 20 percentage points from 13% to 33%. There were distinct differences in how confidence had altered regionally, GfK said. In the north of England confidence had dropped 19 points and in Scotland it had fallen 11 points. In southern England, including London, there was a two-point drop. The survey chimes with separate polls by YouGov and the consultancy Cebr, conducted both before and after the referendum. They revealed a crash in consumer confidence after the result was announced. Anecdotal evidence suggests consumers have become more cautious about big purchases and about buying property as the outlook for jobs, wages and house prices becomes more uncertain. Marks &amp; Spencer reported its biggest fall in clothing sales in more than a decade on Thursday as its new chief executive, Steve Rowe, said confidence had weakened in the run-up to the EU referendum. The accountants BDO published a report on Friday suggesting there was an immediate drop-off in sales after the leave vote and that last month marked the weakest June performance for the high street for more than a decade. Footfall successively declined as the month went on, with the worst performance coming in the final week of June as the leave vote was confirmed, BDO said. Worries about employment were fanned on Thursday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which said that the vote to leave the EU could exacerbate the UK\u2019s already weak recovery in pay growth since the financial crisis. Brexit also \u201crepresented a cloud over the UK\u2019s recent ability to create jobs\u201d, the OECD said in its annual employment outlook. The OECD highlighted the UK as suffering from one of the weakest pay recoveries among its 34 member countries and urged the government to do more to raise living standards. That call was echoed by the Trades Union Congress. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said: \u201cWorkers are still paying the price from the last recession, with UK wage growth far behind the rest of the OECD. With the OECD warning that Brexit will harm jobs and growth, we need urgent action from government to make sure that workers do not pay the price again.\u201d A separate report suggested that Brexit worries were also weighing on recruitment in the UK ahead of the referendum. The number of people placed in permanent positions fell in June, marking the first decline in 45 months, according to a monthly jobs report from the data company Markit and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC). There was also a slowdown in salary growth for permanent and temporary roles, according to the report, which was compiled with data from recruitment firms collected between 13 and 24 June. Almost all responses were collected before the EU referendum result was known, REC said. \u201cUncertainty during the run-up to the referendum saw many employers suspend permanent hiring and instead bring in temporary, contractor or interim staff to hedge against potential changes to their growth prospects,\u201d said REC\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Green. \u201cWhile it is too early to assess what the impact of the vote to leave the EU will be on jobs, our data underlines the need for uncertainty to be minimised so that our economy and our labour market are not adversely affected. The best thing for business right now is clear and calm leadership and as much clarity as possible on what the post-EU future will look like.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Marks &amp; Spencer merry-go-round, where Britain\u2019s most famous high street retailer goes round in circles for years trying to fix its ailing clothing business. Thursday\u2019s stop on the carousel is at the delayed summer sale, an option used by M&amp;S chiefs to show that they are focused on permanently lowering prices for shoppers, rather than on one-off promotions. Other stops include hiring new style directors, relaunching the clothing range and changing the logo, all options taken by the former chief executive Marc Bolland. Steve Rowe, Bolland\u2019s replacement, said his plan to turn around the dire performance of M&amp;S\u2019s clothing business is to focus on lowering everyday prices and drastically cut the number of promotions. This has led to M&amp;S running 28 fewer promotional events in the past three months and moving its summer sale to July, later than usual. Rowe\u2019s strategy hurt sales in the last quarter, which fell an eye-watering 8.9% in clothing and home on a like-for-like basis. But the M&amp;S chief executive said he is seeing \u201cencouraging early signs\u201d. M&amp;S has been here before, though. Rewind to 9 July 2005 and the then M&amp;S chief executive Stuart Rose was trying to explain a 10.3% drop in clothing and home sales. \u201cWe have made good progress. This has enabled us to delay the summer sale by 18 days. We go on sale tomorrow with 40% less stock than last year,\u201d he said. If you also go back to 7 January 2009, another disappointing trading update, there are further similarities with Rowe\u2019s strategy. Rose talks about closing shops, cutting head office jobs and changing M&amp;S\u2019s generous benefits scheme, all options that are under consideration once again. This does not mean there is anything wrong with Rowe\u2019s strategy. As a keen M&amp;S historian who has worked for the company for more than 25 years, he is well aware of the paths taken by his predecessor. However, what this does show is that nearly 20 years after M&amp;S reached its peak by recording pre-tax profits of more than \u00a31bn in 1998, there are no easy answers to getting its clothing business growing again. Rowe needs time. He should also be encouraged to be radical by the M&amp;S board. This means closing stores \u2013 M&amp;S has far more than its rivals \u2013 or even bringing clothing production back to Britain. Alternatively, it could be time for M&amp;S and its shareholders to accept that it will continue losing market share to online and international clothing rivals, such as Primark, Zara and H&amp;M, and put more resources into its impressive food business instead. Eye off the ball Any sportswear retailer in Britain should have been focused on two things in the last week - making sure they take advantage of Wales\u2019s run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and protecting themselves from the repercussions of the Brexit vote. Sports Direct appears to have failed on both counts. It does not sell the official Wales kit because Adidas, the manufacturer, wants to deal with other retailers. Sports Direct has also warned that a fall in the value of sterling after the EU referendum will hit the cost of buying goods abroad. Neither of these points are unforgivable if you are shareholder in Sports Direct. Adidas is a major supplier, so any cracks in the relationship are damaging. However, the warning about foreign exchange costs, which analysts said could lead to \u201cpretty remarkable\u201d pain on profit margins, is worse. Sports Direct has not had a permanent finance director since Bob Mellors stepped down in December 2013. Matt Pearson was named as the acting chief financial officer in June 2015, and a year on, he still has \u201cacting\u201d in his title. This is shocking corporate governance at any time, but it is even more important now that Sports Direct\u2019s hedging of foreign exchanges will determine how much of a financial hit it takes from Brexit. Pearson could be a talented and competent stand-in, but if so, Sports Direct and its founder, Mike Ashley, need to end the uncertainty by giving him the job permanently. The company is treading on dangerous ground by not having a permanent finance director during a time of volatility in financial markets. Sports Direct is simply giving investors another reason to not to buy shares in the company.",

      "bodyText": "Shopping centres, office blocks and warehouses worth up to \u00a35bn could be put up for sale as the turmoil in the UK commercial property sector prompted by the Brexit vote forces fund managers to revalue their portfolios or temporarily prevent investors withdrawing their savings. With the pound under pressure on the foreign exchange markets, fund managers Legal &amp; General, Foreign &amp; Colonial and Dutch-owned Kames cut the value of their property funds on Thursday. L&amp;G cut the value of its \u00a32.3bn fund by 10% \u2013 following a 5% cut last week \u2013 while F&amp;C and Kanes both cut by 5%. Aberdeen Fund Management announced on Wednesday it was halting trading in its property fund for 24 hours and devaluing it by 17% \u2013 thought to be the biggest adjustment ever made by a property fund . Aberdeen has since extended the trading ban until Monday. Others have suspended dealings for longer, starting with Standard Life\u2019s decision on Monday to halt trading in its \u00a32.9bn commercial property fund, leading to a cascade effect with Aviva, Prudential\u2019s M&amp;G, Henderson, Columbia Threadneedle and Canada Life following suit \u2013 taking the total value of property funds suspended to \u00a318bn. Mike Prew, equity analyst at Jefferies, said buildings could be sold to find the cash to repay investors in the funds: \u201cWe estimate that \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn of assets could be put up for sale but it\u2019s a trading vacuum and what sells is likely to get a hefty Brexit discount. \u201cBuildings are now being readied for sale but keys to cash can typically take three to six months.\u201d One of the factors weighing on sentiment is uncertainty about the role of London as a financial centre outside the EU. George Osborne, the chancellor, met the heads of major international banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Thursday to discuss ways to keep the City as a major trading centre. \u201cWe are determined to work together,\u201d they said in a joint statement. Ratings agency Fitch cited \u201cdeterioration in market confidence for London City offices following the UK vote to leave the EU\u201d as it downgraded a complex bond \u2013 known as Ulysses \u2013 secured against the City Point skyscraper. The property fund sector has been a focus since the Brexit vote and was highlighted in the Bank of England\u2019s assessment of risks to markets, published on Tuesday. Threadneedle Street cited these open-ended commercial property funds, which offer almost instant access to cash, as having the potential to exacerbate problems in the market. The turmoil has coincided with pressure on the pound, which has been trading at 31-year lows and on Thursday remained below $1.30, well off the $1.50 it reached when the polls closed on 23 June. However, the London stock market has steadied, with the FTSE 100 gaining more than 1% to 6,533 and the FTSE 250 \u2013 regarded as a better barometer for the UK economy and at one point off this week 10% since the referendum \u2013 rallying by 1% on Thursday to 15,898. Yields on UK government bonds \u2013 known as gilts \u2013 which have halved to 0.7% since the referendum are also being watched as investors seek safe havens and brace for a cut to interest rates as soon as next Thursday. Analysts at Barclays struck a cautious note as they lowered the forecast for UK growth in 2017 to minus 0.4%. \u201cWe believe investors should position for a less benign economic and financial environment than is priced into global risk assets,\u201d the Barclays analysts said. Jason Hollands, managing director of Tilney Bestinvest, said: \u201cDealing in the property funds could be suspended, possibly, for the remainder of the year.\u201d He said the revaluations were pre-emptive moves. \u201cActual commercial property transaction volumes could remain low for some months as deals go back to investment committees and businesses await greater line of sight on who will lead the negotiations between the UK and EU over Brexit and their opening stances,\u201d said Hollands. Great Portland, which develops and invests in offices, retail space and housing in the West End and other parts of central London, echoed this sentiment, warning it expected London\u2019s commercial property markets to weaken during the uncertainty. British Land, however, announced it had sold the Oxford Street branch of Debenhams for \u00a3400m to an unnamed private investor \u2013 although it gave no details of any profit on the sale of the seven-storey flagship department store building. Since the referendum, it said it had exchanged 11 long-term retail leases on terms agreed prior to the vote. \u201cBritish Land has entered this period of post-referendum uncertainty in a robust position,\u201d said Chris Grigg, chief executive of British Land.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell\u2019s consortium allegedly planned to write off debts that it owed to BHS and keep a stake in the retailer\u2019s international business as part of a proposed rescue deal with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct. Members of Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, would also have kept their jobs at BHS for at least six months after selling the company to Sports Direct under the proposed deal. The proposed terms would have allowed Retail Acquisitions to continue making a profit from BHS after selling it to Sports Direct. They have been revealed in evidence submitted by former BHS chief executive Darren Topp to MPs investigating the demise of the retailer. The latest news could further anger BHS staff who face losing their jobs and having their pension benefits cut. The collapse of the company is already one of the most contentious business failures in Britain this century because Sir Philip Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m from BHS during his period in charge, while Retail Acquisitions banked at least \u00a317m during its 13-month ownership. BHS and Sports Direct were in talks about a rescue deal in the days before BHS collapsed into administration in April. The failure of BHS has put 11,000 jobs at risk and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Chappell insisted that Retail Acquisitions\u2019 demands were not the reason the deal with Sports Direct fell apart. He blamed Green, BHS\u2019s main creditor, for setting \u201cpreposterous\u201d time restraints on reaching a deal and securing the backing of the Pensions Regulator. According to what Topp claims is an extract from the proposed deal between Retail Acquisitions and Sports Direct, BHS would have been sold to Ashley\u2019s company for \u00a31. In return, a \u00a36m loan from BHS to Retail Acquisitions would be waived, the valuable international business would be hived off into a separate vehicle that was 49% owned by Retail Acquisitions, and the management services agreement between BHS and Retail Acquisitions would remain in place for at least six months, meaning Chappell\u2019s consortium would continue to receive fees and keep their roles within the retailer. However, Chappell denied that Retail Acquisitions was trying to profit from BHS even as it collapsed. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want this coming across that even in the 11th hour we were trying to make a profit. We simply were not. This is what we were trying to do to save the company and these were the terms and conditions that Sports Direct wanted us to sign up for.\u201d Chappell insisted that the waiving of the \u00a36m loan had only been in draft proposals and was eventually removed from the final agreement. He added: \u201cObviously we discussed it with them to see if we could waive it because it depends on how that debt was booked, whether it was booked through BHS or into RAL [Retail Acquisitions] or whatever. But we kept it as a debt within BHS.\u201d Chappell also said the management services was extended at the \u201cbehest\u201d of Sports Direct and that Retail Acquisitions was going to take a stake in the international business because Ashley\u2019s company had no interest in running it. \u201cThe negotiation with us staying on for six months was at the behest of Sports Direct because they didn\u2019t just want us leaving on day one. They needed someone to run the business for them during that period of time,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cThe international business was something that we discussed with Sports Direct, and Sports Direct wanted to give us a position in there so we really drove that piece that of the business forward. They did not want to run the international business.\u201d Chappell also criticised Topp, who has previously accused the former owner of BHS of threatening to kill him. \u201cDarren Topp was nowhere near the negotiations whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he has got is a draft form, he doesn\u2019t have any finished form because that is a Retail Acquisitions document. So I don\u2019t know where he has got that document from. \u201cWe and Sports Direct wanted to do the deal, the deal was agreed, we actually gave them our shares for a \u00a31 [payment] and we were going to do the transaction. It\u2019s just that we could not do it in the time frame that was given to us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis may soon have to find a new managing director after it was rumoured that Andy Street wants to stand for mayor of the West Midlands. Street, who has headed the department store for nine years and spent more than 30 years at its parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, is said to be preparing to put himself forward as a Conservative party candidate in the election next May. The West Midlands Conservatives said no formal list of candidates has been drawn up and it will not be finalising the selection until the autumn, but the Birmingham Post has reported that Street is putting in an application. This week\u2019s edition of the paper features an editorial from Street in which he argues that the region \u201cmust be the leading part of the national solution\u201d following the EU referendum vote. He says the West Midlands has to push through the development of HS2, the high-speed rail link between London, Birmingham and Leeds, adding that that the region\u2019s automotive, aerospace, life sciences and professional services industries \u201care all now proven as internationally competitive\u201d. \u201cWe must, as we have over the last five years, emerge as a victor from this time of change. And that is undoubtedly a realistic prospect if we play our cards well,\u201d writes Street, who is the chair of the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership, the body tasked with driving economic growth in the region. Street, a politics, philosophy and economics graduate, retains a keen interest in politics and was a member of the prime minister\u2019s business advisory group. Reports of Street\u2019s political ambitions come after the former managing director of Waitrose Mark Price left the supermarket and became minister for trade and investment. Sir Stuart Hampson, the former chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, was a civil servant for 12 years before joining the company. John Lewis declined to comment and Street was unavailable for comment.",

    "webTitle": "Lagarde urges speedy Brexit deal as City sees pound hitting new lows \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, after another busy day of financial twists and turns. Britain has been threatened with the spectre of the pound falling towards parity with the US dollar. Mohamed El-Erian of investment giant Allianz warned that sterling could hit record lows, unless politicians get their act together and negotiate a new agreement with the EU. He told Reuters that: The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar. Three investment banks have warned that the pound will fall to $1.20, or lower, this year. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, has also weighed in. She fears Britain\u2019s economy will suffer long-term damage if the uncertainty following last month\u2019s EU referendum isn\u2019t resolved soon. Senior bosses at the world\u2019s largest banks have promised to help London retain its place as a global financial hub.... ...But the boss of JP Morgan has reiterated that thousands of London-based jobs will be lost if the City loses its \u2018passport\u2019 into the UK. UK consumers have been warned that the slump in the pound will soon hit their purses and wallets: Cocoa prices are at a 39-year high, when priced in sterling, which could make chocolate more expensive Lenovo, the IT firm, has said it might raise prices There are also several signs that the UK economy is weakening: The NIESR thinktank has reported that the economy contracted in June Barclays has predicted that UK GDP will shrink by 0.4% during 2017 Three commercial property funds, F&amp;C, L&amp;G and CPPA, have cut the value of their assets. Up to \u00a35bn of real estate is now on sale, possibly at bargain prices, as fund managers try to cash in illiquid assets to pay investors It\u2019s been a better day in the market, though. The pound clawed its way above $1.30, although it has now dipped back towards yesterday\u2019s 31-year lows. And Europe\u2019s stock markets have just closed with gains across the board. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 1.1% to 6533, a gain of 70 points. The smaller FTSE 250 rose by 1.66%. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight. GW Worrying signs from Germany: Analysts at Barclays have slashed their growth forecast for next year, predicting that the Brexit vote will cause \u201cprolonged uncertainty and financial stress.\u201d They now expect the UK economy to contact by 0.4% next year, down from growth of 1.8% previously. They also cut their euro area growth forecast to 0.6%, down from 1.7%. Barclays also see several flashpoints in the months ahead which could even put the future of the eurozone in doubt again: For example, the UK-EU exit negotiations could turn rancorous. And market upheaval could be even greater if an EMU country were to actively question EU membership; redenomination risk could return. Hence, investors are likely to pay close attention to the October referendum on constitutional reforms in Italy, as well as the general elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany in 2017. Any outcome that helps anti-EU political parties would likely be poorly received by markets Newsflash: The British economy appears to have contracted last month. New figures from the National Institute Of Economic and Social Research indicate that the economy was weakening, even before Britons headed to the polls. NIESR estimates that the economy grew by 0.6% in the April-June quarter, up from 0.4% in January-March. So far so good.... But before anyone gets the bunting out, NIERS also estimate that strong growth in April fizzled out in May, leading to the economy shrinking in June. Jack Meaning, Research Fellow at NIESR, explains: \u201cAt first glance this represents a robust rate of quarterly growth for the UK economy. However, the quarterly figure masks an important within-quarter pattern. Our monthly estimates suggest that April saw a large expansion in GDP, which then stagnated in May. The estimate for June is one of an intensifying contraction across the board, but this is not enough to offset the very strong April numbers. What it does suggest is that when April drops out of the 3 month calculation we should see a quick deterioration of growth, especially if the estimated contraction in June persists or accelerates into July and beyond.\u201d Fancy buying a supermarket or an office block? It could be your lucky day. Somewhere between \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn of direct real estate is now up for sale, as commercial real estate funds try to generate cash to pay redemptions to investors. And as it is a buyers market, some assets could be sold pretty cheaply. Investment bank Jefferies is scathing about the \u2018open-ended\u2019 funds which have invested in property on the way up. Six funds have now locked the exit doors this week; Standard Life, Aviva, M&amp;S, Columbia, Canada Life and Henderson. Jefferies accuses them of selling \u201csnake oil\u201d to retail investors, by guaranteeing liquidity while investing in a notoriously illiquid asset class. You can\u2019t just sell a tower block in a few days, which is why redemptions are now frozen. Jefferies analysts predict more pain ahead: Now the virtuous cycle is turning into a vicious circle of redemptions, REIT sales, gating, discounted asset sales, lower fund valuations, and Major (Ret\u2019d) &amp; Mrs Smith complaining in the Sunday Times Money Section that they never read the small print and then more redemptions etc. etc. [REIT = real estate investment trusts; companies who generate an income from owning commercial property ] Newsflash: Another investment fund has cut the value of its property funds, following L&amp;G and Foreign &amp; Colonial. This time it\u2019s CCLA, which invests money for a range of charities, religious groups and the public sector. It has lopped 4.5% off the value of its funds, which were worth \u00a31.3bn. In another sign of Brexit tensions, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has revised down its opinion of several UK banks. It has cut Barclays\u2019 outlook to negative, from stable, and also lowered Royal Bank of Scotland to stable, from positive. It blames \u201cpotential economic deterioration\u201d following the EU vote, and says the UK is \u201centering a correction phase\u201d, in which consumer confidence will suffer. There are fresh rumblings in the UK commercial property market, where the Brexit vote continues to alarm investors. Two more funds have announced that the value of their shopping centres, office blocks and suchlike has fallen sharply in the last two weeks. Legal &amp; General cut the value of its \u00a32.3bn property fund by 10% \u2013 following a 5% cut last week \u2013 while Foreign &amp; Colonial cut the value of its \u00a3290m fund by 5%. L&amp;G also warned that it\u2019s too early to know the full impact of the EU referendum vote. Just in: The latest US employment survey has beaten expectations. Some 172,000 new private sector jobs were created in June, some 13,000 more than expected. We get the main US jobs report tomorrow, the Non-Farm Payroll, and that will show if Brexit worries had any impact on hiring last month. Christine Lagarde also warned that the global economy could suffer if Britain enters a limbo state where it delays the process of leaving the EU. Do we have a forecast and scenario with prolonged uncertainty, total lack of clarity, no triggering of Article 50 [the official notification required to leave the EU], things staying in limbo for a long period of time? No. We don\u2019t have that. We doubt that it would be sustainable politically, geopolitically. More here: Lagarde warns Trump-style protectionism would hit world economy Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has called on Britain to resolve its relationship with the European Union quickly, to limit the economic damage of Brexit. She\u2019s echoing Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning that uncertainty will hurt the UK economy. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lagarde says: \u201cWe want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making. The IMF believes could UK cushion the impact of leaving the EU by agreeing a Norway-style agreement (basically getting access to the single market, but also agreeing to EU laws and freedom of movement). That would only cut 1.5% off GDP growth by 2019 However, if the UK clatters out of the EU without a new trade deal, it will revert to standard WTO tariffs - meaning the economy would be 4.5% smaller than otherwise by the end of the decade. The boss of the WTO has already warned that this would cost consumers \u00a39bn per year. It\u2019s not clear when the UK can deliver the clarity which Lagarde is seeking. This morning, foreign secretary Philip Hammond told MPs that the government simply isn\u2019t in a position to start \u2018substantive negotiations\u2019 with Brussels. The pound has broken back over the $1.30 mark, away from yesterday\u2019s 31-year low of $1.28 (and further away from dollar parity, of course). It appears that some calm has returned to the markets, after some wild days. But analysts are expecting sterling to keep dropping. fastFT have the details: Deutsche Bank believes that sterling is in line to fall as far as $1.15, while HSBC has set $1.20 as its target for the end of the year. Goldman Sachs has a three-month target of $1.20. Five top executives from the biggest international banks based in London have pledged to work together to protect the City following the Brexit vote Bosses from Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan issued the promise, after a meeting with chancellor George Osborne. They cite Britain\u2019s \u201cbrilliant workforce\u201d and \u201cstable legal systems\u201d as key assets. Here\u2019s the statement: Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges which we are determined to work together to meet. We will also work together to identify the new opportunities that may now become available so that Britain remains one of the most attractive places in the world to do business. One of Britain\u2019s key economic strengths is that it is a world leading financial centre. It has one of the most stable legal systems in the world, a brilliant workforce and deep, liquid capital markets unmatched anywhere else in Europe, all of which are underpinned by world class regulators. In recent years it has established itself as a global hub for renminbi, rupee, Islamic finance and green finance, as well as leading in new markets such as FinTech. Today we met and agreed that we would work together to build on all this with a common aim to help London retain its position as the leading international financial centre. It\u2019s signed by: Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne Mr Bill Winters, CBE, (Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered) Mr Michael Sherwood, (Vice Chairman and co-CEO, Goldman Sachs International) Mr Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, (President (Europe and Emerging markets excl. Asia), Bank of America Merrill Lynch) Mr Robert Rooney, (CEO, Morgan Stanley International) Mr Viswas Raghavan, (Deputy CEO and Head of Investment Banking (EMEA), JP Morgan) According to the financial markets, there\u2019s a high chance that the Bank of England will cut interest rates to new record lows next week. Ben Brettell of investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown has drilled down into the interest-rate swaps traded in the City, and reports that they imply: 78% chance of a cut next week [the decision is due on Thursday] 86% chance of a cut by August, with a 27% chance rates will be 0% by then 89% chance of a cut by December, with a 34% chance rates will be 0% and an 8% chance rates will be negative by then He explains: Initially August had looked more likely, but with economic data deteriorating and markets still nervous, it now looks probable the Monetary Policy Committee will adjudge that immediate action is warranted. Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning that the pound could fall to parity with the dollar unless UK politicians urgently devise a Brexit plan has sent ripples through the City today. Andrew Edwards, CEO of ETX Capital, report: \u201cThe chatter on forex desks is that the pound could hit parity with the dollar. Although not impossible, this seems a little far-fetched as sterling would have to drop considerably from where it is now. Parity would represent an all-time low for the pound. Deutsche Bank is pessimistic with its forecast of $1.15 for cable \u2013 the consensus is $1.20. It all depends what the Bank of England does next week -- a rate cut (to a new alltime low) could easily send the pound tumbling. But Mark Carney and colleagues could vote to leave borrowing costs unchanged, which Edwards reckons would be \u201cthe sensible move\u201d. Increasing credit supply doesn\u2019t achieve much if there is no demand and it\u2019s the demand side that matters most. A firm vote to hold rates where they are would send a clear signal to investors that the Bank is confident the UK can weather this storm and that it doesn\u2019t want the pound to drop further. Keeping its powder dry would mean it has ammunition for another day, should financial conditions get a lot worse. The boss of investment bank JP Morgan has warned that he may move thousands of jobs out of the City, if Britain loses full access to the single market. Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg that it\u2019s crucial that firms in London retain the ability to \u2018passport\u2019 into other EU countries and sell financial services there. If that passporting rule is broken, then JP Morgan staff will be packing their bags. Dimon explained: \u201cIf we have that passport after Brexit, we likely would not have to make any change at all. \u201cBut I think the European Union will not accept that. It will put more conditions on the U.K. and might force banks to become smaller in London.\u201d Those with memories of the financial crisis might welcome an exodus of bankers. One problem, though, they do provide a lot of tax receipts: The OECD, which urged Britain to stay in the EU ahead of the referendum, has warned that Brexit would \u201crepresents a cloud over the UK\u2019s recent ability to create jobs.\u201d There was a potential impact on wages, too, it said. The UK had suffered from \u201cdisappointing\u201d growth in real wages, partly reflecting weak labour productivity growth of only 2% from 2010 to 2015, the smallest increase in the OECD after Hungary, Italy and Greece. In a briefing on the UK, the OECD says: \u201cAny decline in foreign direct investment in the UK that may result from Brexit could further worsen this poor productivity performance.\u201d The OECD has also warned today that unemployment is still too high in many EU countries: Even in countries where labour market slack has been absorbed, low quality jobs and a high level of labour market inequality are of concern. Many of the workers who lost their jobs during the Great Recession are now back in work, but wage growth remains subdued and job stress is common. More on that later.... The chocolate bar in your pocket may soon cost more, following the sharp falls in the pound. The price of cocoa in sterling terms has hit its highest level since 1977, at \u00a32,487 per tonne. Cocoa\u2019s a key ingredient in chocolate, of course, and the Financial Times reckons we\u2019ll soon see the impact on the shelves. They warn: If the collapse of sterling was not depressing enough, the price of chocolate for UK buyers could get higher as cocoa, the key ingredient hit a 39-year high. Here\u2019s more reaction to Andrea Leadsom\u2019s claims that Britain has a bright economic future after Brexit, and that a weak pound isn\u2019t a problem.... Andrea Leadsom, one of the contenders to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, has heeded Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning that the UK needs to arrange a workable trade deal with Europe. A free trade deal with the EU is vital, Leadsom says, as she outlines her economic platform. She told supporters that \u201cno-one needs to fear\u201d Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, as the government will move carefully. Trade must be the top priority, she says, adding: Britain must get continued tariff-free trade with the EU and continued free trade with other countries as at present, plus agreements with other fast-growing economies. However, she doesn\u2019t give any details about how she\u2019ll negotiate this happy outcome. Our Politics liveblog has all the details: Leadsom was also remarkably upbeat about the financial consequences of the Brexit vote. She claims that the slump in the pound is partly because the markets called the result wrong \u2013 ignoring the fact that economists - correctly - predicted sterling would tumble to current levels. She also argues that lower sterling is good for exports, makes inward investment more attractive, and means Britons will import less and buy more at home. Yes, but it also means goods are going to cost more.... Leadsom also loses marks for declaring that the FTSE 100 is now higher than two weeks ago, without explaining it\u2019s mainly due to the weak pound. Analysts at Deutsche Bank have predicted that the pound will keep falling, and hit $1.15 by the end of 2016. Or worse.... It feels like ancient history now... but new figures show that British industry was growing at its fastest pace in six-years before the EU referendum. UK industrial output jumped by 1.9% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, which is the strongest increase since May 2010. Output did drop by 0.5% in May, but that\u2019s less than the 1% economists expected. So, broadly encouraging -- but we don\u2019t know what impact the referendum result, or the weaker pound, has had yet.... Chinese computer maker Lenovo has warned that it will probably hike its prices following the Brexit vote. The recent slump in the pound\u2019s value means that Lenovo\u2019s UK earnings are now worth around 10% less than before the referendum. Chief financial officer Wai Ming Wong told reporters earlier today price increases are one option being considered, saying: \u201cTo the extent that we need to pass things on to the customer, we will\u201d More here. Mohamed El-Erian\u2019s warning about the pound isn\u2019t causing much angst in the City yet. Most shares on the FTSE 100 are up this morning, led by financial stocks and builders such as Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says: Strong recoveries from the previously battered banking and property stocks provided the thrust of the early growth, helping cable steady itself around $1.295. Construction firms need some relief; they\u2019ve been badly hit by the fallout from the EU vote, losing around a third of the value due to fears of a UK recession. Brexit uncertainty is also casting shadows over Sports Direct, the retail chain that has faced criticism over its working practices. Sports Direct buys many of its products overseas, so the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote is having an immediate impact on current profitability. It also reported this morning that pre-tax earnings fell by 8.4% in the last financial year; meaning the staff bonus scheme won\u2019t pay out. And CEO Dave Forsey warned that consumer confidence will be hit by the \u201ccurrent political uncertainty\u201d. Shares are up 11% this morning, though, suggesting it has done better than the City expected. Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have fallen by 1.7% after the high street chain reported its biggest slump in clothing sales in a decade. Clothing sales at M&amp;S slumped by almost 9% in the last quarter, a jaw-dropping decline, Newish CEO Steve Rose isn\u2019t panicking, saying it\u2019s all part of his plan to cut promotions and offer cheaper prices. But he also admitted that consumer confidence did take a hit in the run-up to the EU referendum. Just in: UK house prices rose by 1.3% in June, according to the Halifax building society. That means the prices grew by 8.4%, year-on-year, in the last quarter. That\u2019s a slight slowdown, but higher than the 7.7% which the City expected. It\u2019s probably too early to see the impact of the Brexit vote on the property market, but July\u2019s figures could be interesting.... The pound is actually quite calm this morning. It\u2019s hovering near 31-year lows against the US dollar and three-year lows against the euro. The pound could fall closer to parity with the US dollar if the Bank of England cuts interest rates closer to zero. Banking analyst Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities believes the BoE should resist slashing borrowing costs from 0.5% to zero. He argues it would send sterling slumping to new 31-year lows. He writes: There is talk of a 50 basis point rate cut next week. Note to Mark Carney: Please don\u2019t. A 50bp cut won\u2019t boost borrowing, but it will almost certainly lead to another drop in cable (the pound/US dollar exchange rate). In our opinion, if rates were kept on hold, then investors (including those overseas UK commercial property investors who are now on the sidelines according the BOE\u2019s own Financial Stability Report) might be tempted to do some bottom-fishing. The London stock market has opened higher this morning, after yesterday\u2019s selloff. The FTSE 100 index, which benefits from a weak pound, has by 80 points or 1.2% to 6543. Commercial property companies are leading the rally, reversing some of their heavy losses this week. The UK-focused FTSE 250 index is also up, gaining 1.1% or 175 points to 15844. Investors are in cheery mood, because Amercia\u2019s central bank released some surprisingly dovish minute last night. That means US interest rates are expected to remain unchanged for many months. George Magnus, senior economic adviser to UBS, also believes that the pound could easily hit parity with the US dollar \u201cif the economy really shudders\u201d He also disputes the idea a weak pound is a great boost for UK exporters In a blog post, Magnus argues that a weak currency is only really useful when there is solid overseas demand for a country\u2019s goods. Today, though, world trade is stagnating and emerging markets growth is slowing.... You should note that the Pound has been falling since it reached $1.71 in July 2014, and yet the UK\u2019s trade and external payments position has gotten steadily worse. In the first quarter of 2016, the UK\u2019s trade deficit was the biggest recorded since 2008. So don\u2019t let anybody tell you that a cheaper currency, plain and simple, is a good thing for the economy. It depends. The British pound could slump to parity with the US dollar unless UK politicians get their act together over the Brexit vote, a top financial figure has warned. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to investment giant Allianz, says the UK government urgently needs to start developing a credible \u201cPlan B\u201d to European Union membership, that gives British firms a free trade agreement with the bloc. Speaking to Reuters, El-Erian warned that sterling is very vulnerable, as: \u201cAfter the Brexit referendum, the UK has to urgently get its political act together, including a new Prime Minister who can negotiate effectively with the EU. Plan B depends on the politicians in London and across the Channel, but so far they have not stepped up to their economic governance responsibilities.\u201d UK negotiations with Brussels are effectively in limbo now, while the Conservative Party choose a new leader to replace prime minister David Cameron. Yesterday, the pound hit a 31-year low of $1.2798 against the US dollar. Traders around the globe are watching nervously to see how Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU changes following last month\u2019s referendum. As El-Erian puts it to Reuters\u2019 Guy Faulconbridge: The future value of sterling is a function of how and how quickly the structural uncertainty is resolved \u2013 if Plan B is delayed and/or it doesn\u2019t involve much of a free trade setup with the EU, it is not inconceivable for sterling to head to parity with the US dollar. The pound\u2019s record low was $1.05, in late February 1985. However, if a deal is reached to give access to the EU single market, the pound could rally back to pre-vote levels. Many EU leaders have warned that access to the single market means accepting the four freedoms of movement - for goods, services, capital and people. Some Leave campaigners, though, argue that Britain could get access and also impose some restrictions on migration. More here: Allianz\u2019s El-Erian says UK must urgently get its act together or dollar parity could beckon Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... we\u2019ll be looking at the impact that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote is having on the UK\u2019s economy, and beyond. Last night, Aberdeen Fund Managers sent a shiver through the City by cutting the value of a property fund by 17% percent and briefly halting redemptions. That came after six commercial property funds froze trading, to prevent a stampede of nervous investors. Could more funds follow today? Financial jitters have hit Australia too, with Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s lowering the country\u2019s credit rating outlook overnight: There\u2019s a flurry of corporate news this morning, including UK retailer Sports Direct and Marks &amp; Spencer. They may be seeing the impact of the EU referendum on their results.

      "bodyText": "Efforts to appoint more women to the boards of Britain\u2019s biggest companies have stalled, while men still exert a tight grip on key decision-making positions, new data has revealed. Less than a quarter of FTSE 100 boardroom recruits in the six months to March 2016 were women, the lowest level since 2011, according to the Female FTSE Board Report. The minister for women and equalities, Nicky Morgan, said the figures showed that \u201cmomentum has not kept pace\u201d, adding that it was time to \u201ccall out those sections of the business community who aren\u2019t doing their bit\u201d. The report charts the progress of the government\u2019s efforts to address the gender divide in British business. In 2011 Mervyn Davies, a former trade minister, asked FTSE 100 businesses to ensure that 25% of directors were women. Lord Davies has since extended the voluntary challenge to all firms in the FTSE 350 and called on them to reach a target of 33% by 2020. But while blue-chip FTSE 100 companies reached a level of 26% in October \u2013 up from 23.5% in March 2015 \u2013 the proportion has not increased since then. Meanwhile FTSE 350 companies remain a long way from Davies\u2019 target, staying at just 22%, and female representation dwindles significantly among the most influential executive positions. Fewer than 10% of the three most senior positions at FTSE 100 firms were held by women, the report says, compared to nearly a third of less powerful non-executive roles. \u201cThere are still more [people] called John chairing FTSE 100 boards than there are women,\u201d said Morgan. The report also reveals that 15 firms of Britain\u2019s top 350 still have no women on their boards at all. These companiesinclude the Egypt-focused mining firm Centamin, the interdealer brokerage Icap, the gambling firm Playtech, the building materials group Grafton, and Hastings Insurance. Lucy Neville-Rolfe, a minister in the department for business, who has been on the boards of firms such as ITV and Tesco, called on male dominated firms to mend their ways. \u201cMaking sure there\u2019s at least one woman on every 350 board is an extremely good idea,\u201d said Lady Neville-Rolfe. \u201cKnowing who those 15 companies are is helpful. I\u2019ve got the list and if they want to talk to me, of course they can.\u201d This year\u2019s report also marks the moment when Davies hands over responsibility for the review to the team of Sir Philip Hampton, chair of GlaxoSmithKline, and Dame Helen Alexander, chair of the events group UBM. Hampton has promised to focus on addressing the balance of executives, saying the overall increase in female board members over the past few years was largely a non-executive phenomenon. \u201cWe still have tiny numbers of women in senior executive positions in listed companies,\u201d said Hampton, who has also served as chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Fewer than 10% of the top three executives at any one UK company are women, the report reveals, while three firms have no women in executive jobs at all. The trio with an all-male executive committee are Shell, the defence firm Babcock, and Provident Financial. While Davies set a target of 25% women on FTSE 350 boards, Hampton and Alexander will oversee efforts to reach a more stretching target of 33% by 2020. Hampton said he and Alexander were considering setting a new target for the executive pipeline of each company \u2013 the talent pool of staff thought destined for the top jobs. Among FTSE 100 companies Diageo, the owner of Guinness, had the largest proportion of women on its board, with five of 11 boardroom seats at the drinks company occupied by women. The Chilean copper miner Antofagasta came in last place, with only one woman in 11. The Female FTSE Board Report was written by academics from Cranfield School of Management, and sponsored by KPMG. \u2022This article was amended on Friday 8 July. The Female FTSE Board Report wrongly claimed that RSA Insurance had no woman executives.",

      "bodyText": "In this new post-Brexit universe, what happens to your investment nest egg is going to depend a lot on all kinds of economic data points \u2013 like the monthly jobs data report from the US labor department due to be released on Friday. That figure \u2013 the number of new jobs created in the preceding month \u2013 has always been a critical one for traders, especially in times when the economy\u2019s fate is uncertain (like 2007 and 2008) or when we\u2019re all on edge, waiting to see what Federal Reserve policymakers are about to do. It also has been a handy gauge of whether it\u2019s time to batten down the hatches or whether it might be OK to splurge on a beach holiday over the winter: if more people are finding jobs, then even if you lose yours, the job market might be robust enough that drawing on your savings might not be too reckless. But we\u2019re heading into a presidential election season, with both probable candidates promising that they would create jobs. That election is taking place against an increasingly unstable global economy, with last month\u2019s vote by a majority of British citizens to leave the European Union. Against that backdrop, it seems more crucial than ever to measure how many jobs the US private sector is creating. The problem is that today, more than ever before, we just can\u2019t trust that data. The June employment report will appear hard on the heels of a very disappointing figure released a month ago. In May, employers added only 38,000 jobs, and the labor department\u2019s revisions to previous months\u2019 data meant that average monthly job creation in the prior three months sank to only 116,000. That compares to a monthly average of 219,000 during the previous 12 months. And yet while hiring fell, so did the unemployment rate \u2013 from 5% to 4.7% That\u2019s only part of the paradoxical puzzle that is the DOL\u2019s attempt to draw a picture of the world of work and unemployment in the United States. Throughout the entire economic recovery, as Barack Obama and his economic team have pointed to the (slowly) recovering jobs figures and unemployment rate, Americans have been perplexed, wondering why their personal economic situation stubbornly remains an anomaly. There are the traditional ways in which the way the labor department falls short of the mark. For instance, it simplifies nuanced answers to its survey. Some people might respond to that survey saying that they are employed, but in fact have cobbled together a series of two or three part-time jobs to make ends meet, none of which are secure. Or they may have a job that theoretically is full-time \u2013 if only the employer would allocate them enough hours. There are measures that capture some of this. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes something called the U-6 rate, which tracks discouraged workers, those who are only \u201cmarginally attached\u201d. These people aren\u2019t looking for work because they think there is nothing there for them, are working part-time but not making a living wage, or are underemployed \u2013 imagine a laid-off aeronautical engineer whipping up your latte at Starbucks. The U-6 unemployment remains, stubbornly, about twice as high as the traditional U-3 unemployment rate, at 9.7%, compared to 4.7%. As the recovery got under way, however, it was complicated still further by the nearly simultaneous birth of a new phenomenon: the gig economy. There\u2019s a furious debate under way over just how many Americans are earning the majority of their income by driving for Uber, selling products on Etsy or some other kind of self-employment. Unquestionably, however, contract employees of all kinds have become far thicker on the ground in recent years. The Wall Street Journal reported last summer that it\u2019s hard to find proof in government data that Americans are more reliant on self-employment. But Harvard economist Lawrence Katz and his fellow researcher, Alan Krueger, of Princeton, have concluded that all net job growth since 2005 has come in the form of alternative work arrangements \u2013 contract or gig type hirings that aren\u2019t traditional jobs with salaries and benefits. More and more individuals are receiving 1099 forms documenting self-employment earnings, and a growing number file Schedule C tax forms spelling out how much they made from their personal businesses, whether renting out their spare rooms or designing greeting cards. They may also have a traditional \u201cjob,\u201d or have a part-time job on the side, or generate income through a mish-mash of traditional or gig jobs. Zen Payroll has found that in some cities \u2013 Los Angeles and Austin among them \u2013 the \u201c1099 economy\u201d now makes up 20% or more of the local workforce; the percentage of workers who fall into this category has almost doubled in Seattle. What we can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 measure, we can\u2019t, or don\u2019t, understand. And then, just as a starting point, we have no way to know whether those traditional unemployment numbers that traders are so anxiously awaiting represent anything meaningful. The markets will respond, of course, but so what? If the gap between the reality of what that employment is and what the government statistics measures widens much further, that market reaction will be about as meaningful as celebrating the end of the Iraq war on the day that George W Bush announced in 2003 that \u201cthe United States and our allies have prevailed\u201d would have been. The BLS is taking belated baby steps in the right direction. Next May, it will roll out a supplement to its Current Population Survey that will cover all kinds of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers and alternative work arrangements. But that still falls short of data that would routinely capture the size and nature of this large and (arguably) fast-growing world. What\u2019s at stake are the working terms and conditions of the millions of Americans who are more and more likely to find themselves engaged in some part of the gig economy, as companies realize just how much it is to their financial advantage to operate in this way. Hire an independent contractor, and a company saves on: health care insurance contributions; social security contributions; pay for sick days, parental leave, vacation; contributions to retirement savings plans; Medicare; heck, even the cost of a lunch break. All of those can cost as much as a third of the total cost of employing someone \u2013 and the growth of the 1099 economymeans companies get to transfer many of those costs to the employees. But if you can\u2019t measure how many \u201cemployees\u201d turned gig workers/independent contracters/self-employed individuals are shouldering those new financial burdens for themselves now, then it\u2019s tough to advocate for changes to labor laws recognizing the new world of work. It\u2019s time to overhaul the monthly employment data. The first step is to stop responding to it like Pavlov\u2019s dog \u2013 that just reinforces the idea that it sends out an economically vital signal. Admittedly, it\u2019s important information, but it\u2019s also flawed and becoming more so. The less we react to it, the more we drive home the message that it\u2019s unhelpful as it stands, and (perhaps) the greater the incentive there is for someone out there to devise something that will address its many flaws. Quickly, please.",

      "body": "<p>In this new post-Brexit universe, what happens to your investment nest egg is going to depend a lot on all kinds of economic data points \u2013 like the monthly <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-02/dollar-traders-see-jobs-data-as-obstacle-after-post-brexit-fade\">jobs data report</a> from the US labor department due to be released on Friday.</p> <p> That figure \u2013 the number of new jobs created in the preceding month \u2013 has always been a critical one for traders, especially in times when the economy\u2019s fate is uncertain (like 2007 and 2008) or when we\u2019re all on edge, waiting to see what Federal Reserve policymakers are about to do. It also has been a handy gauge of whether it\u2019s time to batten down the hatches or whether it might be OK to splurge on a beach holiday over the winter: if more people are finding jobs, then even if you lose yours, the job market might be robust enough that drawing on your savings might not be too reckless. </p> <p> But we\u2019re heading into a presidential election season, with both probable candidates promising that they would create jobs. That election is taking place against an increasingly unstable global economy, with last month\u2019s vote by a majority of British citizens to leave the European Union.  </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/03/jobs-report-us-election-economy-donald-trump-hillary-clinton\">'Bombshell' jobs report puts economic growth back in US election spotlight</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Against that backdrop, it seems more crucial than ever to measure how many jobs the US private sector is creating. </p> <p> The problem is that today, more than ever before, we just can\u2019t trust that data.</p> <p> The June employment report will appear hard on the heels of a very disappointing figure released a month ago. In May, employers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/03/jobs-report-may-unemployment-rate-economy\">added only 38,000 jobs</a>, and the labor department\u2019s revisions to previous months\u2019 data meant that average monthly job creation in the prior three months sank to only 116,000. That compares to a monthly average of 219,000 during the previous 12 months. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/jobs-report-added/\" data-alt=\"Nonfarm payroll employment, seasonally adjusted (in thousands)\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/jobs-report-added/\">Nonfarm payroll employment, seasonally adjusted (in thousands)</a> </figure>  <p>And yet while hiring fell, so did the unemployment rate \u2013 from 5% to 4.7% That\u2019s only part of the paradoxical puzzle that is the DOL\u2019s attempt to draw a picture of the world of work and unemployment in the United States. Throughout the entire economic recovery, as Barack Obama and his economic team have pointed to the (slowly) recovering jobs figures and unemployment rate, Americans have been perplexed, wondering why their personal economic situation stubbornly remains an anomaly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/one-percent-2008-recession-recovery-income\">The 1% are recovering from 2008 recession while 99% are still waiting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are the traditional ways in which the way the labor department falls short of the mark. For instance, it simplifies nuanced answers to its survey. Some people might respond to that survey saying that they are employed, but in fact have cobbled together a series of two or three part-time jobs to make ends meet, none of which are secure. Or they may have a job that theoretically is full-time \u2013 if only the employer would allocate them enough hours.</p> <p>There are measures that capture some of this. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes something called the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/07/05/why-the-real-unemployment-rate-is-higher-than-you-think/#c1f5acd368cc\">U-6 rate, which tracks discouraged workers</a>, those who are only \u201cmarginally attached\u201d. These people aren\u2019t looking for work because they think there is nothing there for them, are working part-time but not making a living wage, or are underemployed \u2013 imagine a laid-off aeronautical engineer whipping up your latte at Starbucks. The U-6 unemployment remains, stubbornly, about twice as high as the traditional U-3 unemployment rate, at 9.7%, compared to 4.7%.</p> <p>As the recovery got under way, however, it was complicated still further by the nearly simultaneous birth of a new phenomenon: the gig economy. </p> <p>There\u2019s a furious debate under way over just how many Americans are earning the majority of their income by driving for Uber, selling products on Etsy or some other kind of self-employment. Unquestionably, however, contract employees of all kinds have become far thicker on the ground in recent years. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported last summer that it\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/proof-of-a-gig-economy-revolution-is-hard-to-find-1437932539\">hard to find proof in government data that Americans are more reliant on self-employment</a>. But Harvard economist Lawrence Katz and his fellow researcher, Alan Krueger, of Princeton, have concluded that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fusion.net/story/285543/krueger-katz-gig-economy-forthcoming-paper/\">all net job growth since 2005 has come in the form of alternative work arrangements</a> \u2013 contract or gig type hirings that aren\u2019t traditional jobs with salaries and benefits. </p> <p>More and more individuals are receiving 1099 forms documenting self-employment earnings, and a growing number file Schedule C tax forms spelling out how much they made from their personal businesses, whether renting out their spare rooms or designing greeting cards. They may also have a traditional \u201cjob,\u201d or have a part-time job on the side, or generate income through a mish-mash of traditional or gig jobs. Zen Payroll has found that in some cities \u2013 Los Angeles and Austin among them \u2013 the \u201c1099 economy\u201d now makes up <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newgeography.com/content/004770-1099-economy-rise\">20% or more of the local workforce</a>; the percentage of workers who fall into this category has almost doubled in Seattle. </p> <p>What we can\u2019t \u2013 or don\u2019t \u2013 measure, we can\u2019t, or don\u2019t, understand. And then, just as a starting point, we have no way to know whether those traditional unemployment numbers that traders are so anxiously awaiting represent anything meaningful. The markets will respond, of course, but so what? If the gap between the reality of what that employment is and what the government statistics measures widens much further, that market reaction will be about as meaningful as celebrating the end of the Iraq war on the day that George W Bush announced in 2003 that \u201cthe United States and our allies have prevailed\u201d would have been.</p> <p>The BLS is taking belated baby steps in the right direction. Next May, it will roll out a supplement to its Current Population Survey that will cover all kinds of \u201ccontingent\u201d workers and alternative work arrangements. But that still falls short of data that would routinely capture the size and nature of this large and (arguably) fast-growing world.</p> <p>What\u2019s at stake are the working terms and conditions of the millions of Americans who are more and more likely to find themselves engaged in some part of the gig economy, as companies realize just how much it is to their financial advantage to operate in this way. Hire an independent contractor, and a company saves on: health care insurance contributions; social security contributions; pay for sick days, parental leave, vacation; contributions to retirement savings plans; Medicare; heck, even the cost of a lunch break. All of those can cost as much as a third of the total cost of employing someone \u2013 and the growth of the 1099 economymeans companies get to transfer many of those costs to the employees. </p> <p>But if you can\u2019t measure how many \u201cemployees\u201d turned gig workers/independent contracters/self-employed individuals are shouldering those new financial burdens for themselves now, then it\u2019s tough to advocate for <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-the-gig-economy-changes-work-so-should-rules-1449683384\">changes to labor laws recognizing the new world of work</a>. </p> <p>It\u2019s time to overhaul the monthly employment data. The first step is to stop responding to it like Pavlov\u2019s dog \u2013 that just reinforces the idea that it sends out an economically vital signal. Admittedly, it\u2019s important information, but it\u2019s also flawed and becoming more so. The less we react to it, the more we drive home the message that it\u2019s unhelpful as it stands, and (perhaps) the greater the incentive there is for someone out there to devise something that will address its many flaws. Quickly, please.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley has told the Sports Direct board that he has no current intention to take the company private, as the retailer revealed a \u201cdisappointing\u201d fall in profits. Dave Forsey, the chief executive, said: \u201cThe group has delivered a disappointing full-year financial performance, impacted primarily by a tough trading environment in the second half across our sports retail businesses.\u201d He said trading in the runup to the EU referendum had been in line with expectations, but warned that there could be no certainty on profit levels for the coming year as the outlook was \u201csomewhat uncertain and hard to predict\u201d in the light of the UK\u2019s decision to exit the EU. Sports Direct had already warned that its profits for the year ahead could be affected by the drop in the value of the pound against the dollar, which it uses to buy stock in Asia, but on Thursday it outlined the detail. Analysts at Jefferies said the \u201cmargin pain could prove pretty remarkable\u201d for Sports Direct, as it had just finished a two-year deal under which it bought dollars at $1.70 to the pound. With sterling now trading at $1.30, the cost of buying about half the retailer\u2019s goods abroad will increase by more than 20%. Sports Direct also warned that a 10% fall in the value of the pound against the euro would result in a \u00a365m loss on hedging contracts Sports Direct had taken out. Forsey added that Brexit was also likely to hit sales. \u201cSince the EU vote, we expect the current political uncertainty \u2013 and potential weakness in the UK\u2019s short- to medium-term economic outlook \u2013 is likely to act as a continuing drag on consumer confidence,\u201d he said. Despite the gloomy outlook, Sports Direct\u2019s shares rose 2.4% to 281p. The price was boosted by news that the group is considering launching a share buyback scheme amid volatility in equity markets following the Brexit vote. In bad news for Sports Direct staff, the retailer confirmed that it would not be paying a bonus after underlying profits, at \u00a3381.4m, missed the company\u2019s target of \u00a3420m in the year to 24 April. The bonus plan would have paid out \u00a3200m in shares to 3,000 permanent staff if earnings doubled by 2019. Forsey said Sports Direct would be looking to develop a replacement scheme to reward staff. Group sales rose 2.5% to \u00a32.9bn, slightly better than expected, after Sports Direct bought the Irish Heatons chain. Analysts said this indicated that sales at established stores had fallen in the second half of the year. Profit margins rose for the group as a whole as it booked big increases at its brands and premium lifestyle chains, which include the USC and Flannels chains. However, margins at the group\u2019s sports stores decreased by 1 percentage point in the second half of the year as the company was forced to discount to clear winter stock during unseasonably warm weather. At the pretax level, full-year profits fell 8.4% to \u00a3275.2m. Andrew Hall, an analyst at Verdict Retail, said: \u201cThe swirling market conditions and the harsh glare of the media spotlight are illuminating the cracks in Sports Direct\u2019s performance, even as it continues to invest in its multichannel proposition. There are few positives for Sports Direct to take from this morning\u2019s results, and strong leadership to right the ship is required to prevent the retailer lurching from one bad news story to another.\u201d Sales at the group\u2019s sports stores, excluding Heatons, rose by just 0.6%, despite the opening of 60 new stores in 11 countries. Meanwhile, sales at its premium lifestyle chains slumped nearly 13% as the group closed lossmaking stores. In response to what it said was \u201crepeated press speculation about his intentions with regards to his shareholding in Sports Direct\u201d, the company said Ashley had confirmed to the board of directors that he had no current intention of taking the Sports Direct private, and had \u201cindicated his willingness for the company to confirm this statement publicly\u201d. The retailer has dropped out of the FTSE 100 after facing criticism over its treatment of workers, revealed by a Guardian investigation last year. It has also had difficulties in securing the acquisitions it needed to meet profit targets while sales growth has stumbled. The company issued its second profit warning in a year in March. Ashley admitted last month that Sports Direct had paid workers in its warehouse below the minimum wage because of delays in security searches of staff. Giving evidence to a committee of MPs in parliament, Ashley said he had already taken measures to address the problem and would be continuing his review into workers\u2019 pay and conditions. In Thursday\u2019s statement, there was no mention of Ashley\u2019s pledge to MPs that he would look into the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy under which workers are sacked for six black marks within six months. Nor was there any further update on the company\u2019s policy of docking workers 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being one minute late for work - something Ashley told MPs was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which polices minimum-wage abuses, is investigating the retailer, and the company is in talks with its full-time staff about a deal to offer back pay.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Employment across developed countries has almost recovered to pre-crisis levels but weak wage growth has blighted living standards, a respected thinktank has said, as it called for more government action to boost productivity and protect workers from workplace automation. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Thursday the employment rate across its 34 member countries would have recouped all its losses from the recession by 2017 \u2013 a decade after the onset of the crisis. But its 2016 employment outlook said family finances were being squeezed by slow wage growth, with UK workers among the worst affected. A slowdown in global growth and the UK\u2019s recent vote to leave the EU are casting further shadows over the outlook for wages for workers in Britain, the Paris-based group said. Across the OECD countries, the group noted a combination of low-quality jobs and a high level of labour market inequality. Many of the workers who lost their jobs during the recession were now back in work, but wage growth remained subdued and job stress was common, the report said. Highlighting weak growth in productivity \u2013 a measure of output produced per hour worked \u2013 and low job security for many workers, the OECD reiterated recent pleas for governments to help with more structural reforms and fiscal policy. \u201cThe job of healing the employment market is only half done: back at work, but out of pocket,\u201d said Angel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD secretary general, launching the annual jobs report in Paris. \u201cComprehensive and ambitious policy action is needed to kickstart labour productivity growth, raise wages, and reduce rising job market inequalities.\u201d The OECD report highlights the UK\u2019s particularly weak performance on pay growth over the last seven years since the global financial crisis. Real hourly wages were more than 25% below where they would have been if wage growth had continued at the rate observed during 2000-07, the thinktank found. The group, which had warned of dire economic consequences for Britain if it voted to leave the EU, said Brexit \u201crepresents a cloud over the UK\u2019s recent ability to create jobs\u201d. Any resulting decline in foreign direct investment in the UK could further worsen the country\u2019s poor productivity performance, it said. The OECD also highlighted work by some of its experts into the rise of robots in workplaces. They came up with relatively benign estimates that on average just 9% of jobs were at a high risk of being fully automated, based on an analysis of 21 OECD countries. However, the researchers found that many workers, even if their jobs were not fully replaced by machines, would see automation of substantial parts of their daily tasks. That increased the impetus for retraining, the OECD said, noting that more than half of workers in its member countries had no or very limited technology or computer skills. For the UK, the researchers found in 35% of all current jobs, 50% or more of the tasks performed could be automated. \u201cNot all these jobs will disappear but they will undergo major change, requiring better access to training opportunities for workers in these jobs to update their skills or learn new ones,\u201d the OECD briefing on the UK said (pdf). The employment report noted that despite the average employment rate being within touching distance of its pre-crisis level, that masked an uneven recovery and \u201cunemployment remains much too high in a considerable number of European OECD countries\u201d. Some countries experienced only a shallow or short recession and employment in these countries had long since returned to \u2013 or climbed above \u2013 its pre-crisis level. Employment rates were now more than 5 percentage points above their end-2007 levels in Chile, Germany, Hungary, Israel and Turkey. But at the other extreme, the jobs deficit was still large in Greece, Ireland and Spain. The report noted the number of long-term unemployed had finally started to fall in the past year across the the 34 OECD member countries, which include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Spain, the UK and the US. Looking ahead, the report warned that it was too soon to \u201cdeclare victory\u201d over tackling long-term unemployment and it was also cautious about predicting a more general pickup in living standards. \u201cWhether workers can ever recuperate the potential wage gains lost since 2007 is uncertain, especially if labour productivity growth remains weak,\u201d said Stefano Scarpetta, OECD director for employment, labour and social affairs. \u201cThe prospects for returning to vigorous wage gains is closely tied to whether the global economy manages to move from the current low growth equilibrium characterised by low investment, subpar productivity growth and historically weak international trade, which in turn calls for a comprehensive policy response, including more ambitious use of fiscal policy and additional structural reforms.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel and the government must urgently set out plans for the Indian company\u2019s UK operations, according to Port Talbot\u2019s MP, Stephen Kinnock. Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, which includes Tata\u2019s main steel works at Port Talbot, said reports that the firm intends to put the sale of its British assets on hold would leave employees in limbo. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is flying to Mumbai to meet Tata executives to discuss plans for the UK business, which employs 11,000 people. Tata Steel\u2019s board meets on Friday and could announce a pause in the sale process, the BBC reported. Tata was already in talks with the UK government about keeping the business in return for a loan of up to \u00a31bn and a restructuring of its pension scheme. Kinnock called on Javid to make a statement to parliament after he returns from India. Kinnock said: \u201cSteel workers and their families have been put through hell over the last weeks and months, and they will be forgiven for greeting these reports with a degree of scepticism, and perhaps even an element of anger. It is now absolutely critical that Tata Steel and the UK government come forward with a specific timetable.\u201d He said disruption caused by the vote to leave the EU was not an excuse for further uncertainty and called on Tata Steel and Javid to say whether the Port Talbot strip products business was still for sale and to clarify the position of the pension scheme. \u201cSajid Javid must now undertake to make a statement to parliament upon his return from Mumbai on Monday. This statement must provide a clear timetable, and clear answers,\u201d Kinnock said. Tata Steel announced in late March that it intended to sell its UK business, blaming cheap Chinese imports, a slump in the steel price and high energy costs for its decision. At the time the business was said to be losing \u00a31m a day. Cost cutting, a rise in the steel price and the fall in sterling after the referendum have helped make the business more viable. Tata Steel is considering selling its speciality steels and pipeline tube businesses, which employ 2,500 people in Rotherham, Hartlepool and Stocksbridge near Sheffield, if it decides to stay in the UK. After a slow initial response, the government came up with measures designed to encourage potential buyers, including taking a stake in the business. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said on Wednesday that full nationalisation remained an option to save Tata\u2019s UK operations, which helps support tens of thousands of jobs. Both Tata Steel and the business department declined to comment.",

In a trading update Great Portland said it expected Brexit to reduce economic growth in London, where it has all its \u00a33.7bn of property investments. That will have a knock-on effect on confidence, investment and rental values. Toby Courtauld, Great Portland\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIn the near term, we expect confidence to reduce and some business investment decisions to be deferred whilst negotiations to establish our trading arrangements with the EU are undertaken. As a result, we can expect London\u2019s commercial property markets to weaken during this period of uncertainty.\u201d The company published its warning amid growing concerns about commercial property if the UK economy contracts following last month\u2019s vote to leave the EU. This week, six property funds worth a total of \u00a314bn have blocked worried investors from withdrawing their money. Coutauld said Great Portland was in a strong position to weather the tougher market and that it had the financial strength to snap up bargains. At the end of the three months to the end of June, 62% of its developments were already sold or let and 97% of its leasehold property was occupied. Great Portland develops and invests in offices, retail space and housing in the West End and other parts of central London. Its properties include the ITN building on Gray\u2019s Inn Road, buildings on upmarket Piccadilly, Jermyn Street and Bond Street, and a large retail site at the east end of Oxford Street, which is undergoing regeneration as part of the Crossrail project. Standard Life drew attention to fears among retail investors in commercial property when it closed its \u00a32.9bn fund on Monday. Others followed suit, including Prudential and Aviva, in a move to prevent forced sales of assets as people tried to get their money out. Commercial property prices rose 40% from 2009 until the start of this year, drawing in retail investors seeking better returns than the meagre rates on offer from bonds and bank accounts. After the vote for Brexit the funds were bombarded by redemption requests because of fears that slower economic growth would slash the value of retail parks, offices and other investments held by the funds. Great Portland shares, which had lost a quarter of their value following the vote to leave the EU on 23 June, rose 4%.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has suffered its biggest fall in clothing sales since the 2008 banking crisis as new boss Steve Rowe tries to end its reliance on heavy discounting. The 8.9% fall in underlying clothing and home sales over the last three months was far bigger than analysts expected and turned the clock back to 2008 when the retailer had a disastrous Christmas following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cThese are not the numbers I want to see by any stretch but they are the numbers I expected to see,\u201d said Rowe, who took over as chief executive three months ago. He said M&amp;S\u2019s clothing prices have been too high and too promotional with shoppers trained to wait for special offers before buying anything. Last year, more than 40% of its clothing was sold on promotion. \u201cI\u2019ve been clear we must break this cycle because it is damaging our business,\u201d he said. The dire figures were later compounded by embarrassment when M&amp;S was forced to issue a second stock exchange announcement on Thursday admitting it had got some of its sales figures wrong. Rather than rising 1.3%, group sales were actually down 0.4%. The sales number, adjusted for currency fluctuations, was also wrong. The company blamed the mistake on a clerical error and said there had been no breach of procedure. Rowe, who has worked at M&amp;S for 26 years, used his first annual results presentation in May to outline a strategy promising sharper clothing prices and a less slavish pursuit of catwalk trends. Despite high-profile successes such as a recent collection by TV presenter Alexa Chung, sales at the retailer\u2019s clothing business have now been in decline for more than five years. \u201cA key part of our recovery plan for clothing and home is lowering prices and reducing promotions,\u201d said Rowe. To that end the retailer ran 28 fewer promotional events during the quarter and cut the prices of 1,000 product lines. \u201cWe knew our actions would reduce total sales but we are seeing some encouraging early signs,\u201d continued Rowe, who pointed to women\u2019s leggings, with the number of pairs sold increasing 149% after the price was cut from \u00a319.50 to \u00a315. In the past, he said, the retailer had \u201cdipped for the line\u201d, offering deals to help it hit sales targets at the end of a quarter, but added: \u201cWe are not going to play that game anymore.\u201d The changes to M&amp;S\u2019s pricing strategy, which included delaying its summer sale by a week, accounted for more than half of the 8.9% fall. Rowe compared the situation to spring 2005 when predecessor Sir Stuart Rose also sought to wean shoppers off discounts, by cancelling the regular discount \u201cmega days\u201d, a tactical change that sent sales down 11.2% but eventually led to a recovery. The retailer said confidence had weakened in the run-up to the EU referendum but M&amp;S had not detected a fresh decline since 23 June. All fashion retailers are facing tough trading conditions as UK clothing sales are falling for the first time in six years, while the poor weather has also dampened demand for summer ranges. On Thursday, M&amp;S rival Primark revealed a third quarter of sales falls at established stores in the three months to 18 June. The company blamed \u201cunpredictable weather patterns\u201d, particularly the cold weather in April followed by a return to more seasonal conditions in May. M&amp;S\u2019s shares, which have fallen more than 40% in the past year, have come under pressure as investors assess the impact of Rowe\u2019s plans on its profitability as well as the prospect of a high street downturn following the Brexit vote. The post-Brexit collapse in the value of the pound is also bad news for Rowe\u2019s turnaround as M&amp;S, in common with other clothing retailers, imports goods in dollars. M&amp;S said it imported $1bn - $1.5bn (\u00a3770m \u2013 \u00a31.16bn) worth of goods each year which equates to 65% of its clothing. Canaccord Genuity analyst David Jeary said: \u201cThere is no hiding from the fact that both the overall market and M&amp;S\u2019s performance have been soggy at best in the first quarter.\u201d Despite the dire trading figures M&amp;S said its guidance for annual profit remained unchanged. The shares closed up 4.8p at 298.9p.",

      "bodyText": "Primark\u2019s owner is expecting a boost from the rising value of the euro against the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote. Associated British Foods had previously warned that it expected a \u201cmarginal decline\u201d in earnings per share for the financial year, which ends in August. However, following the result of the EU referendum, the company said overseas profits in the final quarter would be better than expected once translated into sterling. The better-than-expected news on profits came as Primark revealed its third consecutive quarter of sales falls at established stores, for the three months to 18 June. ABF said total sales at its fashion chain had risen by 7% in the 40 weeks to 18 June after it opened 11 new stores in the last three months of the period. However, underlying sales in the last quarter were hit by \u201cunpredictable weather patterns\u201d, particularly the cold weather in April followed by a return to more seasonal weather in May. John Bason, ABF\u2019s finance director, said the retailer\u2019s sales performance had been affected across Europe by the weather, although it had enjoyed strong growth in Ireland amid an economic recovery in its home market. The company also warned that Primark\u2019s UK profit margins would suffer as a result of the falling value of the pound against the dollar and the euro. However, this will be offset by a favourable boost to margins at the group\u2019s sugar business and also in translating profits earned outside the UK, which last year made up 50% of the total. Bason said it was too early to tell if there would be a post-Brexit sales dip in the UK, but he added: \u201cI\u2019ve seen Primark do well in good economic times and more challenged economic times.\u201d He said there would be cost pressures on all clothing retailers next year in the light of the devaluation of the pound, but that it was not clear if this would feed through into price rises for shoppers. Bason said Primark\u2019s prices would be partly driven by the actions of its competitors. \u201cWe are never going to be a leader on price increases,\u201d he said. Plans to expand Primark remain unchanged in the light of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The chain expects to open 300,000 sq ft more trading space by August, including two more stores in the US, at Willow Grove in gGreater Philadelphia, and Freehold Raceway in New Jersey. It will also double the size of its Creteil store in Paris. The company said the decision to leave the EU had created uncertainty in the business environment and financial markets, but added: \u201cWe have a strong balance sheet and we remain optimistic for the group\u2019s continued growth.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Credit agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has announced that it had revised its AAA rating outlook for Australia from stable to negative. The main reasons for the downgrade in outlook was S&amp;P\u2019s lack of confidence that the budget\u2019s path to surplus was credible due to overly optimistic assumptions of iron ore prices and inflation, and a reliance on the so-called \u201czombie measures\u201d. Australia is one of only 10 nations to hold a AAA credit rating with the three major credit agencies. The negative outlook, released on Thursday, indicates a one in three chance S&amp;P may downgrade that rating within the next two years. While voters wait for the election count to be finalised Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has decided not to wait to find out who will be in power before issuing its outlook. The credit agency has moved to issue the negative outlook \u2013 which is the first step towards a downgrade \u2013 because it believes that \u201cwithout remedial action the government\u2019s fiscal stance may no longer be compatible with the country\u2019s high level of external indebtednes\u201d. While the probability of a hung parliament does loom over the negative outlook, for the most part the decision is S&amp;P\u2019s verdict on the budget. The report is rather scornful of the numbers within the budget and suggest the path to surplus is not as likely as that projected by Scott Morrison on 3 May. Largely it takes this view because S&amp;P believes the assumptions underlying the budget projections are overly optimistic and because many of the \u201czombie measures\u201d carried over from the 2014-15 budget \u2013 which on paper make the budget deficit smaller \u2013 are unlikely to pass. The report noted that \u201cthe negative outlook on Australia reflects our view that without the implementation of more forceful fiscal policy decisions, material government budget deficits may persist for several years with little improvement\u201d. It argues that \u201congoing budget deficits may become incompatible with Australia\u2019s high level of external indebtedness and therefore inconsistent with a \u2018AAA\u2019 rating\u201d. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, argued that the outlook did not change the need to offer company tax cuts, even though such a move would reduce revenue. Morrison said the report affirmed his budget outlook as it argues that Australia could lose its AAA rating \u201cunless more budget savings measures are legislated or there are improvements in the revenue outlook\u201d. He suggested this meant the ratings agency was arguing Australia needed \u201cmore growth\u201d. However it is clear from the report the main issue S&amp;P has with the revenue outlook was the budget\u2019s iron ore price assumptions. S&amp;P noted that it projects iron ore prices to be around \u201cclose to US$20 per metric ton\u201d lower in 2016 and 2017 than the $US55 a tonne estimated in the May budget. Every US$1 drop in iron ore prices results in about $250m less in annual tax revenue. S&amp;P also warns that there is a risk that revenue projections in the budget may get hit \u201cif Australia\u2019s inflation and wage growth is weak for longer than the budget anticipates\u201d. This was something noted at the time, given just three days after the budget, the RBA revised down its own inflation forecasts. While the credit agency did express concern about Australia\u2019s level of external debt it noted that this is \u201cmostly generated by the private sector\u201d and reflects \u201cthe productive investment opportunities available in Australia, foreign investor confidence in Australia\u2019s rule of law, the high creditworthiness of its banking system, and the positive yield available on highly rated debt\u201d. Despite Australian government bonds currently at record low yields, they remain higher than most other nations \u2013 and recently nations such as Japan have recorded negative interest rates. S&amp;P also blamed \u201ca portion\u201d of that debt on the surge of \u201cunproductive household borrowing for housing during the 1990s and 2000s, which was intermediated by the banking sector\u201d. From 1995 to 2007 the level of housing debt as a percentage of household disposable income went from 50.3% to 112.9%: The report notes that the agency \u201cwill continue to monitor, over the next six to 12 months, the success or otherwise of the new government\u2019s ability to pass revenue and expenditure measures through both houses of parliament\u201d.

The report is rather scornful of the numbers within the budget and suggest the path to surplus is not as likely as that projected by Scott Morrison on 3 May. </p> <p>Largely it takes this view because S&amp;P believes the assumptions underlying the budget projections are overly optimistic and because many of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/10/coalition-labor-wrangle-budget-zombie-measures\">zombie measures</a>\u201d carried over from the 2014-15 budget \u2013 which on paper make the budget deficit smaller \u2013 are unlikely to pass. </p> <p>The report noted that \u201cthe negative outlook on Australia reflects our view that without the implementation of more forceful fiscal policy decisions, material government budget deficits may persist for several years with little improvement\u201d.</p> <p>It argues that \u201congoing budget deficits may become incompatible with Australia\u2019s high level of external indebtedness and therefore inconsistent with a \u2018AAA\u2019 rating\u201d.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, argued that the outlook did not change the need to offer company tax cuts, even though such a move would reduce revenue. </p> <p>Morrison said the report affirmed his budget outlook as it argues that Australia could lose its AAA rating \u201cunless more budget savings measures are legislated or there are improvements in the revenue outlook\u201d.

      "bodyText": "While the latest GDP figures suggested the economy is humming along nicely, the reality on the ground suggests otherwise. For now the Reserve Bank is content to wait before further cutting rates, but the worsening outlook for the world economy suggests that whoever does end up in power once the counting has been done might not have the luxury of leaving all the heavy lifting up to the RBA. The RBA\u2019s statement on Tuesday talked of the international and domestic economies as it always does. It referred specifically to Brexit, noting that \u201cany effects of the referendum outcome on global economic activity remain to be seen and, outside the effects on the UK economy itself, may be hard to discern\u201d. Of the non-result thus far of the Australian election, they made no mention at all. This is not all that unexpected; the RBA generally keeps itself above the political fray. It wasn\u2019t always thus. Back in July 1996 the RBA governor\u2019s statement announcing its decision to cut rates by 0.5% strode straight into the politics of the moment: \u201cToday\u2019s action by the Reserve Bank in no way diminishes the urgency of the task confronting the government of reducing the budget deficit. As the bank has emphasised on many occasions, further progress in reducing the budget deficit is critical to both increasing national saving and delivering lower interest rates over the medium term.\u201d Such were the joys of being the governor of the RBA in a period where the whole \u201cindependent\u201d aspect was still being grappled with. Now such as statement would be seen less as a sign of independence as of the RBA overstepping its bounds. Now the RBA comments only on the economic situation, and on this score it remains fairly upbeat. It notes that housing prices have improved slightly in the past couple of months, and that while mining investment is falling, \u201cother areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend.\u201d That\u2019s a generous outlook, for while in the national accounts consumption growth was ok, it remains below the growth levels achieved in the past. Also, even if we exclude engineering construction \u2013 a majority of which comes from the mining sector \u2013 then domestic demand remains well below trend: The latest retail trade data which was released on Tuesday as well also showed a weakening. The annual growth of 3.3% is the slowest since September 2013 \u2013 but whereas back then the trajectory was upward, now it is decidedly downwards heading: And while the RBA might be seeing things with a shade of rose colour, they are still hedging their bets. The Governor\u2019s statement ends by noting that \u201cover the period ahead, further information should allow the board to refine its assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation and to make any adjustment to the stance of policy that may be appropriate\u201d. Given there is no expectation that the cash rate will be raised, any adjustment will be to cut the rates. And the market believes this will occur \u2013 with a full rate cut priced to happen by November and a better than 50:50 chance of another cut to 1.25% by the end of next year. The bond markets as well are not suggesting anything all that good is on the horizon. Since the election on Saturday the yield for Australian government 10 year bonds has fallen even further than the record lows it hit last week. On Wednesday it reached 1.85%: Given that the current cash rate is just 1.75%, that in effect means investors see very little chance for increases in the interest rate over the next few years. It is also a symptom of the yields for government bonds around the world absolutely collapsing as investors take more and more pessimistic views of the world economy over the next few years. The 10 year bond yield is now just a touch over 30 basis points higher than that for the 2 year bonds. As a general rule the closer those two yields are, the worse is the outlook for the economy: And given both yields are inexorably following the rest of the world down closer to zero (if not into negative territory like many other nations), we have a combined very weak outlook for the economy and also record low interest rates. It means the government for the next thee years \u2013 should it survive that long \u2013 will have a situation where growth is expected to weaken but where interest rates will have little ability to do anything. We know this ability is limited because pretty much every other nation that has cut its rates and indulged in quantitative easing (buying up of government bonds in an effort to increase the money supply in the economy) has at best stayed out of recession, but not experienced any great burst of economic growth. Coupled with this is the fact that the interest rates the government has to pay are absolutely rock bottom. Yesterday the government borrowed $700m for 12 years at the low, low rate of 2.0281%. Investors are more than happy to borrow money from us, yet governments are worried about lending money for fear of losing our AAA credit rating. And yet, what impact would that be? Certainly the fear is it will cause the cost of borrowing to increase because notionally (if not in any real world sense) we would be considered more risky. But the general consensus is over the long-term it might add 10 to 20 basis points to the government\u2019s bond yields. For some perspective, the current 10 year bond yield of 1.85% is more than 100 basis points below the 2.87% on offer at the start of the year. This doesn\u2019t mean we need to go silly with our borrowing, but that there might be a unique opportunity where such is the overall strength of our economy relative to the rest of the world that we can be less mindful of the impact on our credit rating. Interest rates are plummeting \u2013 regardless of nation\u2019s credit ratings. While having a AAA credit rating is an advantage, we might be in an era where the advantage is less than it once was. And if cutting interest rates won\u2019t spur the economy, then maybe we should use these low rates to our advantage and borrow to do some nation building.",

But the general consensus is over the long-term it might add 10 to 20 basis points to the government\u2019s bond yields.</p> <p>For some perspective, the current 10 year bond yield of 1.85% is more than 100 basis points below the 2.87% on offer at the start of the year.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean we need to go silly with our borrowing, but that there might be a unique opportunity where such is the overall strength of our economy relative to the rest of the world that we can be less mindful of the impact on our credit rating.</p> <p>Interest rates are plummeting \u2013 regardless of nation\u2019s credit ratings. While having a AAA credit rating is an advantage, we might be in an era where the advantage is less than it once was.</p> <p>And if cutting interest rates won\u2019t spur the economy, then maybe we should use these low rates to our advantage and borrow to do some nation building. </p>",
