The Vix index has been at record lows in recent weeks but has been rattled by the remarks Trump has been making about North Korea. A breakthrough in Pyongyang\u2019s weapons programme prompted Trump to warn on Tuesday that he would unleash \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen\u201d on North Korea if the regime continued to threaten the US. On Friday the US president tweeted that US military options were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for use if Pyongyang \u201cacted unwisely\u201d. The Vix index measures expectations of volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index of the US\u2019s largest publicly quoted companies. Its rise in the early hours of Friday prompted Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at financial firm ETX Capital, to comment: \u201cVolatility is back.\u201d \u201cThe Vix just popped to its highest since the election of Donald Trump as jitters about North Korea roil risk sentiment. It\u2019s about time the market woke up \u2013 nothing like the prospect of a nuclear standoff to sharpen mind of investors who had become a tad complacent,\u201d said Wilson. On Thursday, the US markets closed lower in their worst day since May although on Friday they were slightly higher and the Vix index fell back. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 index was on track to post its biggest weekly loss in nine months. In London, the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since May, having lost 232 points since its high point on Tuesday. The index ended the week at 7,309, down 1% or 79 points on the day, as the major mining companies in the index were dragged lower amid anxiety about the economic impact of tensions between the US and North Korea. Germany\u2019s stock market was largely flat while while France\u2019s main index, the CAC 40, fell more than 1%. Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG, said: \u201cFor a week that has been largely devoid of major economic releases, Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational stance with North Korea has raised volatility across the board, pushing the Vix from a rock-bottom reading on Tuesday, to the highest level in almost a year. \u201cThis has been a week of two halves, with complaints over a lack of volatility giving way to complaints over unpredictable volatility,\u201d he added. The Vix index got to a reading of over 17 \u2013 anything higher than 30 is considered high, and below 15 low. At the the height of the financial crisis it was over 80. Last month it was below nine and at record lows. \u201cWe\u2019ve had such a period of low volatility in the markets. Couple that with high valuation, it only takes a bit of a wobble to cause a reaction like we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Jonathan Roy, an advisory investment manager at Charles Hanover Investments, told Reuters, adding that the reaction was still quite tepid by historical standards.",

      "bodyText": "Nationwide Building Society has sounded a note of caution about the financial sector\u2019s approach to lending in the run-up to Brexit. Joe Garner, its chief executive, said the society\u2019s research showed customers did not expect the UK\u2019s exit from the EU to change the way they could borrow from banks and building societies. Garner said the public had become less optimistic about the economy. \u201cIt will be important for lenders to carefully balance credit supply with affordability as we seek to support the long-term interests of consumers in a responsible way through any potential economic slowdown ahead,\u201d he added. As the Swindon-based society announced a fall in profits in the first three months of its financial year, Garner also said it was important lenders did not overreact. He did not foresee any major changes to its approach to lending. The society was one of the first to tighten its criteria for buy-to-let mortgages 18 months ago. It required landlords to prove that their rental income was at least 145% of their monthly mortgage payments, up from 125%. It also grants buy-to-let mortgages of up to 75% of the value of the property, down from 80%. This, along with changes to tax, was cited as the reason for a fall in Nationwide\u2019s mortgage lending in the three months to the end of June. New buy-to-let lending halved to \u00a3800m from the same period a year ago \u2013 which was cancelled out by buy-to-let mortgages being repaid, as the society said there had been \u201cno net growth\u201d in this range. Across its entire mortgage range, lending \u2013 when repaid loans were also taken into account \u2013 was down to \u00a32.4bn from \u00a33.5bn. The reduction in mortgage lending knocked profits for the period, which fell to \u00a3332m from \u00a3401m. Garner is aiming to run the society on the basis that it generates \u00a31bn-\u00a31.5bn a year. He said: \u201cProfit performance in the first quarter remained comfortably within our strategic target range and, after allowing for one-off items, was broadly consistent with the prior period.\u201d There was a one-off \u00a326m gain this quarter and a \u00a3100m gain the previous quarter. Garner highlighted the society\u2019s expansion in current accounts, an area traditionally dominated by the big four banks \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. About 202,000 current accounts were opened at Nationwide in the first three months, with more than one in five people switching accounts moving to the society. A MoneySavingExpert.com survey published on Friday put Nationwide second for current account service. HSBC\u2019s First Direct arm was top, while RBS was bottom. NatWest \u2013 a division of RBS \u2013 was eighth out of 11.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wilko, the high street homewares and households goods chain, has warned almost 4,000 of its employees that they could lose their jobs in a shake-up that will strip out a layer of management. The potential job losses cap a brutal week for British retail workers, with Asda placing 3,257 employees into consultation and Sainsbury\u2019s announcing plans to axe more than 1,000 head office jobs. Wilko, which recorded an 80% drop in full-year profits last month, said it had placed 3,900 staff working as stock supervisors, till supervisors and assistant managers, into consultation, which could lead to redundancy. However, the family-run business said the changes to its structure would also allow it to create about 1,000 new senior supervisor roles. The company said its new \u201csimplified retail team structure\u201d would \u201censure it is best placed to continue to thrive within an ever-changing retail landscape and to ensure it can operate successfully and competitively\u201d. The job cuts come soon after the company announced that the government\u2019s \u201cimposition\u201d of a minimum living wage had hit profits. Despite the 80% decline in its pre-tax profits to \u00a35.2m, Wilko\u2019s board still paid the company\u2019s multimillionaire family owners a \u00a33m dividend. Antony Houghton, the chain\u2019s retail director, said that independent studies had found a \u201clegacy of retail structures\u201d that \u201ccreated complexity to manage which aren\u2019t simple, fair or transparent for our team members\u201d. He said the company was \u201ccommitted to the future growth of the business and reviewing how we stay relevant to our customers. We do this by making sure all retail operations are fit for the future in order to provide customers with the best possible service. \u201cAs a family-run business, we care greatly about team members and know that change is never easy. We are working with our recognised trade union the GMB, listening to team members and offering support at all levels. We are entering into a long period of consultation and wherever possible are aiming to redeploy team members into new roles and offering help and support to those seeking new opportunities.\u201d The company, founded by James Kemsey Wilkinson \u2013 known as JK \u2013 in Leicester in 1930 has grown to employ 20,000 people working in 406 stores across the country, but has struggled to compete with the rise of other discount chains such as B&amp;M and Poundland. Wilko, which recently shortened its name from Wilkinson, is 100% owned by the Wilkinson family and is one of the biggest privately-owned companies in Britain. It describes its mission as \u201cTodobilation\u201d \u2013 which it says describes the \u201cjubilation in a to do. Either the excitement and anticipation of starting something or the sense of achievement when it\u2019s done.\u201d In its annual accounts, the company hit out at George Osborne\u2019s introduction of the national living wage, which starts at \u00a37.50 an hour for over-25s. \u201cChancellor Osborne\u2019s final austerity budget surprised the industry by its unilateral imposition of a statutory minimum living wage at well above expected levels,\u201d the company said. Lisa Wilkinson, a lawyer and grandchild of the founder, is chairwoman of the company and bought out the shares of her cousin Karin Swann, who was co-chair, for \u00a363m in 2015. This week Asda, Britain\u2019s third-largest supermarket, singled out 3,257 employees in 18 underperforming and overstaffed stores, and is also understood to also be looking at staffing levels in a further 59 of its supermarkets. The 18 stores facing staff cuts include branches in Halifax in West Yorkshire, Broadstairs in Kent and the Basildon Eastgate store in Essex. Staff will face a series of one-to-one meetings over the next three weeks. The eventual job-loss figure is expected to be in the hundreds. Asda recently posted its worst annual figures since being taken over by Walmart in 1999, as fierce competition in the UK supermarket sector took its toll. The supermarket industry is going through massive change as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons cut costs to respond to the threat posed by the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as grocery sales moving online. Sainsbury\u2019s is cutting more than 1,000 jobs at its head office as part of an efficiency drive designed to save \u00a3500m. The UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket chain has drafted in McKinsey, the management consultancy, to draw up a headcount reduction plan. It comes on top of 400 job cuts in March. Tesco, the country\u2019s biggest supermarket, announced in June that it was cutting 1,200 jobs at its head office and 1,100 at a call centre.",

Despite the 80% decline in its pre-tax profits to \u00a35.2m, Wilko\u2019s board still paid the company\u2019s multimillionaire family owners a \u00a33m dividend. </p> <p>Antony Houghton, the chain\u2019s retail director, said that independent studies had found a \u201clegacy of retail structures\u201d that \u201ccreated complexity to manage which aren\u2019t simple, fair or transparent for our team members\u201d. </p> <p>He said the company was \u201ccommitted to the future growth of the business and reviewing how we stay relevant to our customers.

      "bodyText": "US inflation rose to 1.7% in July from 1.6% in June. Economists had forecast a bigger rise, to 1.8%. On that note, we\u2019re closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. AM Tata Steel has agreed a new pension scheme for tens of thousands of workers, ending doubts about future payments. The trade unions Community, Unite and GMB said in a statement: We welcome the announcement which includes a commitment that Tata will stand behind a new scheme with reduced annual increases. For over a year our members have feared for their security in retirement, and this announcement helps to bring that uncertainty to an end. Wilko, the high street homewares and household goods chains, has warned almost 4,000 workers they could lose their jobs. The retailer, which reported an 80% drop in full-year profits last month, said it has placed 3,900 staff working as stock supervisors, till supervisors and assistant managers, into consultation, which could lead to redundancy. The company also said organisational changes could lead to the creation of about 1,000 new senior supervisor roles. Read our full story here: History tells us that we are probably not seeing the start of a sustained fall in US equities according to economists at Capital Economics: The recent escalation of tensions between the US and North Korea has weighed on the S&amp;P 500. But provided that war is avoided, we doubt that this marks the start of a sustained downturn in the index. This was the case for US equities during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world arguably came closest to conflict between two nuclear-armed powers. Although the S&amp;P 500 fell after US President Kennedy announced the discovery of missiles on Cuba, it had recovered its losses before Soviet General Secretary Khrushchev announced six days later that the missiles would be removed. There have been other instances since WW2 when the US has potentially been on the brink of a war that did not break out. Admittedly, these did not pose such a direct threat to the US. But they also typically had little lasting effect on the S&amp;P 500. Our assumption is that there will not be a war between the US and North Korea. We are therefore sticking to our forecast for the S&amp;P 500 to end this year and next only a touch below its current level. President Trump has taken to Twitter with a fresh warning for North Korea: The lack of conciliatory tone is unlikely to sooth markets. The FTSE 100 is now down 90 points as investors find little to cheer about. The latest scores across Europe: FTSE 100: -1.2% at 7,299 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 11,978 France\u2019s CAC: -1.2% at 5,057 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.4% at 21,387 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.4% at 10,309 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -1.1% at 372 Over in Greece there are growing signs that collaboration between the ruling left-wing Syriza party and its junior coalition partner, the small rightwing Independent Greeks, may finally be coming to an end. Helena Smith reports: From the outset, the progressive leftist Syriza party and the arch-nationalist, ultra right wing Independent Greeks, Anel, made for odd bedfellows. Austerity, or rather the two parties\u2019 dislike for it, was their common point of reference. With the worst of bailout negotiations finally over and unpopular pension cuts and tax hikes legislated, rumours of a rift have been growing. Today, Panos Kammenos, leader of Independent Greeks, took to the airwaves to try and dispel the speculation: We are participating in the government but have made clear our red lines with regards to issues of religion, the homeland and national matters \u2026 we often disagree in parliament. This doesn\u2019t mean that each person cannot express their personal opinion. But veteran leftists in Syriza are grumbling, arguing that with Anel as its partner the coalition will never be able to move ahead with the leftist policies it wants to implement now that the worst of fiscal adjustment is over. Hong Kong\u2019s economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, boosted by exports, household spending and investment. GDP increased by 1% between April and June, compared with the same period a year earlier, up from 0.7% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast a slight slowdown to 0.6%. Hong Kong\u2019s statistics office raised its forecast for full-year growth in 2017 to a range of 3-4% from 2-3% previously. However, Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics, said growth in Hong Kong is likely to slow: We think GDP growth will slow in the second half of the year. The recent strength in capital spending won\u2019t last. The city\u2019s overheated property market also remains a major concern. For this year as a whole, we remain comfortable with our forecast that GDP will grow by around 3.3%, which is well above most expectations. But we expect growth to slow to 1.5% in 2018, which is lower than most expect. July inflation rates for the eurozone\u2019s largest economies have been confirmed: Germany: 1.7% France: 0.8% Italy: 1.2% Spain: 1.5% The VIX index, which measures market expectations of short-term volatility, has hit 17.19. That\u2019s the highest level since Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in November. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, has this take: Volatility is back: the VIX just popped to its highest since the election of Donald Trump as jitters about North Korea roil risk sentiment. It\u2019s about time the market woke up \u2013 nothing like the prospect of a nuclear stand-off to sharpen mind of investors who had become a tad complacent. It comes amid another bloodbath for European stocks. The FTSE and CAC in particular are taking a pasting, while the DAX is trading below its 200-day moving average. The FTSE is now about 250 points, or more than 3%, below its high of the week hit on Tuesday. Brent crude oil is down 1.2% at $51.30 a barrel, as fears about over supply persist. CMC\u2019s Michael McCarthy says the tensions between the US and North Korea are also weighing on oil. I think the issue that is affecting the market is the general risk sentiment of sabre-rattling between Washington and Pyongyang. The drop in oil prices is despite official data, which showed inventories in the US fell by 6.5 million barrels in the week ending 4 August. The pound is roughly flat against the dollar this morning, at $1.2973. That is a touch above the three-week low of $1.2952 on Thursday, as investors digested a mixed bag of data on the UK economy. Viraj Patel, currency strategist at ING, said a weaker trend for the pound was likely: The July bounce in sterling was on some expectations that the Bank of England will increase interest rates at its latest policy meeting, but with fundamentals looking increasingly downbeat for the economy, it seems to to be a path of gradual weakness for sterling. The pound is up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1032. European markets are down across the board this morning: FTSE 100: -0.9% at 7,322 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.2% at 11,989 France\u2019s CAC: -0.7% at 5,079 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.9% at 21,493 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.8% at 10,368 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.6% at 374 If you haven\u2019t already, do sign up for our regular morning email for the latest business and economics news: Gold prices are holding steady after hitting the highest in more than two months earlier this morning. Investors are piling out of equities and into gold, as escalating tensions between the US and North Korea drive demand for safe haven assets. Spot gold hit the highest since 8 June at $1.284.64 per ounce, and is on course for a weekly gain of more than 2%. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda: Traders should closely watch global equities today, with further falls and risk aversion likely pumping more safe-haven flows into precious metals. The FTSE 100 is down 60 points or 0.8% in early trading at 7,330, as investors jitters in the US and Asia spread to Europe. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, says the tensions between the US and North Korea are completely dominating markets around the world. Stock markets in Asia overnight continued to be under pressure from the stalemate between North Korea and America. The tension between the US and North Korea is still dominating the news and it is looming over the financial markets. The uncertainty surrounding the situation has been the main driver of the markets recently, and the enormous surge in the volatility index tells us exactly what traders are thinking. Global equity markets have been severely shaken by the standoff between the two countries, Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets have followed Wall Street lower this morning as Donald Trump ramped up threats against North Korea. The President suggested his previous threat to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the country was not \u201ctough enough\u201d. He told reporters: [North Korea] better get their act together or they\u2019re going to be in trouble like few nations ever have been in trouble in this world. Here is our full story on the developments: In Asia, the Hang Seng is down 1.8% at 29,956, while the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.7% to 3,207. European markets are expected to open lower: Also coming up today are July inflation figures from the major eurozone economies and the US.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Commonwealth Bank has indicated it will not lend money to Adani\u2019s proposed Carmichael coalmine, leaving the project without financing from any of Australia\u2019s big four banks. A spokesman from Commonwealth Bank said the bank is \u201cnot among the banks who have been, or will be, asked to consider this financing\u201d. But a spokesman for Adani told Guardian Australia the bank\u2019s statement is just a reflection of the fact Adani has said it would not be approaching any Australian bank for financing. \u201cWe are well advanced with our financing,\u201d he said, adding that it needs to be completed by the end of 2017, or the end of the first quarter of 2018. \u201cThose arrangements have been, and continue to be, with international financial institutions. We have never ever approached Westpac, Commonwealth, ANZ or NAB,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have said publicly that we will not be approaching any of the big banks ... They\u2019ve just picked that fact up.\u201d He said Adani would not be approaching any Australian banks. The statement follows a significant public campaign pressuring the bank to rule-out funding the project. Until today, it was the last of Australia\u2019s big-four banks to not rule out lending to the project. Commonwealth Bank remains a lender to Adani\u2019s Abbot Point coal export terminal, through which coal from the proposed Carmichael mine will be shipped through the Great Barrier Reef to India. The first of the big four banks ruled out lending to the project two years ago, with NAB distancing itself from the mine in September 2015, and ANZ following suit in December. Then in April this year Westpac became the third of the big banks to rule out funding the project, drawing criticism from then-resources minister Matthew Canavan, who said the bank had a conflict of interest because of its interest in other coal-producing regions, and called for a boycott of the bank. The Commonwealth Bank had previously stepped back from the project, ending its role as a finance adviser, but until now had not indicated it would avoid financing it. Blair Palese, chief executive of 350.org Australia said the announcement was a win for the public campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge win for the two and a half years of campaigning from the public across Australia to put pressure on the bank,\u201d Pelase said. \u201cLiterally there were thousands of protests at Commbank branches around the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be really great if they would come out openly and clearly (to rule out the project) but we\u2019ll take it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear statement that it\u2019s a toxic project.\u201d Julien Vincent, chief executive of Market Forces, a financial campaign group, said not having any of Australia\u2019s big-four banks on board would be a problem for Adani. \u201cThey provide not just debt but credibility,\u201d he said. \u201cLosing Commonwealth Bank from the pool of prospective lenders is a huge blow, given that CBA is already a lender to Adani\u2019s Abbot Point coal export terminal.\u201d Jonathan Moylan, a campaigner at Greenpeace said the announcement from CBA is a win for the public, but that pressure on the bank to release a stronger climate policy would continue. \u201cIt\u2019s a step forward \u2013 the fact that Commbank have been forced to publicly comment on the Adani project means it\u2019s obvious they are under pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety thousand people have taken action to call on the bank to rule out new coal projects. That action is just going to continue until Commbank does the right thing,\u201d Moylan said.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has decided to stick to plastic banknotes despite complaints from vegans and religious groups that they contain tallow, an animal byproduct. The central bank concluded after \u201ccareful and serious consideration and extensive public consultation\u201d that switching to palm oil alternatives would be costly and raise questions about environmental sustainability. A row broke out over the use of animal fat in the new plastic fiver last November, and a petition was launched calling for the use of tallow to be stopped. The petition said the use of animal fat was \u201cunacceptable to millions of vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others in the UK\u201d. Some Hindu temples in the UK banned the \u00a35 note. Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley and a vegetarian, tweeted: The decision means the new plastic \u00a320 note and future print runs of \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes will be made from polymer, which typically contains less than 0.05% of animal fat. The only viable alternative would be to use chemicals derived from palm oil, the central bank said, but its suppliers were \u201cunable to commit to sourcing the highest level of sustainable palm oil at this time\u201d. Coconut oil did not work, tests by the suppliers Innovia and De La Rue showed. Another consideration was value for money. The Bank estimates the cost of switching would be about \u00a316.5m over the next 10 years, on top of the \u00a370m cost of reprinting the \u00a35 and \u00a310 notes. The Treasury advised that a switch to palm oil would not represent value for money for taxpayers. Polymer banknotes are used in more than 30 countries. It emerged during the Bank\u2019s research that plastic containing animal fat is also used in debit and credit cards, mobile phones, carrier bags, cosmetics, soaps, household detergent bottles and car parts. The central bank said 3,554 people responded to its consultation. Of those who expressed a preference, 88% were against the use of animal-derived additives and 48% were against the use of palm oil-derived additives. It said it had taken account of its obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and had \u201cnot taken this decision lightly\u201d. The Bank argues that polymer banknotes are much harder to counterfeit and last longer than paper notes. Mark Carney dipped one of the new plastic fivers in chicken curry at Borough Market in London last year to prove their durability. The news came as Royal Bank of Scotland said it would issue its first polymer \u00a310 note in Scotland. The new Scottish tenner and RBS\u2019s first plastic fiver, issued last year, are made by De La Rue and also contain traces of tallow. The new \u00a310 note, to be released on 4 October, will be 15% smaller than current paper banknotes. It will feature the Scottish mathematician and astronomer Mary Somerville. The face of the new polymer \u00a320 note, scheduled to enter circulation in 2020, has been revealed as philanthropist and entrepreneur Catherine Cranston, who set up a series of tearooms across Glasgow. She was a major patron of Scottish artists Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald. Scottish banknotes are issued by RBS, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale. The Committee of Scottish Bankers said the Scottish banks would, like the Bank of England, continue to use polymer for banknotes after \u201ccareful consideration\u201d.",
