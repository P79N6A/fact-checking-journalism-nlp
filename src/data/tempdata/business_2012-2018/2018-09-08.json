      "bodyText": "In the past six months, some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies have found themselves flat on the floor, gasping for breath and, in one case, seeking help from the global financial rescue centre otherwise known as the International Monetary Fund. Argentina\u2019s $50bn bailout by the Washington-based lender of last resort is the most extreme event so far, but it sits alongside the dramatic collapse of the Turkish lira, a recession in South Africa and dire economic predictions for the Philippines, Indonesia and Mexico. Making matters worse, the US is poised to slap tariffs as high as 25% on as much as $200bn worth of Chinese goods. If the US goes ahead, Beijing has already threatened to retaliate, which would only incense President Donald Trump further. This tit-for-tat might only end when tariffs are applied to the entire $500bn of Chinese goods imported by America each year. In response, the stock markets of many developing nations have slumped in value, leaving investors to ask themselves whether they are witnessing an emerging-markets meltdown akin to the Asian crisis of 1997: a panic that wrecked the finances of several hedge funds and proved to be an hors d\u2019oeuvre before the dotcom crash of 1999 and the global financial crisis of 2008. Investors have run for safety to such an extent that the MSCI Emerging Markets index, which measures the value of shares in emerging economies, has tumbled by more than 20% since the beginning of the year. That slump appeared to be over in July, when Turkey and Argentina were seen as being isolated, and more importantly ringfenced, economic trouble spots. But figures last week showing that the US economy is steaming along like a runaway train \u2013 underlining the likelihood of more US interest rate rises \u2013 have sent the currencies and stock markets of most emerging-market economies tumbling again. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at currency dealer FXTM, says that a sense of doom is lingering in the financial markets as fears of contagion from the \u201cbrutal emerging-market sell-off\u201d rattle investor confidence. \u201cMore pain seems to be ahead for emerging markets as the combination of global trade tensions, prospects of higher US interest rates and overall market uncertainty haunt investor attraction,\u201d he says. The closely watched ISM survey of US manufacturing showed the sector was just a few points away from reaching its all-time high, recorded in 1983. That puts factory output at bursting point, with car firms and the aerospace industry working around the clock to satisfy demand at home and abroad. In the second quarter of the year, the US economy was running at an annualised growth rate of 4.1% \u2013 much higher than the UK and eurozone, which are expanding at a sluggish 1.5% by comparison. Analysts are convinced these figures, coupled with low unemployment, will persuade the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to keep raising interest rates this year and into 2019. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said as much last month in a speech to his international counterparts at the annual Jackson Hole central bankers\u2019 meeting in Wyoming. Alarmingly, he praised Alan Greenspan, who ran the Fed in the 1990s and early 2000s, for spending the latter part of his tenure steadily increasing rates to choke off a boom. It was an unfortunate analogy to draw, given that Greenspan is now known for keeping rates too low and allowing first the dotcom bubble and then the bank lending boom, only raising rates when it was too late. But investors didn\u2019t need Powell\u2019s speech to read the signals. They understand that two potentially disastrous trends for emerging markets are set in motion by higher US interest rates. First, billions of dollars invested in emerging-market stocks and bonds begin to make their way back to the US, where they can once again earn a decent return in deposit accounts without taking any risks. To prevent some of this money departing their shores, emerging-market economies must put up their own interest rates. That solves one problem only to create another \u2013 namely that borrowing in the local currency becomes more expensive for domestic businesses and households. Secondly, the cost of borrowing in dollars soars, hurting all those emerging-market businesses and governments that have borrowed from US banks in dollars over in the last decade to help fund their expansion. The US Federal funds rate has moved up from 0.25% in 2014 to 2% today. A rate of 3% in the looks likely by the end of next year. Turkish businesses are among those that took out cheap loans before 2014 to invest in new factories, meaning they have enormous borrowings in dollars. Now that they must re-finance these debts, they face shockingly high interest rates. Furthermore, to prevent the Fed\u2019s actions influencing the domestic economy, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has put his brother-in-law in charge of the finance ministry and is seeking to control the central bank, preventing it from raising rates. However, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s interventions have only made the situation worse. Inflation has hit almost 18% and is still rising. An effective freeze on interest rates robs the state of a key tool in calming inflation. It also encourages more cash to leave Istanbul\u2019s banks for New York. But Mark Mobius, the financial trader frequently referred to as \u201cMr Emerging Markets\u201d, says that while Turkey and Argentina have had severe problems, most developing nations have sought to protect themselves from rising US interest rates. China is also capable of weathering the immediate storm. \u201cThe big devaluations have taken place,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the ones we will see from now on will be incremental.\u201d He says that while no on knows where the bottom of the market will be, he is buying shares in emerging-market companies on the basis that if they fall further, it will not be far. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Canadian trading firm BMO Capital Markets, says those who argue that emerging-market chaos could spread to the rest of the world are wrong. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should be using words like \u2018contagion\u2019. The global economy is in good shape and the countries we are talking about have minuscule GDP numbers. They are just too small to hurt the global economy.\u201d The second tier of affected countries, like South Africa and Indonesia, are also likely to follow Argentina\u2019s lead and win round investors with austerity programmes to bring down borrowings. It is a policy that has the potential to trigger domestic strife, but it will prevent even more of them from joining the exodus. Countries in the spotlight Argentina The Argentinian central bank raised interest rates to 60% last month in an effort to prop up its plunging currency. This did not placate investors, so the government launched sweeping austerity measures to try to restore confidence. The currency crisis is likely to push the economy into deep recession. It has asked the IMF to accelerate the payment of $50bn in emergency funding to bolster its finances. Finance minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne said the austerity measures \u2013 and higher export taxes\u2013 would allow Argentina to achieve a balanced budget next year, instead of a 1.3% deficit as previously expected. South Africa South Africa unexpectedly plunged into recession in the second quarter of 2018, recording a 0.7% drop in GDP and triggering a sell-off that took the rand to its lowest level in two years. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced Jacob Zuma earlier this year in a whirlwind of optimism for the economy which sent financial markets soaring, says the recession is a \u201ctransitional issue\u201d from which the economy will recover. Unemployment is at 27.2% and rising, bringing a risk of nationwide protest over the state of the economy. Turkey The country\u2019s unfolding crisis is likely to push it into deep recession as inflation continues to rise. The lira has fallen to the lowest levels on record, pushing up borrowing costs. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan remains defiant, accusing foreign interests of waging economic war on the country. In the US, Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on the country\u2019s steel exports in a bitter dispute over the detention of Andrew Brunson, a US pastor accused by Turkey of espionage. Emergency support from the IMF has been mooted, and Turkey is also under pressure to raise interest rates, though Erdo\u011fan may resist this. China High levels of corporate debt have fuelled global fears about the Chinese economy and its ability to reduce reliance on debt and maintain growth. The picture is complicated by Trump\u2019s threat to impose $200bn of tariffs on Chinese exports. Investors are concerned an escalation of the trade war could slow global growth, as China is a key driver of the world economy. The yuan has dropped against the dollar this year, which could alleviate the impact of the tariffs on Chinese exporters, whose goods will become more competitive. Indonesia The Indonesian central bank has had to raise interest rates to shore up its currency. The rupiah is at a 20-year low, prompted by rising debt and numbers of investors betting against emerging markets. Indonesia has the highest debt to foreign creditors of any Asian country, at 35% of GDP. As inflation has so far remained under control, the central bank would probably have preferred to cut rates to stimulate its struggling economy, but fears over the currency fall forced it to raise rates instead. If the outlook deteriorates further, neighbouring countries including South Korea, India and the Philippines could be forced to take similar steps. Mexico Trump\u2019s steel tariffs and his threat to force US businesses to bring back production outsourced south of the border hang like a dark cloud over the Mexican economy, putting the pesounder pressure. A renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement would benefit Mexico: it has struck a deal with the US, but talks with Canada are ongoing. India The rupee is at an all-time low against the dollar amid concern over the impact of protectionism and higher US interest rates. High inflation has led to protests in Delhi overfuel prices. India is the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy, with growth of 8.2% in the three months to June. But its trade deficitworsened in July to $18bn because of higher fuel imports and rising global oil prices. Government economists are sanguine about the currency, but others fear slower growth ahead.

The largest of these are collectively called the Brics \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China. These countries tend to have lower per-capita income than developed markets. They are also typically moving away from basic activities such as farming and mining towards&nbsp; manufacturing and services. The phrase can also be shorthand for nations that are adopting free-market economic practices as they become more aligned with nations such as the US, Britain and Japan. Emerging markets are prone to rapid change and are often more exposed to factors outside their control.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Why are they important?</b></p>\n    <p>As they grow, these nations will have an increasing impact on global trade. They are becoming increasingly important for British businesses as they seek to export more, especially, post-Brexit, in new markets. China is still considered an emerging market even though it exerts huge influence on the global stage. It is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of goods, yet its economy is still advancing as it moves from manufacturing towards services.</p>\n    <p><b>Why are so many in trouble?</b></p>\n    <p>The root of the pressure is the strong US dollar, boosted by higher US interest rates. A decade of low rates made investing in emerging markets more attractive, helping fuel ballooning debt in these countries. A rise in dollar borrowing costs is prompting greater fears over their ability to repay those debts. The worrying picture is completed by rising oil prices and geopolitical risks from trade tensions as Donald Trump imposes import tariffs.</p>\n    <p><b>What is the solution?</b></p>\n    <p>There could be painful economic adjustments for many emerging market nations. Many will need to raise interest rates to protect their domestic currency, a move that also depresses economic growth. In the short term, tax cuts to stimulate growth, or the use of austerity measures and privatisations might help them regain the confidence of international investors. Weaker domestic currencies could be a boost to these countries\u2019 exports. Some nations may need to go to the International Monetary Fund for emergency funding.</p>\n    <p><b>Could it affect us?</b></p>\n    <p>Economists have been relatively sanguine about the risks to the global economy, although that is changing as financial markets become unsettled by some nations\u2019 plunging currencies and mounting debt. The plight of smaller nations will have limited effect, but should larger nations such as China or India struggle further, the consequences could be severe.-</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But Mark Mobius, the financial trader frequently referred to as \u201cMr Emerging Markets\u201d, says that while Turkey and Argentina have had severe problems, most developing nations have sought to protect themselves from rising US interest rates.

      "bodyText": "The Nike ad starring Colin Kaepernick does not appear to have adversely affected sales, an analyst said on Saturday. According to Edison Trends, a digital commerce research company: \u201cNike sales grew 31% from Sunday through Tuesday over Labor Day this year, besting 2017\u2019s comparative 17% increase.\u201d The sportswear giant released the first version of its ad on Monday, the Labor Day holiday. It featured the quarterback and the slogan: \u201cBelieve in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it.\u201d Kaepernick, 30, has been without a team since opting out of his San Francisco 49ers contract in March 2017. In 2016 he was an originator of protests by NFL players, targeting racial injustice and police brutality, which often involve kneeling during the pre-game playing of the national anthem. Donald Trump has made the protests a key part of his appeal to his base, arguing that the players are disrespecting the anthem, the US flag and the military. On Tuesday, the president told the rightwing website Daily Caller: \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible message that [Nike] are sending and the purpose of them doing it, maybe there\u2019s a reason for them doing it. But I think as far as sending a message, I think it\u2019s a terrible message and a message that shouldn\u2019t be sent. There\u2019s no reason for it.\u201d He also said Nike paid him \u201ca lot of rent\u201d in New York and admitted that the protests and the Nike ad were \u201cin another way \u2026 what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn\u2019t do\u201d. \u201cBut I personally am on a different side of it,\u201d Trump said. In the following days, the president pursued the issue via Twitter. On Wednesday, he wrote: \u201cJust like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!\u201d Trump did not supply evidence for his claim of \u201canger and boycotts\u201d but opposition to the company\u2019s move was expressed widely and in some instances creatively on social media. On Friday, the morning after the full version of the Nike ad played during the Philadelphia Eagles v Atlanta Falcons NFL season opener, the president asked: \u201cWhat was Nike thinking?\u201d Edison Trends\u2019 analysis suggested the company will be thinking its gambit has worked, allowing it to surf familiar controversy and create a \u201cTrump bump\u201d all of its own. \u201cNike\u2019s 2018 late summer sales show much the same trend as last year\u2019s,\u201d the company wrote, \u201cwith order volume decreasing slightly going into late August. The similarity decreases coming out of Labor Day weekend, however, with sales seeing a bigger bump on Monday and Tuesday than in the past.\u201d Edison Trends said its analysis was based on \u201canonymised and aggregated e-receipts from more than 3 million consumers\u201d. The NFL has not resolved how to respond to or govern the protests, which were widely discussed again on Thursday after Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett sat down before the anthem had finished. In July, in an open letter to league owners, the NBA great and Guardian sports columnist Kareem Abdul Jabbar wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s been two years since Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest systemic racial injustice, especially police brutality, against people of color. \u201cThe worst thing about that isn\u2019t that two years later we\u2019re still debating whether players have the right to protest, it\u2019s that not much has changed regarding what Kaepernick was protesting.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This week came the news that the economy over the past year grew faster than it has any time since 2012. It was a nice point given that the average household\u2019s income is still at 2012 levels in real terms. The national accounts are not reflecting the reality of people\u2019s own economic experience, but they do reflect how skewed the economy has become away from households. Within the national account the ABS provided a figure called \u201creal net national disposable income per capita\u201d, which is often referred to as a measure of Australia\u2019s economic wellbeing. In the past it has been a rough and ready guide for how we\u2019re all going. But the problem is the national income includes not just the income of households, but also companies. In the past two years, this measure of wellbeing was 5.5%. Given the average annual rise this century has been just 1.7%, that should mean we\u2019re all doing rather nicely! Except over the past two years, the real household disposable income has fallen. If you use the ABS\u2019s price index for household consumption it has fallen 1.3%, if you use the standard consumer price index, it has fallen 2.5%. By either measure, household\u2019s disposable income is now lower than it was at the end of 2011. Six and half years of no improvement. And yet the mining industry is booming once again \u2013 it contributed nearly 11% to our entire GDP growth of the past year. But it only accounted for 4% of the increase in employment \u2013 below the 7% employment growth share it took in the pre-GFC mining boom years. And whereas back then wage growth in the industry reached 6%, now mining wages are growing by just 1.3% \u2013 lower than the overall rate. So yes, we still have a mining boom, but one where the benefits mostly go to the companies and not the workers, and which unlike in the past now has a negligible flow on to other industries. We are living in an economy that is quickly shifting away from households and workers and towards companies. An economy where workers have little option but to acquiesce. This week the ABS also released the latest industrial dispute numbers. In the past 12 months just 41,000 employees were at some point engaged in industrial action \u2013 it marked only the second time ever that fewer than 50,000 were so engaged. The only other time that has occurred was in the 12 months of 2007 when under WorkChoices the number of employees on strike was down to a record low 36,000. So much for the Fair Work Act putting the balance too greatly in favour of unions. And then came the cheery news that interest rates were going up. When Westpac announced that they were raising the mortgage rate by 14 basis points, everyone knew that the other three big banks would follow. And so when this week both the Commonwealth and ANZ banks announced that they too were raising their home loan rates by 15 and 16 basis points respectively, there was little shock. Around 92% of all home mortgage lending occurs through banks, and the big 4 account for 80% of that. Thus the entire process was nicely summed up by one analyst who told the ABC that NAB will likely follow soon, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty certain now NAB will have to go as well \u2014 probably not have to so much as they can go now.\u201d That really is the whole issue \u2013 the big four banks can, and so they do. Much like employers, in a world where going on strike has been made effectively impossible, can and do what they like with wage negotiations. Of course the oddity of the rate increase is that this week marked the 26th month the Reserve Bank has had the cash rate set at 1.5%. The banks argue that they need to increase the rates because the cost of their funding has increased. And it is true that recently the short-term funding costs have gone up quite markedly. The cost of short-term funding has definitely risen in the period since August 2016 when the RBA put the cash rate at its current level. But short-term financing accounts for only around 20% of banks funding costs. Meanwhile, the cost of deposits \u2013 which makes up 60% of banks funding costs \u2013 has fallen. Since August 2016 the gap between the interest rate banks pay for short-term funds and the cash rate has increased 23 basis points (or 0.23% pts) \u2013 so yes, it has become more costly. But in the same period the gap between the interest rate it pays for term deposits and the cash rate has fallen 43 basis points \u2013 so that has actually become cheaper. Swing and roundabouts, I guess \u2013 where the customers get thrown off the roundabout and hit in the back of the head with the swing. It\u2019s not true that the banks are doing this because the government is dishevelled; the reality is for all Peter Costello\u2019s old lines about having the banks in for a stern talking to, they can do what they like for the most part. So disconnected from the reality of households has our economy become that the president of the Real Estate Institute on the ABC\u2019s 730 report could suggest with a straight face that people struggling to pay rent should \u201cGod forbid, get two jobs\u201d. He suggested \u201cNow your viewers will hate that. But many, many people do it. A lot of our migrants work a couple of jobs\u201d. Of course they do! Because one great reason employers love migrant workers is that they can use threats about their visa to prevent them from joining a union, and their temporary residency status often sees them exploited. Fairfax media found that some workers here under the seasonal worker programme were paid as little as $8 an hour, and a survey by UTS and UNSW Sydney found that in 2017 a third of international students were being paid only about half the median wage. The economy has long been set more favourably towards those with power, but the past few years has seen a massive lurch, and this week gave us all a very stark reminder. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The only other time that has occurred was in the 12 months of 2007 when under WorkChoices the number of employees on strike was down to a record low 36,000.</p> <p>So much for the Fair Work Act putting the balance too greatly in favour of unions.</p> <p>And then came the cheery news that interest rates were going up.</p> <p>When Westpac announced that they were raising the mortgage rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/29/westpac-lifts-interest-rates-other-banks-expected-to-follow\">by 14 basis points</a>, everyone knew that the other three big banks would follow. And so when this week both the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-06/anz-lifts-variable-mortgate-rates/10208852\">Commonwealth and ANZ banks</a> announced that they too were raising their home loan rates by 15 and 16 basis points respectively, there was little shock. Around 92% of all home mortgage lending occurs through banks, and the big 4 account for 80% of that. Thus the entire process was nicely summed up by one analyst who told the ABC that NAB will likely follow soon, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty certain now NAB will have to go as well \u2014 probably not have to so much as they can go now.\u201d</p> <p>That really is the whole issue \u2013 the big four banks can, and so they do. Much like employers, in a world where going on strike has been made effectively impossible, can and do what they like with wage negotiations.</p> <p>Of course the oddity of the rate increase is that this week marked the 26th month the Reserve Bank has had the cash rate set at 1.5%. The banks argue that they need to increase the rates because the cost of their funding has increased.</p> <p>And it is true that recently the short-term funding costs have gone up quite markedly. The cost of short-term funding has definitely risen in the period since August 2016 when the RBA put the cash rate at its current level.</p> <p>But short-term financing accounts for only around 20% of banks funding costs. Meanwhile, the cost of deposits \u2013 which makes up 60% of banks funding costs \u2013 has fallen.</p> <p>Since August 2016 the gap between the interest rate banks pay for short-term funds and the cash rate has increased 23 basis points (or 0.23% pts) \u2013 so yes, it has become more costly. But in the same period the gap between the interest rate it pays for term deposits and the cash rate has fallen 43 basis points \u2013 so that has actually become cheaper.</p> <p>Swing and roundabouts, I guess \u2013 where the customers get thrown off the roundabout and hit in the back of the head with the swing.</p> <p>It\u2019s not true that the banks are doing this because the government is dishevelled; the reality is for all Peter Costello\u2019s old lines about having the banks in for a stern talking to, they can do what they like for the most part.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/06/commonwealth-and-anz-raise-mortgage-rates-blaming-rising-costs\">Commonwealth and ANZ raise mortgage rates, blaming rising costs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So disconnected from the reality of households has our economy become that the president of the Real Estate Institute on <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/is-australia-in-a-rental-affordability-crisis/10210712\">the ABC\u2019s 730 report</a> could suggest with a straight face that people struggling to pay rent should \u201cGod forbid, get two jobs\u201d. He suggested \u201cNow your viewers will hate that. But many, many people do it. A lot of our migrants work a couple of jobs\u201d.</p> <p>Of course they do! Because one great reason employers love migrant workers is that they can use threats about their visa to prevent them from joining a union, and their temporary residency status often sees them exploited. <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/key-farm-scheme-badly-exploited-migrant-workers-paid-8-an-hour-20180518-p4zg53.html\">Fairfax media</a> found that some workers here under the seasonal worker programme were paid as little as $8 an hour, and a survey <a href=\"https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/business-law/backpackers-international-students-suffer-widespread-wage-theft-report-finds\">by UTS and UNSW Sydney</a> found that in 2017 a third of international students were being paid only about half the median wage.</p> <p>The economy has long been set more favourably towards those with power, but the past few years has seen a massive lurch, and this week gave us all a very stark reminder.</p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",
