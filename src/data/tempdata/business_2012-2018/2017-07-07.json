      "bodyText": "The UK plans to invest millions of pounds to explore how the batteries in thousands of electric cars could help the power grid and drive take-up of the cleaner vehicles. British businesses will be able to bid for \u00a320m of government funding for undertaking research and trials of vehicle-to-grid technology, which officials believe holds \u201cenormous potential\u201d benefits for drivers and the energy system. The announcement comes on the heels of a week of good news for electric car manufacturers and battery-makers. Volvo said it was turning its back on cars powered solely by an internal combustion engine, France declared it would ban sales of diesel and petrol cars by 2040 and Tesla revealed plans to build the world\u2019s largest battery storage plant in South Australia. There are now more than 90,000 electric or plug-in hybrid cars on UK roads, which currently only draw electricity from the grid when owners recharge them overnight at home or for half an hour at rapid charging stations in towns, cities and motorway service stations. But with vehicle-to-grid, their batteries could also provide services to local power networks and National Grid \u2013 returning electricity to the grid at times of peak demand, or filling the gap if the output from windfarms or solar panels were suddenly less than expected. Drivers also stand to benefit as they would be compensated in some form \u2013 such as via payments or free parking \u2013 for allowing their batteries to help power grid managers. StrategicFit, an energy consultancy, thinks a single electric car could earn its owner \u00a31,000-\u00a32,000 a year for helping the grid, depending on where it were located and how often it were plugged in. Jesse Norman, a transport minister, said: \u201cElectric vehicles are already helping thousands of motorists cut their fuel costs, and now there is an extra financial incentive for motorists to go green.\u201d The Japanese car-maker Nissan and Italian energy company Enel last year launched the UK\u2019s first large-scale trial of the technology, involving 100 electric cars, and there are several smaller pilot projects being run by universities. The \u00a320m fund will support such work, by paying for feasibility studies into how the technology could be used in the future, development of charging equipment and trials around the country. The competitions are expected to attract energy companies, car makers and local authorities. Adam Mitchell, the principal at StrategicFit, said: \u201cThere are many companies who expect [the technology] to grow quite significantly. They are starting to test commercial feasibility but it\u2019s fairly early days.\u201d The government wants the projects to address how consumers grapple with the technology, examine cybersecurity issues and demonstrate the technical and commercial potential for supporting power networks. Officials believe that giving new financial incentives to electric car owners \u2013 on top of the cheaper running costs and exemptions to congestion zones they already enjoy \u2013 will drive a \u201csignificant take-up\u201d of the vehicles in the next five to 10 years.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 40 MPs are backing a parliamentary motion calling on supermarkets to support the Fairtrade ethical mark amid fears the 25-year-old campaign faces collapse. The cross-party support ramps up pressure for a change of heart by Sainsbury\u2019s, the biggest backer of Fairtrade in the UK, which recently began experimenting with its own \u201cfairly traded\u201d scheme on tea. Campaigners and shareholders accused the supermarket of undermining Fairtrade at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting this week. They fear the changes will be extended to other products, including bananas and coffee. An online petition on Change.org calling on Sainsbury\u2019s to stick with Fairtrade has gathered more than 85,000 signatures. Caroline Lucas MP, the Green party co-leader and main sponsor of the parliamentary early day motion, called on supermarkets not to confuse shoppers by abandoning Fairtrade. She said: \u201cTo abandon the Fairtrade mark would be an act of huge irresponsibility from a supermarket which claims \u2018sourcing with integrity\u2019 as one of its five key values. Supermarkets should be empowering people to shop ethically \u2013 not making it harder. Abandoning the Fairtrade mark in favour of in-house certification schemes creates big differences in standards between companies and is confusing for shoppers. \u201cPeople must be able to trust that products which claim to be ethically produced are of the best possible standard. The decision by Sainsbury\u2019s to turn away from the Fairtrade mark, a scheme so well respected for getting farmers from developing countries a good deal and tackling the causes of poverty, sets a concerning precedent. I hope Sainsbury\u2019s will reconsider its withdrawal from the scheme and that other supermarkets will strengthen their support.\u201d The motion, which is backed by Conservatives including Peter Bottomley, Lib Dems including Jo Swinson, Labour MPs including Catherine McKinnell, as well as Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, says: \u201cThis house deeply regrets the decision by the supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s to drop the Fairtrade mark for its own-brand tea and develop its own certification scheme; notes that the Fairtrade Foundation is a respected organisation and part of a global network that strives to ensure that farmers and workers in developing countries get a better deal for their produce.\u201d A spokesman for Sainsbury\u2019s said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s would welcome the opportunity to take MPs through all the benefits that our pilot will bring beyond what the current Fairtrade model offers. We are very confident that our pilot project will deliver more funding to farmers in Africa than they receive through Fairtrade as well as greater levels of support.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy added 222,000 new jobs in June, reversing a worrying slowdown in jobs growth for Donald Trump but once again highlighting America\u2019s low-wage economy. Economists had been expecting the US to add about 178,000 jobs over the month, but the latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics comfortably beat those estimates. Healthcare and food services showed big monthly gains. The unemployment rate moved up marginally to 4.4%, but remains at lows unseen since 2001 and rose as more people came off the sidelines and started looking for work. This month\u2019s numbers came as economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create large numbers of new jobs despite Trump\u2019s promise of \u201cJOBS! JOBS! JOBS!\u201d US employers added just 138,000 jobs in May, the third month of relatively soft growth in the job market. But those figures were revised up this month to 152,000. Employment growth has averaged 180,000 per month thus far this year. In comparison, payroll employment growth averaged 187,000 a month in 2016 and 226,000 in 2015. The latest figures will increase the probability that the Federal Reserve will once again raise interest rates this year. The Fed raised short-term interest rates last month for the third time since December, with its chair, Janet Yellen, citing the \u201cvery strong labor market\u201d. June marked the 81st consecutive month of job growth in the US, but the recovery from the depths of the 2007 recession has been marked by slow wage growth and a worryingly large number of people in part-time work. Once again, the largest growth areas were in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying blue-collar industries Trump has pledged to support. Mining, an area in which Trump has promised to bring back jobs, added 8,000 positions over the month, but manufacturing and construction saw little change. Healthcare added 37,000 jobs over the month, while food services and drinking places added 29,000 jobs, in a sector that has added 277,000 jobs over the year. Wages once again grew only marginally in June, rising 2.5% from a year ago and little changed from prior months. These numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so \u201creal\u201d wage growth is close to 1%. Some 5.3 million people were employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers), little changed from previous months. The Bureau said these individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job. \u201cOverall, this morning\u2019s report shows a recovery continuing to chug along, but with wage growth below target levels, it is abundantly clear that we have a ways to go before we reach genuine full employment \u2013 where workers see better wage growth and workers who have been sitting on the sidelines see better job opportunities,\u201d wrote Elise Gould, senior economist with the Economics Policy Institute. Friday\u2019s government figures come a day after ADP, the US\u2019s largest private payroll processor, released its latest monthly tally of job gains. The report showed jobs growth slowed last month. According to ADP, the private sector added 158,000 new jobs in June; economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting a gain of 185,000. Small businesses, a leading driver of job growth, added just 17,000 jobs in the month, with the smallest of small businesses, those employing one to 19 people, recording zero jobs added. Once again, the service sector was the largest new employer. Overall, hiring may be weakening because the number of available workers has declined with the unemployment rate, now at a 16-year low. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said: \u201cThe job market continues to power forward. Abstracting from the monthly ups and downs, job growth remains a stalwart between 150,000 and 200,000. At this pace, which is double the rate of labour force growth, the tight labour market will continue getting tighter.\u201d",

Once again, the service sector was the largest new employer.</p> <p>Overall, hiring may be weakening because the number of available workers has declined with the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/issues/unemployment.htm\">unemployment</a> rate, now at a 16-year low. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, said: \u201cThe job market continues to power forward. Abstracting from the monthly ups and downs, job growth remains a stalwart between 150,000 and 200,000. At this pace, which is double the rate of labour force growth, the tight labour market will continue getting tighter.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "PS: Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s story about today\u2019s weak UK data, and what it means for interest rates.... Liam Fox, Britain\u2019s international trade secretary, has said there is no reason why the UK can\u2019t replicate the current smooth trading agreements it enjoys with the EU after Brexit, unless politics gets in the way. He told Reuters during a visit to Paris: We\u2019re going into an arrangement with the EU already with zero tariffs , we\u2019re going there with complete regulatory equivalence and with customs systems that already work. The only reason we wouldn\u2019t replicate them would be if politics got in the way of good economics. Fox made the comments a day after the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said London\u2019s \u201cred lines\u201d for a future trading relationship meant the UK was definitely leaving the single market and customs union, with consequences. On that note, we\u2019re closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a great weekend. US markets are up in early trading, with those strong non-farm payrolls numbers giving investors a boost. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 21,361 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,417 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,623 The FTSE 100 is also edging higher, up 0.1% or seven points at 7,345. Main markets in the rest of Europe are in the red. Analysts at Nomura said the stronger-than-expected payrolls number is good for riskier assets. Equities, EM and high yielders should like it. Higher job creation indicates growth, but weak wages indicates firms are not yet allowing the labour force to reduce margins = higher profitability. It shouldn\u2019t bear too much of an impact on the Fed timing of balance sheet reduction as this is an overall good number. So it shouldn\u2019t lead to fresh impetus on USD selling in USD/JPY. But given this is good for growth and the ECB normalisation is a far more potent animal at these levels, the markets initial reaction to buy EUR/USD on the dip is something we would agree with. The US jobs market in graphics: Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says the jobs reports is more evidence that the real economy is in \u201cgood health\u201d. The only disappointment is that wage growth still shows few signs of accelerating. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.2% m/m in June, but the annual growth rate only edged back up to 2.5%, from 2.4%. That means there has been no pick-up in wage growth whatsoever over the past 18 months. We will find out what Fed Chair Janet Yellen thinks of this next week, during her semi-annual congressional testimony. Our view is that, despite the lack of a pick-up in wage growth and core inflation, the Fed will nevertheless push ahead with hiking interest rates. The unemployment rate is already unusually low and is likely to fall further over the coming months. My colleague Dominic Rushe has the full details on the US jobs report in the context of Donald Trumps big jobs promises. He writes: The US economy added 222,000 new jobs in June, reversing a worrying slowdown in growth for president Donald Trump who campaigned on a promise of massive job creation. Economists had been expecting the US to add around 178,000 over them month but the latest numbers from the bureau of labor statistics comfortably beat those estimates as healthcare and food services showed big monthly gains. The unemployment rate moved up marginally to 4.4% but remains at lows unseen since 2001. This month\u2019s numbers came as economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create large numbers of new jobs despite president Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to create \u201cJOBS! JOBS! JOBS!\u201d US employers added just 138,000 jobs in May, the third month of relatively soft growth in the jobs market, and March and April\u2019s figures were revised down by 66,000. His full story: And here\u2019s the full data from the US labor department: Assessing what that non-farm payrolls update means for US interest rates, James Knightley, chief international economist at ING says the report is \u201cgood enough\u201d to keep the Federal Reserve on a gradual policy tightening path. Strong jobs growth should eventually translate into higher wages, but it is taking time to do so. The Fed remains confident it will come, suggesting gradual hikes will continue, but the market continues to have doubts. ...In any case, the Fed has repeatedly used the term \u201ctransitory\u201d to describe the slowdown in activity and subdued inflation backdrop and believe that it is only a matter of time before the tightness in the labour market translates into rising wage pressures. We agree. Some market reaction now to that news of stronger-than-expected growth in jobs but weaker-than-forecast wage growth in the US last month. US stock futures have extended gains but the dollar has lost ground as traders focus on the wage growth undershoot - something that will temper expectations of further rate rises from the US Federal Reserve this year. Elsewhere, there are some interesting patterns in where the new jobs are coming from in President Donald Trump\u2019s America. (Of course, his pledges to revive manufacturing were always going to take time to show in the jobs numbers but it shows the challenge ahead) More details now on that US jobs report: More jobs were added than expected but wage growth missed forecasts. The report from the Labor Department shows average earnings rose by 0.2% month-on-month in June, and were up 2.5% over the last year. Forecasts were for average hourly earnings to increase 0.3% in June and for the year-on-year growth rate to stand at 2.7%. The Labor Department said the unemployment rate was 4.4%. Economists had forecast it would hold at a 16-year low of 4.3%. BREAKING: The US economy added 222,000 jobs in June, according to the latest non-farm payrolls report. That was higher than the 179,000 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. May\u2019s gain was revised to 152,000 from the 138,000 figure previously reported. More to follow... Newsflash: The NIESR thinktank has estimated that Britain\u2019s economy only grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year. That would be an improvement on the 0.2% growth recorded in January-March, but below the 0.6% trend growth rate. Rebecca Piggott, Research Fellow at NIESR, says: Growth in services has offset a contraction in industrial output, yet remains subdued when compared with last year. The saving ratio reached an historic low of 1.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, implying that, so far, households have reduced their saving to cushion the effect of falling real incomes on consumption as inflation rises\u201d. Philip Coggan of the Economist points out that the drop in the pound after the EU referendum hasn\u2019t helped the trade gap: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here are some charts that show today\u2019s data. First, the widening of the UK trade gap to \u00a33.1bn, from \u00a32bn, as a jump in imports drove the \u2018trade in goods\u2019 deficit to over \u00a311bn: Second, the disappointing 0.1% drop in UK industrial output in May. Sustained selling pressure has just pushed the pound down through $1.29, a drop of 0.7 of a cent today. Bloomberg explains: The pound fell for the first time in three days versus the dollar after data showed U.K. factories and construction companies\u2019 output unexpectedly declined in May, adding to a spate of recent data that pointed to an economic slowdown. Sterling was on course for weekly declines against all but two of its Group-of-10 peers, as manufacturing, industrial and construction output all dropped and undercut analysts\u2019 forecasts. This morning\u2019s data paint a rather bleak picture for the UK economy and underline the challenges lying ahead, says Kay Daniel Neufeld of the CEBR. He fears that growth is going to be subdued this year, and next: So far, the depreciation in Sterling has not led to a significant reduction in the trade deficit \u2013 at Cebr we have repeatedly stressed that the UK\u2019s high-value added exports are less price sensitive and that any rebalancing in the make-up of exports will take time to manifest itself. In the meantime the lack of clarity about future trading relationship with the EU \u2013 further exacerbated by the result of the general election \u2013 weighs on activity in the manufacturing sector. As a result, Cebr expects GDP growth of only 1.3% in 2017 and 1.2% in 2018. Britain\u2019s export performance remains \u201cunderwhelming\u201d, says Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He blames manufacturers for hiking their prices since the pound fell, rather than trying to grow their market share. The main problem remains that exporters have hiked their prices, blunting the boost to competitiveness from the weak pound. Foreign-currency prices for U.K. goods exports in May were just 5% lower than in Q4 2015. Exports are earning healthy profits, but few are willing to invest and ramp up production due to Brexit risk. Markit\u2019s survey of export orders also has weakened over the last few months, casting further doubt over the likelihood of a sustained trade boost going forwards. This chart shows how exports have been lagging behind imports for more than a year Today\u2019s data suggest that Britain\u2019s economy has only grown by 0.3% in the second quarter of the year, says Howard Archer, Chief Economic Advisor to the EY ITEM Club. That would only be slightly better than the 0.2% growth posted in Q1 - the weakest of any G7 nation. Archer says: \u201cBased on today\u2019s data and the business survey results for June, we now think that industrial production is likely to have contracted by 0.5% in Q2, with construction output down 1.8%. And though an improved performance from the services sector will provide some support, GDP is likely to have grown by just 0.3% with the risks to that projection skewed to the downside. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Sterling has also hit a nine day low against the euro. The pound has dropped by almost half a eurocent to \u20ac1.1311. That means one euro is now worth 88.4p. Today\u2019s trade data provides little evidence that Britain\u2019s economy is rebalancing away from consumer spending and towards exports. My colleague Katie Allen points out that the weak pound doesn\u2019t seem to be providing much support. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal highlights that the goods deficit has been widening for a long time: Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Economics wins the prize for pithy analysis: Fast FT show that UK industrial production has been disappointing for several months: ONS senior statistician Kate Davies sums up today\u2019s flurry of disappointing UK data: \u201cActivity in the production sector was broadly unchanged in May, though the underlying position is weaker with both total output and manufacturing falling in the three months to May compared with the previous three months. Construction output also fell on a three-monthly basis, though this is after several years of growth. \u201cMeanwhile the total trade deficit widened by \u00a32 billion in the most recent three months, primarily due to high imports especially from outside the European Union.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s a triple-dose of bad news -- UK construction output fell by 1.2% in May. It also shrank by 1.2% in the March-to-May quarter, compared to the previous three months. That\u2019s the biggest drop since September 2012. The ONS blames \u201cfalls in both repair and maintenance, and all new work.\u201d The 0.2% drop in UK manufacturing output in May was triggered by a drop in car production. The ONS says: Transport equipment provided the largest downward contribution, falling by 2.3%; within this, motor vehicles, trailers and semi trailers fell by 4.4%, the largest fall since February 2016, when it fell by 5.8%. That double-dose of disappointing UK economic data has hit the pound. Sterling has slumped to $1.2917, down half a cent, as traders digest the news that Britain\u2019s trade deficit has widened and industrial output fell in May. More bad news! Britain\u2019s trade deficit has widened, due to a surge of imports. The total trade deficit jumped by \u00a31bn in May, to \u00a33.1bn - a worse reading than the City expected. Here are the key points from the Office for National Statistics: Between the 3 months to February 2017 and the 3 months to May 2017, the total UK trade (goods and services) deficit widened from \u00a36.9 billion to \u00a38.9 billion. The widening of the trade deficit in the 3 months to May 2017 reflects a higher rise in imports than the rise in exports of goods, in particular transport equipment (cars, aircraft and ships), oil and electrical machinery from non-EU countries; a decrease in exports of services also contributed. Between the 3 months to February 2017 and the 3 months to May 2017, the total UK trade (goods and services) excluding erratics deficit widened from \u00a38.6 billion to \u00a39.3 billion. The total UK trade (goods and services) deficit widened by \u00a31.0 billion between April and May 2017 to \u00a33.1 billion, following a narrowing in April 2017; this reflects an increase in imports of goods on the month following a decrease in April 2017. Newsflash! Britain\u2019s industrial production fell by 0.1% in May. That\u2019s a weaker performance that expected, and reinforces fears that the UK economy is faltering. It\u2019s also much weaker than France and Germany, which both reported strong growth earlier today (details here). Manufacturing output shrank by 0.2% during the month, dashing hopes that the weak pound is proving a tonic for the sector. Energy output fell by 0.8%. The Office for National Statistics says: In May 2017, total production was estimated to have decreased by 0.1% compared with April 2017, due to falls of 0.2% in manufacturing and 0.8% in energy supply; transport equipment provided the largest contribution to the manufacturing decrease, followed by food products, beverages and tobacco. Here\u2019s Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, on the 1% drop in house prices last month. \u201cHouse prices have flattened over the past three months. Overall, prices in the three months to June were marginally lower than in the preceding three months. The annual rate of growth has fallen, to 2.6%; the lowest rate since May 2013. \u201cAlthough employment levels continue to rise, household finances face increasing pressure as consumer prices grow faster than wages. This, combined the new stamp duty on buy to let and second homes in 2016, appears to have weakened housing demand in recent months. \u201cA continued low mortgage rate environment, combined with an ongoing acute shortage of properties for sale should help continue to underpin house prices over the coming months.\u201d Factories in the eurozone\u2019s Big Two economies powered on in May, new figure show. German industrial output jumped by 1.2% month-on-month. That\u2019s the fifth monthly rise in a row, marking the best run since 2010. France did even better, expanding their output by 1.9% after a 0.6% decline in April. In classical market theory, bonds and shares are supposed to move in opposite directions. The idea is that investors pour money into equities when they\u2019re feeling optimistic, or dump their shares and scurry into fixed-income (bonds) in times of anxiety. It doesn\u2019t always hold true - especially in a world where central bankers have driven bond prices to record highs. But it\u2019s a decent yardstick. So, we now have bonds and stock both falling as the markets anticipate higher interest rates. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets fears that this could mean a correction is on the way.... Newsflash: UK house prices fell by 1% in June, according to the Halifax\u2019s monthly survey. That\u2019s rather weaker than the 0.2% rise which the City expected, and could be another sign that higher inflation and falling real wages are hitting the economy. Over the last three months, prices rose by 2.6% year-on-year -- the weakest rate in more than four years. However, Nationwide\u2019s figures have shown that house prices rose in June, so this monthly data needs to be treated a little cautiously. Bonds are also suffering from the prospect that central bankers might have finally tired of topping up the punchbowl of monetary policy. The interest rate on German 10-year bunds is hovering at an 18-month high this morning, while Italian bond yields are at a two-month high. It shows how nervous investors are about the prospect of an end to monetary stimulus, after seeing umpteen billions of new pounds, dollars and euros pumped into the system over many years. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale puts it: At the risk of a circular argument, if the ECB signalling a teeney-weeny shift in the direction of travel for monetary policy prompts a big reaction, that does pose the question of how, when or if central bankers can actually escape the gravitational pull downwards from the ZIRP/QE world. That\u2019s a question we asked a lot when we entered this mad world. Is the right image one of a man caught in quicksand, or one of a rocket floating aimlessly in space? European stock markets have dipped in early trading. David Madden of CMC Markets says traders are pondering whether the European Central Bank might tighten monetary policy, as they wait for the US jobs report. The very aggressive easing policy [by the ECB] certainly assisted the economic health of the region, but it also pushed up equity markets. Now central bankers are thinking about moving away from an easing bias, it prompted traders to cash in their positions..... The non-farm payroll report at 1.30pm will be the highlight of the trading session, and the consensus is for a 179,000 jobs to have been added in June. The unemployment rate is tipped to remain at 4.3%, and average earnings is anticipated to rise from 0.2% to 0.3% on a month on month basis. You can keep tabs on all the G20 action here: Shares have fallen across Asia today, as traders hunkered down ahead of the US jobs report. In Japan, the Nikkei hit a three-week low \u2013 but then recovered some ground after the Bank Of Japan boosted its government bondbuying programme. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index shed almost 1%, and there were losses in Hong Kong, South Korea and China too. Despite the BoJ\u2019s move, the big concern in the markets right now is that central banks are moving towards unwinding their stimulus programme. Yesterday, minutes from the European Central Bank showed that policymakers had discussed dropping its pledge to boost its own bond-buying efforts, if needed. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Investors are digesting hawkish ECB minutes and prepping for further withdrawal of global easy money policy; tapering of ECB QE, unwind of Fed\u2019s balance sheet. Maybe even a UK rate hike. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors are edgy today as they brace for a splurge of economic data from both sides of the Atlantic. Bonds and equities are both under some pressure. It\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll day in the US, when we learn how many Americans joined the labour market last month. The consensus forecast is that the NFP rose by around 179,000 in June, which would show that the economy continues to create jobs at a healthy rate. Average earnings are expected to have picked up last month, pushing the annual rate to 2.6% from 2.5%, while the jobless rate could remain at just 4.3% A weak report might fuel worries that the US economy is slowing; conversely, a really strong report would create more pressure to keep raising interest rates. So there could be some drama when the figures hit the wires at 1.30pm BST. In the UK, we find out how the industrial sector fared in May, and how Britain traded with the rest of the world. Economists predict that UK industrial output rose by 0.5% during the month, up from 0.2% They also expect that Britain ran a trade deficit of around \u00a32.5bn with the rest of the world, despite the supposed benefits of a weaker pound. City investors will also be watching developments in Hamberg as the G20 leaders meeting gets underway. The key event of the day could be Donald Trump\u2019s first meeting with Vladimir Putin. Protectionism and climate change are high on the agenda, after Hamburg police broke up protests last night. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: Though unlikely to move markets, the G20 meeting is expected to have a major focus on trade after the removal of standard language about resisting trade protectionism at the previous finance ministers meeting in March. Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.30am: Halifax UK house price survey for June 9.30am: UK industrial production for May 9.30am: UK trade balance for May 1.30pm: US non-farm payroll for June",

      "bodyText": "France has stepped up its seduction of banks and other financial institutions considering a move out of London due to Brexit, as the government unveiled a raft of proposals aimed at making Paris more appealing. A document presented by the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, on Friday listed reforms he said could turn Paris into \u201cEurope\u2019s leading financial centre after Brexit\u201d amid fierce competition from Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. The proposals including the abolition of the highest bracket of a payroll tax levied on each salaried employee and the cancellation of plans to increase France\u2019s 0.3% tax on financial transactions. Bankers\u2019 bonuses will no longer be considered when labour courts decide on unfair dismissal compensation under the proposals, easing the cost of labour disputes for French financial institutions. The document also pledged to change the way EU financial regulations are absorbed into French law to make sure red tape is not more burdensome than in other countries. Paris is competing against rival financial centres such as Frankfurt and Dublin for jobs that move out of London due to the fallout from Brexit. One of its largest obstacles is the ease of doing business in English for international staff, a hurdle that the programme of reforms laid out on Friday will also address. Philippe announced that the government has begun work on establishing an international tribunal in Paris that can handle cases in English, the lingua franca of the financial world. There will also be three new international schools in the Paris area by 2022, in a move apparently aimed at banking staff concerned at moving their families to France. The package of measures chime with promises by France\u2019s new centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, to loosen the country\u2019s labour laws and do away with red tape and high taxation. The early days of the former investment banker\u2019s tenure have set a markedly different tone to his predecessor Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who once referred to the financial sector as the \u201cenemy\u201d. Paris already has its eye on tens of thousands of bankers who could move away from London, if the UK\u2019s divorce from the EU proves to be the catalyst for an exodus. Among the factors that could affect this is the potential loss of Britain\u2019s \u201cpassporting rights\u201d allowing international financial firms access to markets in the EU. But Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, cast doubt on how much business rival financial centres could poach from the capital. She said: \u201cLondon is the world\u2019s leading financial centre thanks to the breadth and depth of the banking and other institutions clustered here, its competitive tax rates, stringent regulatory regimes and close proximity to other major financial centres. \u201cIts growth has helped the rest of Europe prosper. It\u2019s understandable that European competitors will try to lure firms into moving jobs away from London. \u201cHowever, we are confident that plans to lower corporation tax to 17% by 2020, a commitment to boost national infrastructure and developing trading relationships with new international partners in the coming years will ensure that London remains a world-leading financial hub.\u201d The European Central Bank said last month that banks should speed up Brexit preparations, while the Bank of England wants to hear financial firms\u2019 contingency plans by 14 July. In the meantime, the UK is seeking a deal that would allow firms based in Britain to operate freely in the EU after Brexit, scheduled to take effect in March 2019.",

The average cost of a home fell by 1% over the month to \u00a3218,390 according to Halifax, one of the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders. It was the first drop reported by Halifax in five months and surprised economists who had forecast a 0.2% increase. Annual house price inflation fell from 3.3% in May to 2.6% in June, the weakest since May 2013. Martin Ellis, a housing economist at Halifax, said house prices had flattened as consumers took a more cautious view. \u201cAlthough employment levels continue to rise, household finances face increasing pressure as consumer prices grow faster than wages,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, combined with the new stamp duty on buy to let and second homes in 2016, appears to have weakened housing demand in recent months.\u201d However, the rival lender Nationwide last week said its data suggested UK house prices rose in June, by 1.1%, but it reported a sharp slowdown in London. Economists believe that a combination of low mortgage rates and a shortage of properties coming on to the market will prop up the housing market in the coming months, preventing a drop in prices in 2017 overall. Estate agents reported a fall in new instructions for the 15th consecutive month in May, according to the latest data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Hansen Lu, a property economist at Capital Economics, said house prices were likely to rise by about 2% this year. \u201cIt seems unlikely that the recent softness in prices is the start of a major decline. Yet it is also hard to see the market gaining much momentum,\u201d said Lu. \u201cAfter all, while house prices have come down a little, they are still close to a record high.

      "bodyText": "A drop in manufacturing output, a slowdown for the construction industry and a widening in Britain\u2019s trade deficit have doused expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates over the coming months. The pound dropped sharply against the dollar and euro on Friday after the latest signs that the economic resilience seen after last summer\u2019s Brexit vote has waned. A trio of weaker-than-expected reports from the Office for National Statistics left traders scrambling to scale back earlier bets that policymakers could raise interest rates by the end of 2017 and perhaps as soon as next month. \u201cThe data releases of the past week will help to dissuade the UK\u2019s monetary policy committee from a near-term rate hike,\u201d said Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec. \u201cLooking ahead, the household cash squeeze is set to remain a continued drag. And with the UK\u2019s more export focused manufacturing sector seemingly losing momentum, we see continued signs of a UK economy that is struggling to gain any serious pace.\u201d The Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting committee has been divided over when to lift borrowing costs from their record low of 0.25% to keep inflation in check. Much of the debate has centred around whether stronger exports and business investment can offset a slowdown in consumer spending as households grapple with higher living costs. The latest figures showed exports did pick up between April and May but by less than imports. That meant the trade deficit widened more than expected, tempering hopes that the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the Brexit vote would drive a revival in exports because it made UK goods cheaper in overseas markets. Export volumes rose 2.5% in May while imports rose an even bigger 4.8%. That pushed the deficit on trade in goods to \u00a311.86bn in May from \u00a310.6bn in April. The deficit including trade-in services, which covers activities such as banking and legal services, widened by \u00a31bn to \u00a33.1bn, reflecting an increase in imports. \u201cNet trade still is not compensating fully for the damage to households\u2019 spending power wrought by sterling\u2019s depreciation,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThe main problem remains that exporters have hiked their prices, blunting the boost to competitiveness from the weak pound.\u201d The figures on manufacturing and the wider industrial sector, which includes utilities and mining, were all below economists\u2019 forecasts. Output fell on a monthly basis and also on the less volatile measure of three-months on three-months. For May alone, a drop in car production helped knock overall manufacturing output down by 0.2% from April, confounding forecasts for a 0.5% rise. The construction sector also suffered a slowdown in May, with output down 1.2% on the month, defying forecasts for a 0.7% pick-up. The figures follow news that the economy slowed markedly in the opening months of 2017. Business surveys since then have suggested that activity continues to rise but at a more muted pace as companies grapple with higher costs, weaker consumer spending and skills shortages. Friday\u2019s figures painted \u201ca rather bleak picture for the UK economy and underline the challenges lying ahead,\u201d said Kay Daniel Neufeld, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy. Based on the latest data, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated the economy grew 0.3% in the second quarter, barely faster than the 0.2% expansion in the first quarter and well below the long-run trend of 0.6%. But Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics said she was expecting growth to accelerate to 0.4% in the second quarter. She saw some encouraging signs in the trade figures with the three-month growth rate of goods export volumes in May outpacing growth in imports.\u201cMeanwhile, the production and construction sectors only account for around 20% of the economy, and the hard data available for the services sector so far suggests that growth has rebounded strongly after a poor start to the year,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union is prepared to impose countermeasures within days if Donald Trump takes action to protect the US steel industry, the European commission president has said. In one of the most serious warnings of a tit-for-tat response if the US resorts to protectionist measures, Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU was \u201cin elevated battle mood\u201d. Targets could include American whiskey exports. Speaking at the start of the G20 summit in Hamburg, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you in detail what we\u2019re doing. But what I would like to tell you is that within a few days \u2013 we won\u2019t need two months for that \u2013 we could react with countermeasures. \u201cI am telling you this in the hope that all of this won\u2019t be necessary. But we are in an elevated battle mood.\u201d Buoyed by its free trade deal signed with Japan this week, the EU is determined to defend the multilateral trade system, with officials warning the US not to take any measures against either Germany or China\u2019s steel industries. The EU, it is understood, is likely to retaliate by focusing on US agricultural products. Officials confirmed one target might be bourbon whiskey, one of the main exports of the state of Kentucky, the home of Mitch McConnell, the US Senate majority leader. The EU is hoping to divide the Republicans by warning that Republican protection for the rust best will lead to EU retaliation in the American farm belt. The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has said she is \u201cextremely worried\u201d about a US threat to curb steel imports for national security reasons, saying the step could trigger protectionist reactions around the world. Trump launched an inquiry into steel imports in April that is likely to report in the coming days. US trade law allows the president to unilaterally \u201cadjust\u201d imports should the Department of Commerce find evidence of a national security threat from foreign shipments. Trump has pulled out of a new transpacific commercial accord, frozen talks on a deal with the 28-nation EU and questioned the terms of a longstanding pact with Canada and Mexico. Malmstr\u00f6m has warned that any unilateral US action would lead to a reference to the World Trade Organization. The large global steel surplus has mainly been caused by China, even as Chinese steel exports to the US have been declining. Total US steel imports last year amounted to 26m tonnes, of which 3.2m were shipped from the EU by companies such as Thyssenkrupp AG, Salzgitter and Celsa Group. The EU shipments were worth \u20ac2.8bn ($3.1bn), according to the European Steel Association. EU officials insisted they were happy to examine allegations of Chinese steel dumping, but could not endorse any unilateral measures, even if only trained on China. \u201cEven if we are not the target, we will be collateral damage in this process, which is going to hit Europe very hard,\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m said. Other countries likely to be affected include South Korea and Japan. The dispute adds edge to the dispute under way between diplomats over the wording of the G20 communique on trade. The G20, normally an advocate of free trade, is likely to avoid a wording clash by referring to free and fair trade. The communique of the recent G7 in Sicily referred to support for fighting protectionism and a rules-based international order. Trump declared the opening of the steel investigation \u201ca historic day for American steel and most importantly for American steel workers\u201d, suggesting he would like it to back protectionist measures. Only two US presidents \u2013 Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford \u2013 have granted relief under section 232 of the 1962 trade law, citing national security concerns stemming from the global oil crisis of the 1970s. The European council president, Donald Tusk, also revealed some members of the G20 were opposing words in the draft communique supporting sanctions, and asset freezes being imposed on Libyan smugglers of refugees. Neither Tusk nor his officials would identify the country mounting the resistance, but he described the culprit\u2019s actions as cynical.",
