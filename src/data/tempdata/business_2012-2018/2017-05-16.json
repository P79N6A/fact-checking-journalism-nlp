      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, could be pursued for millions of pounds owed to Philip Green\u2019s business empire as well as to creditors of the now collapsed department store. Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions (RAL), which bought BHS for \u00a31 in 2015, has been accused of extracting an estimated \u00a317m from the retailer despite owning it for just 13 months before it went into administration in 2016. RAL was put into liquidation earlier this month after a high court ruling on the group\u2019s financial state, details of which were published on Tuesday. The ruling paves the way for liquidators to sift through RAL\u2019s paperwork seeking clarity on where funds taken from BHS were moved to and attempting to recover them. As the main director of RAL, Chappell could be personally liable for money owed by the company. Lance Ashworth QC, a barrister specialising in insolvency, said liquidators would now be closely examining RAL\u2019s accounts to establish if all the payments and agreements made by the company were legitimate. \u201cIf a payment has been made to somebody it shouldn\u2019t have been paid out to in breach of the directors\u2019 fiduciary duty, then the directors will be liable to make a contribution to the company\u2019s assets,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cThey will also seek to establish if the company had been trading while insolvent. That could lead to a charge of wrongful trading. The liquidators will look at the company\u2019s financial position at the outset and at the end of the day and could ask for a contribution for the difference between them.\u201d The registrar who judged the case dismissed Chappell\u2019s claim that RAL had about \u00a310m of assets and so was still a viable business. Chappell claimed that Green owed RAL at least \u00a35.5m related to the sale of BHS\u2019s headquarters Marylebone House. However, the registrar ascribed a nominal value of just \u00a31 to RAL for this asset. Chappell presented documents suggesting he was planning legal action to recoup up to \u00a38.5m from Green on the basis of a handwritten note dating from March 2015 when the retail tycoon sold BHS to RAL for \u00a31. However, the registrar found that a \u00a33.5m loan to RAL from Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, which includes Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, remained valid. Payment of that debt will depend on the amount of assets liquidators can recoup from RAL to pay back all the group\u2019s creditors. The ruling also confirms that BHS made a loan of \u00a36.2m to RAL on the day before it sent out proposals for an insolvency agreement known as a \u201ccompany voluntary arrangement\u201d in which it asked landlords to accept lower rents. The judgment also refers to a \u00a32.8m payment from BHS to RAL which went straight to its directors including Chappell. The documents outline how RAL then charged BHS quarterly management fees, which exactly matched the amounts owed in repayments on the \u00a36.2m loan from the retailer to its owner. Once BHS went into administration and these management fee payments dried up, RAL was unable to meet its loan repayments and the balance of the loan, \u00a35.98m, then fell due. The documents also reveal that Chappell tried to turn a \u00a31.5m loan from RAL secured against his parents\u2019 home into an asset. Chappell said the loan had been swapped for a 43% stake in a Portuguese development company called Chaplake held by his father. Chappell said this asset was worth \u00a35.08m. The judge said Chappell had provided no evidence to support that claim and the asset was more likely to be worth \u00a31.5m. Chappell had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds reaches landmark as government sells final shares", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has sold its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group in a landmark moment for the banking sector almost a decade after the \u00a320.3bn bailout of the high street lender. It will be confirmed on Wednesday that the Treasury has finally extricated itself from its shareholding in the bank \u2013 owner of Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows \u2013which it rescued during at the depths of the financial crisis. At its peak, the government owned 43% of Lloyds but through a series of share sales this has now fallen to zero. This is in stark contrast to Royal Bank of Scotland, which was rescued at the same time and in which taxpayers still own a stake of more than 70%. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has already said the government has recouped all of the \u00a320.3bn used to buy shares in Lloyds, which rescued HBOS at the depths of the financial crisis. While Hammond\u2019s figures do not include the \u00a33.6bn cost of borrowing the bailout funds, the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, told last week\u2019s annual general meeting that the government would make at least \u00a3500m from its investment in Lloyds. The chief executive will now face questions about whether he intends to stay on at the bank, which he joined in 2011 and immediately started to tackle the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal which has cost Lloyds more than \u00a317bn. He has received about \u00a340m through salary, pensions, benefits and share bonuses since taking the helm and the removal of the taxpayer stake means he will have met the conditions attached to some of those bonuses, which will be released next year. The turnaround of the bank has in part been fuelled by Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s cost-cutting programme, which has taken a toll on jobs. Some 57,000 job cuts have been announced since 2008, although some of these were the result of merging Lloyds and HBOS before he arrived. Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said \u201csignificant progress has been made over the past eight years\u201d since the bailout. Then, he said, the bank had an \u201cunsustainable\u201d loan to deposit ratio of 177% \u2013 which made it reliant on borrowing on the markets to fund its growth. This has now fallen to 107% \u2013 almost a balance between its savers and depositors and requiring less funding on the financial markets. Nearly \u00a3200bn of problem loans and businesses have been sold off and the bank has given up its international ambitions. Once operating in 30 countries, it now remains in just six \u2013 leaving it open to concern that it is vulnerable to any economic slowdown in the UK caused by Brexit. Lloyds has a 25% share of UK current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages, and as a result of the takeover of credit card company MBNA it will have a 26% share of credit card lending. However, Gordon said the bank\u2019s outlook was \u201cset fair\u201d and that it could produce stable earnings in the future. Neil Woodford, one of the City\u2019s most respected fund managers, admitted last week he had bought shares in Lloyds after shunning the banking sector for many years. In 2014 he sold his holding in HSBC because of concern about the fines it faced. Lloyds shares closed on Tuesday at 70p \u2013 below the 73.6p average price that taxpayers paid them in three stages during the crisis \u2013 and, Gordon pointed out, similar to the 69p level they were trading at when Horta-Os\u00f3rio was appointed to the role. While the last chunk of shares have been sold at a loss, below that breakeven price, the bulk were sold at a profit. The fall in the share price meant that the government\u2019s intention to sell the last shares in a discounted share offering to the public had to be abandoned. Lloyds is also battling with the legal issues. As well as the ongoing PPI scandal, it is currently facing criticism of its handling of compensation to the victims of the fraud in the HBOS Reading branch. Among those complaining is the TV celebrity Noel Edmonds. Timeline September 2008 A \u00a312bn takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB comes just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shockwaves through financial markets. The Financial Services Authority, then the City regulator, says the deal will \u201cenhance finance stability\u201d. October 2008 As financial instability mounts the government announces a bailout of the banking system. Lloyds TSB renegotiates the takeover of HBOS to 0.605 Lloyds TSB shares for every one HBOS share, from 0.833 a month earlier. January 2009 Lloyds Banking Group is created from the purchase of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. The government begins the first of a three-tranche bailout of the group, pumping in \u00a313bn. May 2009 Sir Victor Blank is forced to step down as chairman of Lloyds. June 2009 The government puts in a further \u00a31.5bn. December 2009 The government backs cash call, buying \u00a35.8bn of shares. Total rescue deal amounts to \u00a320.3bn. Taxpayer stake stands at 43%. March 2011 Eric Daniels leaves and Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio takes over as chief executive. May 2011 Lloyds takes first provision for payment protection insurance of \u00a33.2bn. The bank\u2019s bill eventually tops \u00a317bn. November 2011 Horta-Os\u00f3rio takes leave, citing fatigue. He returns to work in January. September 2013 The taxpayer stake gradually reduces from 43% to 39% for technical results. It is cut to 33% when a formal sell-off of Lloyds shares begins:\u00a32.3bn of shares sold to big City investors at 75p a share. March 2014 \u00a34.2bn of shares sold at 75.5p, taking the taxpayer holding to 24%. February 2015 Dividends to resume for first time since the bailout. December 2014 George Osborne announces a plan to dribble out shares into the market. October 2015 Osborne unveils plans for a cut-price sale to the public. October 2016 Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, abandons his predecessor\u2019s pledge to sell cut-price shares to the public.",

Recent trophy boardroom appointments and a new marketing campaign have contrasted with imminent store closures, and whisperings of further disappointing sales figures on the horizon as the brand continues to shift its focus from clothes to food. But fashion came out fighting on Tuesday at the press preview for next season\u2019s womenswear range, as Marks and Spencer revealed a chic lineup of grown-up high street dressing at a glossy Mayfair venue. Director of womenswear, Jo Jenkins, said at the launch: \u201cClearly we\u2019ve got a brilliant food business, and yes, we are adapting our space portfolio to reflect how our customers are shopping. But fashion is still growing too, and online is very strong for us\u201d. Key pieces for autumn include an immaculately styled cashmere-and-wool blend city coat, available in eight colours, for \u00a3119, and a tiered velvet midi-length day dress for \u00a359. The range is up to speed with catwalk trends: an asymmetric cable knit sweater for \u00a335 has more than a touch of a Burberry piece currently on sale for \u00a3550; a romantic full skirt in navy with star embroidery in silver thread for \u00a345 is as near to Christian Dior\u2019s new catwalk collection as most of us are likely to get; and the cult sock boots by Vetements, a sell-out despite their \u00a31060 price tag, have inspired a rather more affordable nude-pink satin version. But the promise of desirable merchandise in four months is not enough to satisfy today\u2019s impatient shopper. So an an edit of five dresses, each priced \u00a345, go on sale on Wednesday. (The online search term \u2018dress\u2019 peaks during May.) Three of these \u2013 in blue, black, and floral \u2013 are variations on the current bestselling pink dress, featuring a keyhole opening tied at the nape and fluted sleeves. Jenkins believes the flute-sleeve dress is a winning formula because the customer \u201cloves a dress with sleeves, and a piece that works on its own or with layers\u201d. There are cheaper versions of this dress on neighbouring high street stores, but superior fabric quality gives the M&amp;S piece an advantage in a silhouette where the drape of fabric is key. Statement sleeves are a recurring theme in the autumn collections \u201cbecause they are such an easy way to give a wardrobe a feminine twist\u201d, said Jenkins. (However, the ever-practical M&amp;S team have updated some of what they call the \u201ccan\u2019t-eat-my-soup sleeve\u201d seen in many of this spring\u2019s stores into more modestly scaled flared cuffs.) M&amp;S clothes must tread a delicate line to avoid being labelled as either too frumpy or too gimmicky. The current vogue for covered-up, modest dressing plays in the brand\u2019s favour: a kingfisher-blue silk blouse with scarf-tie detailing (\u00a329.50) styled for evening with a below-the-knee, blue-and-black sequin skirt (\u00a335), is ageless but contemporary. The traditional strength of the brand\u2019s lingerie ranges shows no sign of fading, with market share on the increase. Soozie Jenkinson, head of lingerie, points to keeping up with the trend for soft and sporty bras \u2013 fuelled by the impact of the athleisure aesthetic \u2013 as key to this success. \u201cWe make our bras up to a size 46K, so we have to work hard at interpreting trends in a way that will work for all our customers,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "In a volatile day\u2019s trading, the UK stock market has outpaced its peers, with the FTSE 100 closing above 7,500 for the first time. Investors have been buoyed by hopes of further infrastructure spending in China, which has boosted commodity company shares, a strengthening oil price on the back of suggestions an output cut would be extended and a dip in the pound against the euro after higher than expected inflation figures. But after hitting new highs earlier in the week, Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped back, with a mixed performance from other European markets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished at a new closing high of 7522.03, up 67.66 points or 0.91% Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.02% to 12,804.53 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.21% lower at 5406.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.38% to 21,787.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.22% at 10,982.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.83% to 788.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 11 points or 0.05%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. And here\u2019s our updated Lloyds Banking Group story with the latest developments: The UK government has reportedly sold off the final part of its stake in Lloyds Banking Group, the legacy of the bank\u2019s bailout following the financial crisis. Here\u2019s our story from the weekend: On the FTSE 100 reaching 7,500, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: An improving global economy, a weaker pound and higher commodity prices are behind the surge in share prices. It\u2019s quite amazing to think the footsie has gained 2000 points in the last fifteen months against a background of weak investor confidence. In the short term the market can of course move in either direction but investors will be thinking that the 8,000 mark is hovering into view. After hitting yet new highs earlier, the S&amp;P 500 has edged lower although the Nasdaq Composite is managing to just about keep in positive territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is around 200 points shy of its peak, has also slipped back. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: While the FTSE 100 has continued to clock up record highs this afternoon, the same cannot be said of the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones. Both indices seem stuck in limbo, unable to move higher. Perhaps some of this is down to nervousness following the latest Trump news, as the president takes to Twitter to defend something that his aides last night said he didn\u2019t do (are we all keeping up?). But aside from that, US markets are bereft of reasons to move. Still, the old adage \u2018never short a quiet market\u2019 applies here; while Wall Street isn\u2019t going up, it isn\u2019t going down yet either, and if the past few months have taught us nothing else it is that a grind higher is more likely than a big correction. It took17 years for the FTSE 100 to go from 6000 to 7000 - from April 1998 to March 2015 - although it came close on the last day of 1999 before the dotcom bubble burst. But it has taken just over two years for the leading index to climb from 7000 to 7500, showing how the pace has accelerated in recent times with the 8000 barrier now in the sights of investors. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The UK stock market reached a new milestone today when the FTSE 100 hit 7500 for the first time. Investors seem to be feeling confident about the outlook for Britain under what is expected to be the biggest Conservative party majority since Margaret Thatcher... Data from the ONS showed price inflation in the UK at its strongest since 2013. Rising inflation tends to make stocks relatively more attractive to bonds, which could make the next big hurdle for the FTSE of 8000 more achievable. The pound may be holding up against a weak dollar but it has fallen back against the euro following the morning\u2019s inflation figure, currently down 0.86% at \u20ac1.1647. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said that was one reason for the FTSE 100\u2019s current surge: The FTSE left its international peers in the dust this Tuesday, the UK index rocketing more than 1% higher to hit a record peak of 7530. The continued recovery of its key commodity stocks \u2013 the likes of BP, Rio Tinto and Anglo American all rose between 1.5% and 3% \u2013 was joined by the pleasing sight of a sterling slide, the currency dropping 0.8% against a souped-up euro. In months previous the kind of inflation figure produced this morning \u2013 the CPI reading hitting its highest level since autumn 2013 \u2013 would have caused a bit of a headache for the UK index. However, the Bank of England appears reluctant to combat rising prices with a rate hike; combine that with the alarming squeeze on real wages and the pound has little reason for cheer, something that only works in the FTSE\u2019s favour. A weaker sterling boosts business at the exporters and overseas earners which dominate the FTSE 100, and although the relationship between sterling and the leading index has been rocky recently, it seems to be in place today. Back with the higher than expected UK inflation figures, and economists at Barclays believe this will not necessarily put any more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates: (QIR is the Quarterly Inflation Report issued last week) And here\u2019s the US stocks at new peaks: With global markets hitting new peaks, here\u2019s our story looking at five reasons for the rise: DING DING goes the opening bell on Wall Street, opening a new trading day in New York. And shares are rallying, sending the S&amp;P 500 and the technology-focused Nasdaq to fresh record highs. In better news, US factory output jumped by 1% in April \u2013 the fastest rate in three years. Ouch! The US dollar has just hit a new six-month low, after new disappointing economic data from America. The number of new house-building projects (or housing starts) fell by 2.6% in April, the Commerce Department reports, following a 6.6% slide in March. That send the dollar down against a basket of currencies, and the euro up to a six-month high of $1.1085. A weak US housing market may well mean less pressure to raise America\u2019s interest rates.... Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, suggests that the Footsie could now make a run at 8,000 points. She says: Considering it took five months for the FTSE 100 to jump 500 points, if momentum is maintained over the summer months then we could see 8,000 in this index by October. She agrees that there are several reasons to be cautions \u2013 from global cyber-attacks, and North Korea missile to the political tensions in America. But there are two reasons why shares can push higher, she argues. First, the political developments in Europe, where the threat of populism has receded in recent weeks: Looking at politics first, the markets reacted with glee to the election of Donald Trump last November, European indices are now doing the same with Emmanuel Macron in France. His victory in last week\u2019s election solidifies the euro and eradicates the threat to the West\u2019s organisational structure from nationalist parties who wanted to break up the Eurozone. This is a powerful tonic for markets, especially when Europe\u2019s economy is starting to pick up and the ECB is toying with the idea of tapering at some stage later this year. Markets may continue to bask in Macron\u2019s victory, but it could be cut short in mid-June when we get the National Assembly elections. If Macron\u2019s newly formed En Marche! Party cannot get enough members into parliament to push through Macron\u2019s radical agenda, then the Macron rally could lose some of its lustre. However, the next month could be strong for European equities, as political risk recedes. Secondly, central banks are still driving the markets: Central banks are also driving the markets, with the Fed expected to raise interest rates next month, and the ECB continuing with its enormous stimulus package. The soft patch of economic data for the US in Q1 this year means that the Fed could put the brakes on its rate hiking efforts for a few months after the expected June hike. A little bit of tightening isn\u2019t going to hurt this stock market rally, but too much of it will, thus, a hike from the Fed in June and then a pause would probably be the best outcome for global stock markets. In contrast, a strengthening European economy is giving rise to expectations that the ECB will have to announce some form of taper perhaps as early as this summer. But that is good for stocks also, as it would suggest a confidence in the Eurozone economy that would also be welcomed by investors. Thus, this rally may still have further to go. Although UK inflation is rising sharply, UK house prices are cooling as the London property boom falters. The average British house price rose by 4.1% in the 12 months to March, the weakest growth since October 2013. Prices rose fastest in the East of England and the East Midlands, at 6.7% per year, followed by the West Midlands at 6.5%. Prices shrank by 0.4% in the North East, while in the capital they only rose by 1.5%. London house prices are still more than twice the national average, though, at \u00a3472,000, followed by the South East at \u00a3312,000 and the East of England at \u00a3277,000. Houses in the North East are cheapest, on average, at \u00a3122,000. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, suspects that the jump in inflation is weighing on the housing market. Higher inflation is contributing to buyers\u2019 nervousness about prospects for the property market and making them more determined to achieve the best possible deals. There are concerns about affordability and possibly jobs being compromised mainly because changes in exchange rates are pushing prices up and making goods more expensive. It underlines once again the importance of realism from buyers and vendors, particularly the latter, if they want to transact. \u2019The house-price figures are a little concerning bearing in mind 12 months ago how active the market was as buyers struggled to beat the stamp duty surcharge deadline. But they are not really surprising when you appreciate how the market has changed in that time and a new sense of balance between supply and demand is prevailing which has contributed to where we are now - a more subdued market with fewer transactions, softening prices and more realistic buyers and sellers.\u2019 This chart from Danske Bank shows neatly how inflation (the blue line) is now rising faster than earnings (the red line): That means real wages are falling -- as people\u2019s pay packets can\u2019t keep up. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (which campaigns against poverty) explains how poorest households are suffering from rising prices: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show the cost of living is creeping ever higher for families, including the cost of essentials such as food, clothing and electricity bills, at a time when wages are stagnant and working-age benefits are frozen. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s earnings figures are expected to show that pay fell at the start of 2017, while inflation is set to continue increasing over the year. We know people in the poorest households spend roughly \u00a31 in every 6 on food and \u00a31 in \u00a313 on energy bills, meaning they feel the squeeze more when costs go up. Boom! The FTSE 100 index of the biggest companies listed in London has just hit another record high. The FTSE has rattled through the 7,500 point mark for the first time ever, up almost 50 points today. Mobile network giant Vodafone continues to be the best-performing company today, after reporting financial results at 7am. CMC Markets\u2019 analyst Michael Hewson says: Vodafone are in demand this morning despite reregistering a \u20ac6.1bn annual loss. The telecoms company wrote-off a large loss in its Indian operation but traders focused on the increased dividend and rosy outlook for next year. After an early spike, the pound has fallen back to $1.288 as the City digests today\u2019s inflation figures. Traders may be concluding that the Bank of England is likely to \u2018look through\u2019 (ie, ignore) rising inflation, on the grounds that raising rates now would cause more harm than good. Michael Baxter, economics commentator for the Share Centre, says: \u201cAlthough one member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy (MPC), Kristin Forbes, voted for a hike in interest rates in the last meeting, the minutes made it clear that other members will only join Ms Forbes in voting for a rise, if inflation starts surprising on the upside. So far, this has not happened. \u201cThere is nothing in today\u2019s data to suggest that the MPC will deviate from its current course. The odds of an increase in UK interest rates later this year are diminishing.\u201d Fund manager Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management fears that rising oil prices will drive inflation up this year \u2013 as Opec producers are poised to extend their current production cuts. He argues that small investors should be looking to buy shares, rather than invest in bonds: \u201cThe news that UK inflation rose to 2.7 per cent in April - tracking well above the Bank of England\u2019s two per cent target for the next few years - undermines the appeal of gilts and bonds. With yields below the rate of inflation, capital is effectively being eroded. These are ideal conditions for a potential return of the cult of equity, which although riskier, looks favourable in current market conditions. The rate of inflation could be forced even higher by the price of oil, as this may nudge upwards due to OPEC action this month \u2013 resulting in an even more compelling argument for equities.\u201d Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, warn that inflation is likely to keep climbing this year, hitting the UK public in the pocket. \u201cInflation has risen to its highest level since the autumn of 2013, and this is adding to the squeeze on consumer spending shown in the latest retail sales figures. We should expect this rise in inflation to continue as the impact of the weakness if the pound feeds through into higher prices for imported goods and services. \u201cInflation is set to rise to around 3pc or higher in the months ahead - with prices likely to be rising faster than wages. The resulting squeeze on consumer spending will reinforce the slowdown in economic growth we are now seeing. Last week, the Bank of England warned that real wages would fall this year as rising prices erode households incomes. Today\u2019s inflation figures show that they were right. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, blames the slump in the pound on the EU referendum result: \u201cWe\u2019re now starting to feel the real impact of Brexit on our wallets. There\u2019s no escaping the fact that the luxury of low inflation is well and truly over with prices of goods and services rising left right and centre and the shiny new pounds in our pockets will unfortunately buy you less. \u201cYour household budget will be stretched as the cost of fuel, energy and anything that\u2019s made overseas is creeping up. The cost of your supermarket shop is rising too so you must act now to protect yourself from future struggles.\u201d So what can people do to protect themselves? Maundrell has four suggestions: check you\u2019re on a fixed rate energy tariff (one that guarantees the price you pay per unit) and if not switch make sure your savings are earning an interest rate that\u2019s higher than the rate of inflation \u2013 otherwise they\u2019ll lose buying power over time shop around for food and fuel so you\u2019re not paying any more than you need to check whether you could cut your mortgage repayments by switching to a fixed rate deal if you\u2019re on your lender\u2019s SVR TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is urging politicians to heed the living standard squeeze and come up with policies to boost job creation and pay. She says: \u201cThe last thing Britain needs is another real wage slump. But rising prices are hammering pay packets. \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash. That\u2019s why living standards must be a key battleground at this election. \u201cAll the parties need to explain how they\u2019ll create better paid jobs, especially in the parts of the UK that need them most. \u201cAnd there needs to be a recognition across the political spectrum of the damage pay restrictions in the public sector are doing. Nurses shouldn\u2019t have to use food banks to get by.\u201d Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, says workers are suffering as pay rises fail to keep pace with inflation: \u201cAs expected, CPI rose in April to 2.7% , with rising air fares a major contributor thanks to the later date of Easter this year. \u201cThe impact of rising air fares was partially offset by a fall in fuel prices, but at just above the 2% target, this rate of inflation is not high by UK standards. \u201cHowever with wages still sluggish, despite the sharp fall in unemployment, growth in real wages is being squeezed.\u201d Elliott Silk, commercial director at wealth manager Sanlam, points out that rising inflation is bad news for savers and pensioners. \u201cThe rise in inflation for the third month in a row is likely to damage retirees buying power and is set to take out a serious chunk of peoples\u2019 nest eggs. Many don\u2019t appreciate the true cost of inflation. For those who retired before 2010 and took out a fixed annuity, the cost can be staggering. As bills rise across the board, retirees on a fixed income begin to feel the inflation pinch. As we enter this period of increased inflation, one of the ways people can consider avoiding inflation eating away at their hard earned cash is to seek out alternative investment vehicles.\u201d Shilen Shah, bond strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, is concerned that core inflation is rising. Higher electricity and clothing prices were somewhat offset by lower motor fuel prices, however the underlying inflation figure does indicate some inflationary pressures in the economy with the core CPI print increasing to 2.4%. Here\u2019s confirmation that UK real wage packets are now falling, with inflation rising faster than pay rises: This chart shows how inflation is now rising at the fastest rate in almost four years, having jumped to 2.7% in April. Airfares jumped by 11% in April compared to March, while clothing prices jumped by 1% month-on-month. The chart shows how these were the main factors pushing inflation up: The inflationary pressures are broad-based, though \u2013 prices in every category of goods and services were higher in April 2017 than in 2016. Core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like food and energy, has also jumped. Core CPI has leaped to 2.4%, from 1.9% in March, suggesting that underlying inflation pressures are building fast.... Higher air fares drove inflation up in April, says the Office for National Statistics, due to Easter falling later in 2017 Rising prices for clothing, vehicle excise duty and electricity also contributed to the increase in the rate, the ONS adds. Here we go! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 2.7% in April, up from 2.3% in March. That\u2019s higher than the City had expected. It means that means real wages are falling across the economy, as earnings including bonuses only rose by 2.3% in the three months to February. More to follow! The FTSE is cling onto its record levels, as City traders bite their knuckles and wait for the April\u2019s inflation report to flash across their screens at 9.30am precisely... Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted about today\u2019s inflation data, due in just 10 minutes.... Germany\u2019s DAX has shrugged off the impact of the rising euro, and hit a new alltime high. The DAX is up 0.2% at 12,834 points, led by chemicals firms Linde and Bayer, and Deutsche Telekom. Newsflash: Italy\u2019s economy only managed mediocre growth in the first three months of this year. Italian GDP rose by 0.2%, weaker than the UK and France (which both managed 0.3%) and well behind Germany (+0.6%). Over the last year, Italy\u2019s economy has only grown by 0.8%, which isn\u2019t enough to pull down unemployment or erode its huge debt pile. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx warns that this morning\u2019s UK inflation report, due in 35 minutes, could dent the Footsie\u2019s rally. The FTSE is still in the all-time record high ballpark this Tuesday, though it faces a tough test with the morning\u2019s data. The index is still being propped up by its commodity stocks, though at an admittedly reduced pace, with the oil and mining sectors still high on Brent Crude\u2019s recovery and the $900 billion \u2018Silk Road\u2019 infrastructure plan in China. The FTSE won\u2019t have an easily ride this morning, however, as it deals with the latest, likely soaring, piece of inflation data. Analysts are expecting the CPI number to jump from 2.3% to 2.6% month-on-month, a reading that would be the highest in more than 3 and a half years. In theory this would inject a bit of life into the pound \u2013 which is currently up 0.3% against the dollar but down 0.1% against the euro \u2013 and could, potentially, cause the UK index to fall from its current peak. It will be a test of the FTSE\u2019s resilience to see how it copes with this challenge, and may help indicate the longevity of these highs going forwards. Bad news from the Netherlands; its growth rate slowed to just 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, down from 0.6% in October-December. But things look rosier in Eastern Europe; Romania has expanded by 1.7% in Q1, while the Czech Republic grew its GDP by 1.3%. The euro has rallied to its highest level since the US presidential election. The single currency has gained 0.5% this morning to $1.1027, a level last seen in November 2016, as traders anticipate today\u2019s eurozone GDP report at 10am BST. A stronger euro is bad news for Eurozone exporters, so the German DAX and French CAC indices have both dipped in early trading. The FTSE 100 is continuing to scamper into uncharted territory; it\u2019s now reached 7475 points, 20 points higher. Telecoms firms, consumer-focused companies and energy providers are up this morning, with Vodafone, DIY chain Kingfisher and housebuilder Barratt leading the risers. But easyJet is dragging the market back, after reporting that its losses have widened in the last six months. Boom! The FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading. The blue chip index has gained 8 points to 7465, beating the previous record of 7460 set on Monday. Vodafone is the top riser, up 3% after reporting results this morning. Traders are looking beyond its \u20ac6bn loss, and comforted that it sees improving cash flows. Vodafone has also told reporters that it doesn\u2019t plan to move operations out of the UK, saying Brexit doesn\u2019t make a big difference to its operations. Britain\u2019s stock market could hit a new record high this morning, say spreadbetters IG, after closing at an alltime high last night. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit fresh record highs overnight as the long rally refuses to fizzle out. MSCI\u2019s World Index, which tracks equities across the globe, has tickled up to a fresh lifetime high, after Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s DAX and the US S&amp;P 500 all hit new peaks on Monday. Optimism over China\u2019s ambitious \u201cSilk Road\u201d plan is helping to drive the rally. Beijing\u2019s commitment to spend hundreds of billions of dollars for new roads, ports and other infrastructure is likely to drive up commodity prices, which boosted miners\u2019 shares yesterday. Market volatility is also hovering around its lowest level in decades, tempting investors to keep buying. Saudi Arabia and Russia\u2019s pledge to keep oil production curbs in place for another nine months is another key factor. Chris Weston of IG explains: Clearly the big talking point yesterday was the punchy moves in the barrel courtesy of a determined and cohesive stance from the Saudi\u2019s and Russian\u2019s about extending the output cuts for a further nine months. The market is always going to react when we see collusion between these two oil heavyweights, especially when they pull out a famous Mario Draghi line and pledge \u201cto do whatever it takes\u201d to bring down global inventories. Also coming up today At 9.30am the latest UK inflation report is released. Economists predict that the cost of living jumped again in April, as the weak pounds drive up import costs. The consumer prices index is tipped to jump from 2.3% to 2.6%, which would mean real wages are still falling. We also get Italian GDP figures at 9am, and an update on eurozone growth at 10am. That may confirm that the euro area expanded by 0.5% in the first three months of this year. There may be drama in Greece, as workers go on strike in protest at the country\u2019s austerity programme, ahead of a parliamentary vote on further cuts on Thursday. On the corporate front, mobile giant Vodafone, budget airline easyJet and housebuilder Crest Nicholson are among the companies reporting to the City. Vodafone\u2019s figures aren\u2019t too impressive; it has reported a net loss of \u20ac6.1bn loss, partly due to a \u20ac3.7bn writedown on its Indian operations. There\u2019s red ink at easyJet too; it made a half-year loss of \u00a3236m, as the late Easter and the weak pound hit its bottom line. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

His victory in last week\u2019s election solidifies the euro and eradicates the threat to the West\u2019s organisational structure from nationalist parties who wanted to break up the Eurozone. This is a powerful tonic for markets, especially when Europe\u2019s economy is starting to pick up and the ECB is toying with the idea of tapering at some stage later this year. Markets may continue to bask in Macron\u2019s victory, but it could be cut short in mid-June when we get the National Assembly elections. If Macron\u2019s newly formed En Marche! Party cannot get enough members into parliament to push through Macron\u2019s radical agenda, then the Macron rally could lose some of its lustre. However, the next month could be strong for European equities, as political risk recedes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Secondly, central banks are still driving the markets:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Central banks are also driving the markets, with the Fed expected to raise interest rates next month, and the ECB continuing with its enormous stimulus package. The soft patch of economic data for the US in Q1 this year means that the Fed could put the brakes on its rate hiking efforts for a few months after the expected June hike. A little bit of tightening isn\u2019t going to hurt this stock market rally, but too much of it will, thus, a hike from the Fed in June and then a pause would probably be the best outcome for global stock markets. In contrast, a strengthening European economy is giving rise to expectations that the ECB will have to announce some form of taper perhaps as early as this summer. But that is good for stocks also, as it would suggest a confidence in the Eurozone economy that would also be welcomed by investors. Thus, this rally may still have further to go.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591ac869e4b0f5ae171e28d4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-16T12:12:23.337Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">House price inflation slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Although UK inflation is rising sharply, UK house prices are cooling as the London property boom falters.</strong></p> <p>The average British house price rose by 4.1% in the 12 months to March, the weakest growth since October 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2a3cd7bc0dbd696e7e1a6b9f749133e38665983\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2a3cd7bc0dbd696e7e1a6b9f749133e38665983/0_0_849_554/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK house price growth\" width=\"500\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Prices rose fastest in the East of England and the East Midlands, at 6.7% per year, followed by the West Midlands at 6.5%.</p> <p>Prices shrank by 0.4% in the North East, while in the capital they only rose by 1.5%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"588e753d4c657ee84aeaa9e72e9cc4bdd637d820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/588e753d4c657ee84aeaa9e72e9cc4bdd637d820/0_0_844_553/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK house prices by region\" width=\"500\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>London house prices are still more than twice the national average, though, at \u00a3472,000, followed by the South East at \u00a3312,000 and the East of England at \u00a3277,000.

      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s has pulled its new advert from TV screens and apologised for any upset caused after it was accused of exploiting childhood bereavement. The advert, first screened last week, shows a boy asking his mother about his dead father. As she tells him what his dad was like, the boy looks sad as they do not seem to have much in common. His face lights up once they arrive at a McDonald\u2019s and, as he eats a Filet-O-Fish, his mother says: \u201cThat was your dad\u2019s favourite too.\u201d Shelley Gilbert, a psychotherapist who founded the children\u2019s bereavement charity Grief Encounter, said it had received a lot of phone calls from concerned parents. She said: \u201cWhat [McDonald\u2019s] have done is exploited childhood bereavement as a way to connect with young people and surviving parents alike \u2013 unsuccessfully. \u201cOne in 29 children are bereaved of a parent or sibling by the time they are 16 years of age, so this storyline will resonate with a huge number of children and surviving parents. \u201cWe have already received countless phone calls this morning, with parents telling us their bereaved children have been upset by the advert and alienated by McDonald\u2019s as a brand that wants to emotionally manipulate its customers.\u201d The Advertising Standards Authority said it had received about 100 complaints by Monday, with more coming in. A spokesman said: \u201cComplainants have objected that it is inappropriate and insensitive to use bereavement and grief to sell fast food. Some complainants have referenced the proximity to Father\u2019s Day. \u201cWe\u2019re carefully assessing the complaints but no decision has been reached on whether there are grounds to launch an investigation.\u201d There was also criticism on social media, including from many people who said they had lost a parent during childhood. A McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cWe can confirm today that we have taken the decision to withdraw our \u2018Dad\u2019 TV advert. The advert will be removed from all media, including TV and cinema, completely and permanently this week. \u201cIt was never our intention to cause any upset. We are particularly sorry that the advert may have disappointed those people who are most important to us: our customers.\u201d She added that due to lead times required by broadcasters, the promotion created by the London advertising agency Leo Burnett, would still air on Wednesday. Last month, Pepsi withdrew an advertising campaign featuring Kendall Jenner after the company was accused of co-opting the imagery of protest movements to sell its products. The soft drink multinational\u2019s video featured the reality TV star and model Jenner joining a protest but then defusing a standoff with police by handing an officer a can of Pepsi. The image of Jenner approaching police appeared to reference the widely shared photograph of Ieshia Evans, a black woman who stood up to riot police during a Black Lives Matter protest following the fatal shooting of Alton Sterling by police in 2016.",

      "bodyText": "The rising cost of electricity contributed to inflation\u2019s rise to 2.7% in April, its highest level in three and a half years. Increases in the cost of clothing, car tax and air fares were also blamed by the Office for National Statistics for the rise in consumer price inflation (CPI) that exceeded City forecasts of 2.6%, and soared above the previous month\u2019s figure of 2.3%. With wages increasing by just 1.9%, opposition parties and the TUC said the new inflation figure highlighted the growing pressure on living standards and consumer spending. The economy has grown over the last two years in response to a surge in consumer spending, fuelled largely by an increase in credit. But the fall in the value of sterling following the Brexit vote has pushed up the prices of imports, especially of food and clothing. The Bank of England predicted last week that inflation would peak at 2.7% in the summer. However, this forecast looks like it will need to be revised, especially after the ONS said producer output price inflation was above 3%, indicating that further rises in inflation could be expected. Liberal Democrat shadow business secretary Susan Kramer said: \u201cThese worrying levels of inflation show the Brexit squeeze is hitting shopping baskets across the country.\u201d The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the government needed to protect workers from a slump in real wages. \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash. That\u2019s why living standards must be a key battleground at this election,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the parties need to explain how they\u2019ll create better-paid jobs, especially in the parts of the UK that need them most.\u201d City economists were divided over the path of inflation over the next year, with some expecting a modest and brief rise above 3% while others said it would be more sustained. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said he expected further electricity and gas price rises and that an acceleration in food price rises would push CPI inflation to 3.25% in the autumn. \u201cWe remain convinced that the market is underestimating the further upside for inflation from here,\u201d he said. Clarke argued that the retail prices index (RPI), which includes some housing costs, was already at 3.5% and would rise to 4.25% before the end of the year, putting extreme pressure on consumers to cut back spending on non-essential items. The National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research (NIESR) forecast last week that British workers will see their disposable incomes shrinking this year as a result of rising inflation that will peak at 3.4%, while average wage rises are capped at only 2.7%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said rising inflation would put a further squeeze on real incomes and force Threadneedle Street to delay any move to raise interest rates. \u201cThe Bank of England will most likely sit tight on interest rates through 2017 and 2018 \u2013 and very possibly well beyond. \u201cWe suspect it will end up remaining tolerant on the inflation overshoot given likely limited UK growth and the prolonged, highly uncertain outlook that the UK economy will face as the government negotiates the exit from the EU,\u201d he said. But Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, was more optimistic that inflation would be held in check. He said many of the elements pushing up inflation were one-off factors and their effect would wane over the coming months. \u201cThe sharp rise was mainly due to factors that, while they won\u2019t be reversed, shouldn\u2019t be repeated. Indeed, a large part of the rise in inflation reflected air fares reversing the previous month\u2019s fall as a result of Easter shifting from March last year to April this year. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, vehicle excise duty rates rose this April and tobacco and alcohol duty increased by more this year than they did last year,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Global stock markets: what's driving the record rises \u2013 and will they continue?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global stock markets are hitting new peaks, with the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax, the S&amp;P 500 in the US and MSCI\u2019s World Index, which tracks equities across the globe, all at record highs. Investors are shrugging off worries about flashpoints such as North Korea, the uncertainty over the global political situation and latterly the WannaCry cyber-attack to snap up shares. So what is driving the rise, and can it continue? China\u2019s $124bn infrastructure project Over the weekend, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, unveiled a plan to spend $124bn (\u00a396bn) on infrastructure as part of a $900bn \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative, a global construction plan covering 65 countries, from Asia to the Americas via Africa and Europe. Beijing\u2019s commitment to spend billions of dollars on new roads, ports and other infrastructure is likely to drive up consumption of commodities such as iron ore, copper and nickel. In turn this has given a boost to shares in mining companies that dig the key commodities out of the ground. And the FTSE 100 is particularly dominated by mining businesses, meaning it gains a particular benefit when the sector is in demand. European political fears recede Among political risks worrying investors was the prospect of renewed calls for a break-up of the eurozone, with unpredictable consequences for the rest of the global economy. The prospect of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, with her anti-EU stance, winning the French presidential election had been hovering over markets for weeks. So when the moderate Emmanuel Macron won, markets rallied in relief. The forthcoming German federal election has also been in focus. Concerns that Angela Merkel, the chancellor seen as a safe pair of hands by markets, could struggle brought new uncertainty. But over the weekend, Merkel\u2019s CDU defeated its rival SPD in regional elections, suggesting Merkel has little to worry about in September\u2019s poll. As for the UK election, Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives appear so far ahead that a shock result looks unlikely and investors are hoping a strong Tory majority will head off the threat of a chaotic Brexit. Oil price recovers on production cuts Rising production and weak demand had seen oil prices slide to new lows last year, but in November an agreement between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output for six months seemed to halt the decline. But in recent weeks there had been doubts about the effectiveness of the move, given US shale producers were increasing output and taking up the slack and concerns that the end of the agreement was in sight. But ahead of an Opec meeting on 25 May, two of the world\u2019s biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, said they would support a nine-month extension of the output cap until March 2018. They said they would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to tackle the global supply glut, and the news sent oil prices soaring. That, in turn, lifted energy and commodity companies and helped give the markets another lift. Central banks still supporting shares Recent strength in the US economy means the Federal Reserve has been happy to start edging up interest rates, and most economists now expect another increase in June. But with some signs of weakness in the first quarter, that may well be the last rise from the US central bank for a while. These small hikes have done little to halt a Wall Street rally and a pause is likely to be welcomed by investors. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank shows little sign of raising interest rates or halting its bond-buying programme anytime soon. Even if it does begin to ease its stimulus measures in the late summer, investors are likely to welcome the fact that the eurozone economy would be strong enough to absorb such a move. In the UK, the Bank of England last week suggested rates may rise sooner than the market expected, but economists believe there will be no move until 2019. And with low interest rates and bond yields, investors searching for growth have little option but to continue buying equities. Even a stronger pound in recent weeks has failed to dent the current rally in the FTSE 100, which has reached 7,500 for the first time. Taken as a whole, FTSE companies make the majority of their earnings overseas, so a weak pound boosts their bottom line and thus their stock prices. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, a spreadbetting firm, said: \u201cSince the snap election was announced, the negative correlation between the British pound and the FTSE 100 has broken down. If the last two weeks are any guide, investors in UK stocks seem to be looking beyond foreign exchange. \u201cAfter consolidating in a 350-point range for most of the year, the FTSE 100 could be setting the stage for another surge higher.\u201d Trump trade continues Following the election of Donald Trump as US president in November, global stock markets surged on his promises of increased infrastructure spending and tax reforms to boost demand for goods from the world\u2019s largest economy. And despite his initial failure to pass the healthcare bill, the lack of detail on his economic stimulus plans and the continuing controversies surrounding the president, investors continue to bet that the US economy will keep growing. The latest set of corporate results on Wall Street were generally positive, with earnings growing at their best quarterly pace in more than five years, according to Thomson Reuters. Technology stocks continue to lead the way, with Apple recently becoming the first US company to be valued at more than $800bn. Meanwhile, the VIX volatility gauge, the so-called fear index, has fallen to a 24-year low. US corporate earnings are on track to grow nearly 15% in the first quarter, the best quarterly pace in more than five years, according to Thomson Reuters.",

But over the weekend,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/14/angela-merkel-christian-democrats-beat-social-democrats-schulz-germany-state-election\"> Merkel\u2019s CDU defeated its rival SPD in regional elections</a>, suggesting Merkel has little to worry about in September\u2019s poll.</p> <p>As for the UK election, Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/may/08/general-election-2017-poll-tracker-who-is-in-the-lead\">Conservatives appear so far ahead</a> that a shock result looks unlikely and investors are hoping a strong Tory majority will head off the threat of a chaotic Brexit.</p> <h2>Oil price recovers on production cuts</h2> <p>Rising production and weak demand had seen oil prices slide to new lows last year, but in November <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/30/oil-price-opec-cut-in-output-saudi-arabia-deal-market\">an agreement between Opec and non-Opec producers to cut output for six months seemed to halt the decline</a>. But in recent weeks there had been doubts about the effectiveness of the move, given US shale producers were increasing output and taking up the slack and concerns that the end of the agreement was in sight.</p> <p>But ahead of an Opec meeting on 25 May, two of the world\u2019s biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, said they would support a nine-month extension of the output cap until March 2018. They said they would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to tackle the global supply glut, and the news sent oil prices soaring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2017-05-16T10:39:50/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Oil prices\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2017-05-16T10:39:50/embed.html\">Oil prices</a> </figure>  <p>That, in turn, lifted energy and commodity companies and helped give the markets another lift.</p> <h2>Central banks still supporting shares </h2> <p>Recent strength in the US economy means the Federal Reserve has been happy to start edging up interest rates, and most economists now expect another increase in June. But with some signs of weakness in the first quarter, that may well be the last rise from the US central bank for a while. These small hikes have done little to halt a Wall Street rally and a pause is likely to be welcomed by investors.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the European Central Bank shows little sign of raising interest rates or halting its bond-buying programme anytime soon. Even if it does begin to ease its stimulus measures in the late summer, investors are likely to welcome the fact that the eurozone economy would be strong enough to absorb such a move.</p> <p>In the UK, the Bank of England last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/11/bank-of-england-living-standards-interest-rates-inflation\">suggested rates may rise sooner than the market expected</a>, but economists believe there will be no move until 2019. And with low interest rates and bond yields, investors searching for growth have little option but to continue buying equities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2017-05-16T10:38:29/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Pound\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2017-05-16T10:38:29/embed.html\">Pound</a> </figure>  <p>Even a stronger pound in recent weeks has failed to dent the current rally in the FTSE 100, which has reached 7,500 for the first time. Taken as a whole, FTSE companies make the majority of their earnings overseas, so a weak pound boosts their bottom line and thus their stock prices. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, a spreadbetting firm, said: \u201cSince the snap election was announced, the negative correlation between the British pound and the FTSE 100 has broken down. If the last two weeks are any guide, investors in UK stocks seem to be looking beyond foreign exchange.</p> <p>\u201cAfter consolidating in a 350-point range for most of the year, the FTSE 100 could be setting the stage for another surge higher.\u201d</p> <h2>Trump trade continues</h2> <p>Following the election of Donald Trump as US president in November, global stock markets surged on his promises of increased infrastructure spending and tax reforms to boost demand for goods from the world\u2019s largest economy.</p> <p>And despite his initial failure to pass the healthcare bill, the lack of detail on his economic stimulus plans and the continuing controversies surrounding the president, investors continue to bet that the US economy will keep growing.</p> <p>The latest set of corporate results on Wall Street were generally positive, with earnings growing at their best quarterly pace in more than five years, according to Thomson Reuters.</p> <p>Technology stocks continue to lead the way, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/10/apple-becomes-first-company-worth-800bn\">Apple recently becoming the first US company to be valued at more than $800bn.</a> Meanwhile, the VIX volatility gauge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/oct/20/what-is-the-vix-volatility-index\">the so-called fear index</a>, has fallen to a 24-year low.</p> <p> US corporate earnings are on track to grow nearly 15% in the first quarter, the best quarterly pace in more than five years, according to Thomson Reuters.<strong> </strong></p>",

Tell us more about this right to hard facts that supposedly information-starved workers will enjoy? \u201cThis will be no more than the information that shareholders currently receive,\u201d says the prime minister\u2019s next sentence. For employees of publicly quoted companies, the correct response is a shrug. They are getting nothing they don\u2019t have already. Quoted companies do not communicate with their shareholders in sealed envelopes. They are obliged to publish their financial results and material relating to takeovers and the like via announcements to the stock exchange. Anybody \u2013 whether they work for the company or not \u2013 can read this stuff. On the first promise, May\u2019s slippery use of the phrase \u201crepresentation for workers on company boards\u201d is well known. She does not mean actual workers on actual boards. The CBI and other corporate lobbyists killed that radical idea months ago. Instead, to meet the prime minister\u2019s ambition, a company may merely have to designate a non-executive director as the \u201cemployee representative\u201d. That director may feel obliged to meet a few workers once in a while, but dressing up the process as \u201ca workers\u2019 right\u201d is ridiculous. True, a few of the other pledges are more solid. A new statutory right for bereaved parents to have time off work is an act of common decency. And the promise to guarantee current EU worker protections after Brexit is important. But the more interesting manifesto content will relate to what the Tories say about gig economy workers. If she listened to responsible employers, the prime minister would know that fury over bogus use of \u201coutsourcing\u201d contracts, especially in the delivery industry, extends to boardrooms. Upright firms accept the duties and obligations that come with employing people and don\u2019t see why rivals should be able to undercut them by abusing the definition of self-employment. Will May address this legitimate worry? Don\u2019t hold your breath. On the basis of her pledges about workers\u2019 representatives and access to information, she is more interested in playing with words. Is GSK getting the prescription right? \u201cMy viewpoint, and that of other like-minded institutional investors, has been heard but ultimately ignored \u2013 repeatedly,\u201d complained fund manager Neil Woodford as he revealed last week that he has sold his GlaxoSmithKline stake. He has been in the stock for more than 15 years, he said, so grumpiness is perhaps understandable. At the time of the grand merger in 2000, GSK\u2019s share price was pushing \u00a320. Now it\u2019s \u00a316.58 and the flow of dividends over the years is inadequate compensation. Woodford\u2019s complaint, however, is that none of the chief executives over the years has adopted his idea of breaking up GSK, a business that spans pharmaceuticals, vacinnes, consumer products and a specialist HIV unit. He calls the company \u201ca healthcare conglomerate with a sub-optimal strategy\u201d. It\u2019s a point of view and, as ever with Woodford, he makes it clearly \u2013 indeed, has done for ages. But his campaign for a break-up cannot be said to have caught fire. There may be \u201clike-minded\u201d investors but they surely don\u2019t amount to anything approaching a majority. The consensus opinion is still that the three-way asset shuffle with Novartis, which was executed in 2014, should be given time to work. There was little grumbling when Emma Walmsley, who Woodford calls the \u201ccontinuity candidate\u201d, succeeded Sir Andrew Witty in April. Woodford\u2019s analysis may be vindicated in time. His investing record is superb. But the idea that GSK has somehow frustrated the will of the bulk of its shareholders doesn\u2019t hold water. Woodford was an unhappy minority.

      "bodyText": "A US fund manager has thrown down the gauntlet to high-charging rivals and financial advisers by slashing fees to less than half the UK average. Vanguard will offer the cheapest way to buy funds and investment ISAs in the UK, with fees half the level charged by Hargreaves Lansdown and Fidelity Funds Network. Until now, fund groups have shied away from offering direct-to-consumer deals, preferring to sell through financial advisers or platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Vantage system. But Vanguard will now sell its range of index funds directly to consumers, charging from just 0.23% a year. That compares with the 0.5% to 1% fees charged by rivals. Vanguard is the world\u2019s second-largest fund manager, with $4.2tn (\u00a33.3tn) under management, mostly in low-cost index funds, which promise to track a particular index, such as the FTSE 100. Set up in 1974 by financier John Bogle, Vanguard pioneered index investing \u2013 which aims to replicate the performance of a specific share index such as the FTSE 100 \u2013 with the world\u2019s first mutual index fund available to the general public. It is client-owned, so does not pay dividends to shareholders. And, as it has expanded, it has consistently cut charges. The group launched eight years ago in the UK, where it has already acquired $72bn under management but until now has had a minimum investment of \u00a3100,000 for direct buyers. Under its new deal, investors with \u00a3500 upwards will be charged an account feeof 0.15% to administer their money, plus the underlying fee for each fund. Its cheapest mainstream fund is its FTSE All Share tracker, with a fee of 0.08% a year, making the total cost over one year 0.23%. Hargreaves Lansdown, currently Britain\u2019s biggest firm of financial advisers, charges 0.53% a year for the same fund. Vanguard said that someone investing \u00a310,000 a year would pay \u00a323 a year in total charges, compared with an average of \u00a349.58 for online investing services and up to \u00a3128 at the most expensive platforms. The authors of a book last year on investment industry charges, What They Do With Your Money: How the Financial System Fails Us and How to Fix It, highlighted the damaging impact of a seemingly innocuous 1.5%-a-year fee typically levied to manage money. Over a lifetime, a 1.5% charge means a fund manager and advisers help themselves to 38% of an individual\u2019s pension savings, much of it, they alleged, the result of pointless short-term positions and over-trading. Sean Hagerty, head of Vanguard\u2019s European business, said: \u201cOnly recently, the FCA\u2019s [Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s] asset management market study highlighted that fees have not decreased enough based on the economies of scale achieved by the industry. Vanguard agrees with these conclusions.\u201d The chief drawback to Vanguard\u2019s deal is that it will only sell its own range of funds, unlike Hargreaves and Fidelity, which allow investors to keep a wide range of different funds from asset managers in one place on their platform. Vanguard also largely offers index and \u201cexchange traded\u201d funds rather than actively managed funds. But it said that $1tn of its assets under management are now in actively managed funds, with fees starting at 0.6% compared with the industry\u2019s typical fees, in the UK, of about 1.5%. Hargreaves Lansdown said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on our competitors or their propositions. \u201cOur clients tell us they appreciate our extensive range of shares, funds, investment trusts, ETFs [exchange-traded funds] and cash open to them, all in one place, and most of them take advantage of the choice available to invest across multiple fund groups.\u201d",
