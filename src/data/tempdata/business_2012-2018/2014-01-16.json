      "bodyText": "A wide-ranging review of the Co-operative Group being conducted by former City minister Lord Myners is to analyse whether the chief executive should be appointed to the board, as well as the group's relationship with the Labour party after its tumultuous 2013. Myners, appointed a non-executive director of the group of pharmacies, supermarkets and funeral homes last month, will take a year to complete a root and branch review of the way the UK's biggest mutual is run after the problems exposed by the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall in its bank. He will, however, publish a report by the annual meeting in April on proposed changes to the management structure, which would need approval from the membership. \"In view of the urgent need to put in place a group board structure that is fit for purpose in providing appropriate guidance and support to management in a period of fundamental restructuring of the business, it is envisaged that initial proposals for changes to the society's rules will be put forward at the next AGM in May 2014,\" the terms of reference of the review said. The 20-strong Co-op Group board does not include the any members of the executive team, led by former B&amp;Q boss Euan Sutherland, and until the appointment of Myners was made up of representatives of the 8 million members of the co-operative movement. The terms of the review by Myners, a former chairman of Guardian Media Group elevated to the Lords during the banking crisis by Labour, also spells out that the \"governance of the group's relationships with affiliated bodies and representative organisations\" will be included. This is thought to include its links to the Labour party, which receives donations from the group. The second part of the review will look at ways of improving relations with members and engaging with customers and be completed by the end of the year. The report will be published on the review website. Myners regards the management changes as more urgent given the challenges facing the group which last year pumped \u00a3462m into the bank and ceded 70% control to its bondholders, led by US hedge funds. The aim is to eventually float the loss-making bank on the stock market. He is also going to look at the senior management expenses and the remuneration practices. The way appointments are made will also be scrutinised \u2013 an issue which was thrown into focus through Paul Flowers' appointment to chair the bank. A Methodist minister, he had little experience in banking and has since faced accusations of buying illegal drugs. The terms of reference of the review by Myners were published as the Treasury select committee announced it would take further evidence in its investigation into the collapse of the Co-op Bank's attempts to buy 631 branches from Lloyds. Lord Levene and Gary Hoffman, who led bidding vehicle NBNK \u2013 set up to bid for the branches \u2013 will give evidence to the committee next week.",

      "bodyText": "The most startling statistic among Thursday's crop of retail numbers was this: 20% of Christmas trade at Argos came from shoppers ordering via a mobile device; either a smartphone or a tablet. That's from a standing start in May 2010, when Argos first launched an iPhone app. On some days and weekends close to Christmas, reports Terry Duddy, chief executive of parent Home Retail, orders via mobile devices were running at up to 30% of Argos's total. The peak period was 6pm-7pm, suggesting the modern breed of customer has half an eye on the TV while shopping on a tablet. For Argos, where 46% of total sales now come via the internet, this shift in habits has delivered something close to salvation. A couple of years ago Amazon seemed destined to flatten Argos. It hasn't happened because the rise of tablets has gone hand-in-hand with the increase in collect-from-store services. Typically, customers will collect orders from Argos within an hour or two, or the next morning. The Amazon streamroller will trundle on, of course. But the trend illustrated at Argos explains why the internet giant is scrambling to secure collection points in London tube stations and elsewhere, while also indulging in fantasies like delivery by drone. Warmer breezes have come too late for the likes of Comet and HMV. But the survivors among specialist retailers, it seems, are no longer doomed to die at the hands of Amazon or Tesco's out-of-town megastores. This cheery conclusion is supported by Thursday's trading numbers. Dixons, for which obituaries were being prepared in 2011, saw like-for-like sales rise 5% in the UK and Ireland, which it thinks represented a gain in market share. It is a beneficiary of the demise of Comet, but the other half of the story is sharper pricing, imposed on it by the internet, and investment in better customer service, for which there is clearly still a demand. Halfords' revival \u2013 sales up 6.6% in the Christmas period \u2013 has followed a Dixons-like path. Its gadget boom is the huge increase in cycling, and there was a similar recognition that training staff was a necessary investment. All of which has provided some remarkable turnarounds in share prices. Home Retail's have advanced from 80p to 200p since summer 2012. Halfords' have travelled from 200p to almost 500p in the same time. Dixons' have quadrupled since Christmas 2011. Among that trio, only Halfords' shares stand even remotely near an all-time high, it should be added. Home Retail, even in revival mode, is a substantially less profitable business than it was. In 2007-08, profits were almost \u00a3400m; yesterday it said it expected this year's outcome to be towards the top of the City's \u00a390m-\u00a3109m range. But the three retailers can credibly claim to be competitive again. Debenhams doubts After Mike Ashley's fast shuffle out of Debenhams' shares, and into the business of writing put options on the stock, the net effect is that Sports Direct will end up with either a 0% stake in the department store group or 6.6%. But that's only if nothing changes in the meantime. When Ashley's around, make no assumptions. From his point of view, the arrangement makes some sense. He can book a \u00a34.5m profit on the initial purchase and sale of a 4.6% holding while keeping an indirect economic exposure. His only real risk comes if Debenhams' shares collapse. The clever-clogs manoeuvre may also be designed to remind Debenhams' board that he's around, plotting, and deadly serious about wanting to discuss some form of trading deal. But the advice to Debenhams' board remains the same. Only sign a deal with Ashley if it demonstrably makes sense for Debenhams and can be justified to shareholders. It doesn't matter if Sports Direct's stake is 0%, 4.6% or 6.6%. Any commercial alliance must stand on its own feet. For the time being, Ashley and Sports Direct have no voting rights whatsoever at Debenhams. The board should remember that fact when the two sides meet next week to talk about a tie-up as, from outside, it remains hard to see where the mutually beneficial crossover between Debenhams and Sports Direct is meant to be. In the midst of complexity, the department store group should try keep matters simple.",

But that's only if nothing changes in the meantime. When Ashley's around, make no assumptions.</p> <p>From his point of view, the arrangement makes some sense. He can book a \u00a34.5m profit on the initial purchase and sale of a 4.6% holding while keeping an indirect economic exposure. His only real risk comes if Debenhams' shares collapse.</p> <p>The clever-clogs manoeuvre may also be designed to remind Debenhams' board that he's around, plotting, and deadly serious about wanting to discuss some form of trading deal.</p> <p>But the advice to Debenhams' board remains the same. Only sign a deal with Ashley if it demonstrably makes sense for Debenhams and can be justified to shareholders.</p> <p>It doesn't matter if Sports Direct's stake is 0%, 4.6% or 6.6%. Any commercial alliance must stand on its own feet.</p> <p>For the time being, Ashley and Sports Direct have no voting rights whatsoever at Debenhams. The board should remember that fact when the two sides meet next week to talk about a tie-up as, from outside, it remains hard to see where the mutually beneficial crossover between Debenhams and Sports Direct is meant to be.</p> <p>In the midst of complexity, the department store group should try keep matters simple.</p>",

Set against the rise of regional powers, an era of greater economic pragmatism and national self-protection might increase inter-state friction and aggravate a global governance vacuum. This may hinder progress on cross-cutting, long-term challenges, and lead to increased inefficiencies and friction costs in strategically important sectors, such as healthcare, financial services and energy. Managing this risk will require flexibility, fresh thinking and multistakeholder communication.&#xa0;</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Generation lost?</strong></h2> <ul> <li>The generation coming of age in the 2010s faces high unemployment and precarious job situations, hampering their efforts to build a future and raising the risk of social unrest. In advanced economies, the large number of graduates from expensive and outmoded educational systems \u2013 graduating with high debts and mismatched skills \u2013 points to a need to adapt and integrate professional and academic education. In developing countries, an estimated two-thirds of the youth are not fulfilling their economic potential. The generation of digital natives is full of ambition to improve the world but feels disconnected from traditional politics; their ambition needs to be harnessed if systemic risks are to be addressed.&#xa0;</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Digital disintegration</strong>:</h2> <ul> <li>So far, cyberspace has proved resilient to attacks, but the underlying dynamic of the online world has always been that it is easier to attack than defend. The world may be only one disruptive technology away from attackers gaining a runaway advantage, meaning the Internet would cease to be a trusted medium for communication or commerce. Fresh thinking at all levels on how to preserve, protect and govern the common good of a trusted cyberspace must be developed.&#xa0;</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/news/worsening-wealth-gap-seen-biggest-risk-facing-world-2014\"><strong>The full report is online here</strong></a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-5d8079dd-2909-45b8-bf49-a08ad257c4eb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/16/1389876928533/3b8fc699-faaa-4734-9d06-8f96849fb6c7-226x420.png\" alt=\"World Economic Forum, global risks, January 2014\" width=\"226\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: /WEF</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52d7e7bbe4b040bca45b48bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-16T14:18:02.439Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>US inflation,</strong> meanwhile, rose by the most in six months in December - pushed up by higher gasoline prices.</p> <p>The US Consumer Prices index jumped to 1.5% on an annual basis, from 1.2% in November.

Business over the&#xa0;<a>internet</a>&#xa0;made up almost half of Argos's sales as shoppers made more purchases using&#xa0;<a>tablet computers</a>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a>mobile phones</a>.</p> <p>At their peak, sales using tablets and phones were almost 30% of Argos's business.</p> <p>Sales of tablets were strong while demand for video games consoles often outstripped Argos's ability to supply the goods.</p> <p>Both businesses were written off as dinosaurs a few years ago but have revived themselves by homing in on internet shopping. Argos had its best Christmas trading for more than 10 years as customers ordered online and picked up goods in shops.</p> <p>Terry Duddy, Home Retail's chief executive, said: \"Customers are looking for strong availability instore for must-have gifts, particularly tablets and video games. They want those products with absolute immediacy.\"</p> <p>Tablet sales boomed at Dixons along with demand for large televisions and kitchen gadgets. After a frantic period around \"Black Friday\" sales at the end of November, business quietened down but \"took off like a rocket\" from Boxing Day when Dixons took \u00a3100,000 a minute, chief executive Seb James said.</p> <p>\"This has been a lively Christmas with plenty of ups and downs and I am pleased to report that we have turned in a good performance,\" he said.</p> <p>But he warned that business would be more moderate for the rest of the financial year. Consumers squeezed by falling real incomes are expected to tighten their belts to recover from Christmas.</p> <p>\"These are good numbers, but I am mindful that what recovery there is in the UK is still fledgling,\" James said.</p> <p>Internet sales have helped mark out retail's winners and losers over the crucial Christmas trading period. Next was able to withstand pressure to reduce prices because of its top-notch internet operation while Debenhams, which is weak online, resorted to a failed strategy of aggressive promotions. Morrisons blamed its lack of online capability partly for the worst performance of Britain's big supermarkets.</p> <p><a>On a busy day for retail news, a string of other companies announced strong Christmas trading</a>&#xa0;included Associated British Foods, which owns<a>Primark</a>, Halfords and online grocer Ocado, which started delivering for Morrisons this week.</p> <p>Primark had \"excellent\" Christmas sales with strong performance at established stores, Associated British Foods said. Sales at Ocado jumped 21% in the six weeks to 6 January but like Dixons the company warned that the market is tough with \"consumer sentiment subdued\".</p> <p>Like-for-like sales at Halfords were up 5.2% in the 15 weeks to 10 January as the bike and car accessories seller gained from the boom in bicycle sales, which were up by almost 20%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52d7a84ce4b0d68a166e436e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-16T09:48:28.830Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Richard Hunter</b>, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, &#xa0;says there's no doubt that Dixons' recovery is on track (despite its cautious outlook statement).</p> <p>And Dixon's recent success online (internet-led sales&#xa0;jumped&#xa0;by 23%) gets some of the credit:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The internet led channel continues to grow apace, whilst the previously announced strategic disposals help clear the deck for a stronger focus on growth.&#xa0;</p> <p>Alongside this, the company has kept a tight rein on costs and the success of the Christmas trading period is testament to a number of pricing and service objectives coming to fruition.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has declaring that Britain's minimum wage could be raised from \u00a36.31 per hour to \u00a37 by 2015, winning praise from charities and left-leaning economists but raising the hackles of business leaders. In a bold, unexpected bid to outflank Labour, the chancellor told the BBC that Britain's economy was strong enough to support a higher national minimum wage (NMW), putting pressure on the Commission which will make an official recommendation. Osborne said: Of course we have got to make the exact calculation about what the rate should be. That's for the Low Pay Commission, created by a Labour government, supported by this government, to make the independent decision on the number itself. \"But when I look at the British economy I see the British economy expanding, I see jobs being created, I see the prospect of future jobs being created as well. I think Britain can afford a higher minimum wage. We have worked hard to get to this point and we can start to enjoy the fruits of all that hard work.\" Prime minister David Cameron told Facebook followers that: Because of the difficult decisions we've taken to fix the economy, we believe we can now afford to increase the minimum wage - putting more money in people's pockets and helping them provide for their families. Business bodies questioned whether the economy was strong enough to support a higher minimum wage. The CBI said productivity may be too low, while the Institute of Directors wants to see national insurance rates cut in return. But the Child Poverty Action Group said a higher minimum wage was urgently needed in poorer parts of the country. Alison Garnham, its chief executive, explained: \u201cWe know that when workers get better pay, not only are they able to better meet their children\u2019s needs but more money flows through their local community as they spend it. Political reaction is mixed -- Labour chided Osborne for not joining them by calling for a higher minimum wage in the past. Chris Leslie MP, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, accused the chancellor of 'flailing' under pressure. While Liberal Democrats sources pointed out that business secretary Vince Cable said months ago that the NMW should rise. Our latest news story is here: George Osborne backs above-inflation rise in national minimum wage Larry Elliott's analysis is here: Minimum wage announcement is not just good economics And Mona Chalabi's datablog post is here: UK minimum wage: a history in numbers Keep watching the website tonight for more developments. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW One point of clarification, raising the minimum wage to \u00a37 per hour would probably take place in two stages, with a rise later this year and a second one in 2015. Our latest news story, by Nick Watt and Patrick Wintour, explains: George Osborne has launched an audacious attempt to outflank Ed Miliband on the cost of living by calling for an above-inflation rise in the national minimum wage to restore it to its value before the financial crash in 2008. On the eve of a major speech on the economy by Miliband the chancellor threw his weight behind a proposal to increase the minimum wage to \u00a37 an hour by 2015. It currently stands at \u00a36.31. The increase would take place over two stages, in October 2014 and October 2015, to allow Osborne to fight the next general election on the basis that the coalition would have increased the minimum wage well above the rate of inflation and restored the value it lost in the recession. Here's the full story: George Osborne backs above-inflation rise in national minimum wage These days, you know something is government policy when the prime minister writes about it on Facebook. And David Cameron has indeed posted his support for raising the minimum wage on the social network, saying: Our long-term economic plan is securing Britain's future and helping hardworking people. Because of the difficult decisions we've taken to fix the economy, we believe we can now afford to increase the minimum wage - putting more money in people's pockets and helping them provide for their families. We are doing all we can to make hardworking families financially secure - cutting income tax for 25 million people, freezing fuel duty and keeping mortgage rates low. There's a lively debate in the comments, with the PM being reminded that the Conservatives voted against the introduction of the minimum wage in 1998. Clearly keen not to be left behind, Liberal Democrat insiders are pointing out that they were calling for a minimum wage rise last year. And it's true that business secretary Vince Cable told party conference delegates that he would ask the Low Pay Commission to restore its value. Press Association has the details: Liberal Democrats said that Mr Cable had wanted to be clear last September about his belief that it was time for a generous increase in the minimum wage, but that the Chancellor had \"dragged his feet\" on the issue. \"He blocked any reference at all to how we wanted to address the failure of the national minimum wage in real terms over the last few years,\" said a senior Lib Dem source. \"It was his office which blocked any reference to restoring it to previous levels.\" Declaring that the Lib Dems were \"glad\" that the Chancellor had come round to their view, the source added: \"The Liberal Democrats have always said we are keen to see the minimum wage increased as fast as economic conditions would allow, to give further help to those on lower incomes. \"That is why in September Vince asked the LPC [Low Pay Commission] to consider whether the minimum wage could be allowed to rise faster.\" Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has thrown his support behind raising the minimum wage, calling it a \"bold move\". \"It shows that at the heart of all our reforms this Government is concerned to improve the quality of life for the poorest in society. \"The commitment to a higher national minimum wage is all part of ensuring that the economic recovery delivers for people who want to work hard and play by the rules.\" It's now almost 15 years since the minimum wage came into effect - one of the flagship policies of Tony Blair's first administration. It started at \u00a33.60 per hour for adult workers over the age of 22 and \u00a33.00 for those aged 18-22 -- and meant higher wage packets for millions. Although it has risen each year, it has lagged behind inflation in recent years, as this chart shows: More in this datablog post: UK minimum wage: a history in numbers Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that raising the minimum wage over the next two years makes economic sense....although the chancellor probably has an eye on the next election too. As Larry explains, increasing the NMW from \u00a36.31 an hour to \u00a37 would bring it back to its real level (ie, adjusted for inflation) when the financial crisis struck in 2008/09: So why this decision to stick up for those on poverty wages? The Treasury say that they have crunched the numbers and decided that in an improving labour market a generous minimum wage settlement this year and next would have no detrimental effects on jobs and growth. Officials think that bigger wage rises will become the norm during 2014 and that those on the lowest wages should not be left behind. This makes a lot of economic sense. Prices have been rising more quickly than wages for the whole of the current parliament, squeezing real incomes and threatening to put the brake on the recovery. Lobbying for a higher minimum wage is one direct way the government can influence the level of consumer demand. Here's the full piece: Minimum wage announcement is not just good economics ITV's economics editor, Richard Edgar, has rattled out a blogpost, pointing out that small businesses who survived the recession may be worried by George Osborne backing a minimum wage rise: The Institute of Chartered Accountants says that companies have already fixed their budgets for the year and higher wages \"would have to be paid for from savings elsewhere in the business, increasing product prices, or even by stalling recruitment plans\". Could the remarkable success story of the past year - falling unemployment - finally draw to a close? One boss of a security firm has told ITV News this evening that she is very worried: \"If I had to put guards on the new minimum wage,\" she said, \"I just don\u2019t know how I could work in that sector.\" The Institute of Economic Affairs has also come out against a minimum wage rise, flags up Laura Kuenssberg of ITN News A reminder that Nick Watt's news story on Osborne's comments is here, and being updated: George Osborne backs minimum wage rise to \u00a37 an hour The Labour Party is not impressed by George Osborne's comments. Chris Leslie MP, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government has failed to support Labour's proposals to raise the minimum wage: \u201cGeorge Osborne is flailing around under pressure but he has made no concrete announcement about the level of the minimum wage. \u201cEd Miliband and Ed Balls said last year that we need above inflation rises in the minimum wage in order to catch up the lost value over the last few years. And both the Tories and Lib Dems voted against Labour\u2019s motion yesterday which called for action to make this happen. \u201cThe Tories cannot hide from the fact that working people on average \u00a31600 a year worse off since they came to office. We need action now to earn our way to higher living standards and tackle the cost-of-living crisis. That\u2019s why, as well as a higher minimum wage, Labour will make long-term reforms to our economy, freeze energy prices, expand free childcare, incentivise the living wage and build the homes Britain needs.\u201d Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, has applauded George Osborne for saying that Britain could afford an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage (see 5.51pm onwards). Moving the base wage from \u00a36.31 per hour to \u00a37 would be a real boon to the poorest parts of the UK, she believes: \u201cThis is a very welcome suggestion from the Chancellor and it will do a great deal of good both for the poorest working families and for the economy. \u201cWe know that when workers get better pay, not only are they able to better meet their children\u2019s needs but more money flows through their local community as they spend it. This helps jobs and growth and is exactly what we need to get the economy moving in the poorest communities that need it most. \u201cThe Low Pay Commission makes recommendations to government on the national minimum wage, but the final decision lies with Ministers, so we hope to see this become a firm commitment very soon.\u201d And that's a hat-trick of employers' groups who don't like the sounds of an increased minimum wage: John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) claims raising base salaries could hurt economic competitiveness - even though the wealth gap is growing. \u201cAlthough it is clear that there is an increased disparity between the highest and lowest earners, arbitrarily raising the floor isn\u2019t necessarily the solution and could in fact make the UK economy uncompetitive in the long term. The adverse effects of an unaffordable minimum wage hike would also be predominantly concentrated among SMEs, young people and graduates. If we want to spread the wealth around as the economy recovers, we need a long-term plan to create a high-skill, high-wage economy, including action on infrastructure and access to finance.\u201d The Institute of Directors are also reluctant to put their hands in their pockets to pay workers more, and would like the business tax burden cut in return: James Sproule, Chief Economist at the Institute of Directors, suggests Britain's economy may not have recovered its productivity levels yet. \u201cWe understand the political pressure to tackle this issue, but economic reality must be the driver for any such policy. A rise in the minimum wage should be offset by a reduction in employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions which, with a reduction in tax credits, could be revenue neutral. Furthermore, if raising the minimum wage is not justified by a rise in productivity, it would be a risky move that could well have an impact on employment, particularly among smaller firms. We would urge the Low Pay Commission to pay careful attention to the timing of any announcement. \u201cA rise in the minimum wage will put pressure on all wage differentials, and the cumulative effect of this could reduce UK productivity and therefore leave employers reluctant to take on new staff. This would be particularly concerning at a time when the government should be doing all it can to make employment attractive.\u201d Reaction to George Osborne's comments on the minimum wage is flooding in -- the CBI don't sound terribly impressed. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said the chancellor should leave the issue to the commission which was set up to consider the issue: \u201cRecommending the rate of the national minimum wage must be a matter for the Low Pay Commission, as the Chancellor recognises. \u201cAn unaffordable rise would end up costing jobs and hit smaller businesses in particular. \u201cAny increase in wages must reflect improved productivity.\u201d The TUC's senior economist, Duncan Weldon, welcomes Osborne's comments on raising the minimum wage - and cautions that the cost of living squeeze affects many more workers too: An interesting development in the UK tonight - chancellor George Osborne has suggested that Britain's minimum wage should be raised. From Westminster, Nick Watt reports: George Osborne has acted to try to outflank Ed Miliband over the cost-of-living issue by calling for a dramatic increase in the national minimum wage to restore it to its pre-recession value. The chancellor has thrown his weight behind a proposal that would see the minimum wage increase from \u00a36.31 to \u00a37 an hour from October \u2013 seven months before the general election. The move, which follows a lengthy debate in Tory circles led by his allies Matt Hancock and Jo Johnson over the need for a major increase in the minimum wage, came in the government's submission to the Low Pay Commission. The Treasury made an assessment \u2013 though not technically a recommendation \u2013 of the impact of increasing the minimum wage to \u00a37 from October. The commission is due to make a recommendation next month. More here: George Osborne backs minimum wage rise to \u00a37 an hour The move comes a day before Miliband makes a key speech on the economy -- perhaps pay inequality is finally climbing up the political agenda, as the World Economic Forum called today? Asked about the 2008 crisis, Bernanke said he paid credit to President W Bush's role -- for giving the Fed the freedom to do what it felt had to be done. He also said that countries where the leader had a guaranteed majority in the legislature were able to react faster than the US. Here's our story about Sir Hector Sants joining the Church of England's campaign to build credit unions and battle Wonga et al. Church of England appoints former City regulator to lead credit union campaign Heads-up: Ben Bernanke, the outgoing Federal Reserve chief, is discussing his time running America's central bank now - it's being streamed on Bloomberg TV. He's been emphasising the importance of the Fed's independence from political influence, warning that the day it lets those short-term political pressures influence policy \"then our independence is gone\". He hopes that some of the criticism in Washington over the Fed's unconventional monetary policy will end as the US economic recovery continues. Asked about the Fed's controversial huge bond-buying programme, Bernanke joked that: The problem with QE is it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory. Philip Jennings, General Secretary of UNI Global Union, says world leaders and business people at Davos must take today's WEF report on Global Risks seriously. Jennings says issues such as wealth inequality and joblessness cannot be ignored any more: \u201cThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Risks Report 2014 confirms how the world economy has become twisted out of shape. High unemployment and underemployment as well as income disparity are among the top ten concerns in the WEF Global Risks Report 2014. The report should act as a wake-up call to the influencers and leaders at Davos next week. These are global issues we can do something about: we can twist the global economy back into shape \u2013 this includes a new commitment to create jobs, address income inequality and falling living standards. Since the global financial crisis it\u2019s been a race to the bottom in jobs, wages and living standards.\" While \"income disparity\" (the wealth gap) is seen as the most likely problem to strike the world economy, those surveyed by WEF said another \"fiscal crisis\" was the most daunting risk looming over the global economy Today's report explains: Advanced economies remain in danger of fiscal crises. Given the US\u2019s official public debt of more than 100% of its GDP, and Japan\u2019s of more than 230%, investors may at some point conclude that these levels are unsustainable. In the short run, the risks are higher for eurozone countries, which lack the option of devaluing their currencies to ease the necessary fiscal adjustment. Although ostensibly in a better position, many emerging markets have seen credit bubbles in recent years that could turn into financial crises, and then fiscal crises, for example, the rapid credit growth in Asia since 2008.1 A fiscal crisis in any major economy could easily have cascading global impacts. Here's the list of the top 10 things that worried WEF's panel the most Global Risk Fiscal crises in key economies Structurally high unemployment/underemployment Water crises Severe income disparity Failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation Greater incidence of extreme weather events (e.g. floods, storms, fires) Global governance failure Food crises Failure of a major financial mechanism/institution Profound political and social instability The wealth gap wasn't even a top -five threat in the minds of the Davos elite until three years ago, as this chart (chopped into two for clarity) shows. Unemployment and underemployment is a new entry, even though fears of a lost generation have been growing since the early days of the crisis. Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider uploaded a clearer version here. Back to the World Economic Forum's warning today that the growing wealth gap is the biggest threat to the global economy. Andrew Hill of the Financial Times is unimpressed, saying that the Davos crowd have, once again, proved they can spot threats that are already banging on the door. He writes: The pressing preoccupations of business, government, academic, non-governmental leaders \u2013 the \u201crisks\u201d that combine \u201chigh impact and high likelihood\u201d \u2013 are: extreme weather events, failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation, water crises, severe income disparity, high unemployment, and fiscal crises in key economies. But if I were a bookmaker, I would have long since closed the betting on whether these events will occur \u2013 because almost all of them already have. Davos leaders spot the risks that have already arrived While some critics hector payday lenders for preying on poorer families, the Church of England has engaged Sir Hector Sants, former top City watchdog, to take them on. Sants led the FSA through the crisis and then worked as Barclays head of compliance and regulatory affairs before taking sick leave, and then resigning. He will chair the CoE's taskforce to support the growth of Credit Unions in the UK, saying today he was delighter to support Justin Welby in this \"very tangible and exciting project\" The Archbishop of Canterbury, who vowed last summer to compete Wonga out of business, said today: \"There are few people in today's financial sector who have Sir Hector Sants' breadth and depth of experience and outstanding reputation. I am enormously grateful and pleased that he has accepted my invitation to lead the church's initiative to work with the credit unions to help serve all the people of this country better and to contribute to developing a more transparent and competitive system focused on serving the needs of everyone.\" The CofE statement is here. Goldman Sachs staff will learn today how much they'll be paid for 2013, after today's results were released. City editor Jill Treanor calculates that they'll get an average of $383,000 each, based on the money set aside by Goldman for remuneration. That's a stark example of the wealth gap which the World Economic Forum says could threaten the stability of the global economy (see 2.20pm). Jill writes: Putting a fresh focus on the debate over City pay, Goldman's 32,900 global employees will be told the size of their individual bonuses on Thursday. The fixed-income trading operation, usually the powerhouse of the Wall Street firms, suffered a fall in profits while the firm did better in its equities business. It was the worst year for bond trading since 2005. In remarks that may indicate the firm is expecting a strong start to the new year, Goldman said its backlog of investment transactions at the end of the year had \"increased significantly\" compared with 2012. I flagged up earlier that fourth-quarter profits were down year-on-year ,but for 2013 as a whole earnings were up 5%. More here: Goldman Sachs pay employees average of $383,000 after profits rise 5% After hitting another record high last night, shares on Wall Street are dropping in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 63 points, or almost 0.4%, falling to 16418 Predictions that Citigroup shares would fall after it missed forecasts (despite growing profits) were accurate -- they're down 2.7% in early trading. The widening gap between rich and poor, and the growing \"lost generation\" of young people who can't find a job, are two of the biggest threats to the global economy, the World Economic Forum warned today. In a new report ahead of its annual get-together of world leaders, economists and journalists in Davos next week, WEF said that income disparity was the most likely factor to cause economic disruption over the next decade. Its survey of 700 opinion formers also identified extreme weather events, and youth unemployment or underemployment, as serious threats over the next 10 years. WEF is also concerned about cyber security, warning that determined attackers could cause \"digital disintegration\". Critics of the annual Davos shindig may question whether the global elite are serious about tackling global wealth gap, given so many of them are paid-up members of \"the 1%\" (or the 0.01% in some cases). While it's encouraging that the issue will be on the agenda next week, we'll be looking for proof that Davos-ites are really waking up to these problems. WEF said that young people face \"twin challenges\" of reduced employment opportunity and the rising cost of education, given: over 50% of young people in some developed markets currently looking for work and rising informal employment in developing regions where 90% of the world\u2019s youth live. David Cole, group chief risk officer of Swiss Re, said young people in developed countries face fewer job opportunities and the need to support an ageing population: While in the emerging markets there are more jobs to be had, the workforce does not yet possess the broad based skill-sets necessary to satisfy demand. It\u2019s vital we sit down with young people now and begin planning solutions aimed at creating fit-for-purpose educational systems, functional job-markets, efficient skills exchanges and the sustainable future we all depend on. Here's the key points from the report: Instabilities in an increasingly multipolar world: Changing demographics, growing middle classes and fiscal constraints will place increasing domestic demands on governments, deepening requirements for internal reform and shaping international relations. Set against the rise of regional powers, an era of greater economic pragmatism and national self-protection might increase inter-state friction and aggravate a global governance vacuum. This may hinder progress on cross-cutting, long-term challenges, and lead to increased inefficiencies and friction costs in strategically important sectors, such as healthcare, financial services and energy. Managing this risk will require flexibility, fresh thinking and multistakeholder communication. Generation lost? The generation coming of age in the 2010s faces high unemployment and precarious job situations, hampering their efforts to build a future and raising the risk of social unrest. In advanced economies, the large number of graduates from expensive and outmoded educational systems \u2013 graduating with high debts and mismatched skills \u2013 points to a need to adapt and integrate professional and academic education. In developing countries, an estimated two-thirds of the youth are not fulfilling their economic potential. The generation of digital natives is full of ambition to improve the world but feels disconnected from traditional politics; their ambition needs to be harnessed if systemic risks are to be addressed. Digital disintegration: So far, cyberspace has proved resilient to attacks, but the underlying dynamic of the online world has always been that it is easier to attack than defend. The world may be only one disruptive technology away from attackers gaining a runaway advantage, meaning the Internet would cease to be a trusted medium for communication or commerce. Fresh thinking at all levels on how to preserve, protect and govern the common good of a trusted cyberspace must be developed. The full report is online here. US inflation, meanwhile, rose by the most in six months in December - pushed up by higher gasoline prices. The US Consumer Prices index jumped to 1.5% on an annual basis, from 1.2% in November. Prices rose by a perky 0.3% month-on-month. But strip out energy and food prices, and core inflation in the American economy only rose by 0.1% during December (or 1.7% on an annual basis). Wage rises have been modest in America (like in the UK and much of Europe) meaning little inflationary pressure, foiling predictions that the central bank stimulus programmes would drive domestic prices up. The latest weekly US unemployment data suggests Americans on jobless benefit found it a little harder to get off welfare at the end of 2013 . The number of US citizens filing 'continuing' unemployment claims jumped back over the three million mark to 3,03m, up from 2.856m, in the seven days to 4 January. That's the highest level since early July. But in brighter news, the number of new claims for jobless benefit fell by 2,000 last week to 326,000, a six week low. The US labour market is under scrutiny after December's Non-Farm Payroll showed that a meagre 74,000 new jobs were created across the economy last month. We have a Christmas loser, and it's a big one. Best Buy, the US retail giant, has shocked the US markets by announcing that sales fell over the festive season, and warned that profit margins shrunk as it slashed prices in a bid to lure customers in. Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly warned that retailers engaged in deep price cutting in December: The promotional intensity that began with Black Friday continued throughout the period. Best Buy's shares will soon be available at a discount too -- they plunged 30% in pre-market trading. Such a contrast with the raft of UK retailers beating forecasts today. Looks like Goldman's shares will rise modestly in an hour's time when Wall Street gives its verdict on today's results, while Citi's are down over 2% in pre-market trading. Citigroup's results are also out, and it has missed top-line expectations. Adjusted earnings came in at $2.6bn, or $0.82 per share, some way shy of the $0.95 per share which Wall Street expected. But on the positive side, that's an improvement on the net profits of $2.15bn, or $0.69 per share, racked up a year ago. Revenues were also below forecast (at $17.9bn, compared to $18.3bn). Citi's chief executive, Michael Corbat, says the bank \"didn't finish the year as strongly as we would have liked\". Under GAAP accounting rules, Citi's profits jumped more sharply - to $2.69bn from $1.2bn a year ago. Goldman Sachs' fourth-quarter financial results have just been released, and at first glance the Wall Street titan has beaten expectations, although profits are still down compared with a year ago. It made $4.60 per share in the last three months of 2013, compared with estimates of around $4.18 per share. But net income, or profits, for the quarter came in at $2.33bn, down from $2.89bn (or $5.60 per share) a yea ago. Here's some more details on the declining revenue levels: \u2022 Net revenues in institutional client services were $3.41 billion for Q4 of 2013, 22% lower than fourth quarter of 2012 \u2022 Quarterly net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution were $1.72 billion, 15% lower \u2022 Quarterly net revenues in equities were $1.68 billion, 27% lower than the fourth quarter of 2012 Back to Jens Weidmann's speech, and the Bundesbank president has urged France to act like a serious \"role model\" for the euro area. Reuters has the story: European Central Bank policymaker Jens Weidmann urged France on Thursday to live up to its responsibilities as one of the largest economies in the euro zone, saying the country had lost some of its competitiveness. Weidmann said during the heated phase of the crisis the focus had been on the periphery members of the currency bloc and less on the reform situation in Germany and France. \"France is decisive for the euro zone,\" Weidmann said in a question and answer session after giving a speech.\"France has lost some of its competitiveness. I'd hope that France, as one of the largest countries in the euro zone, would live up to its position as a role model,\" he added. Meanwhile, the row over Francois Hollande's personal life has irked at least one French farmer: A warning for UK readers from the Bank of England, if you've got any old \u00a350 notes in your possession then please spend them by the end of April, or swap them at a bank. The 'Houblon \u00a350\", with a picture of the first BoE governor Sir John Houblon, is being withdrawn from circulation at the end of April, replaced by a new one starring two pioneers of the industrial revolution, Boulton and Watt. Hard to believe that many Brits will have a pile of fifty pound notes gathering dust -- although City readers may disagree.... Update: Barclays, NatWest, RBS, Ulster Bank and the Post Office have all agreed to exchange Houblon \u00a350 notes for members of the public until 30 October 2014, but only \u00a3200 worth. Germany's top central banker has declared that its economic recovery will continue this year, thanks to low unemployment and growing consumer demand at home Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann said that last year's weak growth (of just 0.4%) didn't show the full picture of German economic strength, as: \"The German domestic economy is already more dynamic than the moderate growth rates for the year 2013 suggest. Weidmann also defended the ECB's performance on maintaining price stability (he sits on its governing council), by arguing there is no need for \"irrational inflationary fears\", or to fret about deflation. Onto other business, and we've had confirmation that the eurozone inflation rate remains well below the European Central Bank's 2% target. Prices rose by just 0.8% on an annual basis in the euro area (in line with the first estimate), driven down by falling costs of telecommunications services and transport fuel. It won't ease concerns that Europe is sliding into deflation -- despite ECB chief Mario Draghi insisting last week that we're not witnessing a repeat of Japan's problems in the 1990s. Time to recap. It's been a surprisingly good morning for Britain's retailers, with several high street names beating City forecasts. And Argos and Dixons, two chains who didn't appear to have a bright future when the recession struck, have shown they've grasped online shopping. Both firms did rather better over Christmas than other retailers, particularly the supermarket chains that were threatening to snatch their business. My colleague Sean Farrell has rounded up all the news (scroll back through the blog for more details) Argos and Dixons have emerged as winners from the Christmas battle of Britain's retailers, as booming online orders drove sales. Sales at Argos stores open a year or more rose 3.8% to \u00a31.8bn in the trading period covering Christmas while equivalent sales at Dixons in the UK and Ireland jumped 5%. Argos is owned by Home Retail Group, which also owns Homebase while Dixons trades on the high street through Currys and PC World. Both groups said online sales were a big part of their success. Business over the internet made up almost half of Argos's sales as shoppers made more purchases using tablet computers and mobile phones. At their peak, sales using tablets and phones were almost 30% of Argos's business. Sales of tablets were strong while demand for video games consoles often outstripped Argos's ability to supply the goods. Both businesses were written off as dinosaurs a few years ago but have revived themselves by homing in on internet shopping. Argos had its best Christmas trading for more than 10 years as customers ordered online and picked up goods in shops. Terry Duddy, Home Retail's chief executive, said: \"Customers are looking for strong availability instore for must-have gifts, particularly tablets and video games. They want those products with absolute immediacy.\" Tablet sales boomed at Dixons along with demand for large televisions and kitchen gadgets. After a frantic period around \"Black Friday\" sales at the end of November, business quietened down but \"took off like a rocket\" from Boxing Day when Dixons took \u00a3100,000 a minute, chief executive Seb James said. \"This has been a lively Christmas with plenty of ups and downs and I am pleased to report that we have turned in a good performance,\" he said. But he warned that business would be more moderate for the rest of the financial year. Consumers squeezed by falling real incomes are expected to tighten their belts to recover from Christmas. \"These are good numbers, but I am mindful that what recovery there is in the UK is still fledgling,\" James said. Internet sales have helped mark out retail's winners and losers over the crucial Christmas trading period. Next was able to withstand pressure to reduce prices because of its top-notch internet operation while Debenhams, which is weak online, resorted to a failed strategy of aggressive promotions. Morrisons blamed its lack of online capability partly for the worst performance of Britain's big supermarkets. On a busy day for retail news, a string of other companies announced strong Christmas trading included Associated British Foods, which ownsPrimark, Halfords and online grocer Ocado, which started delivering for Morrisons this week. Primark had \"excellent\" Christmas sales with strong performance at established stores, Associated British Foods said. Sales at Ocado jumped 21% in the six weeks to 6 January but like Dixons the company warned that the market is tough with \"consumer sentiment subdued\". Like-for-like sales at Halfords were up 5.2% in the 15 weeks to 10 January as the bike and car accessories seller gained from the boom in bicycle sales, which were up by almost 20%. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, says there's no doubt that Dixons' recovery is on track (despite its cautious outlook statement). And Dixon's recent success online (internet-led sales jumped by 23%) gets some of the credit: The internet led channel continues to grow apace, whilst the previously announced strategic disposals help clear the deck for a stronger focus on growth. Alongside this, the company has kept a tight rein on costs and the success of the Christmas trading period is testament to a number of pricing and service objectives coming to fruition. Set against these strengths, the company expects the fourth quarter to take some of the shine from the overall annual performance, whilst competition in its space remains famously competitive. Freddie George, retail analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, says Dixons' results were \"marginally better than expected helped by a good performance in the UK\". Halfords also did slightly better than expected, George confirms, adding: The main feature in the figures was the strong results from cycling +19.5% helped by relatively easy comparatives and good performances in accessories and children\u2019s bicycles. Looks like womens' clothing retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 did well at Christmas too - it grew its like-for-like sales by 6% in the five weeks to 28 December. Dixons Retail shares have dropped 3% in early trading, though, despite today's decent results (a record-breaking day on Boxing Day and increased market share, apparently). Traders may be concerned by the company's cautious outlook, with the CEO warning that the UK recovery is 'fledgling'. Home Retail shares are also rising this morning, up nearly 3% as investors welcome the 3.8% jump in sales at Argos. Terry Duddy's bullish talk on this morning's conference call (saying they beat Dixons in the electrical market) can't have hurt. The City likes the look of Halfords' trading update - its share have jumped 6.3% this morning, to the top of the FTSE 250 leaderboard. The search for a Christmas loser today goes on -- it 's not online grocer Ocado, though, which reported gross sales growth of 21.3% over the last six weeks. Ocado says it saw \" strong trading in the seven days up to Christmas\". Gross takings in the six weeks to January 4 rose to \u00a3111.1m, from \u00a391.6m a year earlier. Chief executive Tim Steiner gave a classic cautiously optimistic quote: \"While we are encouraged by this current trading, the retail environment remains both challenging and competitive, with consumer sentiment subdued, and we expect to continue growing broadly in line with, or slightly ahead of, the market,\" Ocado's performance underlines the importance of the web to retailers today -- as Morrisons has found to its cost (it shocked the City last week with a 5.7% drop in sales over Christmas). Even chocolate maker Thorntons, which has struggled badly in recent years, says Christmas went well. Total sales rose 6.3%, mainly due to a better performance by its Commercial sales arm (which sells chocolate to other retailers). It posted \"a good Christmas performance\", with turnover up 21%. Thorntons retail sales fell by 2.9%, though -- due to 36 stores closuring during 2013 as Thorntons cut back. At the risk of tantalising your taste buds, here's what did well: \ufeffCustomer response to our new seasonal lines, in particular our Advent calendars and our Snowman licensed range, exceeded our expectations. We also saw good growth in our core boxed chocolate ranges, notably through our refreshed Classics selections. Discount clothing Primark also performed pretty well over Christmas, according to its parent company Associated British Foods. After being hit by warm weather in early autumn, meaning less demand for winter clothes, Primark picked up as 2013 drew to a close and enjoyed \"excellent\" Christmas trading. Reporting results for the 16 weeks to January 4, ABF said Primark will post higher profits in this year than last year, as its international expansion continues. It opened a store in France recently, and is aiming to open more stores this year in France, Germany and Spain, flags up Reuters. Bikes-to-cars company Halfords says it also did well at Christmas, with like-for-like sales up 5.2% across the company. Its cycling division was a soaraway performed, with sales up almost 20% in the 15 weeks to January 4. CEO Matt Davies said the robust performance was partly due to \"a period of comparatively mild weather\". In which case, you'd fear that cycling sales will tail off - until the British weather improves (perhaps Halfords could branch out into canoes). But bad weather is good news for Halfords car division -- which suffered \"subdued demand for parts and winter products\" during the trading period. Argos owner Home Retail just held a conference call with city hacks to discuss today's decent results, and declared that it had outperformed Dixons for electrical goods sales over Christmas: My colleague Sean Farrell tweets the key points from the departing CEO, Terry Duddy: Dixons and Argos have both defied the doomsayers who reckoned they'd be crushed by the rise of e-commerce rivals, tweets Sky's Joel Hills: Another high street name, Argos, pulled off a decent Christmas too -- thanks to strong sales over the web and mobile. And as a reward, the boss gets to run its parent company. Home Retail Group reported that like-for-like sales at Argos stores increased 3.8% in the 18 weeks to 4 January -- driven partly by demand for tablet computers and computer games. The firm also reported that sales over the internet make up almost half of Argos\u2019s sales, and told City analysts that profits will hit the high end of their forecasts. Before handing the reins to Argos chief John Walden, the outgoing CEO Terry Duddy said the company was making good progress in the digital space -- with one in five orders now placed on a mobile: We are pleased that both Argos and Homebase have delivered another period of good trading performance despite a challenging consumer environment. This growth was supported by a strong performance in mobile commerce sales which represented 20% of total Argos sales in the period. This gives further reinforcement to our plan for Argos to become a digital retail leader. There's a swathe of UK retailers reporting results this morning, sending my terminal flashing like a set of Christmas lights. Dixons looks like one of the best -- it has reported that it won market share from rivals after the particularly strong post Christmas sale period. Like-for-like sales across the UK &amp; Ireland jumped by 5%, from 1 November 2013 to 4 January 2014, which certainly beats some of the results we've seen recently. The electrical retailer, which has endured a few tough years since the financial crisis kicked off, declared that it had enjoyed \"a particularly strong post Christmas sale period\". Chief executive Sebastian James reported that Dixons had experienced: \"a lively Christmas with plenty of ups and downs\". Boxing Day was the biggest in Dixons' UK history with more than \u00a3100,000 flowing through its tills every minute, said James, who also declared that staff on its Knowhow division had: performed minor miracles in delivering and installing all these new purchases through some, to say the least, very wild weather. Apparently it was: James warned, thought, that: These are good numbers, but I am mindful that what recovery there is in the UK is still fledgling, and we continue to plan accordingly. The company also operates in Greece -- where like-for-like sales tumbled by 8% as its recession continued. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and the business world. It's a busy day, so let's get up to speed with the latest car sales figures -- and they suggest that Europe's battered auto industry is recovering after a grim year. ACEA, the industry body, reported that December showed the biggest jump in car sales since 2009, before the eurozone debt crisis exploded. Sales were 13% higher than a year earlier, making December the fourth month in a row where car sales rose on an annual basis. As these charts shows, the industry may finally be clawing its way back: However, auto makers and vendors have little excuse to hang out the bunting. Today's figures also show that car sales fell by 1.7% through 2013 across Europe, meaning six consecutive years of decline. A total of 11,850, 905 new cars were sold during the year, which ACEA says is \"the worst ever\" since it began counting in 2003. But December's figures do give some cause for comfort. All the major EU markets posted growth; sales were up +1.4% in Italy, +5.4% in Germany, +9.4% in France, +18.2% in Spain and +23.8% in the UK. Britain, we learned last week, outperformed the rest of Europe last year, with sales jumping over 10% -- partly due to easy credit, of course. Other markets struggled: Spain posted a +3.3% rise in sales (thanks to several scrappage schemes), but they fell by 4.2% in Germany, 5.7% in France, and 7.1% in Italy. Also coming up today.... on the economics front, new inflation data from the US and the eurozone will be published, a day after IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned of the risk of deflation. And lots of UK retailers are issuing trading updates. Let's find out who won and lost over Christmas....",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs is devising ways to hand its highly-paid bankers a third element to pay in response to the EU's bonus cap. As it began telling its 32,900 staff \u2013 who on average received pay of $383,000 (\u00a3233,000) in 2013 \u2013 about the size of their bonuses, it delayed informing the 6,000 staff in Europe, the Middle East and Africa about their salaries for 2014. The decision was made while the Wall Street bank irons out its plans to make additional payments in cash and shares to those bankers who fall under the restrictions of the bonus cap, which prevents bonuses of more than 100% of salary being paid out, unless shareholders specifically approve 200%. As a result of the cap, banks such as Barclays and HSBC are preparing to make additional awards of shares to staff which do not count as salary or bonuses. Only Goldman's European operations are affected by the cap which will affect bonuses being handed out this time next year. The size of the average pay for the Goldman staff put a fresh focus on City pay at a time when Labour has put the bonus cap on the agenda by calling on the government to prevent Royal Bank of Scotland from paying out bonuses of 200% of salary. Goldman's profits for the year rose by 5% to $8bn after profits in the fourth quarter fell 21% to $2.2bn and after it made provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $561m, more than double the $260m of a year ago. It was the worse year for bond trading since 2005 and during what Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman, described as a \"somewhat challenging year\". This was seized upon by the Robin Hood tax campaign. \"Bank bonus season has got off to a bad start when Goldman Sachs is doling out such colossal rewards in what's supposed to be a 'challenging environment'. With other banks due to report in coming weeks it's a timely reminder the government should stop sticking up for City fat cat pay and do more to bring banks back under control,\" the campaigners said. In a conference call with analysts, Harvey Schwartz, chief financial officer, said 2013 had been a year of \"two steps forward and one step back\" for the economy. The average pay per head was down on the $400,000 paid last year and the overall pay of $12.6bn was down 3% year-on-year. The closely watched ratio of pay to revenue \u2013 which provides an indicator of the largesse lavished on staff \u2013 was down slightly to 36.9%, compared with 37.9% for 2012. In remarks that may indicate the firm is expecting a strong start to the new year, Goldman said its backlog of investment transactions at the end of the year had \"increased significantly\" compared with 2012.",

N Brown also benefited from shoppers' increasing confidence in online retailer's ability to deliver close to Christmas and strong sales of party dresses and novelty Christmas jumpers. The retailer sold more than 2m Christmas-themed sweaters. Profit margins slipped slightly as N Brown was forced to compete with discounting across the high street but the retailer said it still expected to meet profit forecasts.",

      "bodyText": "RWE, one of Britain's biggest renewable energy investors, is planning to significantly scale back its spending in the UK and expects to sell off wind farms and a major biomass plant. Employees, local communities and regional councils are to be offered stakes in RWE projects as the company retreats in the face of its own huge debts, a plunging share price, and uncertain government policies. RWE, whose npower retail arm is one of the UK's big six power suppliers, has already shelved what would have been one of the world's largest offshore wind farms, the Atlantic Array, among other businesses. Paul Coffey, the chief operating officer of RWE npower Renewables, said his company was still committed to a pipeline of green power projects in Britain but admitted the era of his German-owned company taking majority stakes in future big offshore wind farms was probably over. RWE is already considering whether to reduce its involvement in the proposed Galloper offshore wind farm off the Suffolk coast from 50% to 25% and said this sort of move was likely to become more common. \"I would never say never ... (but) there are more drivers to taking smaller stakes rather than larger ones,\" he said, adding that the company was now focusing on \"value not volume\". The RWE executive, whose firm already owns major offshore wind farms such as Greater Gabbard and Gwynt y Mor, was unwilling to spell out the exact scale of the spending cuts, saying they would be made public on 4 March when the global renewable energy business - RWE Innogy - gives its annual briefing. Last year, RWE announced it would be halving the group's overall clean-tech spending planned for 2014 from \u20ac1bn (\u00a3830m) to \u20ac500m and the new figure for this year will be lower still. In 2013, \u00a3500m of the total spend went to the UK but the figure is expected to fall to around \u00a3300m now, some believe. The parent group is suffering under debts of \u20ac30bn on the back of plunging European electricity prices and the German government's decision to force the early closure of local nuclear power stations. RWE admitted that continuing uncertainty and problems with the UK government's much-delayed Electricity Market Reform programme was also influencing the spending cutbacks. Julia Lynch Williams, the UK managing director of RWE npower Renewables, who sits on a host of government working groups, said the electricity market reform programme \"has got to be concluded soon\" but also stressed that \"we need some improvements\" to its provisions. Meanwhile, the company expects to sell half of its 700MW of onshore wind development pipeline in the next few years and is considering an option to sell its \u00a3200m Markinch biomass plant in Fife, Scotland, which is just about to come online. It is claimed to be the largest biomass combined heat and power plant in the UK. RWE has already shut down a coal-fired plant that it developed into biomass at Tilbury on the Thames due to a lack of expected government financial support. The utility has also disposed of a \u00a3218m stake in a power supply business, its \u00a3350m stake in the Horizon nuclear power venture, and is searching for a buyer for its DEA oil exploration arm, operator of 13 productive gasfields in the North Sea. The company says it wants to move further to a \"capital light\" position where it is bringing in a range of outside investors and partners to help with its many schemes. RWE has already undertaken trials in Germany of selling stakes in the J\u00fcchen onshore wind project, located in North Rhine-Westphalia, to its own staff and even local authorities. RWE says these intiatives can be quite complicated but may be followed in the UK. It is already exploring partnerships with community ownership in relation to new onshore wind farms in Wales and Scotland on Forestry Commission sites. \"It's certainly of interest to us,\" said RWE npower Renewables' Lynch Williams. \"We want to be a trusted partner,\" said Coffey, whose business is dropping the \"npower\" part of the name - something he insists is unassociated with that particular business's image problems. In December, npower agreed to pay \u00a33.5m to help vulnerable customers as a punishment imposed by the regulator for misleading consumers considering switching their energy provider.",

Early expectations had been high for a bonanza at Christmas, given the recovering economy and growing consumer confidence.

The bank set aside $2.19bn in the quarter ending December 31 to compensate employees, up 11% from a year earlier but down 8.1% from the previous quarter.

Goldman's fixed-income, currencies and commodities business posted revenue of $8.65bn, down 13% from last year and the worst year for bond trading since 2005. In remarks that may indicate the firm is expecting a strong start to the new year, Goldman said its backlog of investment transactions at the end of the year had \"increased significantly\" compared with 2012. But Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive of Goldman, said that last year had been challenging. \"Our work in advancing our client franchise and in ensuring continued cost discipline has allowed us to provide solid returns even in a somewhat challenging environment,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley's Sports Direct empire has ratcheted up the pressure on Debenhams' boardroom by gaining control of up to 6.6% of the department store group's shares via a complex financial instrument. The retailer sold the 4.6% stake in Debenhams it acquired less than a week ago \u2013 netting a likely profit of around \u00a35m \u2013 and ploughed a new investment into a complex option arrangement which could give the sports retailer influence over 6.6% of the department store chain.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The large and growing income gap between rich and poor is the biggest risk to the global community in the next decade, the World Economic Forum said on Thursday as politicians, business leaders and academics prepared to gather in Davos. Reflecting mounting concern about the risk to societies from inequality, the WEF said the need to tackle disparities in income and wealth had to be addressed at WEF's annual gathering in the Swiss ski resort of Davos next week. The WEF said its annual survey of 700 opinion formers had identified the income gap, extreme weather events and unemployment or underemployment as the three threats most likely to cause major cross-border damage in the next 10 years. It added that a fresh fiscal crisis, climate change and water shortages were the three risks that would have the biggest impact on the global community, although these were seen as less likely. Jennifer Blanke, the WEF's chief economist, said that although incomes gap between countries had been narrowing, the gulf between rich and poor had widened within countries. \"The message from the Arab spring, and from countries such as Brazil and South Africa is that people are not going to stand for it any more.\" The Davos meeting has often been targeted by anti-globalisation campaigners for being an exclusive club for a small, powerful elite but Adrian Monck, the WEF's head of communications, said inequality and the wealth gap was on the agenda. \"We need to mobilise people around these issues and make people aware of them\", he said. Philip Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, said: \"The report should act as a wake-up call to the influencers and leaders at Davos next week. These are global issues we can do something about: we can twist the global economy back into shape \u2013 this includes a new commitment to create jobs, address income inequality and falling living standards. Since the global financial crisis it's been a race to the bottom in jobs, wages and living standards.\" The report also highlighted the problems of \"generation lost\" and said the world's increasing reliance on the internet had resulted in a threat of \"cybergeddon\". The study, Global Risks 2014, said the generation coming of age in the 2010s faced high unemployment and job insecurity, hindering their efforts to build a future and raising the risk of social unrest. Noting that many young people faced an uphill battle, David Cole, group chief risk officer of Swiss Re, one of the companies behind the report, said: \"The members of generation lost are not lost because they have tuned out. They are highly tuned in. They are lost because they are being left out or they are deciding to leave.\" He added: \"As a result of the financial crisis and globalisation, the younger generation in the mature markets struggle with ever fewer job opportunities and the need to support an ageing population. While in the emerging markets there are more jobs to be had, the workforce does not yet possess the broad-based skill sets necessary to satisfy demand.\" The WEF said the huge expansion of the internet made the risk of systemic failure greater than ever, but revelations about government surveillance had reduced countries' willingness to work together to address potential weaknesses. It added that the effect could be a Balkanisation of the internet, or so-called cybergeddon, where hackers enjoy overwhelming superiority and massive disruption is commonplace. Axel Lehmann, chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said: \"Trust in the internet was decreasing as a result of data misuse, hacking and privacy intrusion. A fragmentation of the internet is the wrong way to solve this issue, as it would destroy the benefits the web provides to all of us. Rather than building walled gardens, it is time to act by setting up security standards and regaining trust.\"",

      "body": "<p>The large and growing income gap between rich and poor is the biggest risk to the global community in the next decade, the World Economic Forum said on Thursday as politicians, business leaders and academics prepared to gather in Davos.</p> <p>Reflecting mounting concern about the risk to societies from inequality, the WEF said the need to tackle disparities in income and wealth had to be addressed at WEF's annual gathering in the Swiss ski resort of Davos next week.</p> <p>The WEF said its annual survey of 700 opinion formers had identified the income gap, extreme weather events and unemployment or underemployment as the three threats most likely to cause major cross-border damage in the next 10 years.</p> <p>It added that a fresh fiscal crisis, climate change and water shortages were the three risks that would have the biggest impact on the global community, although these were seen as less likely.</p> <p>Jennifer Blanke, the WEF's chief economist, said that although incomes gap between countries had been narrowing, the gulf between rich and poor had widened within countries. \"The message from the Arab spring, and from countries such as Brazil and South Africa is that people are not going to stand for it any more.\"</p> <p>The Davos meeting has often been targeted by anti-globalisation campaigners for being an exclusive club for a small, powerful elite but Adrian Monck, the WEF's head of communications, said inequality and the wealth gap was on the agenda. \"We need to mobilise people around these issues and make people aware of them\", he said.</p> <p>Philip Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, said: \"The report should act as a wake-up call to the influencers and leaders at Davos next week. These are global issues we can do something about: we can twist the global economy back into shape \u2013 this includes a new commitment to create jobs, address income inequality and falling living standards. Since the global financial crisis it's been a race to the bottom in jobs, wages and living standards.\"</p> <p>The report also highlighted the problems of \"generation lost\" and said the world's increasing reliance on the internet had resulted in a threat of \"cybergeddon\".</p> <p>The study, Global Risks 2014, said the generation coming of age in the 2010s faced high unemployment and job insecurity, hindering their efforts to build a future and raising the risk of social unrest.</p> <p>Noting that many young people faced an uphill battle, David Cole, group chief risk officer of Swiss Re, one of the companies behind the report, said: \"The members of generation lost are not lost because they have tuned out. They are highly tuned in. They are lost because they are being left out or they are deciding to leave.\"</p> <p>He added: \"As a result of the financial crisis and globalisation, the younger generation in the mature markets struggle with ever fewer job opportunities and the need to support an ageing population. While in the emerging markets there are more jobs to be had, the workforce does not yet possess the broad-based skill sets necessary to satisfy demand.\"</p> <p>The WEF said the huge expansion of the internet made the risk of systemic failure greater than ever, but revelations about government surveillance had reduced countries' willingness to work together to address potential weaknesses. It added that the effect could be a Balkanisation of the internet, or so-called cybergeddon, where hackers enjoy overwhelming superiority and massive disruption is commonplace.</p> <p>Axel Lehmann, chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Group, said: \"Trust in the internet was decreasing as a result of data misuse, hacking and privacy intrusion. A fragmentation of the internet is the wrong way to solve this issue, as it would destroy the benefits the web provides to all of us. Rather than building walled gardens, it is time to act by setting up security standards and regaining trust.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Argos and Dixons have emerged as winners from the Christmas battle of Britain's retailers, as booming online orders drove sales. Sales at Argos stores open a year or more rose 3.8% to \u00a31.8bn in the trading period covering Christmas while equivalent sales at Dixons in the UK and Ireland jumped 5%. Argos is owned by Home Retail Group, which also owns Homebase while Dixons trades on the high street through Currys and PC World. Both groups said online sales were a big part of their success. Business over the internet made up almost half of Argos's sales as shoppers made more purchases using tablet computers and mobile phones. At their peak, sales using tablets and phones were almost 30% of Argos's business. Sales of tablets were strong while demand for video games consoles often outstripped Argos's ability to supply the goods. Both businesses were written off as dinosaurs a few years ago but have revived themselves by homing in on internet shopping. Argos had its best Christmas trading for more than 10 years as customers ordered online and picked up goods in shops. Terry Duddy, Home Retail's chief executive, said: \"Customers are looking for strong availability instore for must-have gifts, particularly tablets and video games. They want those products with absolute immediacy.\" Tablet sales boomed at Dixons along with demand for large televisions and kitchen gadgets. After a frantic period around \"Black Friday\" sales at the end of November, business quietened down but \"took off like a rocket\" from Boxing Day when Dixons took \u00a3100,000 a minute, chief executive Seb James said. \"This has been a lively Christmas with plenty of ups and downs and I am pleased to report that we have turned in a good performance,\" he said. But he warned that business would be more moderate for the rest of the financial year. Consumers squeezed by falling real incomes are expected to tighten their belts to recover from Christmas. \"These are good numbers, but I am mindful that what recovery there is in the UK is still fledgling,\" James said. Internet sales have helped mark out retail's winners and losers over the crucial Christmas trading period. Next was able to withstand pressure to reduce prices because of its top-notch internet operation while Debenhams, which is weak online, resorted to a failed strategy of aggressive promotions. Morrisons blamed its lack of online capability partly for the worst performance of Britain's big supermarkets. On a busy day for retail news, a string of other companies announced strong Christmas trading including Associated British Foods, which owns Primark, Halfords and online grocer Ocado, which started delivering for Morrisons this week. Primark had \"excellent\" Christmas sales with strong performance at established stores, Associated British Foods said. Sales at Ocado jumped 21% in the six weeks to 6 January but like Dixons, the company warned that the market is tough with \"consumer sentiment subdued\". Like-for-like sales at Halfords were up 5.2% in the 15 weeks to 10 January as the bike and car accessories seller gained from the boom in bicycle sales, which were up by almost 20%.",

After a frantic period around \"Black Friday\" sales at the end of November, business quietened down but \"took off like a rocket\" from Boxing Day when Dixons took \u00a3100,000 a minute, chief executive Seb James said.</p> <p>\"This has been a lively Christmas with plenty of ups and downs and I am pleased to report that we have turned in a good performance,\" he said.</p> <p>But he warned that business would be more moderate for the rest of the financial year. Consumers squeezed by falling real incomes are expected to tighten their belts to recover from Christmas.</p> <p>\"These are good numbers, but I am mindful that what recovery there is in the UK is still fledgling,\" James said.</p> <p>Internet sales have helped mark out retail's winners and losers over the crucial Christmas trading period. Next was able to withstand pressure to reduce prices because of its top-notch internet operation while Debenhams, which is weak online, resorted to a failed strategy of aggressive promotions. Morrisons blamed its lack of online capability partly for the worst performance of Britain's big supermarkets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/jan/16/european-car-sales-dixons-argos-christmas-trading-business-live\" title=\"\">On a busy day for retail news, a string of other companies announced strong Christmas trading</a> including Associated British Foods, which owns Primark, Halfords and online grocer Ocado, which started delivering for Morrisons this week.</p> <p>Primark had \"excellent\" Christmas sales with strong performance at established stores, Associated British Foods said. Sales at Ocado jumped 21% in the six weeks to 6 January but like Dixons, the company warned that the market is tough with \"consumer sentiment subdued\".</p> <p>Like-for-like sales at Halfords were up 5.2% in the 15 weeks to 10 January as the bike and car accessories seller gained from the boom in bicycle sales, which were up by almost 20%.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The skills shortage in Australia has long been a topic in economic and political circles. It was even part of the Hawke government\u2019s agenda back<a href=\"http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F1987-09-14%2F0017%22\"> in 1987</a>. In the past few years much of the debate has centred on the need for migrant workers to come to Australia to fill the gap. In 2012 there was great discussion when the Gillard government amended the rules governing<a href=\"http://www.businessspectator.com.au/article/2012/5/28/national-affairs/gillards-mining-jobs-mystery\"> enterprise migration agreements</a>.</p> <p>This week the Australian Industry Group released<a href=\"http://www.aigroup.com.au/portal/site/aig/template.MAXIMIZE/home/?javax.portlet.tpst=45d3ff6ff99c77712aec2f100141a0a0_ws_MX&amp;javax.portlet.prp_45d3ff6ff99c77712aec2f100141a0a0=index%3D0%26docName%3DBoost%2Bto%2Bimmigration%2Blevels%2Bneeded%2Bto%2Bmeet%2Bsk\"> its submission</a> to the government on boosting the immigration intake by 30,000 a year to \u201cmeet skills shortages\u201d.</p> <p>While there is nothing too unexceptional about such a submission, Aig\u2019s logic left a bit to be desired. The submission had the air of a cut-and-paste job from 2007 as it noted the big cause of the skill shortage would be from the mining boom.</p> <p>As has been noted often<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/jun/07/boom-is-dead-long-live\"> on this blog</a> and by the<a href=\"http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/features/mining-boom-continues-as-industry-shifts-phase\"> mining industry itself</a>, the next phase of the mining boom will be about ramping up production and exports but will not see the same level of employment. Essentially this is because exporting iron ore and other minerals doesn\u2019t require as much labour as it does to build a mine in the first place.</p> <p>But Aig\u2019s submission suggests:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>...the flow of skilled workers into the mining industry from construction and industrial sectors will continue as mining moves from its current investment and expansion phase into a very strong period of growth in output and exports.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well it might continue, but in no way is it expected to continue as it did when the mining boom began in the early 2000s and then again in 2010:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/5cSAK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"&lt;iframe%20src=&quot;http:/cf.datawrapper.de/5cSAK/1/&quot;%20frameborder=&quot;0&quot;%20allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;%20allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;%20webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot;%20mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot;%20oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot;%20msallowfullscreen=&quot;msallowfullscre\">Click here for the graph on mobile</a></p> <p>Since the middle of 2012, employment in mining has barely grown, and certainly isn\u2019t causing a massive drag of workers from other industries.</p> <p>Aig also notes that the upturn in the housing construction market will continue to expand and that \u201cwill in turn lead to further skilled trade shortages. This will be exacerbated by the flow of construction workers into the mining sector and reduced trades apprenticeship numbers in recent years\u201d.</p> <p>Now there are signs of renewed growth in housing construction, but the concern for all policy makers is whether it will be able to replace the decline in construction in the mining sector. At present unless building construction gets a big almighty kick along, the slow-down in engineering construction predominantly from the mining industry is unlikely to cause increased demand for skills in that area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/8NbRe/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"&lt;iframe%20src=&quot;http:/cf.datawrapper.de/8NbRe/1/&quot;%20frameborder=&quot;0&quot;%20allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;%20allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;%20webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;webkitallowfullscreen&quot;%20mozallowfullscreen=&quot;mozallowfullscreen&quot;%20oallowfullscreen=&quot;oallowfullscreen&quot;\">Click here for the graph on mobile</a></p> <p>And even ignoring the suggestion that jobs are flowing to the mining industry, the Aig line about reduced trades apprenticeships also jars with reality.

      "bodyText": "The skills shortage in Australia has long been a topic in economic and political circles. It was even part of the Hawke government\u2019s agenda back in 1987. In the past few years much of the debate has centred on the need for migrant workers to come to Australia to fill the gap. In 2012 there was great discussion when the Gillard government amended the rules governing enterprise migration agreements. This week the Australian Industry Group released its submission to the government on boosting the immigration intake by 30,000 a year to \u201cmeet skills shortages\u201d. While there is nothing too unexceptional about such a submission, Aig\u2019s logic left a bit to be desired. The submission had the air of a cut-and-paste job from 2007 as it noted the big cause of the skill shortage would be from the mining boom. As has been noted often on this blog and by the mining industry itself, the next phase of the mining boom will be about ramping up production and exports but will not see the same level of employment. Essentially this is because exporting iron ore and other minerals doesn\u2019t require as much labour as it does to build a mine in the first place. But Aig\u2019s submission suggests: ...the flow of skilled workers into the mining industry from construction and industrial sectors will continue as mining moves from its current investment and expansion phase into a very strong period of growth in output and exports. Well it might continue, but in no way is it expected to continue as it did when the mining boom began in the early 2000s and then again in 2010: Click here for the graph on mobile Since the middle of 2012, employment in mining has barely grown, and certainly isn\u2019t causing a massive drag of workers from other industries. Aig also notes that the upturn in the housing construction market will continue to expand and that \u201cwill in turn lead to further skilled trade shortages. This will be exacerbated by the flow of construction workers into the mining sector and reduced trades apprenticeship numbers in recent years\u201d. Now there are signs of renewed growth in housing construction, but the concern for all policy makers is whether it will be able to replace the decline in construction in the mining sector. At present unless building construction gets a big almighty kick along, the slow-down in engineering construction predominantly from the mining industry is unlikely to cause increased demand for skills in that area. Click here for the graph on mobile And even ignoring the suggestion that jobs are flowing to the mining industry, the Aig line about reduced trades apprenticeships also jars with reality. Figures released by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER) showed that in the September 2013 quarter, there were a record number of people commencing trades apprenticeships and traineeships. Click here for the graph on mobile Similarly Aig also suggests wages growth refers to its set of indices which \u201cshow relatively high wages growth despite weak real labour demand\u201d in the mining, construction and services sectors\u201d. This would imply that there is a skill shortage in these areas because if there is a shortage of skilled workers, employers need to offer higher wages than their competitors to attract the scarce skilled labour. And yet the data on wages by the ABS shows that wages growth in mining and construction have moderated over the past year as have wages in the professional, scientific and technical services industry. This contradicts the Aig\u2019s submission that there will also be skills shortages in this part of the service sector. Click here for the graph on mobile All three industries show wages growth or payment to workers in the past year down at the level experienced during the GFC. In the professional, scientific and technical services industry, annual wages growth is the lowest it has been since the ABS began collating data in 1997. There are, of course, numerous occupations in which there is a skills shortage.
