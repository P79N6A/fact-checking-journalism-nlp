      "bodyText": "And finally, over to Ian Traynor in Brussels to sum up tonight\u2019s news: Greece clinched a three-year bailout worth \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) after parliamentarians in Athens backed the deal, and Germany backed down on its opposition to the third rescue of the bankrupt country in five years. A meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels representing the country\u2019s main creditors agreed to launch the new bailout with \u20ac26bn being disbursed next week following six months of bitter recrimination that almost saw the country, under the leftwing government of Alexis Tsipras, becoming the first to exit the single currency. The meeting was upbeat about finalising the bailout terms after Tsipras, secured approval from MPs for a huge package of legislation on Friday morning. The vote committed the indebted country to radical economic and fiscal reforms needed to secure the rescue money. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister and critic of the proposed new deal, toned down his reservations at a meeting of his eurozone peers in Brussels several hours after the Athens vote. Over the past week, Berlin has consistently argued against being rushed into a new bailout, preferring to award Greece a new bridging loan to pay off a debt payment of \u20ac3.2bn due to the European Central Bank next week. But the temporary loans scenario was barely mentioned by finance ministers. \u201cThe past six months have been difficult. We have looked into the abyss,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. \u201cBut today the message of today\u2019s Eurogroup is loud and clear: on this basis, Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the Euro area.\u201d In an abrupt change of tone, the leaders paid tribute to Tsipras, who could only win the vote on the new bailout with the support of the opposition and by splitting his leftwing Syriza movement. It is now likely that Tsipras will call early elections and trigger a realignment of Greek politics...... More here: And that is a good moment to stop for the night. Thanks for reading and commenting, See you all next week. GW Tonight\u2019s deal faces a trio of major obstacles - one political, one economic, and one financial. The Wall Street Journal explains: Large-scale defections from Syriza party lawmakers during a parliamentary vote on the agreement Friday morning indicate that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipas may soon call new elections. That could once again delay the implementation of the austerity measures mandated by the deal as well as action by the other eurozone countries to lower Greece\u2019s debt load. At the same time, the steep budget cuts Greece has to implement in return for the new bailout are bound to cause more pain for its economy and citizens. The rescue program foresees a 2.3% contraction of Greece\u2019s gross domestic product this year, followed by a 1.3% decrease next year. The deal also expects that shareholders, junior creditors and senior bondholders in Greece\u2019s battered banks will take losses before the lenders will be recapitalized. That will likely cause further uncertainty for a financial sector already reeling from capital controls that are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker must be relieved that the threat of Greece leaving the eurozone on his watch has receded. Here\u2019s his reaction to tonight\u2019s agreement. The past six months have been difficult. They have tested the patience of policy-makers and they have tested the patience of our citizens even more. Together, we have looked into the abyss. But today, I am glad to say that all sides have respected their commitments,\u201d More reaction to tonight\u2019s agreement: Tonight\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t mean the third Greek bailout is totally \u201cin the bag\u201d. Some national parliaments need to give their approval - including Germany\u2019s Bundestag next week. But short of a major shock, the \u20ac86bn bailout package is finally a done deal, after nearly seven months of wrangling, deadlock and drama. So what are the key points of the deal? Well, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Athens and its creditors includes four key elements -- including some very stretching budget targets, unpopular economic reforms. including to pensions,, and sweeping changes to a banking sector that has been battered this year. Or, in the eurogroup\u2019s words: a medium-term target for a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP by 2018 to be achieved through fiscal reform an ambitious reform of the pension system key labour and product market reforms to open up the economy to investment and competition financial sector measures to safeguard its stability, including a recapitalisation of the banks and urgent steps to tackle the non-performing loan (NPL) problem in the banking sector There is also a new pledge to privatise Greek state assets, through a new controversial fund that is designed to raise up to \u20ac50bn. In return, Greece gets the promise of new measures to guarantee debt sustainability. Prime minister Tsipras has repeatedly hailed that commitment as a (rare) key victory. But Europe has not committed to actually cutting Greece\u2019s debt mountain. Instead, it argues that: debt sustainability can be achieved through a far-reaching and credible reform programme and additional debt related measures without nominal haircuts. In other words, by giving Greece longer to repay its existing loans and cutting the interest rates charged. Although ministers have also dangled a carrot: If necessary, the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, possible additional measures to ensure that Greece\u2019s gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level. And debt sustainability is vital, to get the IMF on board (as well as to help Greece). But after two Greek bailouts, the Fund hasn\u2019t yet committed to a third. First, it wants to see proof that Greece has implemented all the fiscal, structural and financial sector reforms on the table. Plus an agreement on possible debt relief to ensure debt sustainability. It could be a dramatic autumn..... The success of tonight\u2019s deal depends on Greece\u2019s willingness to embrace tough reforms, Tsakalotos added. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos must be cream-crackered this evening. He spent last night in the Athens parliament, as MPs argued over whether to approve the bailout programme. No sooner was that vote over than he was preparing for the eurogroup meeting, which began after lunch in Brussels. But he\u2019s still managed to raise the energy to speak with reporters tonight, and argue that tonight\u2019s deal can help Greece recover. Tsakalotos explained: \u201cIt takes Greece forward in the sense that the financial system should be much more stable from now onwards. There is a promise of recapitalisation of the banks, without any of the depositors having to bail in or anything to worry about.\u201d If you\u2019ve been following this crisis, you\u2019ll already know that Greece must implement sweeping economic changes in return for this third package of loans. The broad scope of the plan was agreed a month ago, at the summit of eurozone leaders. And as we reported earlier this week, the final deal includes \u201cmajor reforms of health, welfare, pensions and taxation systems, alongside more ambitious privatisation schemes.\u201d It also awards the troika decisive influence over reforms to Greece\u2019s banks, which have suffered major capital outflows this year, culminating in capital controls since late June. Some tweaks have been agreed tonight, but this story from Wednesday night still gives the picture: Sch\u00e4uble denies that the political instability in Greece could doom tonight\u2019s deal. He points out that prime minister Alexis Tsipras has fought hard to get MPs to approve it: (The Greek parliament gave its seal of approval to the deal early this morning - but Tsipras suffered a significant rebellion among his own MPs). Even Sch\u00e4uble, one of Greece\u2019s biggest critics, sounds optimistic tonight. Germany\u2019s finance minister tells reporters that he\u2019s confident that eurozone ministers can agree a \u201ccommon approach to Greek debt sustainability\u201din October, which would then bring the IMF on board. Wolfgang Schauble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, is briefing the press -- here\u2019s a livefeed. Eurozone finance ministers are racing to brief the press, and give their verdict on the Greek bailout deal reached tonight. France\u2019s Michel Sapin has hailed the deal, and applauded the determination shown by the Greek government to carry out reforms (after a shaky start). With delicious timing, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has just issued a statement welcoming the agreement between Greece and the rest of the eurozone. But she has also warned that \u201csignificant\u201d debt relief is needed before the IMF can join the bailout (as many countries, including Germany and Finland, demand). I\u2019m hopeful that the IMF will come on board in October, Dijsselbloem says. But he admits that this isn\u2019t guaranteed; it all depends on Greece\u2019s ability to implement the programme, and the eurozone\u2019s progress on debt sustainability. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference.... Dijsselbloem repeats that relations with the Athens government has improved in recent weeks. Greece has been \u2018very strong, very organised\u2019, he says, in a clear dig at their former finance minister. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, seeks details about how tonight\u2019s deal differs from the draft proposal drawn up this week. Jeroen Dijsselbloem confirms that tonight\u2019s statement includes an new, explicit commitment that bank depositors won\u2019t be bailed-in to help pay the cost of rescuing Greece\u2019s banks. Ministers added that commitment tonight because they want to avoid panic that savers could lose money. Onto questions. Are the eurogroup concerned by the political instability in Greece, and the prospect of a confidence vote next week? Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that the Athens parliament has approved the Greek bailout plan by a large majority, showing there is sufficient \u201cownership\u201d of the plan. But much of the majority comes from opposition parties, isn\u2019t that a worry? No, Dijsselbloem replies - it\u2019s an encouraging sign. Eurozone authorities are aiming to sign off Greece\u2019s first loan tranche, worth \u20ac26bn, next Wednesday (19th August). Then, \u20ac13bn will be handed over early on Thursday. That will cover repaying Greece\u2019s existing bridge loan (to meet July\u2019s funding needs) and its bond repayment due to the ECB on the 20th. Another \u20ac3bn will be disbursed during the autumn. A further \u20ac10bn of funds are being set aside to cover the cost of recapitalising Greece\u2019s banks. But that money won\u2019t be handed to Athens, says Klaus Regling, the head of the ESM. Instead, it will be retained in Luxembourg and handed over when requested. Greece\u2019s willingness to reform its pension system will be crucial to the IMF\u2019s decision on whether to take part in the bailout, Dijsselbloem adds. What about the thorny question of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s involvement in the bailout? Dijsselbloem says that it is essential that the IMF is involved. That could happen, he says, once the Fund is satisfied by the Greek reforms and the prospects of debt sustainability. Eurozone ministers have agreed to consider taking \u201cadditional measures\u201d to ensure Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem says. However, Athens will need to achieve a successful first review of the bailout programme first. And debt relief may not include haircuts on Greece\u2019s debt pile, he adds. The \u20ac86bn bailout includes a \u20ac25bn buffer to recapitalise the Greek banking sector. Tonight\u2019s deal also tackles issues in the Greek banking sector, Dijsselbloem says, to recapitalise lenders. And he reveals that senior bondholders could be bailed-in to help pay for the plan, although depositors will be protected. We have come to a positive conclusion tonight, says Jeroen Dijsselbloem at the start of the press conference. We have reached a political deal, and solved the last issues, he tells reporters in Brussels. That means Greece\u2019s third bailout, worth around 86 billion euros, is agreed! Dijsselbloem also pays tribute to the Greek government\u2019s recent efforts to help create the deal. Here\u2019s a livefeed of eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem announcing the result of tonight\u2019s meeting, starting any moment..... Belgium\u2019s finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, has told Reuters that the eurogroup have agreed to implement the Greek bailout plan that was drawn up this week, but with some \u201cadditional measures\u201d. Ian confirms that tonight\u2019s meeting has finished, so we should find out very soon what\u2019s been agreed. The newswires are reporting that the Eurogroup meeting on Greece has just ended...... It\u2019s a glamorous gig, covering the biggest financial crisis in generations..... From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor sums up the situation tonight: Greece is close to clinching a three-year bailout worth more than \u20ac85bn (\u00a360bn) after parliamentarians in Athens backed the deal and Germany sent conciliatory signals ahead of a crucial meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Representatives of Greece\u2019s main European creditors were generally upbeat about finalising the bailout terms after the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, secured approval from MPs for a huge package of legislation on Friday morning. The vote committed the indebted country to radical economic and fiscal reforms needed to secure the rescue money. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister and the main critic of the proposed new deal, toned down his reservations at a meeting of his eurozone peers in Brussels several hours after the Athens vote on Friday, voicing optimism that ministers would back a deal. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite confident that we can reach an agreement,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said. Over the past week, Berlin has consistently argued against being \u201crushed\u201d into a new bailout, preferring to award Greece a new bridging loan to pay off a debt payment of \u20ac3.2bn due to the European Central Bank next week. But the temporary loans scenario was barely mentioned by finance ministers as they arrived in Brussels, including the northern and east European eurozone members who have been reluctant to do a deal.... Here\u2019s Ian\u2019s full story: Ian\u2019s also heard that the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, gave an upbeat briefing to the assembled eurozone ministers: Here\u2019s a few more photos from inside the Eurogroup meeting: Eurozone finance ministers are getting closer to a deal on the Greek bailout. They\u2019ve just taken a short break, and are now hammering out a statement. Officials are briefing that the eurogroup could finish in a little over two hours time, at 10pm (9pm BST or 11pm in Athens). Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras may try and reinvent himself to win any forthcoming election, says our correspondent Helena Smith. New Greek elections could come as early as next month, if prime minister Alexis Tsipras calls and loses a confidence vote next week, writes Jon Henley. But Tsipras may well win in any new ballot. Here\u2019s more on what may be on the table: As the Eurogroup of finance minsters meet to discuss the third Greek bailout proposals, European markets ended the week on a downbeat note. Despite some measure of calm returning following the ructions caused by China devaluing its currency, investors remained nervous. Weaker than expected eurozone GDP data proved a drag on markets, although some positive US industrial production figures provided some support. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.59 points or 0.27% at 6550.74 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.27% to 10,985.14 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.61% lower at 4956.47 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.46% to 23,248.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.63% at 10,879.3 The Athens market lost 1.85% to 673.93 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 40 points or 0.24% higher. Meanwhile here is more from the interview with European Central Bank member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, in which he suggests the bank may allow Greek bonds to be accepted as collateral once the new bailout agreement is in place. Will the Governing Council of the ECB immediately reapply the waiver \u2013 i.e. the exemption under which the bonds of a country with a poor credit rating are accepted as collateral if the country is in a programme \u2013 once Greece\u2019s third programme is agreed? That would be an enormous help to Greece. The Governing Council has not yet discussed that. But it is not automatic? In order for a country to benefit from the waiver, a programme needs to be in place, and that programme needs to be functioning well. Once we have reached that point, we will discuss it in the Governing Council. But does the Governing Council not need to wait for the initial assessment by the creditors, which is scheduled for October? That is also relevant as regards the question of when Greece could benefit from the ECB\u2019s bond purchase \u2013 i.e. quantitative easing (QE) \u2013 programme. We could potentially act earlier. Greece\u2019s new programme contains a large number of \u201cprior actions\u201d. The question for the Governing Council will be whether these preliminary measures are sufficient to meet our criteria. Greek officials are saying the Euro Working Group went well and it recommended to the Eurogroup of finance ministers that the country receive \u20ac13bn immediately to cover its financing needs, with another \u20ac10bn to help support the banks. European Central Bank member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 has expressed optimism about the success of a third bailout deal for Greece. In an interview with B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung he said: This year has seen a lot of trust destroyed, and reforms have been reversed. That has been a real setback. But Greece can build on what it has achieved under the first two programmes, and the new memorandum of understanding has everything it needs to give the Greek economy considerable support. I would like to stress two things in this regard. First, we have the right mix as regards fiscal measures. Ambitious medium-term budgetary objectives have been set, without the economy being strangled in the short term. Second, there is a strong focus on structural reforms. Looking back, one could say that if there had been more focus on structural measures \u2013 such as the reform and opening-up of markets, improved tax collection and the fight against interest groups \u2013 from the start, that would have reduced the burden that adjustment placed on the most vulnerable in society and speeded up Greece\u2019s recovery. And in what could be seen as a dig at former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, he said: I am grateful for the good spirit and cooperation of the new Greek Finance Minister. On Greek banks he said it was not clear how much funding they would need: We believe that the recapitalisation of the Greek banks should take place as soon as possible. The banks\u2019 ability to grant credit is an important precondition for growth. However, first we need detailed information about the situation. For that reason, banking supervisors at the ECB have started a new asset quality review and stress test for Greece\u2019s four major banks. Those credit institutions were adequately capitalised , but they are now operating in an extremely difficult economic environment, and nonperforming loans are likely to increase in the next few years. It is quite clear, therefore, that the banks will require more capital. How much remains to be seen. He said any decision about lifting capital controls was not one for the ECB, but should not happen until the banks are recapitalised: It is a matter for the Greek government. As long as there is uncertainty regarding the future of Greece\u2019s banks, the government in Athens should tread very carefully. I do not see scope for substantially relaxing Greece\u2019s capital controls until it is clear how and when the banks will be recapitalised. He was also asked about whether the diverging views within the eurozone could ultimately lead to it breaking up: We have to be careful here, as that can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you talk about it, the more people think nationalistically again and stop trusting Europe \u2013 and when people do not trust Europe, Europe becomes part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. Europe has always thrived on the diversity of its models, ideas and cultures. We need to prevent economic divergence from becoming so large that it threatens the survival of the euro area. But diversity as such is not a bad thing; it also promotes best practices and competition. Away from the eurozone briefly, and US consumer confidence figures have come in weaker than expected. The University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary consumer sentiment index came in at 92.9 for August, down from a final reading of 93.1 for July and forecasts of a rise to 93.5. But other data was more positive for economic growth. Producer prices rose for the third month in a row in July while industrial output climbed at its strongest pace for eight months. I didn\u2019t spot Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, arriving at the Eurogroup meeting -- but he is there now. Tsakalotos can\u2019t have had much sleep, given he spent last night in the Athens parliament arguing over the bailout deal (the vote didn\u2019t end until after 10am local time). More photos from the meeting: That\u2019s it. The Eurogroup meeting is now underway, with most ministers expressing confidence that the third Greek bailout will be signed off today. Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb has now arrived at the eurogroup meeting, and told reporters that he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if a deal isn\u2019t reached to approve the Greek bailout deal today. There are some \u2018nitty gritty issues\u2019 to solve today, including the involvement of the IMF in the Greek bailout, the size of the first bailout programme, and the timing of the financing. Stubb adds that Finland is \u201cvery much\u201d aligned with German on the need to involve the International Monetary Fund -- and puts his finger on the problem: We should be honest and open that there is a bit of a Catch-22 to solve here. The IMF will be involved only with debt relief, and we want the IMF to be involved but we don\u2019t want debt relief. So some kind of solution will have to be found. That solution could be a declaration from the IMF, which also refers to debt relief, he adds. Slovakia\u2019s Peter Kazimir adds that Greece must fulfil its commitments before it can get any debt relief: Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, Peter Kazimir, tells reporters he agrees with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble just arrived, giving reporters a cheery smile and a few words in German. Sch\u00e4uble says he is confident that a deal will be reached today. But he also warns that the IMF must be involved in the new Greek bailout, otherwise Germany can\u2019t back the plan. The question of the IMF\u2019s involvement isn\u2019t clear, though, given that the Fund insists that Greece needs serious, and \u201cdramatic\u201d debt relief. European countries haven\u2019t made such bold commitments yet, and won\u2019t discuss debt relief in detail until October. As our financial editor Nils Pratley explains: There will....be heavy pressure from Germany to compromise and dilute the debt relief. It will be hard to get any bailout package through the German parliament but the task might be impossible if the IMF won\u2019t endorse it. Nevertheless, the IMF should stick to its guns. Greece needs serious debt relief, not token measures. It is about time that lenders accepted the economic reality that piecemeal measures are pointless when debt ratios reach 200%. Malta\u2019s Edward Scicluna is next to arrive -- he tells the press pack that he favours reprofiling Greece\u2019s debt (eg, extending payback dates) rather than a haircut on the face value. And do you expect a short meeting, or a long one? What I wish for, is that it\u2019s not too long, Scicluna smiles hopefully. Amen to that. Next up, Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg, who greets reporters in Brussels with a cheerful \u201cgood morning\u201d (?!). Sounding positive, Gramegna says Greece has made more progress in the last month than in the previous six months, and is hopeful that the bailout is approved today. Dijsselbloem then vanished into the building, swiftly followed by ECB president Mario Draghi (showing his usual skill at avoiding the press pack) Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has just arrived at today\u2019s extraordinary Eurogroup meeting. Like France\u2019s Michel Sapin, Dijsselbloem is looking tanned and cheerful. But he warns that today\u2019s meeting won\u2019t be short. Some ministers will have questions, and criticism, on some issues, he predicts, adding: Hopefully at the end of the evening we will have a positive outcome. What about debt sustainability? Debt sustainability is still a major point of concern, certainly for the IMF, Dijsselbloem replies. We will look at it closely in October. Hopefully we can make sure that it is sustainable by them, and make further guarantees if necessary, so that the IMF can come on board in October, because that\u2019s very important to all of us. IMF involvement is particularly important for Germany, of course..... Finnish finance minister Alex Stubb has dropped a hint that today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting will go smoothly: The EPP is the group of centre-right European political parties, so Stubb should be conferring with finance ministers from Germany, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. You can watch the eurozone finance ministers arriving for today\u2019s meeting here. And we\u2019re off! The first ministerial car has arrived in Brussels, and a suntanned looking French finance minister has got out. Michel Sapin told reporters that today\u2019s Eurogroup meeting follows \u201cvery important\u201d work by Greece and the institutions (the Europe Commission, European Central Bank, IMF and European Stability Mechanism). Our task today is to decide whether to approve the Greek deal, Sapin adds - the issue of debt reprofiling will be covered in the autumn (ie, not today). Jeroen Dijsselbloem will speak to the Brussels press in an hour\u2019s time, before the eurogroup meeting gets underway. This morning\u2019s weak eurozone growth figures have pushed stock markets into the red today. The main indices have all lost ground, as investors show disappointment at the slowdown in Germany and France. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A swathe of disappointing GDP figures from across the Eurozone led to a weaker than expected region-wide number this Friday morning. This merely served to compound the current lack of appetite for risk and caused the DAX and CAC to lose their tentative gains in the process. That could change this afternoon, however, dependent on how swift, and successful, the Eurogroup meeting is. The finance ministers are all on their way to Brussels, so sooner rather than later news should start leaking out about the sentiment of the group. Breaking away from the eurozone briefly, the British financial trader accused of helping trigger a multibillion-dollar US stock market crash has, finally, been granted bail. Westminster magistrates court has ruled that Navinder Singh Sarao should be released from custody, almost four months after being arrested and accused of sparking market turmoil in 2010. Sarao won\u2019t be allowed to leave the London area, though, reports my colleague Jennifer Rankin from court. He\u2019s fighting efforts to be extradited to the US to face charges. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem has welcomed the Greek parliament\u2019s vote today. Dijsselbloem, who will chair this afternoon\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, told reporters in The Hague that the current plan is the \u201cstrongest and most concrete\u201d agreed yet. Eurozone ministers will need to be confident, though, that Greece will meet its commitments, he added (via Reuters). Those ministers should start arriving in Brussels soon. Analysts at Capital Economics fear that the eurozone economy will continue to slow through 2015, and only grow by 1% during the year. They say: \u201cLooking ahead, business surveys suggest that the euro zone economy will continue to expand, led by strong growth in Spain and a solid German economy. But they offer little hope that the recovery will gain pace.\u201d \u201cIndeed, we think it is more likely that growth in the region as a whole will slow further in the second half of the year.\u201d Finland was the worst-performing member of the eurozone in the last quarter; the only country to suffer shrinking GDP. But it wasn\u2019t the only poor performer, with France stagnating, Austria and the Netherlands growing just 0.1%, and Italy at +0.2%. Here\u2019s the full details: The eurozone economy grew by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015, weaker than the 0.4% expected. That\u2019s not a surprise, after growth figures from Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands were all weaker than forecast (as covered earlier in today\u2019s blog). But it underlines that the eurozone recovery is nothing to shout about, particularly with the French economy dropping back into stagnation. In contrast, the UK economy grew by 0.7% during the second quarter of the year, while the US expanded by 0.6%. Readers who missed the all-night drama in the Greek parliament in favour of a good night\u2019s sleep can get a flavour from this video: Portugal has outperformed France and Italy, and matched Germany, with growth of 0.4% in the last three months. Today\u2019s vote was the third time that Greek MPs have been asked to approve the third bailout, and each time Alexis Tsipras\u2019s majority has been whittled away. Damian Mac Con Uladh of the Irish Times has been maintaining a spreadsheet showing how the rebellion has gathered pace. As you can see, seven previously loyal members decided to abstain today, leaving Tsipras reliant on opposition MPs to get the bailout approved. And that\u2019s why Greece could be heading into snap elections, unless some of these rebels return to the fold in a confidence vote. Eurozone finance ministers will soon be heading to Brussels for a eurogroup meeting, to sign off the \u20ac85bn Greek bailout deal. Finland\u2019s Alex Stubb is already on his way: Awfully pretty, and still stuck in a pretty awful recession. Italy has just provided further confirmation that the eurozone economy has underperformed in the last quarter. Italian GDP rose by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in April-June, below the 0.3% which had been expected. That\u2019s a quartet of disappointment. With Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands all missing expectations, it\u2019s very hard to see how the eurozone grew by the 0.4% which analysts expected. Back in Athens, Greek MPs are staggering into the daylight after their marathon session. It was touch-and-go at one stage, though. After the result was declared, speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou announced that the vote wasn\u2019t legally valid and should be rerun within 24 hours. The Netherlands economy has also missed expectations. Dutch GDP grew by just 0.1% in the last quarter, compared to estimates of 0.3%. The prospect of snap Greek elections this autumn will not please German MPs, who must give their approval to the deal next week: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jon Henley\u2019s latest news story on the bailout vote: Skai TV are reporting that Alexis Tsipras will call a vote of confidence sometime after August 20, which would lead to snap elections if he loses. And that\u2019s because the Greek PM has suffered a significant rebellion among his own MPs at today\u2019s vote. According to one calculation, just 118 government MPs voted to approve the bailout plan - below the 120 votes needed to maintain Tsipras\u2019s majority. Here\u2019s the voting details: Crisis-watcher Yannis Koutsomitis reckons the Greek government will just retain its majority in today\u2019s vote, but it will be close: It\u2019s official: a majority of Greek MPs have voted to back the third aid programme. But more government MPs are defying Alexis Tsipras and voting no -- meaning he could still lose his parliamentary majority. Halfway through the vote, and 105 Greek MPs have now voted Yes, with 32 voting No and five abstaining. The Greek parliament is on track to approve the third bailout deal, as the main opposition parties are supporting it: Yanis Varoufakis has stuck to his word and voted against accepting the third bailout plan. Other Syriza rebels are also voting \u2018No\u2019. Finally, Greek MPs are voting on whether to accept the third bailout. My colleague in Athens, Jon Henley, has watched the Greek bailout debate - and reports on the serious disunity on display: The Athens parliament did not start debating the 400-page taxt of the draft bailout plan until nearly 4am after parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, a Syriza hardliner, ignored Tsipras\u2019s request to speed up proceedings and instead raised a lengthy series of procedural questions and objections. In angry exchanges, the conservative opposition rounded on the government, warning it not to take its support for granted. \u201cIf you want to provoke us - and for us to vote for it - you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis told finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. On the left, former energy minister Panayiotis Lafazanis, who leads a rebel bloc of around a quarter of Syriza\u2019s 149 MPs, pledged to \u201csmash the eurozone dictatorship\u201d, while in her concluding pre-vote remarks, Konstantopoulou announced: \u201cI am not going to support the prime minister any more.\u201d Earlier, the government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, conceded divisions within the leftist party, which swept to victory in January\u2019s elections on a staunch anti-austerity platform, were now so deep that a formal split was probably inevitable. Tsipras could call fresh elections as early as next month. And here are some photos from the all-night session: There is no end to the economic gloom in Finland, where GDP has shrunk again. Reuters has the details: Finland\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 0.4% in the second quarter from the previous quarter, preliminary data from the statistics office showed on Friday. GDP fell 0.1% quarterly in the first quarter. Second-quarter GDP was 1.0% lower than the same period a year earlier. In June, output fell 0.9% compared with a year earlier, the statistics office said. The Finnish economy has contracted for three years in a row. More drama in the Athens parliament, as the all-night debate continues. Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has just intervened, telling the chamber that he cannot vote for the bailout deal. But he still supports the government, so suggests that he should resign as an MP to allow Tsipras to appoint a successor. Germany\u2019s latest growth figures are also weaker than expected. The eurozone\u2019s powerhouse economy grew by just 0.4% in April-June, slightly below the 0.5% which economists had forecast. That, plus France\u2019s disappointing figures, suggests growth in the eurozone will miss the 0.4% which the City expected. Back in Athens, Tsipras has warned MPs that they must give their approval to the bailout plan today - so Greece can get the money to repay the European Central Bank next week. France has got Eurozone GDP Day off to a bad start, by posting no growth in the last three months. France\u2019s economic output was unchanged in the April-June quarter, stats body INSEE just reported. That\u2019s weaker than the 0.2% which analysts had expected. Household spending slowed, while French firm continued to cut investment. On the positive side, exports grew by 1.7%. Alexis Tsipras is telling bleary-eyed Greek MPs that he doesn\u2019t regret the deal he agreed to in Brussels last month. Addressing parliament after the all-night session heads (finally) to a climax, Tsipras is insisting that he didn\u2019t have a mandate for Grexit: Good morning. Greece\u2019s bailout deal is heading down to the wire today, with Eurozone finance ministers due to sign off the plan today. But first, Greece needs to give its approve. And as I type, the country\u2019s MPs are still arguing over whether to back the plan, as the debate which began on Thursday evening drags into Friday morning. The fragile consensus between the major Greek parties appears to have unravelled overnight, with bitter exchanges between key players. Alexis Tsipras is on his feet now, telling MPs that the bailout agreement is a \u201cnecessary choice\u201d, so the vote may finally come soon. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet this afternoon in Brussels, to give their approval for the plan. They can also ponder the latest warning that Greece needs significant debt relief, with borrowing likely to peak at 201% of national output (GDP) in 2016. Also on the agenda today, we get growth figures from across the eurozone for the second quarter of 2015. France\u2019s data is coming out now, followed by Germany at 7am BST, The Netherlands at 8.30am, Italy at 9am, and the overall eurozone at 10am BST. I\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day.",

Some national parliaments need to give their approval - including Germany\u2019s Bundestag next week. </p> <p>But short of a major shock, the \u20ac86bn bailout package is finally a done deal, after nearly seven months of wrangling, deadlock and drama.</p> <p><strong>So what are the key points of the deal?</strong></p> <p>Well, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Athens and its creditors includes four key elements -- including some very stretching budget targets, unpopular economic reforms. including to pensions,, and sweeping changes to a banking sector that has been battered this year.</p> <p>Or, in the eurogroup\u2019s words:</p> <ul> <li>a medium-term target for a <strong>primary surplus</strong> of 3.5% of GDP by 2018 to be achieved through fiscal reform</li> <li>an ambitious <strong>reform of the pension system</strong></li> <li>key <strong>labour and product market reforms</strong> to open up the economy to investment and competition</li> <li><strong>financial sector</strong> measures to safeguard its stability, including a recapitalisation of the banks and urgent steps to tackle the non-performing loan (NPL) problem in the banking sector</li> </ul> <p>There is also a new pledge to privatise Greek state assets, through a new controversial fund that is designed to raise up to \u20ac50bn.</p> <p>In return, Greece gets the promise of new measures to guarantee debt sustainability. Prime minister Tsipras has repeatedly hailed that commitment as a (rare) key victory.</p> <p>But Europe has not committed to actually cutting Greece\u2019s debt mountain. Instead, it argues that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>debt sustainability can be achieved through a far-reaching and credible reform programme and additional debt related measures without nominal haircuts.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, by giving Greece longer to repay its existing loans and cutting the interest rates charged.</p> <p>Although ministers have also dangled a carrot:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If necessary, the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, possible additional measures to ensure that Greece\u2019s gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level.</p> </blockquote> <p>And debt sustainability is vital, to get the IMF on board (as well as to help Greece).</p> <p>But after two Greek bailouts, the Fund hasn\u2019t yet committed to a third. First, it wants to see proof that Greece has implemented all the fiscal, structural and financial sector reforms on the table.

That would be an enormous help to Greece.</strong></p> <p>The Governing Council has not yet discussed that.</p> <p><strong>But it is not automatic?</strong></p> <p>In order for a country to benefit from the waiver, a programme needs to be in place, and that programme needs to be functioning well. Once we have reached that point, we will discuss it in the Governing Council.</p> <p><strong>But does the Governing Council not need to wait for the initial assessment by the creditors, which is scheduled for October?

That has been a real setback. But Greece can build on what it has achieved under the first two programmes, and the new memorandum of understanding has everything it needs to give the Greek economy considerable support. I would like to stress two things in this regard. First, we have the right mix as regards fiscal measures. Ambitious medium-term budgetary objectives have been set, without the economy being strangled in the short term. Second, there is a strong focus on structural reforms. Looking back, one could say that if there had been more focus on structural measures \u2013 such as the reform and opening-up of markets, improved tax collection and the fight against interest groups \u2013 from the start, that would have reduced the burden that adjustment placed on the most vulnerable in society and speeded up Greece\u2019s recovery.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in what could be seen as a dig at former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am grateful for the good spirit and cooperation of the new Greek Finance Minister.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Greek banks he said it was not clear how much funding they would need:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe that the recapitalisation of the Greek banks should take place as soon as possible. The banks\u2019 ability to grant credit is an important precondition for growth. However, first we need detailed information about the situation. For that reason, banking supervisors at the ECB have started a new asset quality review and stress test for Greece\u2019s four major banks. Those credit institutions were adequately capitalised , but they are now operating in an extremely difficult economic environment, and nonperforming loans are likely to increase in the next few years. It is quite clear, therefore, that the banks will require more capital. How much remains to be seen.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said any decision about lifting capital controls was not one for the ECB, but should not happen until the banks are recapitalised:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a matter for the Greek government. As long as there is uncertainty regarding the future of Greece\u2019s banks, the government in Athens should tread very carefully. I do not see scope for substantially relaxing Greece\u2019s capital controls until it is clear how and when the banks will be recapitalised. </p> </blockquote> <p>He was also asked about whether the diverging views within the eurozone could ultimately lead to it breaking up:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have to be careful here, as that can quickly become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you talk about it, the more people think nationalistically again and stop trusting Europe \u2013 and when people do not trust Europe, Europe becomes part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. Europe has always thrived on the diversity of its models, ideas and cultures. We need to prevent economic divergence from becoming so large that it threatens the survival of the euro area. But diversity as such is not a bad thing; it also promotes best practices and competition.</p> </blockquote> <h2><br></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-14T16:24:53.010Z\">at 5.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55ce00d2e4b076bafa06f4ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-14T15:00:29.754Z\">4.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Away from the eurozone briefly, and US consumer confidence figures have come in weaker than expected</strong><em>.</em></p> <p>The University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary consumer sentiment index came in at 92.9 for August, down from a final reading of 93.1 for July and forecasts of a rise to 93.5.</p> <p>But other data was more positive for economic growth.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece clinched a three-year bailout worth \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) after parliamentarians in Athens backed the deal, and Germany backed down on its opposition to the third rescue of the bankrupt country in five years. A meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels representing the country\u2019s main creditors agreed to launch the new bailout with \u20ac26bn being disbursed next week following six months of bitter recrimination that almost saw the country, under the leftwing government of Alexis Tsipras, becoming the first to exit the single currency. The meeting was upbeat about finalising the bailout terms after Tsipras secured approval from MPs for a huge package of legislation on Friday morning. The vote committed the indebted country to radical economic and fiscal reforms needed to secure the rescue money. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister and critic of the proposed new deal, toned down his reservations at a meeting of his eurozone peers in Brussels several hours after the Athens vote. German MPs will vote on the agreement on Wednesday and are expected to approve it, although Angela Merkel could face an even bigger rebellion than the 65 politicians from her coalition who last month refused to back talks on a third bailout. Over the past week, Berlin has consistently argued against being rushed into a new bailout, preferring to award Greece a new bridging loan to pay off a debt payment of \u20ac3.2bn due to the European Central Bank next week. But the temporary loans scenario was barely mentioned by finance ministers. \u201cThe past six months have been difficult. We have looked into the abyss,\u201d said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. \u201cBut today the message of today\u2019s Eurogroup is loud and clear: on this basis, Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the Euro area.\u201d In an abrupt change of tone, the leaders paid tribute to Tsipras, who could only win the vote on the new bailout with the support of the opposition and by splitting his leftwing Syriza movement. It is now likely that Tsipras will call early elections and trigger a realignment of Greek politics. Instead of questioning the merits of the draft deal struck earlier this week between Greece and its troika of creditors \u2013 the European commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 the main problems raised on Friday concerned the issue of debt relief for Greece and whether or not the IMF would take part in the rescue. The IMF is refusing to participate in a new bailout until there is an \u201cexplicit and concrete agreement\u201d on debt relief from Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors. Christine Legarde, the IMF managing director, told the meeting that it hoped to take part in the bailout and that a decision would be made in October, but she could not commit. Sch\u00e4uble said IMF participation was \u201cindispensable\u201d. Greece needs to pay \u20ac3.7bn to its creditors next Thursday. The first \u20ac26bn will be released on Thursday morning, eurozone leaders said, although Greece would only see half of that immediately, since \u20ac10bn would be reserved in Luxembourg for Greek bank recapitalisation while a further \u20ac3bn would be disbursed over the next two months subject to Athens delivering on its pledges. The first of the troika\u2019s quarterly reviews of Greek progress in observing the strict terms of the deal is to take place in October. Depending on the results, the eurozone will then discuss rescheduling Greek debt amid a new consensus among the IMF, the ECB and the commission that the level of debt is unsustainable. But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said Greece\u2019s debt burden \u2013 and the problems of servicing it \u2013 would not become a major problem for almost 30 years. There is unlikely to be any direct writedown of nominal debt levels, but moves to reduce the debt could involve extending repayment schedules and lowering interest rates. Germany is the biggest and most formidable opponent of debt relief, but is also the loudest supporter of keeping the IMF on board. IMF involvement in the new bailout was a \u201cprecondition\u201d for Berlin, said Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cWe have to see that we can get a clear, possibly binding, commitment from the IMF ... We\u2019ve always said that has to be feasible. The IMF has its own rules, but we will have to find a way.\u201d An IMF statement supporting the new deal said it would reserve judgment on participation until October. \u201cThe IMF will make an assessment of its participation in providing any additional financing to Greece once the steps on the authorities\u2019 programme and debt relief have been taken,\u201d it said. On Thursday the IMF\u2019s call for debt relief was bolstered further when the European commission, the European Stability Mechanism \u2013 the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund \u2013 and the ECB raised concerns about the scale of the debt burden. However, the three European institutions opposed the idea of a so-called \u201chaircut\u201d, or reducing the size of the debt. The IMF has said a haircut might be necessary. Alexander Stubb, the Finnish finance minister, admitted that the debt relief issue was a problem that needed to be resolved. \u201cWe should be honest and open that there is a bit of a catch-22 to solve here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IMF will be involved only with debt relief, and we want the IMF to be involved but we don\u2019t want debt relief. So some kind of solution will have to be found.\u201d Speaking ahead of the parliamentary vote in Athens, the Greek prime minister urged MPs to accept the tough bailout terms. Tsipras said the rescue package was a necessary choice for the nation, saying it faced a battle to avert the threat of a bridge loan \u2013 which he called a return to \u201ccrisis without end\u201d \u2013 that Greece may be offered instead of a full-blown bailout. The terms for the bailout detail a radical overhaul of the Greek economy, stipulating major reforms of health, welfare, pensions and taxation systems, alongside more ambitious privatisation schemes. It also gives the troika decisive influence over reforms of the country\u2019s struggling banking sector.

      "bodyText": "At 17 Broad Street in Oxford, in the heart of the city\u2019s university district, there is a blue plaque on the wall to commemorate the \u201centrepreneur and philanthropist\u201d Cecil Jackson-Cole, who died in 1979. Jackson-Cole was the co-founder of the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, which is today known as Oxfam, one of the biggest charities in the world. The plaque is located on Broad Street because it was there, in 1947, where Jackson-Cole opened Britain\u2019s first charity shop. Oxfam was founded five years before the shop opened to help Greek citizens who were starving following an Allied blockade of the occupied country. However, the charity received so many donations of clothing and blankets that Jackson-Cole decided to open a shop to sell the leftover products and use the proceeds to fund extra aid for Greece. This was the first time a charity had opened a shop that was simply designed to raise funds for the parent organisation. The Oxfam at 17 Broad Street is still open, a testament to the success of Jackson-Cole\u2019s initiative. According to the Charity Retail Association, there are now 10,500 charity shops in the UK. However, Oxfam\u2019s latest figures reveal that charity shops are facing their greatest challenge to date: the rise of the discounters. In the year to the end of March, sales in Oxfam\u2019s 670 stores fell 3% to \u00a372.5m. The squeeze was caused by the double whammy of falling demand from shoppers and a fall in the quality and quantity of donations. The rise of discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark has played a role in both factors. Not only have they increased competition for charity shops, but the growing popularity of cut-price clothing means the quality of the garments in people\u2019s wardrobes is not what it was. So, when a household clears out its wardrobes, unwanted clothing is more likely to go in the bin than be taken to the charity shop. Oxfam said that donations fell by 2% last year. However, the charity\u2019s figures also show it made a loss on the sale of new products, an area that charity shops are moving into increasingly, selling food, gifts and homeware. Turnover for new goods was \u00a37.8m, but the direct retailing costs were \u00a38.5m, meaning a loss of \u00a3700,000. Andrew Horton, trading director at Oxfam, said: \u201cIt is not a crisis, but the way people shop on the high street has changed a bit. Discounters have had an impact on lots of the retail market. They have driven down perceptions of what customers should pay. But it is not a collapse in the market. We have had dips before and come back stronger.\u201d In response to the slowdown in sales, Oxfam is to trial six \u201csuper saver\u201d discount-style stores where donated books, fashion, and homewares will be set out under blocks of \u00a31, \u00a32 and \u00a33. Oxfam also plans to expand its online business, and spend \u00a313m on modernising its shops. \u201cWe have got to adapt to the changing retail marketing,\u201d Horton said. \u201cWe think our shops need to look better. The strategy is to grow our online business and capture some of the growth that other retailers have seen.\u201d However, some high street campaigners think charity shops should rein in their ambitions. Since the financial crisis, there has been a sharp increase in the number of charity shops on Britain\u2019s high streets. Research from Experian shows that the number of charity shops in Britain has grown by 36% since 2000. Also, the proportion of high street charity shops has grown by a fifth as traditional chains have collapsed or closed stores in response to a decline in consumer spending. East Anglia has emerged as the charity shop capital of the UK. There are 27 charity shops in the centre of both Colchester and Norwich, compared to 20 and 21 respectively in 2010. In the last year alone, an extra 64 charity shops were added to Britain\u2019s leading 500 town centres, the biggest increase of any retail sector according to accounting firm PwC and the Local Data Company. This is in stark contrast to the overall reduction in shops in Britain of 987 during the same period, running at almost three a day. The Charity Retail Association says that sales for the charity sector as a whole grew 2.7% last year, ahead of the overall sector, with the performance boosted by new store openings. According to Paul Turner-Mitchell, a high street campaigner, the main reason that charity shops have fared better than traditional chains is that they enjoy an 80% discount on business rates. Retailers have constantly pressed the chancellor to overhaul business rates, with the burden of the property tax increasing as online shopping siphons off sales and profits. Government figures show that the tax relief granted to properties occupied by charities has almost doubled since the 2006/2007 financial year from \u00a3760m to \u00a31.5bn. \u201cIt is distorted massively in their favour,\u201d Turner-Mitchell said of charity shops. \u201cYou can understand if they were being charities, but they are moving into replicating being a retailer. They are next to retailers like Argos and selling the same stuff, yet they have crippling overheads and charity shops don\u2019t. I think we need to look at the rates relief for charity shops. In the last decade it has increased massively.\u201d However, Horton insisted the tax relief for charities was justified, and that charity shops are vital in promoting the goals of the organisation. \u201cIt helps to lower our costs, but we are a charity. We are raising funds to help poor people,\u201d he said. \u201cShops give us tremendous exposure and keep us in touch with the British public.\u201d",

Bain ran the company for the last three years after taking over from Harriet Green, who left to take charge of Thomas Cook. Mark Whiteling, Premier\u2019s chief financial officer, has been appointed as interim chief executive until a permanent successor is found. Shares in the FTSE 250 company rose 1% to 135.9p on the news. The stock had plunged to a six-year low at the end of July when the electronic components specialist issued a profit warning, triggering speculation that it might become a takeover target. Sales have slowed sharply, particularly in North America and the UK, and the firm warned that operating profit in the first half would be 10% lower than in the same period last year. It was also hit by supply constraints, as shortages of components held back production of the credit card-sized Raspberry Pi, which costs about \u00a320 and is designed to get young people interested in computer programming. Premier, which was founded in Leeds in 1996, began a review of its operations in late July. It will reveal the outcome when it publishes half-year figures in September. Three years ago Premier signed a deal with Sony to manufacture the Raspberry Pi in the UK, at Sony\u2019s factory in Bridgend in Wales. The mini-computer was developed by the non-profit Raspberry Pi Foundation and until then had been manufactured in China. Val Gooding, Premier\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cDuring his time as CEO Laurence has led the company\u2019s transformation to a web-based business, developed a global operating model and management structure, and introduced an innovative and differentiating strategy. \u201cHowever, whilst these initiatives provide a solid platform for the future, the company\u2019s recent results have been disappointing and the board has concluded that the time is right for a change of leadership.\u201d A spokesman said Premier has been hit by weaker demand in North America and Europe along with the rest of the sector, including its main listed rival, Oxford-based Electrocomponents.",

The bank said: St James\u2019s Place remains a key pick \u2013 we see no change to the attractive combination of rapidly growing funds under management, rising dividend and lack of balance sheet exposure. Likely changes to taxation of UK pensions unlikely to pose a material threat. The Government is consulting on the future shape of tax relief for pensions, which is likely to reduce tax incentives for higher earners. However, in our view St James\u2019s Place is well placed to respond given its range of tax wrappers.

      "bodyText": "It has been a tough year for China. Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s plan to have slower but better balanced growth has run into difficulties and Beijing\u2019s struggle to transform its economic model has prompted fears that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy could be the source of the next global downturn. Here are five warning signs that have set seasoned China watchers worrying that what started out as an exercise in rebalancing and controlled liberalisation might result in a hard landing. 1. Growth On the face of it, China has little to worry about. Official figures show that the economy is growing at an annual rate of 7%, the sort of expansion western nations can only dream about. But there are doubts about whether the official data is correct. The Economist has developed an unofficial \u201cKeqiang index\u201d, based on Li\u2019s own technique of looking at indicators such as electricity use and rail freight volumes to assess what is really going on in the economy. These provide a much less rosy picture, with rail freight volumes down 11% on a year ago and electricity production flat. Using similar measures the London-based consultancy Fathom estimates China is really growing at 3.1% a year, not 7%. 2. Cutting interest rates The cost of borrowing in China has been cut aggressively since the autumn of 2014 in response to the slowdown in the economy and the distress caused to property owners, local government and corporations by high debt-servicing costs. Tight monetary policy was one mechanism by which Beijing sought to slow the pace of growth amid concerns that its response to the global financial crash \u2013 cheaper credit and a fiscal boost worth 12% of GDP \u2013 had been excessive. The subsequent cut in benchmark interest rates from 6% to a record low of 4.85% suggests policymakers think the slowdown has been too rapid. 3. Putting a floor under the stockmarket The ability to buy and sell shares was seen as an example of China\u2019s growing financial maturity. But when the Shanghai Composite index fell by 30% in a month earlier this year, the government stepped in. The central bank supported share buying, a state-backed wealth fund bought up stocks and fund managers were prevailed on not to sell until the market had recovered. Far from restoring calm, the moves suggested Beijing was afraid of a damaging crash. 4. Declining exports A move away from an over-dependence on exports is official government policy. But the recent weakness in the sale of goods overseas has been more marked than expected, and has helped to contribute to declining world trade and the drop in commodity prices. The cost of maintaining the yuan\u2019s level against the US dollar has been a drop in foreign exchange reserves and an 8.3% drop in exports in the 12 months to July. 5. A cheaper currency As a result of its weakening economy, China has abandoned its currency peg with the dollar and reduced the yuan\u2019s exchange rate on three separate occasions this week. Beijing has put a brave face on this move, saying it is designed to get the yuan included in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s reserve assets known as special drawing rights. A more obvious explanation is that China is seeking to boost growth by making its exports cheaper \u2013 a return to the growth model it is supposed to be abandoning.",

      "bodyText": "Nine major banks including Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), HSBC and Barclays have settled a $2bn (\u00a31.28bn) claim brought by investors in a US court for losses caused by the rigging of foreign exchange markets. The law firm that brought the claim in New York\u2019s southern district court said there was scope for cases to be brought outside the US. Anthony Maton, a managing partner at the law firm Hausfeld in London, said: \u201cThe extent of collusive conduct in the FX market is now clear. US investors will see compensation from these settlements. Others will not. \u201cThere is no doubt that anyone who traded FX in or through the London or Asian markets \u2013 which transact trillions of dollars of business every day \u2013 will have suffered significant loss as a result of the actions of the banks. Compensation for these losses will require concerted action in London.\u201d The case comes after banks were hit with record fines for manipulating forex markets, where \u00a33.5tn a day changes hands from Sydney to London and New York. The fines topped \u00a36.3bn, with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issuing penalties alongside US regulators including the Department of Justice. David Scott, a managing partner of Scott + Scott, another law firm involved in the case, said: \u201cThe settlement agreements we have entered into with nine banks go a long way to ensuring that they are being held accountable for their egregious manipulation of the foreign exchange market.\u201d It was not immediately clear if the banks will incur additional costs to settle the case brought by Hausfeld, as many of them have already set aside billions of pounds to deal with the forex-rigging scandal. RBS said in May that it had reached a settlement in the case and taken enough provisions to cover its bill. HSBC mentioned the lawsuit in its interim results earlier this month, as did Barclays, although neither said it had been settled. At least seven other banks are being pursued in the continuing case in the New York court, where the allegation is that they conspired to manipulate prices in the foreign exchange market since 2003. The ratings agency Moody\u2019s issued updates on its assessments of Barclays and RBS, making reference to the continuing costs of litigation and investigations by regulators. Issuing a stable outlook on RBS, Moody\u2019s said: \u201cAlthough RBS\u2019s current capital ratios are adequate, our current assessment of the group\u2019s capitalisation considers the risk of volatility in the ratios as the restructuring progresses and pending litigations are settled, as well as its limited ability to raise fresh equity capital as a result of quasi-UK government ownership.\u201d Moody\u2019s also gave Barclays a stable rating but said its profitability could be held back by weak revenues, as well as high litigation, conduct and restructuring costs.",

    "webTitle": "Milk price row: Aldi, Lidl and Morrisons vow to raise price paid to farmers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aldi, Lidl and Morrisons are to raise the price they pay their suppliers for milk, bowing to growing pressure from dairy farmers who say the industry is in crisis. Discounters Aldi and Lidl have promised to pay a minimum of 28p a litre from Monday, following talks with farmers, while Morrisons pledged 26p a litre from later this month. The promised increases come after Asda said on Thursday it would also pay 28p a litre. The current average price paid to farmers is 23.66p per litre. The four supermarkets promising rises have declined to say what price they have been paying. However, even the higher prices would still be below the estimated cost of producing milk of 30p a litre and campaigners pledged to continue their protests over the weekend. The National Farmers Union has warned that dairy producers are facing a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d after the price they are paid for milk has fallen by a quarter over the past year. The campaign group Farmers For Action organised protests against Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl that have included blockading distribution centres and walking two cows around a supermarket in Stafford. Protests against the four grocers will be halted while agreements over the new price for milk are finalised. David Handley, chairman of Farmers For Action, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t class it as a big victory. This is the start of a realisation by retailers that something had to be done. It is a pity it needed a bit of protest to get them to the table.\u201d Handley said farmers were still concerned at the amount that supermarkets and the food services sector pay for cheese and yoghurt, and there could be a push to increase the price of liquid milk further. Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have been spared from protests so far because they have agreed to pay dairy farmers based on the cost of production of liquid milk, but they could be among retailers targeted over the weekend. \u201cFor other retailers who haven\u2019t even bothered to pick the telephone up, I am afraid it is open season,\u201d Handley said. The increase from Morrisons comes just days after the Bradford-based supermarket said it would launch a new milk brand called Morrisons Milk For Farmers which will cost 10p more per litre than its standard own-brand milk, with the premium paid to dairy farmers. The company will now also launch a new Milk for Farmers cheddar cheese, which will cost 34p a pack more than Morrisons\u2019 standard cheese. Morrisons said: \u201cWe know that the dairy farming community faces a tough winter. This month, we will continue discussions with our cheese processor about other initiatives that will help their dairy farmers.\u201d Tony Baines, managing director of buying at Aldi, said: \u201cAldi has wide-ranging, long-term commitments to British farming and this new price agreement is the latest example of our support for the sector.\u201d The NFU welcomed the supermarkets\u2019 announcements. In a joint statement, the NFU, Tenant Farmers Association and Farmers for Action said: \u201cAfter our conversations we are pleased that Morrisons has recognised the need to support the dairy sector at this difficult time. Morrisons must continue conversations with its processors on a regular basis. And it is absolutely vital that the extra money goes back to British farmers \u2013 we cannot emphasise this enough. \u201cFurther work is needed within the cheese sector and we will continue discussions with Morrisons on this issue. \u201cOur main concern at present is that any relief within the cheese sector is being funded by price increases to customers. We believe there is sufficient margin within cheese sales which should avoid customers having to pay more.\u201d",

David Handley, chairman of Farmers For Action, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t class it as a big victory. This is the start of a realisation by retailers that something had to be done. It is a pity it needed a bit of protest to get them to the table.\u201d</p> <p>Handley said farmers were still concerned at the amount that supermarkets and the food services sector pay for cheese and yoghurt, and there could be a push to increase the price of liquid milk further.</p> <p>Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have been spared from protests so far because they have agreed to pay dairy farmers based on the cost of production of liquid milk, but they could be among retailers targeted over the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cFor other retailers who haven\u2019t even bothered to pick the telephone up, I am afraid it is open season,\u201d Handley said.</p> <p>The increase from Morrisons comes just days after the Bradford-based supermarket said it would launch a new milk brand called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/11/milk-price-row-morrisons-pay-farmers-10p-premium\">Morrisons Milk For Farmers</a> which will cost 10p more per litre than its standard own-brand milk, with the premium paid to dairy farmers.</p> <p>The company will now also launch a new Milk for Farmers cheddar cheese, which will cost 34p a pack more than Morrisons\u2019 standard cheese.</p> <p>Morrisons said: \u201cWe know that the dairy farming community faces a tough winter.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn, the frontrunner in the Labour leadership election, has proposed \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d to fund extra infrastructure spending, build homes and invest in green industries. The policy of \u201cquantitative easing for people\u201d has been attacked by fellow candidate Yvette Cooper, who said it would lead to higher inflation and a weaker pound. Corbyn outlined his policy last month, saying: \u201cThe \u2018rebalancing\u2019 I have talked about here today means rebalancing away from finance towards the high-growth, sustainable sectors of the future. How do we do this? One option would be for the Bank of England to be given a new mandate to upgrade our economy to invest in new, large-scale housing, energy, transport and digital projects: quantitative easing for people instead of banks.\u201d QE has been used by a number of central banks around the world \u2013 including the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve \u2013 as a response to the financial crisis of 2007-09. As commercial banks reduced their lending and credit dried up, the central banks created new electronic money by buying bonds. The Bank of England bought \u00a3375bn of assets this way, with the intention of channelling those billions of pounds into the economy. Corbyn\u2019s argument is that it had little impact on the real economy and instead led to higher share and property prices. His idea would involve a new national investment bank issuing debt that would be bought by the Bank of England. Cooper said: \u201cQuantitive easing to pay for infrastructure now the economy is growing is really bad economics. History shows it hits your currency, hits investment, pushes up inflation and makes it harder, not easier, to get the sustainable growth in a global economy we need to tackle poverty and support our public services.\u201d Cooper\u2019s point is not that QE is always bad economics. She could not possibly say that since she was a member of the Labour government that first adopted the policy in 2009. Her argument is that QE was a response to a dire emergency and that the economy does not need more of it at this time. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee agrees. None of its nine members is currently backing the idea of more QE. Indeed, the MPC is toying with the idea of tightening policy by raising interest rates rather than adding to the amount of stimulus. People\u2019s QE in the current circumstances would therefore have to rest on the argument that it will provide a way of tackling a dearth of infrastructure spending and, by modernising the public realm, lead to higher productivity. But QE is not needed to do this. The same could be achieved by the government borrowing money at historically low interest rates. The case for people\u2019s QE would be much stronger in the event that a fresh financial crisis pushes the economy back into recession between now and the 2020 election. With little scope to cut interest rates, policymakers would inevitably have to fall back on so-called unconventional measures. One option would be to expand the existing QE programme, even though studies suggest it was not especially effective. Another would be to instigate \u201chelicopter\u201d drops of money, in which the Bank would print money to finance cash transfers to consumers. A third would be for the government to pinpoint specific sectors that it wanted to finance through QE. This would involve the Treasury giving political directions to the Bank, something that is feasible in an emergency but has its risks \u2013 including giving the impression that the government is indifferent to inflation \u2013 if deployed at other times. So Corbyn is right when he says People\u2019s QE should be an option if times get tough. Cooper is right when she questions its use as a day-to-day tool of economic policy or as a backdoor way of financing higher public spending.",

      "bodyText": "The British financial trader accused of contributing to a multibillion-dollar stock market crash has been released from prison after being granted bail while he fights extradition to the US. Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, who faces 22 counts of fraud and commodity manipulation in the US, was set bail of \u00a350,000 at Westminster magistrates court. He has been held at Wandsworth prison in London, after being denied bail following his arrest in April and losing an appeal in May. On Friday, district judge Quentin Purdy said Sarao could be released provided he remains within the bounds of the M25. Sarao, who before his arrest lived with his parents in a modest semi-detached house in Hounslow, west London, is also barred from using the internet for any trading. During the hearing it emerged that Sarao has funds of more than \u00a330m, including \u00a325.5m held in Switzerland, as well as \u00a35m in a US account controlled by his lawyers. Sarao\u2019s lawyers are trying to transfer the Swiss funds into the US account, to provide surety to US authorities. However, the Swiss authorities will not release the majority of funds until 2017, apart from \u00a35m that will be transferred to the escrow account in October. The court also heard that Sarao had been diagnosed as having \u201csevere Asperger syndrome\u201d by an expert from Cambridge University. Sarao, who appeared in court wearing a yellow T-shirt, over a black long-sleeved top, denies the charges against him. The British trader is accused of manipulating US financial markets and contributing to the flash crash of 6 May 2010, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,000 points in five minutes, losing 9% of its value and causing panic on Wall Street. The market soon recovered and ended the day 3% lower. The US Department of Justice alleges that Sarao earned $40m (\u00a326m) by \u201cspoofing\u201d financial markets, which involved using software to place fake trades to move prices up or down. James Lewis QC, representing Sarao, argued that his client needed to be released from jail to present evidence to a financial expert on his trading activities, as part of his defence against extradition. Lewis said the trading was \u201chorrendously complicated\u201d, adding he himself had not yet fully understood it. The defence case against Sarao\u2019s extradition had been complicated by the difficulty of finding finance professionals ready to accept the \u201crisible\u201d legal aid fees on offer to expert witnesses, Lewis added. However, the judge denied the defence\u2019s request to delay the extradition hearing, which is scheduled for 24 and 25 September. Sarao\u2019s lawyers will have the chance at a further court hearing on 28 August to argue for more time to develop their defence. When he appeared at the high court in May, Sarao protested his innocence: \u201cI\u2019ve not done anything wrong apart from being good at my job.\u201d But in this latest court appearance, he spoke only to confirm his name and understanding of bail conditions. Lawyers for the US government previously argued that Sarao should not be released on bail until he was able to demonstrate that he had no access to funds. Sarao was prevented from paying \u00a35m bail demanded in May because of a worldwide freezing order on his funds. Mark Summers QC, representing the Americans, said the US authorities would not oppose the latest application for bail, subject to conditions, including depositing the Swiss funds in an account that can be accessed only by Sarao\u2019s lawyers. US authorities have accused Sarao of alleged market manipulation over five years and had warned him against his activities as recently as 6 April. But they stopped short of putting all the blame on the Hounslow day trader for the flash crash, arguing that he was \u201ca contributing\u201d factor. Sarao is alleged to have changed his orders on the day of the flash crash more than 19,000 times before cancelling them, and is said to have made profits of more than $820,000 during a day\u2019s trading. Last year, Sarao explained his success to the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority by saying that \u201che had always been good with reflexes and doing things quick\u201d.",

The market soon recovered and ended the day 3% lower.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice alleges that Sarao earned $40m (\u00a326m) by \u201cspoofing\u201d financial markets, which involved using software to place fake trades to move prices up or down.<br></p> <p>James Lewis QC, representing Sarao, argued that his client needed to be released from jail to present evidence to a financial expert on his trading activities, as part of his defence against extradition. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9263900f22d3c547f3c4e865dd3d1ac31bb692d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/14/1439552364664/321bc12b-7428-4776-a472-1763d0ae94b3-460x370.png\" alt=\"Flash crash\" width=\"460\" height=\"370\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lewis said the trading was \u201chorrendously complicated\u201d, adding he himself had not yet fully understood it. The defence case against Sarao\u2019s extradition had been complicated by the difficulty of finding finance professionals ready to accept the \u201crisible\u201d legal aid fees on offer to expert witnesses, Lewis added. However, the judge denied the defence\u2019s request to delay the extradition hearing, which is scheduled for 24 and 25 September. </p> <p>Sarao\u2019s lawyers will have the chance at a further court hearing on 28 August to argue for more time to develop their defence.</p> <p>When he appeared at the high court in May, Sarao protested his innocence: \u201cI\u2019ve not done anything wrong apart from being good at my job.\u201d But in this latest court appearance, he spoke only to confirm his name and understanding of bail conditions.</p> <p>Lawyers for the US government previously argued that Sarao should not be released on bail until he was able to demonstrate that he had no access to funds. </p> <p>Sarao was prevented from paying \u00a35m bail demanded in May because of a worldwide freezing order on his funds. Mark Summers QC, representing the Americans, said the US authorities would not oppose the latest application for bail, subject to conditions, including depositing the Swiss funds in an account that can be accessed only by Sarao\u2019s lawyers.</p> <p>US authorities have accused Sarao of alleged market manipulation over five years and had warned him against his activities as recently as 6 April. But they stopped short of putting all the blame on the Hounslow day trader for the flash crash, arguing that he was \u201ca contributing\u201d factor.</p> <p>Sarao is alleged to have changed his orders on the day of the flash crash more than 19,000 times before cancelling them, and is said to have made profits of more than $820,000 during a day\u2019s trading.<br></p> <p>Last year, Sarao explained his success to the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority by saying that \u201che had always been good with reflexes and doing things quick\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A slump in French manufacturing and construction sapped the strength of the eurozone economy in the second quarter, pushing the 19-member currency bloc\u2019s GDP growth rate down to 0.3% from 0.4% in the first three months of the year. A solid performance by Germany and continuing expansion, albeit modest, in Italy offset the figures from Paris, which showed that the second-largest economy in the currency bloc failed to expand between April and the end of June. Analysts said uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the Greek crisis weighed on consumer and business confidence, especially in France, which trades heavily with the rest of the eurozone. Germany, which has dramatically extended its trading links with the far east and China in recent years, saw its manufacturing sector continue to strengthen despite the ongoing row between Athens and its creditors. Exports in Europe\u2019s biggest economy did particularly well, a sign that the weaker euro is helping. But slowing global trade and concerns over domestic consumption in China are expected to dampen the German manufacturing powerhouse, with only Mercedes appearing insulated from weakening Chinese demand for cars. Many analysts said they were disappointed that Germany had missed expectations of a minimum 0.5% growth rate and blamed slowing growth in China for the shortfall. \u201cThe weak GDP reading for Germany is also a result of slowing growth in China,\u201d said Naeem Islam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. \u201cThe recent rout in the Chinese yuan could further damage growth in Germany if the current efforts by the Chinese central bank fail to curb the currency sell off.\u201d Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency, said the figures, which are preliminary and have no details beyond country rates, showed Germany growing 0.4% during the quarter, up from 0.3%. Spain\u2019s recovery maintained its momentum with a 1% spurt in the second quarter that built on a 0.9% growth rate in the first three months. Poland managed 0.9%, as did the Czech Republic. However, France, which showed signs of a strong recovery in the first quarter with a 0.7% rise in the first quarter, was the biggest surprise after it registered 0% growth. Finland continued its terrible run with a 0.4% contraction, double the 0.2% contraction earlier this year. The Netherlands and Austria could only manage 0.1% growth, while Portugal, which is battling to recover while complying with a Brussels-inspired austerity drive, managed 0.4%. Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING, blamed a lack of consumption by households and businesses for the worse-than-expected figures, but said the figures showed a resilience to disruptive forces inside and outside the currency bloc that should stand it in good stead for the year. \u201cConsumption growth, having been boosted in the first quarter by the sharp drop in energy prices, probably softened slightly in the second quarter, as oil prices climbed again,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, with the renewed drop in oil prices and the ongoing improvement of the labour market, we expect consumption to be an important growth driver in the second half of the year. \u201cInventories have likely shaved off a bit of growth in the second quarter, but this actually bodes well for the second half, as industrial orders remain strong according to the European commission\u2019s business survey.\u201d European stocks regaining some of the week\u2019s losses after news that the Greek parliament approved a third multibillion-euro bailout deal offset the underwhelming GDP figures. In early European trading, the FTSEurofirst index of leading 300 European shares was up 0.5% at 1,538 points, as was the Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading eurozone shares at 3,349 points. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC40 were both up 0.6%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was up 0.4%. Earlier on Friday, the Greek parliament voted to approve the country\u2019s third financial rescue by foreign creditors in five years. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, still faces a confidence vote later this month. Meanwhile, official figures showed that the German and Italian economies expanded more slowly than expected in the second quarter. The French economy did not grow at all.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a tumultuous, often ill-tempered and at times surreal all-night debate, Greek MPs voted early on Friday to approve a new multibillion euro bailout deal aimed at keeping their debt-stricken country afloat. But a fierce rebellion in the ranks of his leftist Syriza party saw prime minister Alexis Tsipras fall short of the 120 votes he would need to survive a censure motion, leading to speculation he would call a confidence vote next week and snap elections as early as next month. More than 40 Syriza hardliners, including controversial former finance minister Yannis Varoufakis, failed to toe the party line, angry at the punishing terms of the \u20ac85bn (\u00a360bn) package and what they said was a sell-out of the party\u2019s principles and a betrayal of its promises. Tsipras needed the support of opposition parties after the marathon session to win parliament\u2019s backing for the bill in a 9.45am vote, which the government eventually won by a comfortable margin of 222 votes to 64, with 11 abstentions. The prime minister told MPs before the vote that the rescue package was a \u201cnecessary choice\u201d for the nation, saying it faced a battle to avert the threat of a bridge loan - which he called a return to a \u201ccrisis without end\u201d - that Greece may be offered instead of a full-blown bailout. The draft bailout must now be approved by other eurozone member states at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels on Friday afternoon, and ratified by national parliaments in a number of countries \u2013 including Germany, which remains sceptical \u2013 before a first tranche can be disbursed allowing Greece to make a crucial \u20ac3.2bn payment to the European Central Bank due on 20 August. The Athens parliament did not start debating the 400-page text of the draft bailout plan until nearly 4am after parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, a Syriza hardliner, ignored Tsipras\u2019s request to speed up proceedings and instead raised a lengthy series of procedural questions and objections. In angry exchanges, the conservative opposition rounded on the government, warning it not to take its support for granted. \u201cIf you want to provoke us - and for us to vote for it - you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis told finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos. On the left, former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who leads a rebel bloc of around a quarter of Syriza\u2019s 149 MPs, pledged to \u201csmash the eurozone dictatorship\u201d, while in her concluding pre-vote remarks, Konstantopoulou announced: \u201cI am not going to support the prime minister any more.\u201d Earlier, the government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, had conceded that divisions within the leftist party, which swept to victory in January\u2019s elections on a staunch anti-austerity platform, were now so deep that a formal split was probably inevitable. Germany, the biggest single contributor to Greece\u2019s two previous bailouts, cautioned on Wednesday that eurozone support for the package \u2013 which includes more tough spending cuts and tax hikes and surrenders unprecedented powers over large areas of Greek economic and social policymaking to the country\u2019s international creditors \u2013 was not yet guaranteed. \u201cGermany isn\u2019t the only country that is still asking questions at the moment,\u201d deputy finance minister Jens Spahn said, pointing in particular to the issues of International Monetary Fund support for the deal and concerns about a planned privatisation fund to sell off Greek state-owned property. Germany has repeatedly signalled it might prefer to back a bridging loan to help Greece meet its ECB payment rather than agree to an imperfect longer-term deal that might not work \u2013 a solution Athens is unwilling to accept. It emerged overnight, however, that senior EU finance officials had asked the European Commission to draw up a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d for a new interim loan as a safety net to buy more time for eurozone members to finalise the plan. The debate followed better-than-expected Greek economic growth figures, with official estimates on Thursday showing the economy had expanded by 0.8% in the second quarter of 2015 despite the imposition of capital controls to prevent a bank run. The national statistics agency, ELSTAT, also revised upwards its first-quarter growth estimate, from a 0.2% contraction to zero growth. But Greece\u2019s European creditors on Thursday also underlined the temporary nature of the country\u2019s surprise return to growth, warning they have \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the spiralling debts of the eurozone\u2019s weakest member. According to an analysis completed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the eurozone bailout fund, Greece\u2019s debts will peak at 201% of its national output (GDP) in 2016.",
