      "bodyText": "Further evidence of the accelerating housing market emerged on Monday when surveyors said they were more optimistic about the prospects for increasing sales than at any point in the last 14 years. Demand from would-be homebuyers also picked up at its fastest rate in nearly four years in June, according to the survey of sentiment from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. As a result of increased buyer numbers, Rics reports a net balance of 45% more respondents predicting sales would rise rather than fall, against 36% in May, the highest proportion since the index began in 1999. It comes after property website Rightmove said on Friday it would double its prediction for growth in asking prices this year to 4% and mortgage lender the Halifax said property prices were rising at their fastest rate for three years. Government initiatives to boost lending and positive news about the economy have been credited with improving confidence among prospective buyers. Official figures last month showed unemployment falling compared with last year, and data last week suggested the services sector had grown at its fastest rate in two years during June. As a result, many property commentators have revised their forecasts for the year upwards, predicting price rises of up to 5%. Rics said 38% more of its members had reported increases in new buyer inquiries rather than falls during the month, the largest proportion since August 2009. Demand was being driven in part by easing credit conditions, it said, with the government's Funding for Lending scheme, launched in August 2012, translating into low-cost mortgages and more loans to those with small deposits. Although in recent months more homeowners had put properties up for sale, Rics said the number of agents reporting surplus stock on their books in June had fallen. The combination is set to put further upward pressure on prices, which according to one index have increased by 4% in the first six months of this year, and Rics said the government must focus on increasing the supply of homes. Bidding wars have broken out among buyers in some areas of the country. Nicholas Scott, manager of Haart estate agents in Wandsworth, south London, said properties in that area were typically selling for between 98% and 105% of asking price. \"Supply and demand is a big factor in prices going up \u2013 at the moment there is a lack of properties on the market and lots of people wanting to buy because they fear they will get priced out if they wait,\" he said. Rics said 21% more of its members reported prices were up in June than reported falls \u2013 the largest proportion since January 2010 \u2013 and a balance of 23% said they expected further increases over the next three months. While in January they were predicting that prices would stagnate over the next 12 months, they are now predicting a 1.5% increase. Peter Bolton King, Rics global residential director, said: \"We are finally starting to see what looks like the beginning of a recovery in the housing market. \"It is important to remember that activity levels still remain depressed by historic standards but the various initiatives designed to encourage the provision of finance into the housing market do appear to be paying dividends.\" Rics members also reported a strong lettings market and said they expected rents to rise over the next 12 months. Bolton King said: \"As the cost of shelter moves higher, it is absolutely critical that the government continues to focus on its role in supporting the delivery of more new homes into the market.\" The first part of the Help to Buy scheme, which offers interest-free loans to those buying newbuild properties, has helped builders sell properties since its launch in April. Bovis is the latest to report a strong start to the year, aided by Help to Buy. It said reservations were up 40% year on year. In a trading statement it said: \"Consumers are increasingly able to access mortgage finance and the launch of the Help to Buy shared equity scheme, replacing FirstBuy, has had a positive effect on customers' confidence to buy a home and their ability to transact. \"These positive effects are expected to support greater activity in the new homes market, which in turn will provide an impetus to the number of new homes built.\"",

Gardner said that Walmart was part of an alliance of retailers, industry associations and the Bipartisan Police Center, which was looking a the issue and would release details of their safety plan on Wednesday. \"What happened at the Tazreen and Rana Plaza factories is tragic.\" he said. \"We are saddened by this situation and are working every day to improve worker safety in Bangladesh.

      "bodyText": "The US and European Union have started talks aimed at creating the world's largest free-trade agreement, amid diplomatic tensions over spying revelations. The long-delayed negotiations come at a sensitive moment for the two trading superpowers following the publication of documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, which show that America's National Security Agency spied on European nations. EU officials are in Washington to start broad negotiations aimed at easing transatlantic trade by eliminating remaining tariffs on exports and imports, and recognising each other's industry standards. Economists believe the transatlantic trade and investment partnership pact could be a big boost to both sides. Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, has called it \"the biggest bilateral trade deal in history\" and said a deal could be worth as much as $149bn (\u00a3100bn) to the EU economy and $119bn (\u00a380bn) to the US. Revelations of widespread spying by the NSA on Europeans has further complicated already complex and fraught negotiations. Last week, France suggested a further delay in the start of talks while the US clarified the extent of its spying activities on its allies. In the same week, Le Monde newspaper revealed that France runs a vast surveillance operation that, like the NSA, is also intercepting and storing citizens' phone data and internet activity. Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the spying revelations would become a sideshow. \"I think we will find that everybody has been doing this,\" he said. He said negotiations were more likely to founder on other long-simmering disputes between the two trading powers. Among the most sensitive topics under discussion are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and data privacy. Strong opposition to genetically modified crops is seen as a major hurdle to US agricultural exports. Last month, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reiterated that Europe will defend its restrictions on GM food. US firms including Facebook, Google and Microsoft want European data privacy rules relaxed as they look to build their businesses in Europe. But those talks will be complicated by revelations about the extent of their working relationship with the NSA. European companies also want to be able to bid on public works projects currently by \"Buy American\" requirements. Other hot issues include France's cultural exception, which protects the country's arts industries and helps to maintain a homegrown film sector. \"These are fundamental, philosophical differences. Squaring those circles is going to be very difficult and getting any resolution is going to take compromise at the very top,\" said Kirkegaard. If successful, Kirkegaard said the proposed pact would transform international trade. The deal would cover about 50% of global economic output and 30% of global trade and because of its size would create de facto global standards, he said. This week's talks will be largely organisational and led by the assistant US trade representative, Dan Mullaney, and his EU counterpart, Ignacio Garc\u00eea Bercero. Fifteen different groups will be set up to deal with issues ranging from agriculture to competition policy.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Royal Mail sell-off details to be announced", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government will this week formally announce its plan to sell off Royal Mail in the most contentious privatisation since British Rail two decades ago. Vince Cable, the business secretary, will make a statement to the House of Commons formally kickstarting the sale of the 497-year-old postal service. Cable's statement \u2013 which is expected on Wednesday but could be delayed until next week \u2013 will set out details of the sale, expected to come via a \u00a32-3bn flotation on the London Stock Exchange this autumn. The statement will set out the terms under which 10% of the shares will be granted to postal workers. The public will also be encouraged to buy shares in an advertising blitz along the lines of the \"Tell Sid\" campaign that encouraged the \u00a39bn sale of British Gas in 1986. The formal announcement of the sale to MPs in parliament comes amid mounting outcry from postal workers who have taken to an open top bus to protest against the \"great British flog-off\". Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, which represents more than 100,000 postal workers, warned the government: \"We aren't going to let Royal Mail be sold. We are going to fight every step of the way. A strike is certain.\" Hayes warned the government that the union was already planning industrial action that could include rolling strikes this autumn and members would formally meet to vote on strike action on 31 July. \"The public don't want it [privatisation]. The workforce certainly don't want it,\" Hayes said as the union began a week-long open-top bus protest tour of parliament, Royal Mail's head office and the banks organising the sale. Hayes said he hoped the threat of sustained industrial unrest would scare off institutional investors from buying shares in the state-owned delivery service and force the collapse of the sell-off. His message to potential investors was: \"Royal Mail is not for sale. Your shares are not going to be very safe. This is going to be a privatisation against a background of industrial unrest.\" Hayes said the union's campaign had already resulted in several big investors deciding to steer clear of a privatised Royal Mail. On Monday the union took its protest bus to the offices of the investment banks Goldman Sachs and UBS, which are leading a syndicate of banks that could collect about \u00a330m from the privatisation. \"Goldman Sachs and UBS ruined the economy of this country and they are now working on the ruination of the Royal Mail, and we are not going to stand idly by and let that happen,\" Hayes said. \"People have got more faith in postal workers than bankers at UBS and Goldman Sachs.\" The government has also appointed Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Investec, Nomura and Royal Bank of Canada to the banking syndicate working on the sale. The banks are set to collect 1% of the sale price, which is expected to be \u00a32-3bn. Via a loudspeaker on the brightly coloured protest bus John Simkins, a CWU London rep, shouted to passersby: \"Reject the City fat cats. Protect your local postmen and women.\" \"Whose mail? Our mail,\" he chanted to ripples of applause and postal workers loudly playing vuvuzelas. \"Don't let a few elite in the City make a fast buck at the expense of your Royal Mail. Once the City gets its hands on it you'll be lucky to get a delivery once a week.\" The government has pledged that privatisation will not affect Royal Mail's universal service obligation to deliver to every address in Britain six days a week for the same price. The government had attempted to win over workers by offering them an 8.6% pay rise, but the union rejected the \"misleading and unacceptable\" three-year offer. The CWU said the pay rise deal was \"only there as a sweetener to swallow some very bitter pills\" including privatisation and \"damaging\" changes to pensions and working conditions. Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, said the pay offer was a \"good deal \u2013 good for Royal Mail and good for our people\". Royal Mail's annual report, which could be published this week, is expected to reveal that Greene collected a \u00a3500,000 increase in pay to \u00a31.6m last year. The average full-time postal worker's salary is \u00a319,416. This would rise to \u00a321,092 in 2015 if the union were to accept the pay deal, which includes a \u00a3300 lump sum in December. The company has already agreed to a minimum \u00a3100-a-year bonus.",

The banks are set to collect 1% of the sale price, which is expected to be \u00a32-3bn.</p> <p>Via a loudspeaker on the brightly coloured protest bus John Simkins, a CWU London rep, shouted to passersby: \"Reject the City fat cats. Protect your local postmen and women.\"</p> <p>\"Whose mail? Our mail,\" he chanted to ripples of applause and postal workers loudly playing vuvuzelas. \"Don't let a few elite in the City make a fast buck at the expense of your Royal Mail. Once the City gets its hands on it you'll be lucky to get a delivery once a week.\"</p> <p>The government has pledged that privatisation will not affect Royal Mail's universal service obligation to deliver to every address in Britain six days a week for the same price.</p> <p>The government had attempted to win over workers by offering them an 8.6% pay rise, but the union rejected the \"misleading and unacceptable\" three-year offer.</p> <p>The CWU said the pay rise deal was \"only there as a sweetener to swallow some very bitter pills\" including privatisation and \"damaging\" changes to pensions and working conditions.</p> <p>Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, said the pay offer was a \"good deal \u2013 good for Royal Mail and good for our people\".</p> <p>Royal Mail's annual report, which could be published this week, is expected to reveal that Greene collected a \u00a3500,000 increase in pay to \u00a31.6m last year.</p> <p>The average full-time postal worker's salary is \u00a319,416. This would rise to \u00a321,092 in 2015 if the union were to accept the pay deal, which includes a \u00a3300 lump sum in December. The company has already agreed to a minimum \u00a3100-a-year bonus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the eurogroup settles in to discuss, among other things, signs from Brussels that although an agreement between Greece and its Troika creditors has been reached, that is no guarantee that all will be plain sailing. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports: Greece and its Eurozone creditors were locked in a battle of nerves on Monday evening amid fresh friction over the terms of its bailout. With ultimatums and deadlines being set by the Eurozone in advance of Monday evening\u2019s meeting of finance ministers of the 17 countries, last-minute negotiations resulted in a tentative green light to release more bailout funds. But the expert-level accord still had to be blessed by the finance ministers, with Germany expected to make the case for delay. Talks over the weekend between the Greek government and the so-called troika of officials from the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund resulted in a last-minute agreement on a new package of spending cuts, job losses and fiscal reforms in Greece in return for the release of the bailout funds. But it was not clear if the eurozone would agree to release the funds immediately, with Germany sounding as if it wanted to increase the pressure on Athens, hold it to benchmarks of reforms implementation, and calibrate the release of bailout money to tangible results. More on the site shortly, but on that note, we're closing up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow to cover the fallout of the eurogroup gathering and the rest of the day's developments. So, a good start to the week as far as stock markets are concerned. Investors were buoyed by a rethink about the US jobs figures from Friday, fairly upbeat comments on the economy from ECB boss Mario Draghi, and signs of progress in Greece and Portugal. Here are the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 74.55 points or 1.17% higher at 6450.07 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 2.08% at 7968.54 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.86% higher at 3823.83 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended up 1.71% at 15,799 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.9% to 8017 \u2022 In Athens the market put on 2.08% to 858 Meanwhile, ahead of the start of the US reporting season which begins later with Alcoa, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 64 points or 0.4%. ECB chief Mario Draghi said the OMT - the outright monetary transactions or sovereign bond buying programme - was ready to be used when necessary if the right conditions were in place. In his session in front of the European parliament, which now appears to be at an end, Draghi said the OMT - which has not been called upon yet - was \"a fully effective backstop.\" Other comments from his testimony, courtesy Reuters: \u2022 I think that the ECB has truly done a lot, but we are continuously searching, we have an open mind towards instruments, and we are continuously thinking about how to revamp credit. \u2022 [Banks] may not lend [to small and medium sized businesses] because of a lack of capital, but the ECB cannot replace the lack of capital. Shareholders can, but not the ECB. \u2022 [On Portugal] - it is just one of the examples where the economic situation remains stressed and social distress is indeed very high. What the ECB has done is basically say, 'look, don't unravel the progress that these countries and Portugal especially has made on fiscal consolidation. But make this fiscal consolidation growth friendly. Lower your taxes, lower your current expenditures, make structural reforms.' A quick look at the markets and shares have started the week in a buoyant mood. The FTSE 100 is up 1.5%, Germany's Dax and France's Cac have both climbed more than 2%, as has Spain's Ibex. Italy's FTSE MIB is up 1.5% and the Athens market has climbed 2%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 100 points or 0.7% higher Mario Draghi's relatively upbeat comments on the eurozone economy have lifted the single currency, up 0.3% against the dollar to $1.2864. Speaking of Draghi and markets: Meanwhile here are some early photographs as ministers gather for the eurogroup meeting in Brussels: Some early reaction to ECB boss Mario Draghi's appearance at the European parliament. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: So far, Draghi's comments reiterate the message delivered at last week's press conference. Low interest rates for an extended period of time and forward guidance are based on the current scenario for 1) subdued inflation 2) weak growth 3) sluggish credit market. Draghi also confirms the idea that fragmentation in the eurozone remains a major issue and the ECB tenders' full allottment are aimed at facilitating the transmission mechanism. ECB acts in its mandate to reduce fragmentation. More on Draghi. Here's his opening statement to the European parliament and here is a live feed of the Draghi session. ECB chief Mario Draghi continues his hearing at the European parliament and has been addressing the economic outlook as well the ECB's vow to keep monetary policy \"accommodative for as long as needed. Key comments from Draghi include: Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover over the course of the year, although at a subdued pace... Following its July meeting the governing council stressed that the monetary policy stance is geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable market conditions... It reiterated that its monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as needed. Furthermore, the governing council sharpened its communication by announcing that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. ... Higher interest rates in a weak economic situation would destabilise a country making the life of your counterparties even more difficult. In the present situation, the way to address potential risks stemming from low rates is to focus on macroprudential instruments. ... Portugal is just one of the examples where the economic situation remains stressed and social distress is indeed very high. What the ECB has done is basically say, 'look, don't unravel the progress that these countries and Portugal especially has made on fiscal consolidation. But make this fiscal consolidation growth friendly. Lower your taxes, lower your current expenditures, make structural reforms. And with that I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The Greek government's promise to its international lenders that it will push through widespread layoffs in the public sector has sparked protests on the streets of Athens. As eurozone finance ministers convene in Brussels to decide on whether to release the next tranche of bailout money to Greece, in Athens thousands of Greek municipal workers and state school teachers have taken to the streets. Reuters reports from the city: More than 6,000 local administration workers, among them guards and uniformed municipal police on motorbikes, marched to the Administrative Reform Ministry in central Athens, waving black flags, honking horns and sounding sirens. Take your memorandum and get out of here!\" the workers chanted, in the first protest since the lenders completed their latest review of Greece's cost cutting efforts on Sunday, a sign of the resistance the government may face. They won't succeed - we will fight it,\" said POE-OTA, the federation of local government unions, which held a 24-hour nationwide strike. The largest public sector union ADEDY also staged a work stoppage in Athens. ECB chief Mario Draghi has started talking at the European parliament and has repeated the central bank's reassurances on interest rates staying low. Highlights so far, reported by Reuters: \u2022 Higher interest rates are not warranted at this point in time \u2022 Higher interest rates in weak economy would destabilise the economy \u2022 Fiscal consolidation was and still is unavoidable \u2022 ECB shares in principle the objectives of the financial transaction tax (FTT) \u2022 ECB has not recommendation on FTT Back to the news that UK chancellor George Osborne has endorsed some of the proposals from the banking commission (see earlier post at 12.45pm), including introducing a law that could threaten jail to reckless bank bosses. International law firm Mayer Brown has sent through its thoughts on whether any bankers would actually end up behind bars. Litigation partner Alistair Grahamcomments: By endorsing the majority of the commission\u2019s recommendations, George Osborne is moving UK banking regulation towards a US style system which is focussed on punishing individuals. Proposing that reckless bankers will go to jail undoubtedly chimes with public opinion. Indeed, in the US, the threat of prison has had great effect. However, proving that an offence of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank as a criminal offence will be incredibly difficult - as it will have to be beyond all reasonable doubt. This means the number of individuals successfully prosecuted may prove small. The weaker-than-expected industrial output and exports data out of Germany earlier today have been raising questions over the state of the eurozone\u2019s largest economy and the repercussions for the rest of the currency bloc. Bert Colijn, labour market economist at The Conference Board says more uncertainty has returned to the eurozone. He comments: The European economy, even though some indicators suggest that it might be on its way towards recovery, is still seeing a sluggish outlook ahead. German manufacturing orders disappointed with a decline again in May, while the euro area unemployment rate once again reached a new high. This shows that the European economy remains stalled for the moment and that the recovery of confidence in the economy is vital if the outlook is to improve. The consumer caused some good news as retail sales increased by 1% in May. This will likely push second quarter retail sales into positive territory, which would be a second quarterly gain. One potential risk though to this cautious recovery is recent political turmoil in Egypt which is currently driving energy prices higher. That can have an increased effect on inflation, which would hurt the consumer given the current low wage growth environment. Herv\u00e9 Amourda at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has been analysing the 1% monthly fall for German industrial production in May. He says: As the previous two months were quite strong, due to a rebound in activity in April after the very bad weather in March, the second quarter average should be higher than the first quarter. In fact, the three-month-over-three-month rate prints at 2.2%. All in all, this release and the soft data released so far (PMI manufacturing still below 50) point to weak momentum in early Q3 (third quarter). Besides, the recent floods should weigh on German activity in the short term but we should see some gains (from reconstruction) in the medium term. ING has been asking if the German data this morning tell of deeper problems or simply reflect weather and holiday-driven volatility. Its economist Carsten Brzeski says: Today is definitely not a good day for the German economy. This morning\u2019s disappointing trade data combined with these industrial production data show that the Eurozone\u2019s economic engine is still not running smoothly. The big question is whether this is the result of a structural weakness or special factors? In our view, it is the special factors. In fact, German data since the beginning of the year have been highly erratic. To the UK now, briefly, where chancellor George Osborne, has backed the banking commission's proposals for a radical overhaul of the financial sector. We will have a full story soon, but to summarise, Osborne says he will implement the main proposals, which include introducing a new law to jail bankers for \"reckless misconduct\". The government response to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standard\u2019s (PCBS) report outlines plans to \"strengthen standards in banking\" by: introducing a criminal offence for reckless misconduct for senior bankers. Those found guilty could face a jail sentence working with the regulators to ensure bankers\u2019 pay is aligned with their performance, including allowing bonuses to be deferred for up to ten years and enabling 100% claw back of bonuses where banks receive state aid introducing a tough new regime governing the behaviour of senior bank staff and new rules to promote higher standards for all bank staff reversing the burden of proof so that bank bosses are held accountable for breaches within their areas of responsibility working with the regulators, to strengthen corporate governance to ensure that firms have the correct systems in place to identify risks and maintain standards on ethics and culture Osborne says in a statement: The government is determined to raise standards across the banking industry to create a stronger and safer banking system. Last summer I called for a thorough and intensive investigation into how to improve standards in the banking system and the PCBS has delivered. I am pleased to say that the government will implement its main recommendations. Where legislative changes are required we will amend the Banking Reform Bill which is currently before Parliament. Cultural reform in the banking sector marks the next step in the government\u2019s plan to move the whole sector from rescue to recovery and ensure that UK banks demonstrate the highest standards, and are able to support business and drive economic growth. As some of you may have noticed, technical work here has been holding things up and I have not been able to post for a while. Apologies to those of you having problems posting below the line too. A quick market update. Stock markets have rebounded around Europe this morning despite falls in Asia overnight, the dollar has hit a three-year high and gold is down. Market players report that the feeling on stock markets for now is that even if the Federal Reserve moves towards withdrawing its stimulus in the US, there have been reassuring promises of loose policy in the eurozone and UK. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.8%, or 53 points, at 6428, Germany's DAX is up 2.3%, or 178 points, at 7984 and France's CAC40 is up 1.8%, or 68 points, at 3822. The rebound follows a late recovery for stocks on Wall Street on Friday after the closely watched non-farm payrolls report on the labour market came in stronger than expected. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets UK said: The continued recovery in equity markets sees the major indices bouncing hard from their June lows and bulls aiming once again at the highs set in May. The willingness of traders to push valuations higher on the back of a strong Non-Farms number suggests we are back in \u2018good news is good news\u2019 mode despite the looming prospect of Fed tapering, and risk appetites may once more be on the rise. German industrial production fell twice as much as expected in May, according to official data. Output fell 1% in May from April compared with the 0.5% fall forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. While we await the latest industrial production data from Germany due shortly, a quick look at those trade numbers earlier. Official statistics showed the biggest drop in exports since late 2009, falling 2.4% in May. That was much weaker than the consensus forecast for a 0.4% fall in a Reuters poll of economists. Imports were up 1.7% on the month, overshooting the forecast for a 0.5% rise. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, comments: The destiny of German exports remains in the hands of its trading partners outside of the eurozone. Since the beginning of the year, the share of exports to eurozone countries has stabilised at around 36% of total exports... Germany\u2019s dependence on international \u2013 and therefore less intra-eurozone trade \u2013 will not make the necessary rebalancing of the eurozone economy any easier. Even if there has been a tender catching up in terms of price competitiveness by eurozone peripheral countries vis-\u00e0-vis Germany since early 2010, a continuation of this trend will not be easy. The peripheral part of this rebalancing is already a painful one. However, ideally, the rebalancing also requires a German part but German exporters look unlikely to play this role. Since early 2010, German companies have already started to squeeze their margins more than other eurozone countries, helping to sustain market shares. Obviously, German companies cannot squeeze margins forever. As a consequence, the tolerance for and acceptance of higher wages in the non-tradable sector should remain much higher than in the tradable sector. All in all, today\u2019s disappointing trade data show that the eurozone\u2019s economic engine is still stuttering. After a strong start to the second quarter, May data have been rather disappointing. Nevertheless, we still think that at the end of a weather and holiday driven rollercoaster ride, the German economy should finally return to full strength in June. Ahead of the eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Brussels later today, analysts say the focus will be on Greece, on Spain\u2019s bank recapitalisation plan and on Portugal after the political upheaval there. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets says Porugal\u2019s problems will probably be high on the agenda at today\u2019s meeting \u201cwith pressure likely to be brought to bear for an easing to austerity, across the board.\u201d He continues: This is likely to fall on deaf ears, given the upcoming September elections in Germany. The agenda is also likely to include Europe\u2019s perennial problem child of Greece where once again the government is falling short of its fiscal targets, with a new funding gap opening up as the government continues to delay in restructuring its public sector... The recent Cyprus bailout is also likely to be reviewed as the country continues to struggle to make economic progress in the wake of the decimation of its financial sector. Nishay Patel and Mohit Aggarwal at Citi note that the condition for the disbursement of the next bailout tranche of \u20ac8.1bn for Greece is reportedly the decision to put 12,500 civil servants into a \u201cmobility scheme\u201d which would lead to an eventual layoff. The continiue: The key stumbling block of reducing the public sector headcount remains the most difficult to overcome. The government risked collapse last month, as the smallest coalition party withdrew its support because of divergent views on this very issue. The risk of another political crisis in Greece may work as a strong disincentive for international lenders to put too much pressure on Greece to approve the next bailout tranche. After recent events in Portugal and Greece, Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has been addressing client questions over whether a summer crisis is brewing in the periphery of the eurozone. SocGen\u2019s economics team does not expect anything on the scale of 2011 and 2012. Marcussen sends through this summary of the situation: Monday\u2019s Eurogroup will discuss the third review on Greece\u2019s economic adjustment programme and Spain\u2019s bank recapitalisation programme. Speaking in Aix-en-Provence Sunday, Commission President Rehn noted a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of agreement on Greece and added that any talk of debt restructuring was premature. While we believe Greece will ultimately need debt restructuring, this is highly unlikely this side of the German elections (22 September). In Portugal, weekend developments saw agreement reached for CDS-PP leader Paulo Portas to become vice president and thus avoid an early election. Further discussions will be held this week, but as the Troika prepares to arrive in Lisbon on 15 July, a certain calm appears to have returned to Portuguese politics. The issue that Portugal may ultimately need an additional aid programme remains, however, as Portuguese leaders are likely to seek a further easing of budget targets. Details of that troika deal with the Greek government are up online here and highlights include a prediction of a return to growth in 2014: Staff teams from the European Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have concluded their review mission to Greece. The mission has reached staff-level agreement, ad referendum, with the authorities on the economic and financial policies needed to ensure the programme is on track to achieve its objectives. The mission and the authorities agreed that the macroeconomic outlook remains broadly in line with programme projections, with prospects for a gradual return to growth in 2014. The outlook remains uncertain, however. While important progress continues to be made, policy implementation is behind in some areas... Our Europe editor Ian Traynor sends news that the troika and Greek government have reached a deal. At that same economists' conference in Aix-en-Provence, Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann renewed calls for eurozone governments to press on with economic reforms. The European Central Bank had helped matters with loose policy but could not solve the crisis, he said: Monetary policy has already done a lot to absorb the economic consequences of the crisis, but it cannot solve the crisis. This is the consensus of the Governing Council. The crisis has laid bare structural shortcomings. As such, they require structural solutions. You can find the full text of his opening remarks here on the Bundesbank website. Coming back to our weekend catch-up, the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde has been dropping hints that the institution will be more gloomy when it updates its world economic outlook tomorrow. Speaking at an economists conference in southern France, the IMF chief suggested the previous 3.3% forecast for 2013 would be trimmed. I fear that considering what we are seeing now in emerging countries in particular - not developing countries and low-income countries but emerging countries - I fear that we might be slightly below that. We have some technical work starting at 9.00am and expect it to last for an hour and I am afraid we won\u2019t be able be to post anything above the line during that time. However, if we are able, we will keep things going below the line. A quick round-up of comments over the weekend that have raised expectations Greece will get a deal on its latest chunk of bailout funds today. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told Reuters that the negotiations were almost complete, but Athens needed to intensify efforts to deliver on reform commitments. The ball is in the Greek court and it depends on whether Greece is able to deliver the remaining elements of the milestones that have been agreed. Poul Thomsen, head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s mission to Greece told reporters on Sunday: We made very good progress. I hope we will conclude tomorrow morning [Monday] before the Eurogroup meeting. Greece\u2019s Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras was also hopeful. I am optimistic that we will have a deal tomorrow morning before the Eurogroup meeting. Good morning and welcome to the eurozone crisis live blog where we will be bringing you news on the latest bailout deal for Greece, market updates and highlights from today\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. The focus in the eurozone today will be Greece where remarks from various officials over the weekend suggest a deal may well be reached today on its latest bailout review. Talks have been going on over the last week with the troika - inspectors from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - and are expected to wrap up today. Greece then hopes the eurozone finance ministers meeting this afternoon will greenlight the next \u20ac8.1bn tranche of aid. A quick list of what is coming up: \u2022 Eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels this afternoon \u2022 ECB chief Mario Draghi attends a hearing before the committee of economic and monetary affairs at the EU parliament early afternoon \u2022 German industrial output is due for May at 11.00am UK time \u2022 German trade data for May released earlier showed the biggest fall in exports in more than four years and a bigger than expected rise in imports On financial markets, there was a sell-off in Asia overnight but European stocks are rebounding in morning trade. Investors appeared to take a stronger-than-expected non-farm payrolls report from the United States as bad news for stocks. A widespread view the jobs growth will prompt tapering from the US Federal Reserve -- in other words it will start withdrawing its economic stimulus in the near future -- saw the Dow Jones drop but recover and close up almost 1% on Friday [with apologies, this is a correction from original post, saying it closed down]. Bond yields rose on the jobs numbers on Friday, while this morning Bund yields in Germany have edged lower and yields on gilts in the UK are up slightly.",

He comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The European economy, even though some indicators suggest that it might be on its way towards recovery, is still seeing a sluggish outlook ahead. German manufacturing orders disappointed with a decline again in May, while the euro area unemployment rate once again reached a new high. This shows that the European economy remains stalled for the moment and that the recovery of confidence in the economy is vital if the outlook is to improve. The consumer caused some good news as retail sales increased by 1% in May. This will likely push second quarter retail sales into positive territory, which would be a second quarterly gain. One potential risk though to this cautious recovery is recent political turmoil in Egypt which is currently driving energy prices higher. That can have an increased effect on inflation, which would hurt the consumer given the current low wage growth environment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Herv<strong>\u00e9</strong> Amourda at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong> has been analysing the 1% monthly fall for German industrial production in May. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the previous two months were quite strong, due to a rebound in activity in April after the very bad weather in March, the second quarter average should be higher than the first quarter. In fact, the three-month-over-three-month rate prints at 2.2%.

That was much weaker than the consensus forecast for a 0.4% fall in a Reuters poll of economists. </p> <p>Imports were up 1.7% on the month, overshooting the forecast for a 0.5% rise.</p> <p>Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING, comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The destiny of German exports remains in the hands of its trading partners outside of the eurozone. Since the beginning of the year, the share of exports to eurozone countries has stabilised at around 36% of total exports...</p> <p>Germany\u2019s dependence on international \u2013 and therefore less intra-eurozone trade \u2013 will not make the necessary rebalancing of the eurozone economy any easier. Even if there has been a tender catching up in terms of price competitiveness by eurozone peripheral countries vis-\u00e0-vis Germany since early 2010, a continuation of this trend will not be easy. The peripheral part of this rebalancing is already a painful one. However, ideally, the rebalancing also requires a German part but German exporters look unlikely to play this role. Since early 2010, German companies have already started to squeeze their margins more than other eurozone countries, helping to sustain market shares. Obviously, German companies cannot squeeze margins forever. As a consequence, the tolerance for and acceptance of higher wages in the non-tradable sector should remain much higher than in the tradable sector.</p> <p>All in all, today\u2019s disappointing trade data show that the eurozone\u2019s economic engine is still stuttering. After a strong start to the second quarter, May data have been rather disappointing. Nevertheless, we still think that at the end of a weather and holiday driven rollercoaster ride, the German economy should finally return to full strength in June.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51da80c9e4b006f3c8f535e9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-08T09:05:18.381Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurogroup to look at Greece, Spanish banks and Portugal's political turmoil</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the <strong>eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers</strong> in Brussels later today, analysts say the focus will be on Greece, on Spain\u2019s bank recapitalisation plan and on Portugal after the political upheaval there.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets</strong> says Porugal\u2019s problems will probably be high on the agenda at today\u2019s meeting \u201cwith pressure likely to be brought to bear for an easing to austerity, across the board.\u201d He continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is likely to fall on deaf ears, given the upcoming September elections in Germany.</p> <p>The agenda is also likely to include Europe\u2019s perennial problem child of Greece where once again the government is falling short of its fiscal targets, with a new funding gap opening up as the government continues to delay in restructuring its public sector...</p> <p>The recent Cyprus bailout is also likely to be reviewed as the country continues to struggle to make economic progress in the wake of the decimation of its financial sector.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nishay Patel and Mohit Aggarwal at Citi</strong> note that the condition for the disbursement of the next bailout tranche of \u20ac8.1bn for Greece is reportedly the decision to put 12,500 civil servants into a \u201cmobility scheme\u201d which would lead to an eventual layoff. The continiue:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key stumbling block of reducing the public sector headcount remains the most difficult to overcome. The government risked collapse last month, as the smallest coalition party withdrew its support because of divergent views on this very issue. The risk of another political crisis in Greece may work as a strong disincentive for international lenders to put too much pressure on Greece to approve the next bailout tranche.</p> </blockquote> <p>After recent events in Portugal and Greece, <strong>Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong> has been addressing client questions over <strong>whether a summer crisis is brewing in the periphery</strong> of the eurozone. SocGen\u2019s economics team does not expect anything on the scale of 2011 and 2012. Marcussen sends through this summary of the situation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Monday\u2019s Eurogroup will discuss the third review on Greece\u2019s economic adjustment programme and Spain\u2019s bank recapitalisation programme. Speaking in Aix-en-Provence Sunday, Commission President Rehn noted a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of agreement on Greece and added that any talk of debt restructuring was premature. While we believe Greece will ultimately need debt restructuring, this is highly unlikely this side of the German elections (22 September).</p> <p>In Portugal, weekend developments saw agreement reached for CDS-PP leader Paulo Portas to become vice president and thus avoid an early election. Further discussions will be held this week, but as the Troika prepares to arrive in Lisbon on 15 July, a certain calm appears to have returned to Portuguese politics. The issue that Portugal may ultimately need an additional aid programme remains, however, as Portuguese leaders are likely to seek a further easing of budget targets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51da77dee4b0aad461352e47\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-08T08:27:11.959Z\">9.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Troika deal details</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Details of that troika deal with the Greek government are <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-668_en.htm\">up online here</a> and highlights include a prediction of a return to growth in 2014:</p> <blockquote> <p>Staff teams from the European Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have concluded their review mission to Greece.

Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said: The fact that such heavyweight investors are queueing up for a piece of the action, suggests to us that they remain confident of future capital appreciation and income generation from the shares. The reports also helped the other state-owned bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, which rose 12.1p to 288.8p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 74.55 points higher at 6450.07, its best close since 4 June. Positive comments from ECB boss Mario Draghi on the prospects for the eurozone economy, and news of a deal between Greece and its Troika creditors, helped sentiment, as did an upbeat start on Wall Street. Later the US reporting season begins, with an update due from Alcoa. Among the other risers, Arm added 19p to 860p after a buy note from Jefferies, which was optimistic about the chip designer's prospects in the server market. Arm has lost a chunk of its value in recent weeks on two main concerns: firstly that it would lose market share in its key smartphone and tablet market; and secondly, its move into the server market to take on Intel was unlikely to make up the difference. Elsewhere ITV rose 3.3p to 152.8p following reports it might bid up to \u00a390m for Scandinavian production business Nice Entertainment, which makes dramas and reality shows. Ian Whittaker at Liberum Capital said: As long as ITV does get involved in an expensive bidding war and shows discipline, a deal should be positive. Among the mid-caps, Hikma Pharmaceuticals jumped nearly 6% after lifting its full year revenue forecast for the second time in just a couple of months. The company said it expected revenues to rise by 17% in 2013 thanks to strong sales of its antibiotic doxycycline. Previously it had forecast a 13% increase in May. Its shares added 56p to \u00a310.50, helped by vague talk of possible merger activity in the sector. More evidence of a revival in the UK housing market - boosted by government schemes - has come from Bovis Homes. After positive updates from the likes of Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey last week, Bovis said it had seen a 40% increase in net reservations in the first six months of the year. Its sales growth accelerated in the second quarter after the launch of the government's Help to Buy scheme. Bovis shares climbed 55p to 830p while other builders also continue to rise, with Taylor Wimpey up 3.5p at 106.3p and Persimmon 11p better at \u00a312.67. But Betfair fell 39.5p to 840p. Traders said that 11m shares, or 10.57%, had been placed with institutional investors on behalf of Softbank at a price of 827p each, a total of around \u00a390m. Finally Blur Group, which operates an online marketplace for companies to buy and sell services from advertising to legal help, rose 23.5p to 202.5p ahead of a second quarter update on Tuesday.",

Maplin hopes to tap into a market which has so far been used only by professional printing companies. It appears to be popular, with online orders for the K8200 printer already requiring a 30-day wait for delivery. The device is no bigger than a paper printer but users must assemble it and replacement cartridges of the plastic raw material cost \u00a330. The new technology has caused controversy in the US after a student managed to build a working gun with the printer. He later posted the designs online. The printers work by building tiny layers of plastic on top of each other to make the 3D creation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy will rebound strongly in 2015 although unemployment will persist, according to the one of the UK's leading economic consultancies. Capital Economics, one of the City's most pessimistic forecasters, believes the UK economy will beat expectations by expanding at 2.5% in 2015, with growth set to accelerate by as much as 4% in 2016. But the report is not all happy reading for the chancellor, George Osborne, who has been counting on the economy roaring back to life by the time of the general election in 2015. Job creation will lag, with the unemployment rate stuck at 8% in 2015, compared with 5.5% before the financial crisis hit. The \"sub-par recovery\" will continue for the next 18 months, with growth numbers bumping around 1.5% in 2014. Only from 2015 will the economy start to accelerate, not only making up the lost ground of the slump years, but as a result of an expansion in manufacturing, energy and construction. Biotechnology, nanotechnology, 3D printing and the next stage of the computer revolution, as well as a rise in the economically active population all lie behind the economists' bullish forecast of a \"better balanced economy\", although they believe firms will expand using their existing staff rather than making new hires. \"The UK economy has been written off many times in the past, but prosperity has always returned. Accordingly, when a full-blown recovery finally comes, we believe that it will be worth the wait,\" states the report. The mostly upbeat forecast came as accountants BDO reported that business confidence was at the highest level since May last year. BDO's optimism index rose for a fifth month in June as confidence grew among both manufacturing and services companies, although it remains slightly below the level which would indicate the economy was expected to grow. BDO warned a combination of factors including \"belt-tightening\" among UK consumers, eurozone volatility and hints from the US Federal Reserve that it will ease stimulus measures in the coming months were likely to weigh on business confidence. \"While it's encouraging to see confidence continuing to improve, we should be mindful of the zigzag trend that has characterised UK business confidence since 2008,\" said Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO. \"Periods of improved confidence have ended before growth has really begun to get going. The worry is that financial market turmoil arising from the actions of the Federal Reserve will choke off yet another nascent UK recovery.\" The index rose to a 13-month high of 94.3 in June from 93.6 in May, where 95.0 indicates growth. BDO's output index, which covers short-term expectations, increased to 94.9 from 94.4. Last week the Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted against additional stimulus following a string of upbeat data. The economy grew by 0.3% in the first quarter, and economists predict growth accelerated in the second quarter. The first official estimate of second-quarter GDP will be published on 25 July.",

      "standfirst": "The Reserve Bank governor's jokes might not make you laugh, but his vision of the future could raise a smile", 
      "body": "<p>The Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, gave a speech in Brisbane last week to the Economic Society of Australia. Here\u2019s what you need to know.</p> <h2>1. Glenn Stevens needs to work on his stand-up routine</h2> <p>Here\u2019s a central banker joke:</p> <p>A Reserve Bank governor walks into a business luncheon and says: \u201cAs you may know, the Reserve Bank board in fact held its meeting here in Brisbane yesterday at which we deliberated for a very long time and then elected to sit with the cash rate unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>OK. Maybe you needed to be there.</p> <p>The punchline is \u201cwe deliberated for a very long time\u201d. That line isn\u2019t in <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2013/sp-gov-030713.html\">the draft of the speech</a> provided on the RBA\u2019s website. Stevens just indulged in a bit of deadpan humour \u2013 the joke being that they deliberated for a long time to do nothing.</p> <p>The problem is those who trade foreign exchange see more meaning in every single utterance of central bankers than Dan Brown does in a Renaissance painting. And so, after he said this, the Australian dollar dropped half a cent in the space of a couple minutes, all because traders thought this made it more likely the RBA will cut rates next month.</p> <p>Despite deputy governor Philip Lowe <a href=\"http://boardroom-pc.streamguys.us/files/RBA/2RBA20130704_PL/\">confirming the day after</a> that it was indeed a \"light-hearted remark\", the dollar has stayed down. This is actually something Stevens wants to happen, so perhaps the joke is on those who think he was joking.</p> <h2>2. It really is time to realise the world\u2019s economy has changed since the GFC</h2> <p>Call this the latest episode of comedian Glenn Stevens\u2019s ongoing sitcom, Only Fools and Horses ... Still Think the Pre-GFC Period Was Normal (yes the title needs work).</p> <p>Stevens noted that Australia\u2019s average growth before the GFC was 3.5%. But then the world did an economic impersonation of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rcdLeXiU8\">Del Boy falling through the bar</a>. Since then growth has averaged about 2.5%. Stevens also noted that other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malaysia which have done OK in recent years have experienced a similar drop. He concluded that \"Australia seems to be part of a broader pattern here\u201d.</p> <p>A pretty obvious pattern at that \u2013 high growth prior to the GFC, lower growth since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-46597b25-aad3-476b-bf52-a7bfd2523fb5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/8/1373248134408/f4f8b801-f67c-475b-a6f2-4a7bf4cc7e69-460x254.jpeg\" alt=\"Average annual GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"254\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average annual GDP growth Photograph: /IMF world economic outlook report</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So the next time <a href=\"http://www.joehockey.com/media/transcripts/details.aspx?s=474\">someone says</a> that comparing Australia\u2019s economy now with 2007 is a good way to judge which party is better at running the economy, suggest to them they leave the comedy to the professionals \u2013 the entire world was doing better in 2007.</p> <h2>3. Getting through the GFC required more luck than having a lot of mining</h2> <p>Stevens noted that we were lucky to have mining to help us through the GFC, but we were also lucky it hit when it did. In 2007, Australia\u2019s level of sub-prime mortgages (high-risk loans made to people with few assets and poor credit history) was low but rising fast. So when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis\">sub-prime collapse</a> happened in America in 2008 it meant that the issue here was still just \u201ca small problem ... [that] stayed small\u201d. Had it occurred a year or so later, Australia\u2019s finance sector would have been much more vulnerable.</p> <p>He also noted that it was lucky we had changed our behaviour when we did. Our switch to \u201cslower borrowing, more saving\u201d actually occurred prior to the GFC. By the end of 2006 we had already decided enough mad spending was enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7702ea95-3ac0-4cca-917b-a2f2cc962be9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/8/1373248175564/f624162d-06ed-4b46-b16c-9af67f29b5fe-460x257.jpeg\" alt=\"Household saving ratio\" width=\"460\" height=\"257\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Household saving ratio Photograph: ABS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That switch helped us when the GFC hit, and has also helped keep inflation down during the last few years of the mining investment boom. So well done Australia, we made our own luck.</p> <h2>4. Stevens wants us to build houses</h2> <p>The switch to saving means in Stevens\u2019s view that \u201chouseholds have accumulated a good deal of cash\u201d. He would like to see it spent on building houses, saying: \u201cIf anything, we will need to build more dwellings than we have been over recent years.\u201d</p> <p>But while in <a href=\"http://boardroom-pc.streamguys.us/files/RBA/RBA20130703_GS/\">the Q&amp;A session</a> afterwards he noted higher house prices was a driver of housing construction, he thought it would be a bad result if lower interest rates just led to \u201chigher prices and not more houses\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2fc8c34f-dffa-4ad6-98bf-27a5ea56a652\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/8/1373248214259/554da491-1156-4ee0-bd96-55ea065d3e6a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Monthly construction of private sector homes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monthly construction of private sector homes Photograph: /ABS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Private housing construction has increased a bit of late, and given the RBA <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2012/sep/2.html\">last year</a> also noted the importance of supply-side issues with housing such as land release, zoning, and housing design approvals, I\u2019m not sure Stevens is too interested in lowering interest rates further just to keep fuelling demand.</p> <h2>5. The future is unknown (but don\u2019t worry)</h2> <p>In the past 21 years since our last recession, Australia\u2019s GDP has grown by around 100%. If back in 1991 you had said only 3% of that growth would be due to manufacturing, a smart response would have been to ask: \u201cWhere is the growth coming from?\u201d</p> <p>Stevens posed this same question last week and answered that \u201cmost of the time the answer ... is that only part of it will come from the old traditional areas, and a fair bit of it will come from new things, often things of which we are only dimly aware\u201d.</p> <p>This sounds unnerving \u2013 and it is \u2013 but Stevens suggests we\u2019re as well placed to achieve this transition to a different economy as ever before.</p> <p>In the past 50 years whenever our exports boomed, high inflation followed; this time it didn\u2019t. Twenty years ago when our economy changed, it came off the back off a deep recession; this time it hasn\u2019t.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean though that the change will be \u201csimple and easy\u201d.</p> <p>He noted that both sides need to continue their current aim for a surplus in the near term, and businesses need to continue to improve productivity \u201cat the enterprise level\u201d. He also referred to the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/speeches/gary-banks/productivity-policies\">to-do list\u201d</a> which contains some politically tough measures (for example, dropping support for failing industries such as the automotive sector and tightening requirements for drought support).</p> <p>Stevens stressed the need for confidence and said that at present it is a bit \u201csubdued\u201d. But he concluded, albeit in his usual understated way, with an upbeat message. Our current solid economic position, together with prudent policies, should mean Australians \u201creasons for confidence about the future\u201d. And that is no joke.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, gave a speech in Brisbane last week to the Economic Society of Australia. Here\u2019s what you need to know. 1. Glenn Stevens needs to work on his stand-up routine Here\u2019s a central banker joke: A Reserve Bank governor walks into a business luncheon and says: \u201cAs you may know, the Reserve Bank board in fact held its meeting here in Brisbane yesterday at which we deliberated for a very long time and then elected to sit with the cash rate unchanged.\u201d OK. Maybe you needed to be there. The punchline is \u201cwe deliberated for a very long time\u201d. That line isn\u2019t in the draft of the speech provided on the RBA\u2019s website. Stevens just indulged in a bit of deadpan humour \u2013 the joke being that they deliberated for a long time to do nothing. The problem is those who trade foreign exchange see more meaning in every single utterance of central bankers than Dan Brown does in a Renaissance painting. And so, after he said this, the Australian dollar dropped half a cent in the space of a couple minutes, all because traders thought this made it more likely the RBA will cut rates next month. Despite deputy governor Philip Lowe confirming the day after that it was indeed a \"light-hearted remark\", the dollar has stayed down. This is actually something Stevens wants to happen, so perhaps the joke is on those who think he was joking. 2. It really is time to realise the world\u2019s economy has changed since the GFC Call this the latest episode of comedian Glenn Stevens\u2019s ongoing sitcom, Only Fools and Horses ... Still Think the Pre-GFC Period Was Normal (yes the title needs work). Stevens noted that Australia\u2019s average growth before the GFC was 3.5%. But then the world did an economic impersonation of Del Boy falling through the bar. Since then growth has averaged about 2.5%. Stevens also noted that other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malaysia which have done OK in recent years have experienced a similar drop. He concluded that \"Australia seems to be part of a broader pattern here\u201d. A pretty obvious pattern at that \u2013 high growth prior to the GFC, lower growth since. So the next time someone says that comparing Australia\u2019s economy now with 2007 is a good way to judge which party is better at running the economy, suggest to them they leave the comedy to the professionals \u2013 the entire world was doing better in 2007. 3. Getting through the GFC required more luck than having a lot of mining Stevens noted that we were lucky to have mining to help us through the GFC, but we were also lucky it hit when it did. In 2007, Australia\u2019s level of sub-prime mortgages (high-risk loans made to people with few assets and poor credit history) was low but rising fast. So when the sub-prime collapse happened in America in 2008 it meant that the issue here was still just \u201ca small problem ... [that] stayed small\u201d. Had it occurred a year or so later, Australia\u2019s finance sector would have been much more vulnerable. He also noted that it was lucky we had changed our behaviour when we did. Our switch to \u201cslower borrowing, more saving\u201d actually occurred prior to the GFC. By the end of 2006 we had already decided enough mad spending was enough. That switch helped us when the GFC hit, and has also helped keep inflation down during the last few years of the mining investment boom. So well done Australia, we made our own luck. 4. Stevens wants us to build houses The switch to saving means in Stevens\u2019s view that \u201chouseholds have accumulated a good deal of cash\u201d. He would like to see it spent on building houses, saying: \u201cIf anything, we will need to build more dwellings than we have been over recent years.\u201d But while in the Q&amp;A session afterwards he noted higher house prices was a driver of housing construction, he thought it would be a bad result if lower interest rates just led to \u201chigher prices and not more houses\u201d. Private housing construction has increased a bit of late, and given the RBA last year also noted the importance of supply-side issues with housing such as land release, zoning, and housing design approvals, I\u2019m not sure Stevens is too interested in lowering interest rates further just to keep fuelling demand. 5. The future is unknown (but don\u2019t worry) In the past 21 years since our last recession, Australia\u2019s GDP has grown by around 100%. If back in 1991 you had said only 3% of that growth would be due to manufacturing, a smart response would have been to ask: \u201cWhere is the growth coming from?\u201d Stevens posed this same question last week and answered that \u201cmost of the time the answer ... is that only part of it will come from the old traditional areas, and a fair bit of it will come from new things, often things of which we are only dimly aware\u201d. This sounds unnerving \u2013 and it is \u2013 but Stevens suggests we\u2019re as well placed to achieve this transition to a different economy as ever before. In the past 50 years whenever our exports boomed, high inflation followed; this time it didn\u2019t. Twenty years ago when our economy changed, it came off the back off a deep recession; this time it hasn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean though that the change will be \u201csimple and easy\u201d. He noted that both sides need to continue their current aim for a surplus in the near term, and businesses need to continue to improve productivity \u201cat the enterprise level\u201d. He also referred to the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201cto-do list\u201d which contains some politically tough measures (for example, dropping support for failing industries such as the automotive sector and tightening requirements for drought support). Stevens stressed the need for confidence and said that at present it is a bit \u201csubdued\u201d. But he concluded, albeit in his usual understated way, with an upbeat message. Our current solid economic position, together with prudent policies, should mean Australians \u201creasons for confidence about the future\u201d. And that is no joke.",
