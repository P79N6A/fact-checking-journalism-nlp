      "bodyText": "Three clean-cut young Americans are sitting in a diner. One is wearing spotless white new Converse trainers and keeps reaching under the table to wipe them. His two friends, sitting across from him, exchange a glance and start mocking his doomed fastidiousness. Then one lifts a foot and deliberately plants the dirty sole on his toe. Her boyfriend gives the Converse-wearer a shrugging, get-over-it look. The Converse-wearer thinks for a second, then leans across the table and punches him in the face. As the boyfriend, unconscious, slides down his seat, the Converse-wearer gives a satisfied smile and takes a celebratory sip. It's not your usual shoe shop advert. But then ads for Foot Locker, which describes itself as \"the world's leading retailer of athletically inspired footwear\", rarely are. Other recent commercials for the American-based chain have featured a young man being spanked by his girlfriend with trainers; another young man, blindfolded, identifying specific trainers by smell; another, tougher-looking young man wearing huge, heavy trainers in bed; and young men and women making orgasmic faces as they put on new trainers. \"The sneaker addict,\" as another Foot Locker ad puts it, lets \"sneakers dictate 99% of his actions\u2026 The sneakers he wears communicate a million more messages than his mobile\u2026 He makes sure nothing gets in their way\u2026 Experts have named this phenomenon a sneaker way of life.\" For decades, as one of the inventors of this \"sneaker way of life\", Foot Locker has successfully maintained a dual identity. On the one hand, there is its folksy American name and its old-fashioned logo of a black and white striped basketball referee, hands sternly on hips. On the other, there is Foot Locker's advertising: this sells brashness, competitiveness, obsessiveness, insatiability. Compared with trainers, other types of shoe have been potent symbols \u2013 think of high heels or brogues \u2013 but never with quite the same intensity or ubiquity or controversy. \"At the juncture of the sneaker, a host of cultural, political and economic forces meet, collide,\" wrote the African-American sociologist Michael Eric Dyson in 1993. \"Black cultural preoccupation with style\u2026 the commodification of the black juvenile\u2026 rapacious consumerism\u2026 cultural and personal narcissism\u2026 the expanding inner-city juvenocracy\u2026 illicit criminal activity\u2026 The sneaker reigns as the universal icon of the culture of consumption.\" Worldwide, Foot Locker Inc has around 3,400 shops (constant openings and closures keep the numbers fluid), and in Britain about 65, mostly in London and the south-east. Usually, these are orderly places \u2013 more orderly than you might expect from the company's advertising. In the showpiece, three-floor branch on Oxford Street, well-built young staff in black and white stripes patrol the tidy aisles. Unusually polite for central London retail, they are also watchful, eyes on the wall displays, with their garish shoals of trainers, from slim and retro to bulbous and futuristic, from Adidas to Puma to Nike, from \u00a330 to \u00a3170. \"The target customer of Foot Locker worldwide is a young male, aged 12 to 20,\" the company says, in one of several guarded and anonymous email responses to my request for an interview. But the Oxford Street shop's customers are more eclectic: middle-aged men, pairs of teenage girls, parents with young children, couples in their 20s. Some customers are in cheap sportswear, others look smart and prosperous. Everyone, even the occasional clusters of teenage boys, all jostle and jittery swagger, picks the trainers off the wall displays delicately, even reverently, holding them by the heel. The most expensive ones are on the highest shelves; to deter shoplifters further, the only decoration on the shop window is a large sticker saying that CCTV is operating \"for your safety and to help prevent crime\". On the days I visit, no punches are thrown. But this Foot Locker branch, and others in Britain and elsewhere, can be less calm. Two months ago, at lunchtime on Boxing Day, Seydou Diarrassouba, an 18-year-old from south London, bled to death beside a traffic barrier a dozen yards from the store, surrounded by a panicky police cordon and a huge, restive crowd. According to the police, he had been involved in a confrontation with other customers inside the busy shop \u2013 it was the first day of the sales \u2013 which climaxed with him being fatally stabbed in the heart. Last month, Thulani Khumalo, a 20-year-old man from Haringey in north London, was charged with the murder and remanded in custody until 11 April. Another seven men, aged between 16 and 23, remain on bail, having been arrested as part of a continuing investigation into the killing. Apart from a tiny twist of police tape still attached to the traffic barrier, the Foot Locker and its environs show no trace of the Boxing Day horror. Yet on the internet and in newspapers, conclusions have already been drawn. \"Violence does attach to trainers and to the environment in which they're marketed and sold,\" commented the novelist Howard Jacobson on 31 December. In last year's English riots, Foot Locker was singled out. On the night of 7 August, hundreds of looters converged on the branch in Brixton, south London. For more than six hours, as its cheery sign continued to glow in the darkness, the shop front was battered and ripped open, and looters shuttled back and forth from a crowd gathered outside. A man in the crowd, voice tight with excitement, shouted: \"Run! Run! Run! Get your own!\" One teenager carried out eight boxes of trainers. Another looter was 70 years old. The stealing stopped only after the shop was set on fire. Afterwards, the pavement outside was strewn with single display shoes and empty blue and white Adidas trainer boxes. Branches were also looted in Manchester, Birmingham and Dalston in east London, where almost all the surrounding shops were left untouched. A few news reports briefly noted this pattern. But there is an untold story of disorder at Foot Locker stores that goes back much farther than last August. In Dublin in 2006, a branch was looted during a riot between unionists and republicans. In Paris in 2007, during a confrontation between police and black youths over aggressive policing, a chant suddenly went up: \"Foot Locker! Foot Locker!\" Shortly afterwards, Associated Press reported, at the shop near the Gare du Nord railway station, \"Youths broke windows\u2026 reaching through the shattered glass to grab boxes of shoes. Passersby also joined in the looting.\" In Oakland, California in 2010, also during a riot sparked by police behaviour, a Foot Locker was looted with such brazenness that one thief, immortalised on YouTube, tried out his newly acquired trainers by shuffling slowly backwards and forwards on the pavement outside, store tags still dangling. In Montreal the same year, there was another Foot Locker ransacking as ice-hockey fans celebrated in the street after a play-off victory. You could see such incidents as simply a mindless ritual. Or you could see deeper social forces at work as well. After the Montreal looting, on the trainer obsessives' website nicekicks.com, a discussion thread hinted at the latter. \"Foot locker been feeding on us for a long time\u2026 now a lil pay back,\" wrote hahaa. BlaqINK wrote, \"As long as nobody is hurt... footlockers a billion $$ business don't worry they'll be alright.\" Russ wrote, \"[I] use to work for footlocker... they dont care [about] you so I dont care about them im glad this happened.\" Alex Hiller of Nottingham Business School suggests the sort of consumerism represented by Foot Locker and trainer culture is increasingly in tension with economic realities. \"The trainer industry is targeting very strongly young people who don't have much disposable income\" \u2013 because of the current downturn \u2013 he says. Yet, \"Trainers have become a very aspirational product. We all remember being bullied for wearing the wrong trainers at school. It's inconceivable for some people not to take part in the trainer game. If they can't buy those things, they've got to find other ways of acquiring them. And when consumerism turns criminal, sometimes there is an element of resentment, for example at the mark-ups on products. With the recession, that sort of resentment is increasing.\" The store mark-up on trainers is typically 100%. Even in better times, the resulting prices made some people take trainers more seriously than many other purchases. In 2000, after the BBC1 consumer programme Watchdog suggested that some Nike Air Max 95s costing \u00a3100 \u2013 expensive for trainers then \u2013 had faulty, squeaky soles and could be exchanged at the shops where they had been bought, a Foot Locker in Leeds was besieged for two days by dissatisfied \u2013 and opportunistic \u2013 Nike owners. When staff refused to exchange the shoes, police had to be called. There were brawls and seven arrests. On other occasions, it is the supply of trainers that causes confrontations. One of the ways companies such as Nike create demand is by releasing limited numbers of trainers to limited numbers of shops. Foot Locker, because of its size and status, is almost always one of these chosen outlets. Last year, three days before the Oxford Street stabbing, the release of a particularly sought-after model of Air Jordans in America led to stampedes at several malls. In Burlington, New Jersey, \"Foot Locker opened at 7[am],\" a witness told the local TV news channel WTXF. With more than 100 people competing for eight pairs of shoes \"it was a free for all. People were showing up with guns\u2026 A couple of gentlemen walked up and said, 'If I don't get a pair of sneakers, I am going to spray the whole line.'\" In Oregon in July 2008, a lorry carrying thousands of pairs of new Nike trainers collided with another truck, injuring both drivers and killing a passenger. According to the Oregonian newspaper, even while emergency services were at the scene, \"several people\" tried to steal some of the shoes that had spilled across the road. Originally, the trainer was invented to promote relaxation rather than manic acquisitiveness. According to Tom Vanderbilt's The Sneaker Book (1998), Dunlop's Liverpool Rubber Company helped conceive them in the 1890s as canvas and rubber \"sand shoes\" for beachgoers. In 1974 the American retail giant Woolworth established Foot Locker, the first shoe chain devoted to sneakers; by 1979 it had almost 100 branches. Late-70s Britain took to trainers with a similar intensity. In Liverpool, writes Shawn Smith in the 2003 essay collection Trainers, \"A small-scale, black economy began to revolve around the demand for designer footwear\u2026 It mostly revolved around gangs of young men who went to and fought at football games\u2026 'casuals'.\" Then, as now, youth unemployment was high and rising, but hard times only made the suddenly proliferating trainer styles more seductive. And what could not be afforded could be shoplifted: \"Many of the Adidas trainers sported by scousers were 'acquired' on trips to various European countries,\" supporting the Liverpool team, writes fellow Trainers contributor John Connolly. During the 80s and 90s, trainer fetishism grew from a subculture into the dominant culture of young footwear fashion. Endorsements by rappers and sportsmen, advances in shoe technology, more informal dress codes, modern ostentatiousness and materialism \u2013 \"the sneaker way of life\" emerged from and furthered all these trends. Between 1982 and 1995, sales of sneakers nearly doubled in the US. In 1990 Foot Locker arrived in Britain. The mainstreaming of trainer culture did not remove its lawless side. On the contrary, by the early 90s stories about people being mugged or murdered for their trainers, and about the symbolically charged role of trainers in gang life and drug dealing, were a media staple. In 1996, a face-off between members of rival gangs in a Foot Locker in California was reportedly one of the causes of the murder of the rapper Tupac Shakur. For all its watchful staff and in-store cameras, there is a hint of resignation in the company's attitude to disorder in its shops. When I asked what lessons it drew from the looting of its stores in riots, the emailed response was: \"We have procedures to ensure the safety of our associates and customers in such circumstances.\" Store employees, the email continued, were given \"ongoing training\" to deal with \"such events\". Did Foot Locker think looting of its shops could ever be totally prevented? \"No, but good communication with local [law and order] authorities can help to maximise safety and minimise losses.\" When I asked whether the company felt the \"sneaker way of life\" had any broader social downsides, I received no reply. Staff in the shops repeatedly say company policy forbids them talking to journalists. Foot Locker's PR companies, Hill + Knowlton and Frank PR, send countless holding emails, then finally suggest that a brand manager in the US head office might be able to talk on the phone. Then Hill + Knowlton call to say that he is on \"annual leave\". Foot Locker's safety-first approach to its reputation has echoes of how the designer label Burberry protected its own a decade ago, after the actor and cocaine addict Danniella Westbrook and other unwelcome, usually working-class customers became associated with its clothes. Someone who used to work at Burberry recalls: \"We didn't talk about it [in public]. It was never even acknowledged. Not acknowledging it meant the 'chav' thing didn't travel.\" Yet Robert Clark, a veteran analyst for Retail Week Knowledge Bank, says that for a chain store with good insurance, being looted can be double-edged. \"Your security director might be appalled, but your marketing director might think you've achieved something.\" In one sense, mobs of looters at your stores sends the same message as mobs of shoppers: people are desperate for your goods. But a reputation for regular trouble risks scaring off most customers. So, more subtly, does too relentless an association with streetwise young male shoppers. \"It's a fine line for Foot Locker,\" Clark says. \"They want to be a bit edgy, but if they become too edgy, parts of their customer base, such as older people, may increasingly go elsewhere.\" There is not much sign of that happening yet: in 2010 and 2011, despite the disorder at Foot Locker stores, annual profits were up, at close to $200m. But lasting damage can sometimes be done by looters. Six months on from the 2011 English riots, the Brixton branch remains boarded up, sections of wall still blackened from the fire. The premises are to let. Such closures matter because in the US, saturated with trainer outlets, the company is reducing its number of stores; Europe has been earmarked for expansion instead. But around the world Foot Locker must contend with economic stagnation, internet retail and competition from discount clothing chains and supermarkets. In Britain, sales per square foot \u2013 the key measure of retail performance \u2013 are over a third down from their peak in 2003. Vanderbilt describes the trainer as \"the emblematic product of the late 20th century\" \u2013 made by cheap labour, expensively marketed, compulsively purchased. In the 21st century, there are signs of that dominance slipping, thanks to the formal shoe revival, the fashionability of hiking boots and work boots, the renewed appetite for Doc Martens and a visible slowing down in the evolution of the trainer itself. On the wall displays in Foot Locker and other trainer shops these days, unlike in the 70s, 80s and 90s, there are few new shoe designs to bewilder or dazzle. Increasingly, retro styles rule. Trainer prices, except for the limited-edition, luxury brands sold elsewhere in designer stores, have barely risen for 10 years. After four decades, Foot Locker's \"sneaker way of life\" may be losing its power.",

In Liverpool, writes Shawn Smith in the 2003 essay collection <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trainer-Neal-Heard/dp/1842227963\" title=\"\">Trainers</a>, \"A small-scale, black economy began to revolve around the demand for designer footwear\u2026 It mostly revolved around gangs of young men who went to and fought at football games\u2026 'casuals'.\" Then, as now, youth unemployment was high and rising, but hard times only made the suddenly proliferating trainer styles more seductive. And what could not be afforded could be shoplifted: \"Many of the Adidas trainers sported by scousers were 'acquired' on trips to various European countries,\" supporting the Liverpool team, writes fellow Trainers contributor John Connolly.</p> <p>During the 80s and 90s, trainer fetishism grew from a subculture into the dominant culture of young footwear fashion. Endorsements by rappers and sportsmen, advances in shoe technology, more informal dress codes, modern ostentatiousness and materialism \u2013 \"the sneaker way of life\" emerged from and furthered all these trends. Between 1982 and 1995, sales of sneakers nearly doubled in the US. In 1990 Foot&#xa0;Locker arrived in Britain.</p> <p>The mainstreaming of trainer culture did not remove its lawless side. On the contrary, by the early 90s stories about people being mugged or murdered for their trainers, and about the symbolically charged role of trainers in gang life and drug dealing, were a media staple. In 1996, a face-off between members of rival gangs in a Foot Locker in California was reportedly one of the causes of the murder of the rapper <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupac_Shakur\" title=\"\">Tupac Shakur</a>.</p> <p>For all its watchful staff and in-store cameras, there is a hint of resignation in the company's attitude to disorder in its shops. When I asked what lessons it drew from the looting of its stores in riots, the emailed response was: \"We&#xa0;have procedures to ensure the safety of our associates and customers in such circumstances.\" Store employees, the email continued, were given \"ongoing training\" to deal with \"such events\". Did Foot Locker think looting of its shops could ever be totally prevented? \"No, but good communication with local [law and order] authorities can help to maximise safety and minimise losses.\" When I asked whether the company felt the \"sneaker way of life\" had any broader social downsides, I received no reply.</p> <p>Staff in the shops repeatedly say company policy forbids them talking to journalists. Foot Locker's PR companies, Hill + Knowlton and Frank PR, send countless holding emails, then finally suggest that a brand manager in the US head office might be able to talk on the phone. Then Hill + Knowlton call to say that he is on \"annual leave\".</p> <p>Foot Locker's safety-first approach to its reputation has echoes of how the designer label Burberry protected its own a decade ago, after the actor and cocaine addict <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/may/05/features.review27\" title=\"\">Danniella Westbrook</a> and other unwelcome, usually working-class customers became associated with its clothes. Someone who used to work at Burberry recalls: \"We didn't talk about it [in public]. It was never even acknowledged. Not acknowledging it meant <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2004/apr/15/fashion.shopping\" title=\"\">the 'chav' thing</a> didn't travel.\"</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://www.retail-week.com/robert-clark/1200040.contributor\" title=\"\">Robert Clark</a>, a veteran analyst for Retail Week Knowledge Bank, says that for a chain store&#xa0;with good insurance, being looted can be double-edged. \"Your security director might be appalled, but your marketing director might think&#xa0;you've achieved something.\" In one sense, mobs of looters at your stores sends the same message as mobs of shoppers: people are desperate for your goods.</p> <p>But a reputation for regular trouble risks scaring&#xa0;off most customers. So, more subtly, does&#xa0;too relentless an association with streetwise young male shoppers. \"It's a fine line for Foot Locker,\" Clark says. \"They want to be a bit edgy, but if they become too edgy, parts of their customer base, such as older people, may increasingly go elsewhere.\"</p> <p>There is not much sign of that happening yet: in 2010 and 2011, despite the disorder at Foot Locker stores, annual profits were up, at close to $200m. But lasting damage can sometimes be done by looters. Six months on from the 2011 English riots, the Brixton branch remains boarded up, sections of wall still blackened from the fire. The premises are to let.</p> <p>Such closures matter because in the US, saturated with trainer outlets, the company is reducing its number of stores; Europe has been earmarked for expansion instead. But around the world Foot Locker must contend with economic stagnation, internet retail and competition from discount clothing chains and supermarkets. In Britain, sales per square foot \u2013 the key measure of retail performance \u2013 are over a third down from their peak in 2003.</p> <p>Vanderbilt describes the trainer as \"the emblematic product of the late 20th century\" \u2013 made by cheap labour, expensively marketed, compulsively purchased. In the 21st century, there are signs of that dominance slipping, thanks to the formal shoe revival, the fashionability of hiking boots and work boots, the renewed appetite for Doc Martens and a visible slowing down in the evolution of the trainer itself.</p> <p>On the wall displays in Foot Locker and other trainer shops these days, unlike in the 70s, 80s and 90s, there are few new shoe designs to bewilder or dazzle. Increasingly, retro styles rule.&#xa0;Trainer prices, except for the limited-edition, luxury brands sold elsewhere in designer&#xa0;stores, have barely risen for 10 years. After four decades, Foot Locker's \"sneaker way of&#xa0;life\" may be losing its power.</p>",

This account would be topped up only if Athens did indeed service its debts and implement reforms.</p> <p>Even this tough compromise could be undermined by a complicated row over the ECB's holdings of Greek bonds.

A highly confidential report by the so-called troika of senior officials from the European commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund is said to have concluded that even with the \u20ac325m extra savings painfully adopted by Athens this week Greek debt will still be 129% of GDP by 2020. The latest \u20ac3.3bn of savings agreed by the Papademos government and the bailout are supposed to deliver a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120% by then \u2013 the same as Italy's now. On that basis, sources say, the full bailout cannot be approved. The German news weekly Der Spiegel reports that a majority of eurogroup finance ministers are readying themselves for a collapse of the latest rescue package on Monday \u2013 or, at least, leaving it to a planned EU summit on 1 March to decide. \"Scepticism is especially strong among the AAA-rated states (Germany, Finland, the Netherlands) whether Greece can turn it around,\" said Maria Fekter, Austrian finance minister. \"The threat of a Greek default is not off the table.\" Her Dutch counterpart, Jan Kees de Jager, has already admitted that these countries would have voted against granting the \u20ac130bn bailout had the 17 eurogroup finance ministers met \u2013 as planned \u2013 on Wednesday. He said: \"The scenario we're trying to achieve is that Greece complies with all necessary measures and demands made by the international community in order to have a deal on the entire package \u2013 without a split.\" He spoke of unspecified \"alternative scenarios\" without such a deal. \"We expect the Greeks to rise to their responsibilities,\" Sch\u00e4uble's deputy Steffen Kampeter said. \"This coming Monday, we will see whether Greece delivers or whether we will be forced to decide on another course of action, one that is not desired.\" In Berlin officials rebutted widespread reports of a growing rift between Merkel, who backs Greece staying a member of the euro, and Sch\u00e4uble. Francois Fillon, French premier, effectively confirmed divisions within Berlin. But he urged France's allies \"not to play with\" a Greek default and strongly backed Athens: \"The Greeks have promised very important reforms. The Europeans now have to keep their commitments.\" In a seemingly endless tussle between stability and solidarity, finance ministers could end up agreeing to the bailout but only in tranches \u2013 with the first one, required for Greece to repay \u20ac14.5bn of debt by 20 March, held in an escrow account. This account would be topped up only if Athens did indeed service its debts and implement reforms. Even this tough compromise could be undermined by a complicated row over the ECB's holdings of Greek bonds. The eurozone central bank is arguing that these should not be written down in the same way as the 70% \"haircuts\" to be suffered by private investors. The latter, in turn, are enraged.",

    "webTitle": "Retail spending rise boosts hopes UK can avoid double-dip recession", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bargain-hunting consumers eased government fears of a double-dip recession on Friday with the sharpest monthly increase in retail spending since the Royal Wedding last spring. Shares rose and the pound strengthened after the release of data from the Office for National Statistics showing that the volume of spending in the high street and online rose by 0.9% in January. The increase \u2013 which represented the first back-to-back rises in December and January for eight years \u2013 was greeted with incredulity in the City, which had been braced for a 0.4% fall in retail sales volumes. Analysts said that while the strength of consumer activity sharply reduced the chances of a second successive quarter of negative growth it was likely that spending would fall back over the coming months. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The retail sales figures for January were far stronger than expected. After the December increase, which was affected by heavy pre-Christmas discounting, most analysts expected a small fall in January. This increase shows that the economy is slowly improving and supports our view that GDP will return to positive growth in the first quarter of the year.\" The Office for National Statistics said internet shopping and sales of household goods had been especially strong last month, but clothing and footwear \u2013 where many retailers cut prices before Christmas \u2013 saw weaker trading conditions. Last month's increase followed a 0.6% rise in December and meant that retail sales volumes in the three months to January \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures \u2013 were up by 1.3% on the previous quarter. Some analysts cautioned that the heavy seasonal adjustment of the raw spending figures at the turn of the year made interpreting the data difficult. Even so, the government will be relieved that spending appears to be holding up despite the squeeze on incomes caused by high inflation, rising unemployment, a weak housing market and the crisis in the eurozone. Retail sales account for less than half of total consumer spending, and do not include the purchase of cars or eating out. The ONS said that its measure of inflation in the high street \u2013 the annual retail sales deflator \u2013 fell to 2.2% last month, its lowest level since November 2009. Ministers are hoping that lower inflation will boost real income growth during the course of 2012. Helen Roberts, analyst with the pollsters GfK NOP, said: \"Our own data shows that there has been a slight improvement over the last couple of months in how consumers feel about their financial situation. When you combine this with an extended sales season in December and January, when people tend to do a lot of their major purchasing for the year, these figures are perhaps not that surprising. \"It's worth remembering that while an upbeat mood may exist in the new year it doesn't necessarily mean that it will last beyond January. Our research suggests that people plan to spend less this year across a number of areas, including big ticket items. When you combine this outlook with downbeat economic and unemployment figures, this may be the high point of the next few months for retailers.\" Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, said: \"These figures are a bolt from the blue and are at odds with the much softer survey data. The 0.9% monthly increase in retail sales was unexpected, especially on top of the strong rise in December. There is always a big question mark over the December and January figures because of the huge seasonal effects, so we do treat these figures with a degree of caution. \"Heavy discounting still seems to be the main driver for the rise in sales, with retailers continuing to slash prices to sustain market share. This is clearly an unsustainable strategy and it is difficult to see these sort of growth rates being sustained.\" Snow business Britain's biggest department store chain John Lewis said sales rose last week as the heavy snow prompted a flurry of internet shopping. The employee-owned retailer said on Friday its sales rose 4.1% to \u00a352.3m in the week to February 11. \"The start of the week saw the cold wind of winter bite with snow across much of the east and south of the country but overall we had a positive week \u2014 an endorsement of our multi-channel approach as customers chose to keep warm and shop online,\" said director David Barford. \"The start of the week had the biggest snow impact with a 22.3% drop on last year. The remainder of the week saw some great bounce backs.\"",

This increase shows that the economy is slowly improving and supports our view that GDP will return to positive growth in the first quarter of the year.\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said internet shopping and sales of household goods had been especially strong last month, but clothing and footwear \u2013 where many retailers cut prices before Christmas \u2013 saw weaker trading conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-386133115\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/2/17/1329493407471/Retail-sales---January-20-001.jpg\" alt=\"Retail sales - January 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"357\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retail sales - January 2012</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month's increase followed a 0.6% rise in December and meant that retail sales volumes in the three months to January \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month's figures \u2013 were up by 1.3% on the previous quarter.</p> <p>Some analysts cautioned that the heavy seasonal adjustment of the raw spending figures at the turn of the year made interpreting the data difficult. Even so, the government will be relieved that spending appears to be holding up despite the squeeze on incomes caused by high inflation, rising unemployment, a weak housing market and the crisis in the eurozone.</p> <p>Retail sales account for less than half of total consumer spending, and do not include the purchase of cars or eating out. The ONS said that its measure of inflation in the high street \u2013 the annual retail sales deflator \u2013 fell to 2.2% last month, its lowest level since November 2009. Ministers are hoping that lower inflation will boost real income growth during the course of 2012.</p> <p>Helen Roberts, analyst with the pollsters GfK NOP, said: \"Our own data shows that there has been a slight improvement over the last couple of months in how consumers feel about their financial situation. When you combine this with an extended sales season in December and January, when people tend to do a lot of their major purchasing for the year, these figures are perhaps not that surprising.</p> <p>\"It's worth remembering that while an upbeat mood may exist in the new year it doesn't necessarily mean that it will last beyond January. Our research suggests that people plan to spend less this year across a number of areas, including big ticket items. When you combine this outlook with downbeat economic and unemployment figures, this may be the high point of the next few months for retailers.\"</p> <p>Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, said: \"These figures are a bolt from the blue and are at odds with the much softer survey data. The 0.9% monthly increase in retail sales was unexpected, especially on top of the strong rise in December. There is always a big question mark over the December and January figures because of the huge seasonal effects, so we do treat these figures with a degree of caution.</p> <p>\"Heavy discounting still seems to be the main driver for the rise in sales, with retailers continuing to slash prices to sustain market share. This is clearly an unsustainable strategy and it is difficult to see these sort of growth rates being sustained.\"</p> <h2>Snow business</h2> <p>Britain's biggest department store chain John Lewis said sales rose last week as the heavy snow prompted a flurry of internet shopping.</p> <p>The employee-owned retailer said on Friday its sales rose 4.1% to \u00a352.3m in the week to February 11.</p> <p>\"The start of the week saw the cold wind of winter bite with snow across much of the east and south of the country but overall we had a positive week \u2014 an endorsement of our multi-channel approach as customers chose to keep warm and shop online,\" said director David Barford.</p> <p>\"The start of the week had the biggest snow impact with a 22.3% drop on last year. The remainder of the week saw some great bounce backs.\"</p>",

It does show that the market is desperate for any information from the company, which has been lacking of late. We feel that the DECC approval and subsequent departure of the rig should provide major drivers for the share price. Any conversion of contingent resources into reserves should also enhance valuation. We continue coverage with a buy recommendation and target price of 242p.",

      "bodyText": "Virgin Atlantic is increasing efforts to block the takeover of bmi by its arch-rival IAG \u2013 the parent group of British Airways \u2013 by making a formal complaint to the European commission, claiming the merger would create local monopolies and drive up fares. IAG, which owns BA and the Spanish airline Iberia, beat Virgin to the acquisition of bmi from Lufthansa in a \u00a3172.5m deal last December that would give it more than half of the takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow. Virgin's new submission to the commission, which has responsibility for competition matters in the EU, says the takeover would leave three key domestic routes as BA monopolies, allowing the airline to increase fares dramatically in the absence of an alternative carrier for passengers. Bmi is the second-largest airline flying out of Heathrow. According to Virgin, since bmi withdrew its flights to Glasgow in 2011, leaving BA as the sole operator on the route, fares have risen by 34% and the number of flights has nearly halved. BA said it had added 4,000 seats a week on Heathrow-Glasgow services last year. Sir Richard Branson, president of Virgin Atlantic, said: \"This takeover would take British flying back to the dark ages. BA has a track record of dominating routes, forcing less flying and higher prices. This move is clearly about knocking out the competition. The regulators cannot allow British Airways to sew up UK flying and squeeze the life out of the travelling public. It is vital that regulatory authorities, in the UK as well as in Europe, give this merger the fullest possible scrutiny and ensure it is stopped.\" Virgin fears that connecting passengers who currently change at Heathrow from bmi on to other airlines would be shepherded on to BA flights once the deal goes through. The commission could give the go-ahead to the merger in mid-March or defer a decision. IAG said on Thursday it was confident that the authorities would approve the deal, and pointed out that its biggest European rivals had a greater share of slots at their respective national hub airports. A spokesman said: \"Selling bmi to IAG offers the best solution for British consumers and UK plc, securing more jobs than if the airline was broken up and sold off for its Heathrow slots. \"This deal is the only option for safeguarding services to the UK regions.\"",

IAG said on Thursday it was confident that the authorities would approve the deal, and pointed out that its biggest European rivals had a greater share of slots at their respective national hub airports.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Selling bmi to IAG offers the best solution for British consumers and UK plc, securing more jobs than if the airline was broken up and sold off for its Heathrow slots.</p> <p>\"This deal is the only option for safeguarding services to the UK regions.\"</p>",
