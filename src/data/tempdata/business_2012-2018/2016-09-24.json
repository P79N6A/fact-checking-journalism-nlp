      "bodyText": "This week reminded us that the government\u2019s default narratives on welfare spending and government debt and deficit falter in the face of reality. The big story about welfare this week was that the worries about growing numbers of people staying on welfare was not that big a problem. The minister for social services, Christian Porter, released a report which examined the dependence of certain groups on the welfare system over the course of their lives. The report contained some pretty dodgy budget figures that were best ignored but the report itself was worthwhile and instructive. Conservative governments often struggle with welfare, given their default position that it is a \u201cproblem\u201d that requires cutting. They aren\u2019t helped by friendly media outlets so desperate to push the idea of those on welfare as bludgers that they will rush to paint youth as such on their front pages, regardless of the facts. The struggle is compounded by the findings of reports, such as that released this week, which show the biggest driver of welfare spending is the age pension, and that those who remain on welfare for lengthy periods are in small and very specific groups. That reality doesn\u2019t look good on a tabloid front page and so that rather benign information is smothered with large hypothetical figures. Joe Hockey tried this approach last year in his much criticised Intergenerational Report. That report actually predicted all welfare payments would decrease by 2055 as a proportion of GDP except for the age pension and the carer payment \u2013 both of which are linked to our ageing population. To his credit, despite the inclusion of big numbers about \u201clifetime costs\u201d, Porter this week did try to swim against the flow of welfare bashing by talking instead of the failures of the system. He spoke movingly at the National Press Club about the plight of youth who are forced to care for their parents and who remain in the welfare system due to a lack of education and employment experience. He also talked of a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to help such people. The pull of the old narrative, however, was often too strong to resist. Fifteen years ago the base level of Newstart was equivalent to being on the poverty line; now it is equal to being 30% below that line. But Porter quickly dismissed propositions from organisations such as Acoss about the inadequacy of the base level of the payment as exaggerated because \u201conly 5%\u201d of those on Newstart receive only Newstart. That receiving rent assistance, carer allowance, or the family tax benefit resolved questions of the \u201cadequacy\u201d of Newstart is a rather alarming proposition from the man with carriage of the program. Similarly, Porter dismissed concerns about the government\u2019s proposed policy of a four-week wait before being able to access Newstart. He suggested that \u201cit may well be challenging for a very short period of time\u201d but he insisted, because in his view it would prevent people from entering the welfare system, it would be a \u201chuge win\u201d. Yet he already noted that only 5% of those on Newstart were only on Newstart, therefore in reality many of these people would already be in the \u201cwelfare system\u201d. And the very report he was trumpeting noted that the numbers of people on working-age welfare payments such as Newstart was almost perfectly correlated with the unemployment rate. Not surprisingly, what keeps people on Newstart is not the level of Newstart, but whether or not there are jobs available. The rhetoric on the dangers of debt and deficit was also hit by reality this week when the new governor of the RBA, Dr Philip Lowe, appeared before the House economics committee. He suggested that cutting interest rates was nearing the end of its usefulness and that to spur growth the government instead should take advantage of \u201cthe low interest rates to increase its spending\u201d. Lowe argued the government should borrow money to fund infrastructure projects, which in turn would improve productivity and drive growth. But throughout the election the narrative from the government \u2013 and the ALP \u2013 was of the terrible danger of Australia losing its AAA credit rating should spending not be brought \u201cunder control\u201d. Lowe, however, argued there was little to fear from such an occurrence. Rather than preach fear, he suggested the ratings were really just a \u201cuseful reminder\u201d about the need to watch government spending growth and would have little material effect on the government\u2019s borrowing costs. It is unlikely the government will change its narrative, but you would think at some point it might realise that if you are going to get people to agree with your policies, perhaps basing them on reality might be a good way to start.",

      "bodyText": "Winter is coming, or so Britain\u2019s downtrodden fashion chiefs hope after a summer to forget. Last week\u2019s profit warning from womenswear retailer Bonmarch\u00e9, which wiped 25% off the value of the company\u2019s shares, underlined how damaging the wrong sort of weather can be for chains. The Indian summer had put a dampener on sales of new season winter coats and jumpers, said chief executive Helen Connolly of the value retailer, which only two months ago had bemoaned a lack of sunshine. And Bonmarch\u00e9 has not been alone this year in complaining about wintry summers and summery winters, with some of the high street\u2019s biggest names \u2013 from Next to H&amp;M, River Island and even fast-fashion juggernaut Primark \u2013 struggling to trade through topsy-turvy seasons. The malaise is making analysts worried about the fortunes of market leader Marks &amp; Spencer, which in July reported its worst quarter of clothing sales in eight years, and is not due to update the City until November. In the wake of last week\u2019s weaker-than-expected figures from H&amp;M, Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman warns that the slow start to the new season could force retailers to offer discounts. \u201cWe expect that H&amp;M and the industry more broadly have more stock than planned for at this point in the year, which could again lead to higher than expected markdown,\u201d she says. This is bad news for an industry that is struggling as Britons buy fewer new clothes, choosing to spend spare cash on going out. All Bar One owner Mitchells &amp; Butlers, for example, toasted the recent hot spell as it drove more punters into its pubs. \u201cThe weather is a perennial excuse for poor performance, but I do think that ... it has become a more valid reason for [it],\u201d says Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders. A crowded and competitive marketplace and reliance on discounting to shift stock are also behind the sector\u2019s woes, he says, adding: \u201cGiven the weather is not going to behave any time soon, retailers need to look at how they can shift their models to be more reactive to sudden changes.\u201d One of the retailers still managing to thrive is the Inditex-owned Zara chain, which last week bucked the trend by reporting strong figures. The Spanish group, which manufactures and designs its own clothing, is uniquely placed to react to catwalk trends and erratic seasons, getting clothes from factory to store within days. Saunders says retailers should be trying to move away from traditional seasonal stock changes by putting more focus on \u201clayering\u201d \u2013 which allows for warm- and cold-weather lines to be stocked together. Buying some products on shorter production runs would allow chains to react to weather changes, he suggests. M&amp;S tested this in May, selling pieces of its autumn collection in store at the same time as it showed them to fashion press. But other forces are also bearing down, with Next boss Lord Wolfson pointing to the influence of falling real wage growth on high-street sentiment. At its recent trading update, the Tory peer described a volatile sales picture with wildly different figures emerging from stores around the country, as autumn arrived in Aberdeen, but Londoners were still trooping to work in flip-flops. The divergence made it hard to gauge whether winter ranges were a hit or a miss, he said. \u201cConsumers are not buying stock unless they absolutely need and want it \u2026 that\u2019s a symptom of underlying weakness in consumer demand.\u201d The Met Office\u2019s long-range forecast for October suggests the unsettled weather will continue but it promises \u201cincreasing chance of chilly nights and frosts\u201d.

    "webTitle": "From catwalk to checkout: how Burberry is trying to reinvent retail", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Burberry models wafted down the catwalk at London fashion week in outfits inspired by Virginia\u2019s Woolf\u2019s Orlando, it wasn\u2019t the ornate drummer-boy jackets and ruff-collared shirts that stole the show. The hottest runway trend was instant shopping, as the British brand turned its catwalk into a living and breathing shop window. Fans were suddenly able to buy the equestrian-inspired leopard-print bridle bags or shearling jackets that previously they could only have coveted on social media straightaway \u2013 albeit for price tags larger than the average monthly mortgage payment. \u201cI think this can be seen as significant in the sense that when Burberry said it was going to do this, it was essentially rewriting how things are done [in fashion] and the point of a traditional catwalk show,\u201d says Graeme Moran, head of content at the fashion-industry bible Drapers. \u201cIf you go back 100 years, catwalks used to be small, private events that brands put on to show buyers, and eventually the press and clients, what they were doing. It can be argued that the catwalk has now become a platform to speak to customers, rather than the industry,\u201d he says. Burberry \u2013 along with brands such as Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, which also proffered their own shoppable runway collections at New York fashion week \u2013 is at the vanguard of what the fashion industry refers to as the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model. It might not sound like a phenomenon to most people, but this is not how the fashion industry has traditionally worked. There is normally a six-month time lag between catwalk shows and designer clothes arriving in department stores and boutiques around the world. The delay means that fashion editors are usually writing about next year\u2019s shorts and sundresses just as the rest of us are digging out our winter coats. This interregnum also enables nimble high-street chains to piggyback on emerging trends and get cheaper versions of standout styles into store. The backdrop to all this has been the rise of digital media, which has turned runway shows into powerful consumer marketing events that brands cannot cash in on if products have not yet even been produced. Burberry\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Bailey, described the show as a \u201cspecial moment\u201d that was the \u201cculmination of a series of important changes we made, designed to bring our collections closer to our customer. \u201cThe changes we are making will allow us to build a closer connection between the experience that we create with our runway shows and the moment when people can physically explore the collections for themselves,\u201d he said. The usual fashion business cycle sees buyers examining new collections in the wake of the runway show and then placing their orders. But, this year, Burberry let important buyers and press view its new designs back in July, provided they agreed to keep its secrets. Rather than the world\u2019s most beautiful women parading the key looks around the room, it is understood the industry\u2019s power brokers studied mannequins on a rotating carousel in a showroom at its London headquarters. \u201cOur brand is about moving forward,\u201d Bailey told the Financial Times after Monday\u2019s show. \u201cBut we\u2019re testing things out, seeing what we will be able to [do] better in future. We\u2019ve had to look at every facet of the business, from the suppliers, factories, media, every level of the process, to see how it works. And we\u2019ll learn from this and build from there.\u201d Despite its 160 years in fashion, Burberry has not resisted the encroachment of technology. It was one of the first luxury brands to embrace digital and social media, with a ground-breaking runway show streamed on Facebook, as well as YouTube and WeChat. But it may be harder for smaller brands to follow Burberry\u2019s lead. The FTSE 100 trenchcoat maker, which has a market value of around \u00a36bn, is able to shake up its supply chain because it has a lot of control: the company owns a number of factories and has an extensive company-run store network. By closing the time gap and effectively hanging price tags out on the runway, Burberry is primed to cash in on the latent sales potential within the social media buzz. But other brands may struggle to follow suit because of the upheaval involved, says Moran. \u201cAll the brands definitely can\u2019t,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019d spoken to a number of people who said \u2018I\u2019d love to but it just doesn\u2019t work for us\u2019 and others who said \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want that to be how we worked\u2019. \u201cBurberry is a global brand with a huge network of stores and its own e-commerce platform. A small-to-medium-sized brand working from a studio in east London can\u2019t physically do it. Making people change the way they work is only something that brands of Burberry\u2019s influence can do. Burberry has the power to say, \u2018You\u2019re not in charge any more\u2019.\u201d Smaller brands have started to test out what this new faster fashion model can do for sales, with British designers Alice Temperley and Oliver Spencer using fledgling social media platform Vero to enable fans of their designs to purchase pieces from their recent fashion-week collections. Temperley, who is on the British Fashion Council advisory board, said the tactic had enabled the brand to get closer to its customers: \u201cThis is a dynamic industry and we need to embrace change.\u201d Vero\u2019s chief executive, Ayman Hariri, says that rather than have an algorithm lobbing ads at its members, users have chosen to hear from brands they like in their news feeds, so companies are pushing on an open door. \u201cWhereas in the noughties the website was the method brands used to connect with their audience, today it is social networks and apps,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018See now, buy now\u2019 is a big step into the future and it will take time for brands to come to terms with it, as it requires a lot of investment ahead of time in order to have the stock ready. Time will tell how it shapes up.\u201d While the Burberry show had a romantic, ethereal quality in keeping with Woolf\u2019s classic novel, the company\u2019s dealings with investors are more down to earth amid tough market conditions. Last year, profits were down 10% as a result of flagging demand for luxury goods in markets such as China and Russia, and it is cutting costs to improve its financial performance. The point of \u201csee now, buy now\u201d is ultimately to sell clothes and the City will be poring over its next set of figures to get a sense of how far this leap into the unknown has taken the brand. \u201cI think the jury is out on this model, even though the logic is sound,\u201d says Lorna Hall, head of market intelligence, at trend forecaster WGSN. \u201cWhy wait six months to sell your products when you\u2019ve just spent millions of pounds creating a big hullabaloo?\u201d Hall points out that the whole industry has not jumped on the bandwagon, with the major Italian and French labels yet to get involved. \u201cBurberry and Tommy Hilfiger have a position because they are very digitally focused and that has pushed them further into this space than anybody else,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think it will be evolution, not revolution. Everyone will wait and see what kind of impact it has on Burberry\u2019s sales.\u201d Moran confesses that the day after the Burberry show, he popped into a store to try on a shirt that caught his eye on the runway. \u201cI had been hooked in by \u2018see now, buy now\u2019 and went in to try it on \u2013 and it was sold out. I had been sucked in and obviously a number of other people had been, too.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As Burberry models wafted down the catwalk at London fashion week in outfits inspired by Virginia\u2019s Woolf\u2019s <em>Orlando</em>, it wasn\u2019t the ornate drummer-boy jackets and ruff-collared shirts that stole the show.</p> <p>The hottest runway trend was instant shopping, as the British brand turned its catwalk into a living and breathing shop window. Fans were suddenly able to buy the equestrian-inspired leopard-print bridle bags or shearling jackets that previously they could only have coveted on social media straightaway \u2013 albeit for price tags larger than the average monthly mortgage payment.</p> <p>\u201cI think this can be seen as significant in the sense that when Burberry said it was going to do this, it was essentially rewriting how things are done [in fashion] and the point of a traditional catwalk show,\u201d says Graeme Moran, head of content at the fashion-industry bible <em>Drapers</em>.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go back 100 years, catwalks used to be small, private events that brands put on to show buyers, and eventually the press and clients, what they were doing. It can be argued that the catwalk has now become a platform to speak to customers, rather than the industry,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Burberry \u2013 along with brands such as Tom Ford, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, which also proffered their own shoppable runway collections at New York fashion week \u2013 is at the vanguard of what the fashion industry refers to as the \u201csee now, buy now\u201d model.</p> <p>It might not sound like a phenomenon to most people, but this is not how the fashion industry has traditionally worked. There is normally a six-month time lag between catwalk shows and designer clothes arriving in department stores and boutiques around the world. The delay means that fashion editors are usually writing about next year\u2019s shorts and sundresses just as the rest of us are digging out our winter coats.</p> <p>This interregnum also enables nimble high-street chains to piggyback on emerging trends and get cheaper versions of standout styles into store.</p> <p>The backdrop to all this has been the rise of digital media, which has turned runway shows into powerful consumer marketing events that brands cannot cash in on if products have not yet even been produced.</p> <p>Burberry\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Bailey, described the show as a \u201cspecial moment\u201d that was the \u201cculmination of a series of important changes we made, designed to bring our collections closer to our customer.</p> <p>\u201cThe changes we are making will allow us to build a closer connection between the experience that we create with our runway shows and the moment when people can physically explore the collections for themselves,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The usual fashion business cycle sees buyers examining new collections in the wake of the runway show and then placing their orders. But, this year, Burberry let important buyers and press view its new designs back in July, provided they agreed to keep its secrets. Rather than the world\u2019s most beautiful women parading the key looks around the room, it is understood the industry\u2019s power brokers studied mannequins on a rotating carousel in a showroom at its London headquarters.</p> <p>\u201cOur brand is about moving forward,\u201d Bailey told the <em>Financial Times</em> after Monday\u2019s show. \u201cBut we\u2019re testing things out, seeing what we will be able to [do] better in future. We\u2019ve had to look at every facet of the business, from the suppliers, factories, media, every level of the process, to see how it works. And we\u2019ll learn from this and build from there.\u201d</p> <p>Despite its 160 years in fashion, Burberry has not resisted the encroachment of technology. It was one of the first luxury brands to embrace digital and social media, with a ground-breaking runway show streamed on Facebook, as well as YouTube and WeChat.</p> <p>But it may be harder for smaller brands to follow Burberry\u2019s lead. The FTSE 100 trenchcoat maker, which has a market value of around \u00a36bn, is able to shake up its supply chain because it has a lot of control: the company owns a number of factories and has an extensive company-run store network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"363db9dfc4c4c51029150326b7d2b749e2481a41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363db9dfc4c4c51029150326b7d2b749e2481a41/0_278_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Burberry shop in central Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Burberry shop in central Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By closing the time gap and effectively hanging price tags out on the runway, Burberry is primed to cash in on the latent sales potential within the social media buzz.

      "bodyText": "When Sports Direct caved in to pressure last week and accepted an external review of how it treats its workers, it was a sweet victory for Janet Williamson. Williamson is head of corporate governance at the TUC and oversees Trade Union Share Owners (Tuso), a handful of union pension funds that got together three years ago to vote for change at companies\u2019 annual general meetings. It was Tuso\u2019s resolution, at Sports Direct\u2019s AGM on 7 September, that called for an independent review of its treatment of workers and corporate governance, and it was backed by a majority of independent shareholders \u2013 so excluding owner Mike Ashley. Ashley had tried to head off unrest by commissioning his own review and a further report by a law firm close to him but to no avail. Though the vote was not binding, shareholders made an independent review a condition for letting chairman Keith Hellawell remain and on Tuesday Ashley caved in. To get the resolution through, Williamson forged an unlikely alliance \u2013 with City fund managers. Now she wants to build on this success to give unions a lasting influence on how big shareholders treat companies that exploit workers. The Guardian\u2019s revelations about conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse last year had drawn attention to poor treatment of workers at the company, and shareholders, already unhappy about how Sports Direct was run, were incensed. The Unite union had long campaigned against Sports Direct and Tuso held a seminar for investors a year ago on insecure work that used Sports Direct as a case study. After Tuso wrote to leading shareholders asking them to vote against Hellawell at the September 2015 AGM, opposition to the chairman increased. Williamson says: \u201cSports Direct was clearly a company that was on the horizons of investors so we felt there was an opportunity to join forces with them in raising the issues we wanted to raise.\u201d The resolution calling for an independent review of working practices and governance was filed in March, after Williamson scraped together enough shares to get over the minimum threshold. But to have an impact it needed support from City fund managers \u2013 not the most likely of allies for the unions. The alliance was cemented in July, when Tuso met about 30 investors at the TUC\u2019s office in London. Unite presented evidence about Sports Direct and fund managers asked questions. Everyone invited turned up, Williamson says. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, one of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers, says: \u201cThe information they shared and put in front of shareholders had a noticeable effect on people\u2019s views on the company and I think it hardened investors\u2019 line on what was needed.\u201d At the AGM on 7 September the resolution passed \u2013 the biggest-ever vote in favour of a resolution on employment matters at a UK AGM: 57% failed to support the board\u2019s call for shareholders to vote against the resolution. In her speech at the TUC conference a few days after the AGM, Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary, said Sports Direct was a warning to others with a \u201cbig brand but a dirty little secret \u2026 we are coming for you\u201d. She promised to win over shareholders, use the courts and persuade customers to get fair treatment for all workers. Williamson says low pay, zero-hours contracts and other employment issues have now shot up the agenda for politicians, shareholders and consumers. \u201cWe hope this resolution will show to companies that if they don\u2019t act responsibly on employment practices they may be the target of a similar campaign; and we hope we have shown to investors the benefits of engaging with us over employment issues.\u201d Now she is picking new targets, which could include retailers, where low pay and poor working conditions are common, and airlines with pilots on zero-hours contracts. Companies that are not publicly quoted, such as \u201cgig economy\u201d businesses and care home operators backed by private equity firms, could also be targeted through their investors, she says. It remains to be seen whether Sports Direct marks a turning point as a precedent or is just a cause celebre that has fleetingly concentrated the minds of investors, who will accept tough but not terrible working conditions. Aberdeen\u2019s Lee says: \u201cThere may be cases where investors will say: \u2018Yes, we understand that life could be nicer for the workforce but this is the nature of the business and while it\u2019s legal and the company has effective management structures, so that it\u2019s not causing problems with consumers and so on, why would investors intervene to increase the costs of the business?\u2019\u201d But Williamson reckons things are changing. In the wake of the Sports Direct controversy, several big employers, including JD Wetherspoon, Greene King and Everyman cinemas have all announced plans to scrap zero-hours contracts this month. Only one City investor, she says, has told her profit is its priority, rather than treatment of workers. \u201cI hope investors who supported our resolution are pleased to have been part of something that is sending a signal that customers, ordinary people, investors and workers will not accept these poor employment practices,\u201d she says. \u201cPerhaps the tide is turning.\u201d",

In the wake of the Sports Direct controversy, several big employers, including JD Wetherspoon, Greene King and Everyman cinemas have all announced plans to scrap zero-hours contracts this month.</p> <p>Only one City investor, she says, has told her profit is its priority, rather than treatment of workers. \u201cI hope investors who supported our resolution are pleased to have been part of something that is sending a signal that customers, ordinary people, investors and workers will not accept these poor employment practices,\u201d she says. \u201cPerhaps the tide is turning.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Being an oil producer used to mean dealing with luxury problems for many members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). Not anymore. With the oil price still bumping along sustained lows, many of those countries are in crisis. Opec will gather for the third time this year on Monday to discuss crude-oil market conditions. But whether the cartel can finally reach a consensus about what to do remains questionable. Overproduction of oil, powered by a desire to see off a threat from the US shale industry, has sent oil prices into a prolonged slump and caused economic turmoil for many of Opec\u2019s members. Attempts by some member-states such as Venezuela, suffering the worst economic crisis in its history, to persuade Opec to return to its traditional role of ensuring price stability versus seeking market share were ignored, despite the policy\u2019s economic toll. All member-states are feeling the impact of lower oil prices to some degree, with poorer countries like Venezuela affected to a much greater degree than wealthier countries like Saudi Arabia. Opec is slated to meet informally in Algiers, and hopes rose last week following comments from Opec\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, that this gathering could be formalized if the group\u2019s ministers reach an agreement. Scott Roberts, co-head of the high yield team for Invesco Fixed Income with a focus on energy, said he\u2019s doubtful that anything meaningful will occur. \u201cI think unfortunately this is an opportunity for photo ops, handshakes and hugs,\u201d Roberts said. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said Opec called this confab because of the persistent low prices seen during the past few months. Since topping out in June at just over $50 a barrel for both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude oil, prices swooned to near $40 barrel in early August, days before the meeting\u2019s announcement. While that\u2019s well above the year\u2019s low of sub-$30 for both types of oil, prices are far under where they were in late 2014 when Opec embarked on its goal to seek market share. Brent crude lost $1.76, or 3.7%, on Friday as traders worried about the Opec meeting, ending the day at $45.89 a barrel. Comments about a possible production freeze by Opec\u2019s dominant member, Saudi Arabia, and conciliatory talk from Russia, a key non-Opec producer, also gave oil markets a temporary lift last month on hopes that perhaps something might be done, Hansen and Roberts said. Roberts said the soothing words were a smart strategy and a \u201ccheap option\u201d by the Saudis to support prices, but he wonders whether the kingdom didn\u2019t sacrifice any long-term credibility if nothing comes to pass. After all, Hansen noted, it was the Saudis who scuttled a possible deal in April when Opec held an extraordinary meeting in Doha. \u201cWhat will be interesting this time around will be to watch the rhetoric of the Saudis,\u201d he said. Jay Hatfield, co-founder and president of Infrastructure Capital Advisors and portfolio manager of the InfraCap Active MLP exchange-traded fund, said if an agreement to freeze production is announced at this meeting, people need to look beyond the simple headlines. That\u2019s because Opec is already overproducing about 1.5m barrels a day above its stated daily quota of 31.5m barrels. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between maintaining production and cutting it,\u201d Hatfield said. Except for a few countries like Libya and Nigeria, which have reduced production because of internal strife, many Opec producers are nearing maximum production, they said. So agreeing to a freeze at current high levels won\u2019t change the fact that Opec is the main reason why there\u2019s still an oversupply of oil globally. That overproduction means there\u2019s no need to tap the bulging inventories around the world, either. And without an agreement from non-Opec producers such as Russia, Opec likely won\u2019t budge because it doesn\u2019t want to lose market share, they said. Unless Opec meaningfully cuts production, oil prices aren\u2019t likely to move out of their current $40 to $50 range this year. It\u2019s possible that values may stay at the lower end of that level in the short-term because demand is looking shaky. Although US gasoline use was a record this year, Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said it still wasn\u2019t enough to draw down inventories. Those inventories won\u2019t come down anytime soon, either. Haworth, Roberts and Hatfield said the US is about to enter the \u201cshoulder season\u201d where people don\u2019t drive as much as they do in the summer and the weather is mild enough to not require heating oil. Then there\u2019s the International Energy Agency\u2019s reduced forecast for global oil demand for 2017, citing economic uncertainty, which may mean the imbalance between supply and demand will likely continue for now. For oil supply and demand to balance, Haworth said global production will need to drop enough that users start to tap the world\u2019s voluminous inventories, which he believes won\u2019t occur until 2017. Roberts said the earliest that may happen is spring 2017. If so, oil prices may finally rise above $50, he said. But not by much. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we go back to $100 oil. Even if it\u2019s in the $55 to $60 range, that\u2019s an improvement,\u201d Roberts said.",
