Here\u2019s what he told reporters in Washington (during a press conference with Italy\u2019s PM) Greece needs to initiate reforms; they need to collect taxes; they need to reduce their bureaucracy. When the new PM (Alexis Tsipras) came in, I called him and recognised you need to show your people that there\u2019s hope, that you can grow, but you have to show those who are extending credit, who are supporting your financial system that you\u2019re trying to help yourself; that requires making the tough decisions. PS: Keep an eye on Paris this weekend for Greek developments: OK, it\u2019s been a long week, so let\u2019s nail the lid down with a particularly brisk catch-up. Greece has been given until May 11 to satisfy its creditors. EU commissioner Pierre Moscovici identified a eurogroup meeting that day as the final chance to reach agreement about economic reforms, to unlock \u20ac7bn of bailout funds. UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that the mood at this year\u2019s IMF Spring Meeting is notably gloomy; Greece hangs over every meeting, he claimed. Germany finance chief Wolfgang Schauble added to the gloom, saying there is no sign of a deal in the weeks ahead. But some of Greece\u2019s largest creditors will go \u201ca long way\u201d to keep it in the euro, says Bloomberg. Greek fears send shares down sharply in Europe today. The financial world has been disrupted by a major systems outage at Bloomberg. City workers say they were unable to trade for hours. While in the UK, the unemployment rate has hit its lowest since July 2008. Full coverage of that starts here. Have a good weekend all. GW Bloomberg are reporting tonight that some of Greece\u2019s largest creditors are unwilling to allow it to exit the eurozone. Here\u2019s a flavour Greece\u2019s major creditors are not ready to let the country drop out of the euro as long as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras shows willingness to meet at least some key demands, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Chancellor Angela Merkel will go a long way to prevent a Greek exit from the single currency, though only so far, one of the people said. Every possibility is being considered in Berlin to pull Greece back from the brink and keep it in the 19-nation euro, the person said. For all the foot-dragging in Athens, some creditors are willing to show Greece more flexibility in negotiations over its finances to prevent a euro exit, the second person said. The red line is that the Syriza-led government shows readiness to commit to at least some economic reform measures, said both people, who asked not to be named discussing strategy. \u201cOur view is that Greece is not going to exit the euro,\u201d Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management in London, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Friday. While both sides have \u201cvery entrenched positions\u201d in the negotiations, \u201cif you look at the way the euro-zone crisis has developed, in every case what you\u2019ve seen is in return for firm action you get concessions.\u201d Full story: Greece\u2019s Main Creditors Said to Be Unwilling to Allow Euro Exit And I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that those who are who are owed a lot of money by Greece don\u2019t want to risk a default. And here\u2019s one reason that Greece might have more funds at its disposal than some thing: Remember that claim that Greece was scraping the bottom of the barrel to meet its obligations? It\u2019s just been denied: GREECE DENIES REPORT THAT IT NEEDS TO TAP ALL REMAINING CASH RESERVES TO PAY PENSIONS AND WAGES - FINANCE MINISTRY After a day of heavy selling, European stock markets have all closed deep in the red tonight. The German DAX, Spanish IBEX and Italian FTSE MIB all tumbled more than 2%, as fears over Greece stalked the trading floors. The French CAC wasn\u2019t far behind, down 1.6%. In London, Grexit fears helped to blow the FTSE 100 index of top shares back below the 7,000 point mark. It lost fell 65 points, or almost 1%, to finish the day at 6994. Greece wasn\u2019t the only factor hitting shares, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Europe\u2019s stock markets extended a week of heavy losses on Friday, spooked by changes in Chinese trading regulations, an outage in Bloomberg terminals and Greece drifting closer to the brink. Having failed to hold onto new record highs yesterday, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 joined in on the selling frenzy and headed back below 7000, its lowest in over a week. Chinese regulators altered rules to encourage institutional short selling and banned trading on over the counter or non-exchange-listed securities using leverage. The rules were aimed at adding a bit more two-sidedness, but given Chinese equities have been going almost vertically up, that second side could only be down. The Bloomberg terminal outage delayed a UK treasury auction and no doubt delayed, if not prevented numerous other bond deals. The modern way of getting a trade done is through Bloomberg chat, so without it, traders were a bit at a loss. Of course there is always a telephone if the deal is urgent. Another flurry of newsflashes from Washington. This time, from Yanis Varoufakis following his meeting with ECB president, Mario Draghi. Bloomberg has denied that today\u2019s system wipeout was caused by a can of Coke being spilled on a server, as was rumoured earlier today: A weak end to the trading week: The selloff is accelerating in late trading; Germany\u2019s DAX is now down almost 2.5%, or 290 points. The Greek crisis is partly to blame. R.J. Grant, associate director of equity trading at KBW, has told WSJ that: \u201cObviously Greece is back in focus today, and there\u2019s a little bit of trepidation heading into the weekend.\u201d Earlier today, the European Commission revealed that technical officials involved with the negotiations will meet on Saturday. Just in: Bloomberg has said that its service is now \u201cfully restored\u201d after today\u2019s global wipe-out. It\u2019s not clear that Greece has enough funds to reach this new May 11 deadline, without any funds from its creditors. The government must pay public sector wages and pensions at the end of this month; Reuters is hearing that this will pretty much clear Athens\u2019 cash reserves out. That will make it tricky to meet \u20ac900m of IMF repayments due in May, but Greece could potentially tap other reserves, such as state pension funds. The Greek stock market has just posted a 3% tumble, as growing anxiety over Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone hit shares in Athens. Bank shares led the selloff, finishing the day down 5.5%. Here are George Osborne\u2019s full quotes on Greece\u2019s debt negotiations today, via our man in Washington, Phillip Inman: I would say that the situation in Greece is the one that at the moment is the most worrying for the global economy, and the discussions about Greece have pervaded every meeting. The mood is notably more gloomy than at the last international gathering and it\u2019s clear now to me that a misstep or a miscalculation on either side could easily return European economies to the kind of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago. The crunch appears now to be coming in May, and it would be a mistake to think that the UK would be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy, and of course it would be therefore the very worst moment for there to be any confusion about the direction of British economic policy or for a change of direction from the plan that we have pursued. That plan in the UK is building up resilience, and we need resilience for moments like this. Osborne also spoke about the UK: It\u2019s important to help countries affected by Ebola and I\u2019m proud that the UK is the largest contributor to the IMF trust. You will have heard the very positive comments about the British economy, and British economic policy, from the managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde and indeed from my German opposite number Wolfgang Schauble. And I agree with them that the British economy is one of the brighter spots in the world economy at the moment, and that\u2019s confirmed by the IMF forecasts which show the UK as the second fastest growing economy in the G7 in the next two years, having been the fastest growing in 2014. Which brought him onto today\u2019s unemployment data. And of course all of that has been more than reinforced by the employment figures we saw this morning, which show a record number of people in work. They show the claimant count at its lowest level since 1975 and they confirm that under this government two million jobs have been created. So the British economy is a job creating machine, and we have set out, as the Conservative Party, plans today to go on creating jobs \u2013 two million further jobs \u2013 in the next Parliament. The International Monetary Fund is adding its weight to the pressure on Greece to produce credible reforms soon. But crucially, one of its top officials - Poul Thomsen - has said that the programme also needs to be changed. Thomsen, as regular readers will remember, used to be the IMF\u2019s top man in the Troika: The IMF is also worried about the consequences if Greece doesn\u2019t have new financial support in place by the end of June (when its current bailout expires) Shares are falling sharply on Wall Street in early trading, matching the selloff in Europe today. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici has thrown down a challenge to Greece; you must produce a concrete set of reforms by May 11. Moscovici told the Financial Times that Athens must speed up its work, and deliver acceptable plans by the time finance ministers gather next month. There\u2019s not chance of a deal next week, he confirmed. Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs said: We\u2019ve got two meetings which are important. The April 24 meeting in Riga must not be a wasted moment; it must be a useful moment in which we see concrete progress in catching up with those reforms, and then the next meeting on May 11, which certainly must be decisive\u201d. The former French finance minister has been relatively optimistic about the Greek crisis in recent months. But he makes it clear that Athens has still not been \u201cprecise enough\u201d in its reform plans. \u201cWe are not talking about nothing. We are talking about things, but now we need to make progress\u201d. Moscovici warns Greece to agree to reforms or face default Over in Athens, meanwhile, the Greek media is full of accounts of Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s meeting with US president Barack Obama at the White House last night. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Though stand up and barely 12 minutes long, Yanis Varoufakis\u2019 meeting with the US president at a reception to mark Greek Independence Day, is being heartily played up by the media in Athens this morning. The two men exchanged views \u201cin a good climate\u201d with Barack Obama reportedly conveying his concerns of \u201can accident\u201d occurring if flexibility wasn\u2019t shown by all sides \u2013 and Athens in particular. Varoufakis \u2013 giving credence to statements made by his German counterpart Wolfgang Schauble earlier this week - announced that it was highly unlikely that any deal would be sealed at next week\u2019s euro group meeting of finance ministers in Riga. Developments had to be seen cumulatively, he insisted. The Greek finance minister was quoted as saying: \u201cThere has never been a key date. We have to see everything in combination and cumulatively. On the 24th there will not be a solution, there will be progress,\u201d That also squares with Wolfgang\u2019s Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s comments this morning.... Highlighting the role played by the debt-stricken country\u2019s creditors, Varoufakis added: \u201cWe have to be absolutely committed to our goal and absolutely integrated in the process in which we are participating with the IMF, ECB and EU.\u201d Varoufakis also highlighted the importance Athens\u2019 Syriza-led government was giving to the \u201cpost-June\u201d period when Greece\u2019s current bailout program (extended by four months in February) finally expires. \u201cThe issue is what we do in the post- June period. Our goal is a good agreement [after that date], an agreement with a different take on the situation from previous agreements which only prolonged the problem.\u201d Athens would not \u201cleave any stone unturned\u201d to get to it, he said. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also argued that the Greece\u2019s problem is the weak state of its economy, not its huge debt pile. He also downplayed the dangers posed by a potential Grexit: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAUBLE SAYS CANNOT SEE ANY CONTAGION IN THE MARKET FROM GREECE TROUBLES, MARKETS HAVE PRICED IN ALL POSSIBILITIES 15-Apr-2015 13:58 - GERMANY\u2019S SCHAUBLE SAYS PROBLEM WITH GREECE IS NOT ITS LOANS BUT LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS More gloom on Greece. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has just warned that there is \u201cno expectation\u201d of a solution to the Greek situation soon. Speaking in Washington, Sch\u00e4uble said Greece was in a \u201cvery difficult situation\u201d, and criticised the new government for hurting its economy (by demanding a new deal with its creditors) That suggests we should give up on hoping for a breakthrough at the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Riga, a week today. It also backs up George Osborne\u2019s gloomy tone. Reuters has snapped the key points: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAUBLE SAYS GREECE IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION GERMANY\u2019S SCHAUBLE SAYS NOBODY HAS AN IDEA HOW TO GET TO AN AGREEMENT ON AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM FOR GREECE GERMANY\u2019S SCHAUBLE SAYS THERE IS NO EXPECTATION FOR A SOLUTION TO GREEK FINANCIAL ISSUES IN THE NEXT WEEKS GERMANY\u2019S SCHAUBLE SAYS NEW GREEK GOVERNMENT HAS DAMAGED IMPROVING ECONOMIC TREND IN COUNTRY Another line from Osborne: OSBORNE SAYS NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR ANY CONFUSION ABOUT BRITISH ECONOMIC POLICIES OR POSSIBLE CHANGE IN DIRECTION A cynic might quietly suspect the chancellor was using the Greek crisis as a reason to vote Conservative next month George Osborne also told reporters in Washington that the UK would not be immune from the problems caused by a worsening in the Greek crisis. European stock markets remains deep in the red this afternoon, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 2% and the FTSE 100 off 0.9%, or 60 points. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote, says Greece is to blame: Investors are worried that Greece may default after rumors spread that Greece asked to delay its next debt payment to the IMF. If you\u2019re just tuning in, our opening post explains the state of play with Greece (no deal, not much optimism) Breaking: George Osborne has warned that the deadlock over Greece\u2019s bailout programme could trigger a repeat of the crisis which gripped the eurozone in 2011 and 2012. Speaking in Washington, at the IMF/G20 Spring Meeting, the UK chancellor declared that the mood is much more gloomy than last year, adding that one \u201cmisstep\u201d by either side could cause calamity. Greece\u2019s problems are pervading every discussion at this year\u2019s meeting, he claims. Here are the snaps off Reuters: UK FINANCE MINISTER OSBORNE SAYS MOOD AT IMF MEETINGS IS \u201cNOTABLY MORE GLOOMY\u201d THAN AT THE LAST INTERNATIONAL GATHERING OSBORNE SAYS GREECE IS MOST WORRYING ASPECT FOR GLOBAL ECONOMY OSBORNE: MISSTEP ON EITHER SIDE ON GREEK ISSUE COULD RETURN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES TO PERILOUS STATE OF 3-4 YEARS AGO OSBORNE: WOULD BE MISTAKE TO THINK UK WOULD BE IMMUNE FROM EUROPEAN PROBLEMS FROM ANY GREEK FALLOUT Osborne also touched on Greece\u2019s repayments to the IMF -- yesterday, Christine Lagarde was adamant that Athens should not be granted a delay. OSBORNE SAYS HE IS CONFIDENT THAT THE IMF, AS HIGHEST-TIER LENDER TO GREECE, CAN BE BETTER PROTECTED THAN OTHER POTENTIAL CREDITORS TO GREECE OSBORNE - IMF EXISTS TO HELP COUNTRIES IN TROUBLE, BUT GREECE\u2019S BIGGEST TROUBLE IS NOT ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH IMF BUT RELATIONSHIP WITH EURO ZONE The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the City, says it is monitoring the effect of the Bloomberg crash. A spokesman says: \u201cWe are aware of the issue and are monitoring the impact on our firms.\u201d I just chatted with Steve Collins, global head of dealing at asset management firm London &amp; Capital, about the Bloomberg crash. He says the outage was the worst he\u2019s seen in the City in over a decade. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it go down like this for ten or fifteen years. Bloomberg is usually the one stable thing; it\u2019s the thing that everyone can\u2019t live without.\u201d Traders on Steve\u2019s desk were left \u201ctwiddling their thumbs\u201d after their Bloomberg terminals went down. Calls to the Bloomberg helpline (apparently not terribly helpful on a good day) went unanswered, he said. \u201cBig banks will pump thousands of orders across Bloomberg, so the outage had quite an effect on the market.\u201d It was still possible to place orders by telephone, as in the days before computerisation reshaped the City, but is a more cumbersome, time-consuming process. As Steve explains. \u201cIt was annoying that we lost the facility to trade bonds across the Bloomberg platform. Price discovery took longer, as we had to phone Deutsche Bank and Bank of America and say \u201cmake me an offer\u201d.\u201d Bloomberg appears to be back now  , but the cause of the outage isn\u2019t known. A rumour is sweeping the City that it was caused by a carelessly spilled can of fizzy pop: Here\u2019s my colleague Julia Kollewe\u2019s story on the crash: It\u2019s business as usual at the Bank of England despite the Bloomberg outage: 17-Apr-2015 12:28 - BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS CORE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN UNAFFECTED BY BLOOMBERG OUTAGE 17-Apr-2015 12:28 - BANK OF ENGLAND SAYS RETAINS ALL TOOLS NEEDED TO CARRY OUT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND TO PROVIDE MARKET LIQUIDITY IF NEEDED And the bond sale that was halted this morning will take place this afternoon, according to the Debt Management Office; a sign that the City is getting back to normal. Back in the financial markets, a chunky selloff is breaking out across the main European bourses. Germany\u2019s DAX has slipped by over 1.7%, while Spain\u2019s IBEX shed 2%. The FTSE 100 of leading blue-chip shares has also been hit, down 0.6%. Not immediately clear what\u2019s caused the selloff. Some traders are blaming rumours that Chinese stock market regulators are planning to clamp down on speculative trading. It could also be due to a rise in the euro against the US dollar, which is bad news for European exporters. And the crash at Bloomberg may be contributing, meaning there is less liquidity in the market today. There is action in the bond markets too. Spanish and Italian government debt is weakening, pushing up bond yields. Traders are scrambling to get hold of German debt, though, driving the yield on 10-year bonds closer to zero [at which point investors would be accepting NO interest at all] Don\u2019t miss economic editor Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis on the jobs data: Why the British jobs recovery has not brought bulging pay packets The Bloomberg system crash I mentioned earlier has forced the UK\u2019s debt management agency to suspend a \u00a33bn debt sale. Here\u2019s the full story. My colleague Katie Allen writes: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level since 2008 but earnings growth has slowed, according to the final official labour market figures to be published before the election. The Office for National Statistics said the jobless rate dropped to 5.6% in the three months to February, down from 5.8% in the previous three months. That was the lowest rate since the onset of the financial crisis in July 2008.... And here\u2019s her full story, complete with charts and expert reaction: UK jobless rate falls to 5.6%, lowest since 2008, but pay still sluggish PS: apologies that the charts in today\u2019s blog are quite blurry. I must have done something wrong The CBI, which represents British firms, is also notably cool about raising wages faster. Neil Carberry, CBI Director for Employment and Skills argues that firms need to become more productive first: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see 248,000 more people in work, the fastest rise in employment in just under a year \u2013 thanks to our flexible jobs market. \u201cWith real wage growth rising people have a little more money in their pockets. But we need to see a recovery in productivity before wages can rise faster.\u201d Britain\u2019s bosses aren\u2019t keen to open up their wallets, it appears. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, argues that: \u201cWhile many people would like to see greater pay increases, wages are now rising in line with historic productivity growth, making them sustainable in the long term and allowing UK companies to remain competitive.\u201d Curiously, the remuneration packages of FTSE 100 executives doesn\u2019t seem to be rigidly tied to productivity growth. Their total pay jumped 50% last year, the Financial Times reports. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, predicts that workers may finally see larger pay rises soon: \u201cDespite these buoyant job numbers earnings growth has drifted up only slowly from last year\u2019s lows. But with skills shortages emerging, and the jobless rate set to fall further, we see earnings growth accelerating through this year and next.\u201d John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, points out that while employment has grown rapidly since 2010, wage growth has not. That\u2019s not a coincidence either: \u201cLooking back over the past five years, average real earnings are around 4.4% lower, but employment has risen by around 6.5% over the same period. In this way, the pain of recession has been spread more widely than in past downturns in the early 1980s and early 1990s, with more jobs being created but at lower average rates of pay.\u201d The pound has jumped almost a cent against the US dollar to a four week high of $1.5028 on the back of the jobs data. Here\u2019s Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, responding to today\u2019s Labour Market Statistics: \u201cToday\u2019s fall in overall unemployment is welcome, but with working people earning on average \u00a31,600 less a year since 2010 and the biggest fall in wages over a parliament since 1874, it\u2019s clear the Tory plan is failing. \u201cLabour has a better plan to reward hard work, share prosperity and build a better Britain. A Labour government will raise the minimum wage to more than \u00a38 an hour by October 2019 and give tax rebates to firms who pay a Living Wage. We will protect the tax credits that millions of families rely on, get at least 200,000 homes a year built by 2020, extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds and guarantee apprenticeships for everyone who gets the grades.\u201d This chart confirms that the unemployment rate is now at its lowest since July 2008, the quarter before the financial crisis erupted. These two show that Britain\u2019s employment rate, at 73.4%, is the highest since records began in 1971: The number of people in work rose by 557,000 over the last year; more than half were men taking full-time jobs. At 5.6%, Britain\u2019s unemployment rate is almost as low as America\u2019s (which hit 5.5% in February). And it\u2019s half the rate in the eurozone, where 11.3% of adults are out of work. Across the whole EU, the rate is 9.8%. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, questions the quality of the jobs being created in the UK today: \u201cMost of these new jobs are mainly low-skilled, low-paid and zero hours..... \u201cMost workers have seen little or no evidence of any recovery in living standards due to the Tories not promoting real economic growth based on investment and productivity gains.\u201d The prime minister tweets that today\u2019s employment report shows his economic plan is delivering: You can see the jobs report yourself, here on the ONS website: UK Labour Market, April 2015 Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s first take on the jobs data: Unemployment has continued to fall and a record 31 million people are in work, the last jobless figures before the general election have shown. The jobless total fell by 76,000 to 1.84 million in the quarter to February, the lowest for almost seven years. The number of people claiming jobseeker\u2019s allowance fell by 20,700 in March to 772,400, the 29th consecutive monthly cut. Other data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year, the biggest total since records began in 1971. The UK\u2019s unemployment rate is now 5.6%, a fall of 1.3% since a year ago. The rate was 7.9% in May 2010, when the last general election was held. Around 1.3 million people were in part-time jobs when they wanted full-time work, up by 29,000 in the latest quarter, while self-employment was little changed at 4.5 million. The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a relative, on long-term sick leave or who have given up looking for work, fell by 104,000 to just under nine million. Average earnings increased by 1.7% in the year to February, 0.2% down on the previous month. Long-term unemployment has also fallen, down by 188,000 to 623,000 for those out of work for at least a year. Youth unemployment - 16 to 24-year-olds - fell by 22,000 in the three months to February to 742,000. The ONS also reported that 107,000 people were made redundant over the latest three months, little changed on the end of last year, but more than 200,000 fewer than the record peak of 311,000 in early 2009. There were 743,000 job vacancies across the country in January to March, 124,000 more than a year ago and the highest since records began in 2001. Economists are welcoming the news that Britain\u2019s jobless rate has fallen to 5.6%, the lowest since the run-up to the financial crisis. But there is some concern that wage growth isn\u2019t accelerating. Some instant reaction: With inflation at zero, today\u2019s data also shows that real wages continued to rise in the three months to February, after years of falling real pay. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6%, its lowest level since July 2008. And the number of people in employment has risen by almost a quarter of a million in the December-February quarter, to the highest rate on record. A pre-election boost to the Conservatives? But wage growth during the quarter slowed; average pay including bonuses rose by +1.7%, down from +1.8% last month.

The Greek stock market is also calm, up 0.7% in early trading. Fortunately my Reuters terminal is working perfectly this morning (thanks guys), so we can see that Greek bonds are trading at worryingly high levels. The two-year Greek bond is yielding 27.2%, broadly unchanged today, suggesting a high risk of default. And 10-year Greek debt is trading at a yield of 12.7%, down slightly from 12.8% yesterday. Yields soared yesterday as traders reacted to the news that the IMF would not allow Athens to delay a debt repayment, making this the worst week for Greek debt since January. The technical problems at Bloomberg are a major problem for City types. There are more than 300,000 terminals around the globe, used for both news and trading. CNBC has a good early take: Bloomberg\u2019s trading terminal experienced an outage on Friday morning, with some users saying they were unable to perform their usual trading activity. The company confirmed to CNBC that its terminal was currently unavailable worldwide, with traders from the U.K. and Singapore complaining on Twitter that they had been affected by the issue. Bloomberg is looking into the causes of the outage, the company\u2019s spokesperson said. Alarm is sweeping the City this morning as traders and analysts realise that their Bloomberg terminals have crashed. It looks like a serious outage: The Greek crisis is also helping to drive money into German government debt. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year bonds has fallen even closer to 0.0%. That means Berlin could effectively borrow for almost nothing and repay the money in 2025. Shorter-term bunds are already trading at negative yields, meaning investors are paying more than the face value of the debt. They could still make a profit, though, by selling them onto the European Central Bank\u2019s QE scheme. Greece\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper is also gloomy, suggesting that a deal might not come before mid-May. If so, we can scrap hopes of a breakthrough at the April 24th eurogroup meeting With negotiations between Greece and its creditors effectively deadlocked, a potential deal that could unlock crucially needed funding appeared more distant than ever on Thursday with doubts appearing about whether an agreement can be reached in time for a Eurogroup planned for May 11, well after the next scheduled eurozone finance ministers\u2019 summit in Riga next Friday, which had been the original deadline. Darren Courtney-Cook, head of trading at Central Markets Investment Management, confirms that the Greek crisis is lingering over the City: \u201cI think the Greece situation will be resolved but we\u2019ve had a massive up-turn on the stock markets so far this year, and the underlying concerns are causing some people to take a bit of money off the table.\u201d (quote via Reuters) European markets have opened mixed, with Germany\u2019s DAX extending yesterday\u2019s falls but the FTSE 100 rising a little: Investors are underplaying the risk posed by Greece, according to Chris Weston of financial spread betting firm IG this morning: The Greek government have a mandate to stay in the European Monetary Union and they simply can\u2019t leave. However a view from certain parts of the market is [Greece\u2019s plans] to distance themselves from the rest of Europe and to actually be forced out. Markets still believe Greece will stay within the union in some form, but the risks are growing and a full \u2018Grexit\u2019 won\u2019t be pleasant. The market is not prepared at all for this. Analysts at Citigroup also suspect markets are too relaxed: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like another day dominated by the Greek debt crisis, which ratcheted up another notch yesterday when the IMF effectively sunk the idea that Athens could be granted a payment delay. Both sides appear far from a deal, still. As we covered in last night\u2019s blog, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis insists that Greece won\u2019t roll over and accept measures that would perpetuate the crisis. He told an audience in Washington that: \u201cWe will compromise, we will compromise and we will compromise in order to come to a speedy agreement, but we are not going to be compromised.\u201d Varoufakis also warned that Greece was suffering \u201cliquidity asphyxiation\u201d, but insisted that he wouldn\u2019t even consider the idea that the country leaves the euro: Toying with Grexit, or amputating Greece, is profoundly anti-European. Anybody who says they know what will happen if Greece is pushed out of the euro is deluded..... Our only rational pro-European response is to spend every waking hour... trying to reach an honourable agreement.\u201d But Greece\u2019s creditors continue to take a hard line, with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble warning that Athens must deliver on its pledges to receive bailout funds. With Greece due to pay almost \u20ac1bn to the IMF next month, investors fear that the country could hit a cash crunch soon. There\u2019ll be more action in Washington today, where finance ministers and central bank chiefs are attending the IMF/G20 Spring Meeting. Varoufakis is due to meet with ECB chief Mario Draghi at some point. There\u2019s also some data to look forward to, including the latest UK unemployment report at 9.30am BST, and the final eurozone inflation data at 10am BST. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

That plan in the UK is building up resilience, and we need resilience for moments like this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne also spoke about the UK:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s important to help countries affected by Ebola and I\u2019m proud that the UK is the largest contributor to the IMF trust. You will have heard the very positive comments about the British economy, and British economic policy, from the managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde and indeed from my German opposite number Wolfgang Schauble.</p> <p>And I agree with them that the British economy is one of the brighter spots in the world economy at the moment, and that\u2019s confirmed by the IMF forecasts which show the UK as the second fastest growing economy in the G7 in the next two years, having been the fastest growing in 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which brought him onto<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/17/greek-crisis-markets-imf-varoufakis-live#block-5530c4a7e4b0481201dab52b\"> today\u2019s unemployment data</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And of course all of that has been more than reinforced by the employment figures we saw this morning, which show a record number of people in work. They show the claimant count at its lowest level since 1975 and they confirm that under this government two million jobs have been created. So the British economy is a job creating machine, and we have set out, as the Conservative Party, plans today to go on creating jobs \u2013 two million further jobs \u2013 in the next Parliament.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-17T14:33:43.682Z\">at 3.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55311134e4b0d810bf3304db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-17T13:57:10.699Z\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KaterinaSokou/statuses/589064183326629888\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>IMF&#39;s Poul Thomsen says Grexit risks should not be underestimated, would like to simplify/ slim down the Greek program further</p>&mdash; Katerina Sokou (@KaterinaSokou) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KaterinaSokou/status/589064183326629888\">April 17, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55310f30e4b002d5aaf434cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-17T13:54:38.315Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The International Monetary Fund is adding its weight to the pressure on Greece to produce credible reforms soon. </strong></p> <p>But crucially, one of its top officials - Poul Thomsen - has said that the programme also needs to be changed.

The rules were aimed at adding a bit more two-sidedness, but given Chinese equities have been going almost vertically up, that second side could only be down.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for Greece, there are few signs that the two sides are getting any closer to an agreement which would release badly needed bailout funds to the country, which also faces a number of imminent payments, not least to the International Monetary Fund which has ruled out any postponement of what is due.</p> <p>Among the risers,<strong> BP</strong> rose 5.9p to 479.35p in the wake of Thursday\u2019s annual meeting, while <strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong> edged up 6p to \u00a327.22 on renewed speculation it could be in the sights of a US rival.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps defence group <strong>Qinetiq</strong> climbed 7.4p to 202.5p after analysts at Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight and raised their price target from 210p to 220p:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From a trading perspective it is difficult to foresee significant earnings growth, outside of the impact of the share buyback programme, over the next year or so with the current portfolio of businesses and prospects. There also remains risk around defence spending around the UK election in 2015. This will be the challenge for new chief executive, Steve Wadley, who joins on 27 April 2015. However, in the current environment of a hunt for yield, Qinetiq has a number of attractions.</p> <p>The shares offer a prospective dividend yield of around 3%.

In addition the company is currently \u00a3102m through its \u00a3150m share buyback programme. Assuming only \u00a340m of the current buyback programme remains outstanding at the end of March we still estimate net cash of \u00a3159m, or around 25p per share. </p> </blockquote>",

With European markets sharply lower - Germany\u2019s Dax ended down 2.5% - and Wall Street off 1.3%, the FTSE 100 finished 65.82 points or 0.93% lower at 6994.63. ending below 7000 for the first time in more than a week. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Europe\u2019s stock markets extended a week of heavy losses on Friday, spooked by changes in Chinese trading regulations, an outage in Bloomberg terminals and Greece drifting closer to the brink. Chinese regulators altered rules to encourage institutional short selling and banned trading on over the counter or non-exchange-listed securities using leverage. The rules were aimed at adding a bit more two-sidedness, but given Chinese equities have been going almost vertically up, that second side could only be down. As for Greece, there are few signs that the two sides are getting any closer to an agreement which would release badly needed bailout funds to the country, which also faces a number of imminent payments, not least to the International Monetary Fund which has ruled out any postponement of what is due. Among the risers, BP rose 5.9p to 479.35p in the wake of Thursday\u2019s annual meeting, while InterContinental Hotels edged up 6p to \u00a327.22 on renewed speculation it could be in the sights of a US rival. Among the mid-caps defence group Qinetiq climbed 7.4p to 202.5p after analysts at Barclays moved from equal weight to overweight and raised their price target from 210p to 220p: From a trading perspective it is difficult to foresee significant earnings growth, outside of the impact of the share buyback programme, over the next year or so with the current portfolio of businesses and prospects. There also remains risk around defence spending around the UK election in 2015. This will be the challenge for new chief executive, Steve Wadley, who joins on 27 April 2015. However, in the current environment of a hunt for yield, Qinetiq has a number of attractions. The shares offer a prospective dividend yield of around 3%. We expect Qinetiq to generate \u00a383m (yield of 6.8%) of free cash flow in 2015...and \u00a393m (yield 7.7%) in 2016 \u2013 the highest of our coverage universe. In addition the company is currently \u00a3102m through its \u00a3150m share buyback programme. Assuming only \u00a340m of the current buyback programme remains outstanding at the end of March we still estimate net cash of \u00a3159m, or around 25p per share.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has urged EU negotiators to slim down their list of demands in debt talks with Greece amid fears that time is running out to reach a deal. The intervention by one of the country\u2019s three main lenders came as the UK chancellor, George Osborne, said the impasse posed the biggest immediate threat to the global economy. Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF\u2019s European department, said the reforms being demanded from Athens in exchange for a vital \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a35.2bn) in rescue funds should be simplified and slimmed down. European finance ministers and senior officials have warned that Greece is running out of time to secure the payment and avert a disorderly exit from the eurozone. Osborne said the situation in Greece was \u201cthe most worrying for the global economy\u201d. Speaking at the IMF\u2019s spring meeting in Washington,he said discussions about Greece had \u201cpervaded every meeting\u201d and that \u201cthe mood is notably more gloomy than at the last international gathering\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s clear now to me that a misstep or a miscalculation on either side could easily return European economies to the kind of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago.\u201d Osborne\u2019s German counterpart, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, repeated his criticism of the radical left Syriza government\u2019s negotiating tactics and warned that it was harming the economy. He said Greece was in a \u201cvery difficult situation\u201d after Syriza demanded a new deal with its creditors \u2013 the IMF, the EU and the European Central Bank \u2013 which had delayed reforms and hit the country\u2019s already struggling economy. Sch\u00e4uble said it was unlikely that next week\u2019s deadline for Athens to submit reform proposals would be met. The reforms are scheduled to be discussed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Riga, Latvia next Friday, followed by a further gathering in Brussels on 11 May that is being seen as the crunch point for Athens. Greece is scheduled to make a \u20ac747m repayment to the IMF on 12 May and there are fears that Athens will be unable to meet the deadline as cash runs out of state and domestic bank coffers. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said the next two meetings should both be used by the Greeks to find a compromise deal. \u201cThe 24 April meeting in Riga must not be a wasted moment; it must be a useful moment in which we see concrete progress in catching up with those reforms, and then the next meeting on 11 May, which certainly must be decisive,\u201d he said. The former French finance minister, who sought to make peace with the Syriza government soon after its formation following elections in January, made it clear that Athens was still not \u201cprecise enough\u201d in its reform plans. \u201cWe are not talking about nothing. We are talking about things, but now we need to make progress\u201d. The EU has come under pressure from other quarters to drop its demand for a complex list of detailed reforms in favour of a simpler programme that Athens can agree and implement. This week the IMF\u2019s financial stability report highlighted the risks of a Greek exit from the euro, arguing it would create shockwaves with unknown consequences. Thomsen\u2019s intervention was seen as an olive branch to Athens after IMF officials rebuffed an informal request by the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, for a delay in debt payments. Varoufakis has denied asking for a suspension or delay of payments while negotiations are ongoing, arguing that talks can continue until the current bailout programme runs out in June. He said: \u201cThere has never been a key date. We have to see everything in combination and cumulatively. On the 24th [April] there will not be a solution, there will be progress. \u201cThe issue is what we do in the post-June period. Our goal is a good agreement [after that date], an agreement with a different take on the situation from previous agreements which only prolonged the problem.\u201d Athens would not \u201cleave any stone unturned\u201d to get to a deal, he said. However, Osborne said finance ministers wanted an earlier deal to prevent Greece from running out of money and triggering financial disruption across Europe by the Greeks leaving the eurozone. He said: \u201cThe crunch appears now to be coming in May, and it would be a mistake to think that the UK would be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has secured its largest order in a \u00a36.1bn ($9.2bn) deal with Emirates airline. The order of 200 engines is a boost for the UK manufacturing sector, whose performance is central to Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s target of doubling British exports by 2020. The Trent 900 engines will power 50 Airbus A380 superjumbos entering service from next year. Rolls-Royce\u2019s order book is filling up. The company recently struck a \u00a3665m deal with Air China to supply Trent 1000 engines for 15 Boeing Dreamliners. The deals come after a tough year for the group, with a series of profit warnings and plans for 2,600 job cuts worldwide. The company said the Emirates deal confirms the Trent 900 as the \u201cengine of choice\u201d on the A380. Rolls-Royce has won more than a 50% market share in engines for the superjumbo, in addition to being selected by the majority of the planes\u2019 customers. Its engines have been powering Emirates aircraft since 1996. John Rishton, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, said: \u201cWe are delighted that Emirates has again placed its trust in our technology, with the biggest order in our history.\u201d Terry Scuoler, chief Executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, hailed the deal as a \u201chuge boost for UK industry and a vote of confidence in British engineering excellence\u201d.

He added: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is significant not only because it cements the partnership between Emirates and Rolls-Royce, but also because of the significant economic impact that this will have on aviation manufacturing in the UK and Europe.\u201d The Trent 900 engine powered the first commercial A380 in 2007 and is now used by eight operators in more than 70 aircraft. Rolls-Royce says the engine is highly fuel efficient, with the latest version including technology developed for the Trent XWB and Trent 1000 engines. The order is a boost for Rolls-Royce, which had its first fall in annual sales in a decade last yearAbout 1,700 jobs are expected to go in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Parts of the City of London were left paralysed on Friday after Bloomberg terminals crashed in an IT meltdown that even forced the government to postpone a \u00a33bn debt sale. The problems with the terminals emerged as the Asian markets closed and Europe\u2019s opened \u2013 at around 8.20am \u2013 and potentially affected more than 300,000 traders on financial markets. The Bloomberg screens are used by traders of government bonds as well as shares and other financial instruments. They are so important that the breakdown prompted the Financial Conduct Authority to monitor the impact on the firms it regulates. The Bank of England reassured markets it had not been affected, saying it had all the tools needed to ensure financial stability and to provide market liquidity if needed. According to Fortune, 320,000 people worldwide use Bloomberg terminals, which cost about $20,000 a year. A significant number were affected by the IT problem. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at asset management firm London &amp; Capital, said the breakdown was the worst he had seen in the City in more than a decade. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it go down like this for 10 or 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBloomberg is usually the one stable thing; it\u2019s the thing that everyone can\u2019t live without.\u201d It took the whole of the London trading day before Bloomberg said the situation had been fully resolved, although many terminals were running again around lunchtime. The UK Debt Management Office postponed its weekly tender of Treasury bills on Friday morning, but in a sign that the City was getting back to normal, it then conducted the debt sale in the afternoon. Bloomberg blamed a combination of hardware and software failures after City dealers took to Twitter to lament the blackout. Around 4pm, Bloomberg tweeted: \u201cService has been fully restored. We apologise to our customers for the disruption.\u201d The US data provider said there had not been a cyber attack. Bloomberg said: \u201cWe experienced a combination of hardware and software failures in the network, which caused an excessive volume of network traffic. This led to customer disconnections as a result of the machines being overwhelmed. We discovered the root cause quickly, isolated the faulty hardware, and restarted the software. We are reviewing our multiple redundant systems, which failed to prevent this disruption.\u201d Collins said traders at London &amp; Capital were left \u201ctwiddling their thumbs\u201d and calls to the Bloomberg helpline went unanswered. \u201cBig banks will pump thousands of orders across Bloomberg, so the outage had quite an effect on the market.\u201d It was still possible to place orders by telephone, as in the days before computerisation reshaped the City, but it is a more cumbersome, time-consuming process, Collins said. \u201cIt was annoying that we lost the facility to trade bonds across the Bloomberg platform. Price discovery took longer, as we had to phone Deutsche Bank and Bank of America and say, \u2018make me an offer.\u2019\u201d Bankers reported that other bond sales had been postponed , with the absence of Bloomberg\u2019s messaging system \u2013 chat rooms and a direct messaging service \u2013 making it difficult to arrange deals. \u201cThe modern way of getting a trade done is through Bloomberg chat, so without it, traders were a bit at a loss,\u201d said Jasper Lawler of City firm CMC Markets. \u201cOf course there is always a telephone if the deal is urgent.\u201d Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at the London-based asset manager LNG Capital, told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cWe\u2019re flying blind in our office as our principal counterparties are unable to act as market makers, therefore we\u2019re all catching up on admin because there is little else that we can do.\u201d Technical glitches brought share trading on the London Stock Exchange to a halt for seven hours in 2008 and again in 2011, for four hours, when a new system broke down. Facebook\u2019s stock market debut on Nasdaq in 2012 was marred by technical glitches. Nasdaq, which was fined $10m, blamed \u201cpoor design\u201d in the software used for IPOs.

    "webTitle": "UK jobless rate falls to 5.6%, lowest since 2008", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest level since 2008 but earnings growth has slowed, according to the final official labour market figures before the election. The Conservatives welcomed news of the drop in the jobless rate to 5.6% as well as the number of people in work hitting a record of more than 31m. The figures from the Office for National Statistics also showed more of the jobs being created were full-time, raising hopes that job security was finally improving after years in which part-time work and self-employment have driven much of the UK\u2019s labour market recovery. But wage growth eased \u2013 the latest evidence that much of the labour market recovery is yet to translate into higher living standards. It prompted fresh warnings about the UK\u2019s weak record on productivity, something the chancellor George Osborne was forced to address at IMF meetings in Washington. Summing up the mixed labour market report, Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the thinktank EY ITEM Club, said: The story of the UK labour market has long been a \u2018jobs-rich\u2019 but \u2018pay-poor\u2019 one. The latest numbers are no exception with good news for those looking for work, but less so for those already in employment. Speaking in Washington, Osborne said the unemployment figures were an endorsement of his determination to keep a grip on the public finances, which he argued had boosted confidence in the UK. He said: The British economy is one of the brighter spots in the world economy at the moment, and that\u2019s confirmed by the IMF forecasts which show the UK as the second-fastest-growing economy in the G7 in the next two years, having been the fastest growing in 2014. Osborne is at the IMF\u2019s spring meeting where he is holding talks with finance ministers and central bank governors on taking steps to promote global growth. He added: Those forecasts have been more than reinforced by the employment figures we saw this morning, which show a record number of people in work. They show the claimant count at its lowest level since 1975 and they confirm that under this government 2m jobs have been created. So the British economy is a job-creating machine. The 5.6% unemployment rate in the three months to February compared with 5.8% in the previous three months and is the lowest rate since the onset of the financial crisis in July 2008. Unemployment falls The employment rate was 73.4%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. That rise came as the number of people in employment rose by 248,000, the biggest increase for almost a year, to 31.05 million. Employment at record high Wage growth slows, but beats inflation But the figures also showed earnings growth had slowed to 1.7% on the year, down from 1.9% growth in the three months to January. That was weaker than economists\u2019 expectations for growth of 1.8%, according to a poll by Reuters. With inflation at 0%, however, wages are now rising again in real terms after years in which they fell. Chris Williamson, an economist at data provider Markit, warned that moderate wage growth left the economy exposed. He said: The number of people in employment has risen to an all-time high, but the jobs boom and wider economic recovery are still not feeding through to households via higher wages. The lack of wage growth leaves the economy vulnerable to setbacks, especially as growth has once again become all-too dependent on consumer spending, which is in turn reliant on low inflation. Samuel Tombs, economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, was more upbeat: With the jobless rate now only a fraction above its average of 5.3% seen in the decade before the recession, it is unsurprising that wage growth is gradually building. He added that the dip in the headline rate of earnings growth reflected a shift in the timing of bonus payments. Growth in regular pay excluding bonuses, rose to 1.8% from 1.6%. The ONS attributed the increase in part to new European Union rules for bankers\u2019 pay: setting maximum bonus levels as a proportion of basic salaries has pushed regular earnings higher for some in the sector. Labour market experts have said that whoever formed a government after the election would have to secure wage growth for workers by addressing the UK\u2019s weak record on productivity, or output per hour worked. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said a pay puzzle was emerging as the rapid fall in unemployment over the last year failed to spur the higher pay rises that many would have expected. It\u2019s encouraging to see the momentum of the recent jobs recovery continuing into 2015, and to see real wage growth strengthen after a seven year squeeze. But there is still a lot of ground to make up before we return to pre-crash pay levels. With inflation already at zero, this much-needed catch-up rests on far stronger nominal pay growth, underpinned by rising productivity. Osborne conceded weak productivity had been a problem in Britain but he said the government was seeking to address it. He added: The challenge over the longer term is to improve education and develop skills. But I would prefer to have a productivity problem than an unemployment problem.",

      "body": "<p>One of Australia\u2019s biggest energy companies, AGL, has pledged to shut all its coal-fired power stations by 2050.</p> <p>In a surprise announcement, chief executive Andy Vesey said the company would not build, finance or acquire new conventional coal-fired power stations in Australia or extend the operating life of any of its existing stations.</p> <p>By 2050 it would not have any coal-fired stations in its portfolio, Vesey said, in order to help Australia\u2019s contribution to limiting global warming to no more than 2C in the next 35 years.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia currently relies significantly on coal and gas to power its homes and industries with 88% of electricity produced from fossil fuels,\u201d he said, releasing the company\u2019s new <a href=\"http://www.agl.com.au/~/media/AGL/About%20AGL/Documents/Media%20Center/Corporate%20Governance%20Policies%20Charter/1704015_GHG_Policy_Final.pdf\">greenhouse gas policy</a>.</p> <p>\u201cTo support the government\u2019s commitment to work towards the two degree goal, companies such as AGL need to take the lead,\u201d said Vesey.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis will be a measured process of decarbonisation, but one which I am proud to spearhead on behalf of AGL.\u201d</p> <p>AGL\u2019s announcement comes just months after Vesey joined from the American company AES. He replaced Michael Fraser, an enthusiastic supporter of fossil fuels who acquired coal assets such as Loy Yang power station in Victoria. </p> <p>AGL also operates Liddell and Bayswater coal power stations in the Hunter Valley, NSW, and Somerton and Torrens Island in South Australia.</p> <p>The dramatic policy shift would appear to put the company at odds with Tony Abbott\u2019s vision of the industry which he says has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/13/tony-abbott-says-coal-is-good-for-humanity-while-opening-mine\">\u201cbright future\u201d</a>.<br></p> <p>AGL, which is Australia\u2019s largest market-listed power company, supplies electricity to 3.8m households.

      "bodyText": "One of Australia\u2019s biggest energy companies, AGL, has pledged to shut all its coal-fired power stations by 2050. In a surprise announcement, chief executive Andy Vesey said the company would not build, finance or acquire new conventional coal-fired power stations in Australia or extend the operating life of any of its existing stations. By 2050 it would not have any coal-fired stations in its portfolio, Vesey said, in order to help Australia\u2019s contribution to limiting global warming to no more than 2C in the next 35 years. \u201cAustralia currently relies significantly on coal and gas to power its homes and industries with 88% of electricity produced from fossil fuels,\u201d he said, releasing the company\u2019s new greenhouse gas policy. \u201cTo support the government\u2019s commitment to work towards the two degree goal, companies such as AGL need to take the lead,\u201d said Vesey. \u201cThis will be a measured process of decarbonisation, but one which I am proud to spearhead on behalf of AGL.\u201d AGL\u2019s announcement comes just months after Vesey joined from the American company AES. He replaced Michael Fraser, an enthusiastic supporter of fossil fuels who acquired coal assets such as Loy Yang power station in Victoria. AGL also operates Liddell and Bayswater coal power stations in the Hunter Valley, NSW, and Somerton and Torrens Island in South Australia. The dramatic policy shift would appear to put the company at odds with Tony Abbott\u2019s vision of the industry which he says has a \u201cbright future\u201d. AGL, which is Australia\u2019s largest market-listed power company, supplies electricity to 3.8m households. Loy Yang is one of AGL\u2019s largest brown-coal stations and produces about one-third of Victoria\u2019s energy. A spokeswoman for Victoria\u2019s minister for energy and resources, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, welcomed the announcement. \u201cWe believe in the science of climate change and are actively supporting the deployment of more renewable energy technology, as well as energy efficiency,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to having a rational and responsible conversation about the future of our coal resources and, importantly, what that means in terms of economic diversification in the Latrobe Valley. The chief executive of Environment Victoria, Mark Wakeham, said the timeframe of 2050 nominated by AGL was too slow. \u201cIt just feels a little like saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to give up smoking, but I\u2019ll do it in a decade from now,\u201d Wakeham said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good intention, but the time-frames are still rather concerning showing an awareness of the problem but not the haste to address it. It is still on the distant horizon.\u201d AGL was just one of Australia\u2019s producers of \u201cdirty energy,\u201d he said, pointing out that Victoria\u2019s Hazelwood power station, owned by GDF Suez and supplying about 8% of the national electricity market, was one of the country\u2019s dirtiest. \u201cWe need to start withdrawing some of our dirtiest producers from the market like Hazelwood and we need policy solutions not only from industry but also from state and federal governments,\u201d he said.

Vesey said: \u201cDecarbonisation and modernisation of Australia\u2019s electricity system are important goals requiring effective policy.\u201d \u201cIt will be an ongoing, progressive process, managing the efficient operations of our assets, and the transition of our people into new generation technologies and careers,\u201d he said. James Grugeon, of the campaign group GetUp!, said AGL\u2019s pledge was was a small step forward after several big steps back. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see AGL finally listening to the 9 out of 10 Australians who want renewable energy and making a commitment to leave dirty coal-fired power,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame the company will keep pumping carbon into the atmosphere until 2050.\u201d AGL\u2019s share price was largely unaffected by the announcement, falling 0.6% to $14.98 on Friday.",
