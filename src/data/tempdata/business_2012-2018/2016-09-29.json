      "bodyText": "Consumer confidence has continued to recover from the shock of June\u2019s Brexit vote, with a key gauge of sentiment back to its pre-referendum level \u2013 but economists warn rising prices could soon sour shoppers\u2019 moods. A poll by market researchers GfK had recorded a sharp slide in confidence after June\u2019s decision to leave the EU prompted political and financial market turmoil. But since the formation of a new government and Bank of England action to shore up the economy, sentiment has recovered. The September survey puts confidence levels back where they were shortly before the 23 June vote. The headline confidence index rose to -1 in September, up from -7 in August and -12 in July. The reading beats forecasts for a smaller improvement to -5 in a Reuters poll of economists. GfK said its poll of 2,000 people showed they were more upbeat about their personal finances and the state of the economy. They were also more confident that now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods. \u201cBritish consumers appear to have shrugged off Brexit fears about the economy as wages continue to grow faster than prices, rising employment boosts income, and low interest rates encourage people to spend rather than save,\u201d said Joe Staton at GfK. However, Staton questioned how sustainable the mood of optimism was, echoing analysts who warn confidence could deteriorate as Brexit negotiations begin in earnest. For now, the figures will reassure Bank of England policymakers that the interest rate cut to a record low of 0.25% and hints of a further cut have helped restore confidence. They will also be cheered by a separate poll suggesting business sentiment improved in September. The main reading on the monthly Lloyds Bank business barometer increased by eight points to 24%, helped by growing optimism over the UK\u2019s economic prospects. That was a significant improvement on the 6% recorded in the immediate aftermath of the referendum. But it was still below the long-term average of 32%. Lloyds surveyed around 300 firms. There were also mixed signals in lending figures from the Bank. The number of loans approved for house purchases dropped in August to the lowest level for almost two years. Unsecured consumer borrowing, such as on credit cards, continued to grow. Experts warned that consumers could soon see their spending power eroded as an uncertain economic outlook threatens the jobs market and as the weak pound stokes inflation by raising the UK\u2019s import costs. There was already some evidence of that in a report tracking disposable incomes from supermarket Asda (pdf). It showed there had been barely any growth over the last five months in the amount of spare cash that households had left over after covering housing costs, taxes and essentials such as food. In year-on-year terms, disposable incomes were still rising but at a slower pace. At an average \u00a3201 a week, discretionary incomes were up 5.3% on a year earlier \u2013 the weakest growth since October 2014. The stagnation in spending power in recent months reflected slower wage growth, higher transport costs and rising food prices, according to Asda\u2019s report, compiled by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). But August\u2019s interest rate cut had helped to offset some of those rising costs by driving a further fall in monthly mortgage payments. Sam Alderson, economist at CEBR, commented: \u201cWhile the initial turbulence has been navigated, improvements in household finances have slowed, a process that could accelerate if rising production costs begin to feed into prices at the tills.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally.. the Dow Jones industrial average has closed with triple-figure losses, as worries over Deutsche Bank mount. The Dow lost 195 points or 1.07% to finish at 18,143. Deutsche itself hit new lows, and was down 6.7% at \u20ac11.48 in late trading. Reports that some hedge funds have been reducing ties with the bank have caused jitters, although the company insists that it has a stable financial position. CNBC took the mood on Wall Street: \u201cWhen you look at what\u2019s going on in the Deutsche Bank options, you\u2019re seeing a lot of puts being bought,\u201d said Daniel Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. \u201cSo you\u2019re getting some concerns that this could turn into something bigger.\u201d So, why are any hedge funds taking money out of Deutsche Bank, when the bank insists it doesn\u2019t need government support, and is adequately capitalised? Chris Wheeler, a financial analyst with Atlantic Equities LLP in London, has told Bloomberg that \u201cThe issue here is now one of confidence,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. The thinking is \u2018Deutsche Bank is fine, but there\u2019s a slim chance it might not be, so why leave my money in there?\u2019\u201d So that\u2019s why New York-listed shares in DB are down over 7%, and the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 177 points or 1%. Government bonds are rallying too, which is usually a sign of anxiety as investors look for a safe place to put their money. The selloff is getting worse: Over on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have just tumbled by 5%. This is triggered by a Bloomberg report that around 10 hedge funds who clear derivatives trades with Deutsche Bank have cut their exposure by withdrawing some excess cash, and cutting positions held at the bank. This is a sign of counterparties\u2019 \u201cmounting concerns about doing business with Europe\u2019s largest investment bank\u201d, the Bloomberg report says. However, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the 200 clients who clear their derivatives through Deutsche have made no changes. In a statement, Deutsche Bank insisted that it was in a \u2018stable financial position\u2019, and making progress: \u201cOur trading clients are amongst the world\u2019s most sophisticated investors. \u201cWe are confident that the vast majority of them have a full understanding of our stable financial position, the current macroeconomic environment, the litigation process in the U.S. and the progress we are making with our strategy.\u201d The report has also sent the New York stock market into the red; the Dow is now down by 162 points, or almost 1%. Back in the markets, the London stock market has closed at its highest level since mid-August. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained 70 points, or 1%, to close at 6919. It\u2019s being driven by hopes that Opec members will follow through on their pledge to cut production by up to 700,000 barrels per day in November. Oil companies led the rally, with Royal Dutch Shell jumping 6.6%, BP up 4.3%, and Tullow Oil gaining almost 10%. Capita slumped by 26%, though, following this morning\u2019s profits warning. Although analysts have warned that the deal will be hard to agree and enforce, the oil price is now rising this afternoon. Brent crude has now gained almost 2% to $49.55, up 90 cents today. And US crude has gained 2.3% to $48.13. Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says the Opec deal shows that Saudi Arabia has changed its approach to the oil market. But will it work?.... While the news of a production cut is a welcome surprise, the deal will be treated with a degree of scepticism owing to the notoriously unreliable nature of OPEC discussions. Most notably, the meeting goes to show that Saudi Arabia and Iran can work together, despite public spats between the two nations. Arguably despite this deal, supply will continue to outstrip demand, while US production will likely fill the gap with increased output as price rises. However, the key takeaway is that by ditching the market-based pricing mechanism of recent years, Saudi Arabia have re-established the relevance of OPEC, with the price of oil once more being manipulated by the world\u2019s biggest cartel. The House Committee now hear reports that Wells Fargo staff targeted African-American churches for false cross-selling, and referred to sub-prime loans as ghetto loans. Stumpf says this would be totally unacceptable. Could a dairy farmer find that he can\u2019t get credit because his credit score has been \u2018dinged\u2019 by his bank opening accounts? Stumpf confirms that this is how credit scores work. So, two million people have been dinged? No, says Stumpf. There were 565,000 credit cards involved - we\u2019ve contacted 20,000 people, and only 25% say they were mis-sold. My instruction is \u2018make it right\u2019, he insists. This is a quality company that made some mistakes, pleads Stumpf as he faces more sustained criticism. Both sides of the House committee are united in criticising Stumpf: Stumpf is asked about reports that staff were fired for whistleblowing about the problems at Wells Fargo. We\u2019re taking that very seriously, he replies. We have a \u2018non-retaliation\u2019 policy. Quote of the day: That\u2019s a reference to last week\u2019s session, where Elizabeth Warren told Stumpf he should resign and be criminally investigated. Incidentally, Public Citizen have produced a detailed guide into Wells Fargo\u2019s cross-selling practices: The \u201cKing of Cross-Sell\u201d and the Race to Eight Here\u2019s a flavour: Cross-selling amounts to selling a new product to an existing customer. For example, if a customer only has a savings account with Wells Fargo, an employee may try to \u201ccross-sell\u201d that customer a checking, credit card, or other type of account. According to Wells Fargo\u2019s Chairman and CEO, John G. Stumpf, cross-selling \u201cis the result of serving our customers extraordinarily well, understanding their financial needs and goals over their lifetimes, and ensuring we innovate our products, services, and channels so that we earn more of their business and help them succeed financially.\u201d The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Los Angeles (LA) City Attorney found the exact opposite \u2013 fining Wells Fargo $185 million for engaging in fraudulent cross-selling practices. The CFPB described these as \u201cImproper Sales Practices;\u201d the OCC described these as \u201cunsafe or unsound practices in the Bank\u2019s risk management and oversight of the Bank\u2019s sales practices;\u201d and the Los Angeles City Attorney wrote in its complaint that Wells Fargo imposed \u201can ambitious and strictly enforced sales quota system\u201d in which \u201cthose failing to meet sales quotas are approached by management, and often reprimanded and/or told to \u2018do whatever it takes\u2019 to meet their individual sales quotas.\u201d The Los Angeles City Attorney also wrote: \u201cManagers constantly hound, berate, demean and threaten employees to meet these unreachable quotas.\u201d Stumpf says there is no evidence that any ethnic group was disproportionately affected by the practice of creating fake accounts. Asked if seniors were targeted, Stumpf says that young people actually suffered more. John Stumpf is told to submit his resignation, rather than hang on because he has the board\u2019s support. Congressman Steve Pearce tells Stumpf that he failed to tackle the problems at Wells Fargo back in 2011 or 2013. You have proved that you did not show leadership\u2026 I think you should submit a resignation. Stumpf replies that \u201cwe did take accountability\u201d, and invested in things to address the problems with cross-selling financial products. What you did didn\u2019t work, Pearce shoots back. Democratic congressman David Scott says he\u2019s never seen such dreadful behaviour by a bank boss, misselling accounts to customers. Stumpf insists he didn\u2019t mis-sell these accounts personally, and is cleaning the affair up. This won\u2019t satisfy Scott, who tells Stumpf: You should be downright ashamed of yourself, and you should apologies.... for the rancid example that you are setting, and the damage that you have done to the banking industry. Stumpf says that he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d, and committed to resolving the problems. Q: Do you think what you did was criminal? I\u2019m not a lawyer, I led the company with courage, Stumpf replies. Stumpf is asked whether he understands the damage that Wells Fargo has done to the industry. Stumpf replies that he grew up on a small farm, and understands proper values. I stand with the people who are doing the right thing, he pledges. Democratic member Gregory Meeks spoke for many critics, telling John Stumpf that Wells Fargo was a \u201ccriminal enterprise\u201d, that has \u201cgiven the entire financial services industry a black eye.\u201d He also suggested that the entire board may have to go. And now, the House committee moves onto exactly why Wells Fargo urged its staff to cross-sell eight financial products to each customer. It was a rallying cry, John Stumpf says. The average American family has 14 financial products... But Congressman Ed Royce isn\u2019t convinced. He points out that Wells Fargo\u2019s share price rose steadily as the cross-selling gathered pace [partly because some workers were creating fraudulent sales] Democratic member Mike Capuano compares Stumpf and his board to a bank robber who recently stole from a Wells branch. At the least, you\u2019re guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit identity theft.....and at least another dozen crimes, Capuano declares. He also tells Stumpf that his problems will really start when prosecutors get hold of him. Republican Sean Duffy then lays into Stumpf, for not stopping the account mis-selling scandal earlier. Duffy says Wells Fargo fired 1000 people in one year, another thousand the next, without the problem being stopped. And all the time you\u2019re stealing from people. If any bank in my community were stealing from people, then we\u2019d fire and fix the problem. Stumpf agrees that \u201cin some cases\u201d Wells Fargo staff had stolen from customers. Duffy accuses Stumpf of allowing the scandal to rumble on: I think Wells Fargo was making a lot of money out of what you were doing, and you were hoping you wouldn\u2019t get caught. Stumpf denies this, saying that fraudulent accounts cost $10m to fix. Wells Fargo loses out if a customer doesn\u2019t actually use a new product, he promises John Stumpf is now accused of putting unsustainable pressure on workers, by \u201cbragging\u201d about the amount of new bank accounts, credit cards, etc that Wells Fargo was \u201ccross-selling\u201d to customers. Congressman Brad Sherman says: \u201cYou fired 5,300 people, you took 5,300 good Americans and turned them into felons with a system that you created, benefited from and drove your stock price up by bragging about your levels of new accounts.\u201d And while thousands of staff were fired for misconduct, nothing was done to fix the underlying problems, Sherman adds. Blaine Luetkemeyer, Republican representative, then slams Stumpf for saying that Wells has sacked 1,000 staff each year for misconduct. That only happens if there is a culture that allows that to happen, Luetkemeyer insists. He also blames regulators for not spotting problems. Stumpf denies that there is a cultural problem at Wells, but he\u2019s facing more calls to step aside over this scandal. John Stumpf also tells the House committee that Wells Fargo is working on a new sales incentive scheme, and fully reviewing its control practices, going back several years. But the politicians aren\u2019t impressed. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, Democratic member, challenges Stumpf over the lot salaries paid to its staff: I know you\u2019re not aware of this, but it\u2019s very hard for someone to live in this country with a $25,000 salary. The CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, has returned to Capitol Hill for a second grilling. He\u2019s being quizzed by the House Financial Services Committee over the mis-selling scandal that saw 2 million unauthorized credit card and deposit accounts ordered for customers without permission. Republican member Carolyn Maloney has challenged Stumpf for selling $13m of Wells Fargo stock in 2013, immediately after he heard about the fake account scandal. Maloney says it\u2019s \u201cvery suspicious that your largest stock sale was after your $1.8 trillion bank was turned into a school for scoundrels.\u201d Stumpf says he owns much more stock than he is legally obliged to. He doesn\u2019t deny selling the stock, but insists it wasn\u2019t triggered by problems at the bank. He\u2019s also been challenged for not resigning over the scandal. Republican Patrick McHenry tells Stumpf that his bank has broken the law, and hurt customers. So what ethical standards is he holding himself up to? Stumpf insists that Wells Fargo is committed to fully investigating the issue, and whether any staff were fired for missing sales targets. Back in Frankfurt, Commerzbank\u2019s shares have fallen by over 2% after it announced 9,600 job cuts and a dividend freeze. But the flurry around Deutsche Bank has calmed a little. Its shares are up 0.7% today, after the Berlin government insisted yesterday that it isn\u2019t drawing up a rescue plan. Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at Eurasia Group, argues that Berlin is unlikely to bail out Deutsche Bank, for a couple of reasons. First, it might drive more voters towards the populist Alternative for Deutschland party. Secondly - EU rules insist that bond-holders are \u2018bailed in\u2019, before taxpayers are tapped up. And that should provide enough fresh capital if needed. He says: According to reports, Deutsche has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for potential fines and legal costs related to its ongoing discussions with the US Department of Justice. Given leaks the DoJ is seeking a much higher fine \u2013 in the order of \u20ac14bn \u2013 that means the banks maximum capital loss would be around \u20ac8.5bn. But Deutsche has approximately \u20ac12bn of \u201cCocos\u201d \u2013 financial instruments that are designed to be converted to shares if the bank were to enter a formal resolution procedure or undergo a precautionary recapitalisation. As such, these should easily cover any capital shortfall and obviate the need for taxpayer money from Berlin. More American data just hit the wires, but this is less positive than the growth figures. The number of contracts signed to buy a US home dipped by 2.4% last month, down to the lowest level since January. That implies that US consumer demand/confidence is weak. But analysts also blame a lack of supply; there simply aren\u2019t enough homes coming onto the market. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, explains: In most other areas, an increased number of prospective buyers appear to be either wavering at the steeper home prices pushed up by inventory shortages or disheartened by the competition for the miniscule number of affordable listings.\u201d Energy analyst Joe McMonigle of The Abraham Group suggests Opec\u2019s deal is looking less impressive, now the various hurdles have been examined: This muted reaction on Wall Street shows that Opec\u2019s deal isn\u2019t a major shift for global oil market (yet, anyway). But it\u2019s still a start. as Sebastien Marlier, commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: Given how divided OPEC members appeared only a few days ago, this joint agreement is a victory for the group. The pain caused by two years of low oil prices has prompted the cartel\u2019s members to look past their differences. But uncertainties abound and a much clearer message will be needed in November if prices are to move decisively higher. He also sees several hurdles: OPEC still needs to decide how the production cuts will be shared; the Saudi-Iran rivalry could re-emerge as a hurdle here. OPEC also needs to determine for how long it wants these quotas to stay in place; only a lasting cut will have a significant impact on the global supply-demand balance. Even if OPEC agrees on these details, implementation and compliance issues are likely to arise; Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Iraq, which could all make a case for being exempt from the cut, could be tempted to cheat. It is also worth noting that Saudi Arabia\u2019s output usually ebbs after the domestic peak in demand in the summer, so a production cut may have little impact on the country\u2019s exports. A final risk for OPEC is that higher prices, if sustained, risk incentivising production outside OPEC, notably in the US. This would defeat the whole purpose of yesterday\u2019s agreement. Over in New York, Wall Street has just opened for business with the usual bell-ringing and confetti. Shares are dipping a little, with the Dow Jones down 0.1% or 17 points at 18,321. But the US oil price is picking up, a little - gaining 20 cents per barrel to $47.25. That shows the markets haven\u2019t completely lost faith in Opec\u2019s pledge to cut production by up to 700,000 barrels per day (to as low as 32.5m) The London stock market hasn\u2019t been moved by the flurry of data from the US and Germany. The FTSE 100 is still up 1% at 6916, which would be a six-week closing high. Oil and energy stocks continue to power ahead, with Shell up 5.7% and BP up 4%. But outsourcing group Capita remains on track for its biggest one-day slump ever, down 26%. That follows this morning\u2019s profit warning, from a company which runs the London congestion charge and provides service to the NHS and many private businesses. Fellow outsourcing group Mitie issued its own profits warning 10 day ago, blaming the EU referendum vote. Gary Paulin, Head of Global Equities for Northern Trust Capital Markets, sees a clear pattern: \u201cCheck out post-referendum performance of Mitie (warned), Capita (warned) and Babcock. Different underlying businesses and Babcock is well run we think, but similar in that they all depend on customers renewing long term contracts. And on that front, the common theme emerging from the two warnings is that amidst Brexit uncertainty UK businesses are delaying decision-making on long term spending. That could have a meaningful impact on earnings momentum for support services companies with a mostly UK client base. And Babcock may be experiencing the same.\u201d The number of Americans filing new unemployment benefit claims rose by 3,000 last month, to 254,000. That\u2019s still comfortably below the 300,000 mark, which denotes a healthy economy. And the wider labour market looks solid too; the number of \u2018continuing claims\u2019 has dropped to 2.062m, from 2.108m. Another newsflash: America\u2019s economy grew faster than first thought in the second quarter of 2016. US GDP increased at an annualised rate of 1.4%, new figures show, up from 1.1%. That\u2019s the equivalent of a quarterly rate of 0.35%. Wall Street had expected the annualised rate to inch up to 1.2%. This is the final estimate of US GDP, and it shows that business spending and exports were better than thought, helping the economy pick up pace. Highlights include: Business investment grew by 1.0%, compared with an earlier estimate of a 0.9% decline. Business spending on structures shank by 2.1%, not by 8.4% Business spending on equipment fell by 2.9%, not by 3.7% Business spending on intellectual property and software jumped by 9%, up from 8.6% Exports rose by 1.8%, not 1.2% as first thought. Imports rose by 0.2%, down from 0.3% Consumer spending grew by 4.3%, down from a first estimate of 4.4% This suggests the US economy was stronger than we thought in the spring, and may have picked up pace over the summer. Just in.. Prices in Germany have risen at the fastest pace since May 2015. The annual Consumer Prices index has risen to 0.7% this month, up from 0.4% in August. Energy prices were less of a drag on inflation, while food, services and rental costs all rose. This should please the European Central Bank, as it keeps interest rates on record lows and pumps tens of billions of new euros into the system each month to ward off deflation. Brent crude is still declining to rally today, having surged last when the Opec deal came. Having inched over the $49/barrel point in early trading, it is now down by 0.5% at $48.45. Ranko Beric of foreign exchange firm Monex Europe says that shows how the markets aren\u2019t convinced by Opec: \u201cOPEC\u2019s agreement to cut production came as a complete surprise to markets last night, but it\u2019s interesting that Brent has failed to breach the $50/barrel level that has acted as resistance in recent months... It appears that market participants remain sceptical of OPEC\u2019s mettle, and if the cuts announced will be sufficient to clear the current supply glut in crude.\u201d Capital Economics are also in the sceptical camp. They have issued a note called \u201cOPEC deal not a game-changer for oil markets\u201d, which questions whether output will really be cut at all. Here\u2019s why: Iran, Libya and Nigeria will be allowed to increase production to \u201cmaximum levels that make sense\u201d. Given that these three countries are aiming to increase cumulative output by about 1.5m bpd by the end of the year this implies that either the \u201creal\u201d OPEC output quota is closer to 34.5m bpd or that the rest of OPEC are willing to cut output by enough to offset these increases. In practice, most of the burden of cuts would fall on Saudi Arabia, which we doubt will be altruistic enough to substantially cut its own output to benefit the rest of the group. As such, we suspect that the actual OPEC production ceiling will turn out to be considerably higher than 32.5m - 33m bpd. Even assuming no increase in output from Libya and Nigeria, the seasonal decline in Saudi Arabia\u2019s production from summer to winter (about 350,000 bpd last year) would be enough to bring the group\u2019s output within its target range. As a result, supply would be no lower than it otherwise would have been. The Financial Times explains how disagreements between Iran and Saudi Arabia could knock the Opec deal off course: Delegates from Iran say they have secured a production number close to 4m barrels a day \u2014 their stated post-sanctions target \u2014 and representatives from Gulf countries say there is an expectation that Iran caps production at this level. However, that is not yet set in stone and negotiations are still ongoing. With Saudi and Iran still fighting proxy battles from Yemen to Syria, renewed disagreement before Vienna cannot be ruled out. Other hurdles includes: Getting every Opec member to commit to the deal. That could be crucial in getting production down by the full 700,000 barrels per day, to 32.5m per day. Otherwise, Opec might only achieve the high end of its target, 33m, which is more of a freeze than a cut (see earlier chart) Persuading Russia (not an Opec member) to make a contribution. The long-term threat from US shale. Companies which survived the last couple of years are now pretty competitive, and can probably make a profit at a lower oil price than before. More here: FT: Opec agreement faces array of hurdles Energy journalist Ben Winkley has been tracking analyst reaction to the Opec deal, and found plenty of scepticism. Here\u2019s a flavour: All very valid points. On the other hand, few analysts expected anything to be agreed in Algiers yesterday. So Opec could still deliver in November. The boss of Swiss bank UBS has warned it could start charging more customers for banking services, due to the impact of negative rates. The headline Swiss deposit rate is currently minus 0.75%, and chief executive Sergio Ermotti says UBS - the world\u2019s largest money manager \u2013 can\u2019t absorb this indefinitely. The problem is that negative rates eat into a bank\u2019s profitability, by narrowing the gap between the cost of its liabilities (ie, deposits) and what it can earn from lending. Reuters has the details: UBS has already upped fees for corporate and institutional clients as well as raising mortgage rates by 50 basis points and accepting a smaller share of the market, but Ermotti cautioned this might not be enough if negative rates persisted. \u201cWe may need to start to think about how to pass more negative rates to a broader client base than being able to reprice the asset side of the equation,\u201d Ermotti said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference in London. Should people worry that the oil price is going to spike, pushing up transport and heating costs? Marino Valensise, head of multi-asset at Barings, says not, and sees a ceiling at around $60 per barrel. He explains that the global oil industry is producing an extra 1.5 million barrels more than needed each day, partly due to the US shale gas industry. A 700,000 bpd cut won\u2019t eliminate that glut. Shale producers also suffered from low oil prices over the last couple of years, but Valensise is confident they can boost production if needed. Low prices mean budgetary challenges for a lot of oil producers, hence the cuts we\u2019ve seen today. Once confirmed, one might expect that the oil price could go higher, but the cap that we see on the price of oil is between USD $55 and USD $60. At those levels, share producers in the States will inevitably increase production and there will be no potential through that price level. That price level is coming down by the day because the cost of extraction in the US is going down a couple of dollars per year as technology improves. This graph, from energy analyst John Kemp, puts Opec\u2019s production cut into context: If Opec manages the full 700,000 barrels-per-day cut, then output would be higher than in spring. And a smaller cut, from 33.2m to 33.0m per day, is more like a freeze at this summer\u2019s levels. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, the FCA, has charged a former portfolio manager at asset management group Blackrock with insider trading. Mark Alexander Lyttleton faces three counts of insider dealing, relating to \u201ctrading in equities and a call option between 2 October 2011 and 16 December 2011.\u201d More here. Optimism within the eurozone has risen this month, according to the European Commission\u2019s latest data. The EC\u2019s economic sentiment measure rose to 104.9 in September, from 103.5 in August. That\u2019s the highest since January, with retailers and industrial firms both less pessimistic. And the consumer sentiment index remained negative, but improved to -8.2 from -8.5 last month. It looks like another sign that anxiety following the EU referendum three months ago has eased. Energy companies are still rallying strongly in London, thanks to the Opec news. Royal Dutch Shell (the largest company on the Footsie) and BT (5th largest) have driven the market up. The FTSE 100 is currently up by 77 points to 6926, a gain of 1.1%, despite Capita tumbling following its profits warning. Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG says energy stocks suddenly look good value, if Opec delivers on its promises. Expectations of a bigger cut to oil output later on in the year, ideally with Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest players, doing their bit, could see oil reverse its traditionally weak performance in the fourth quarter and push higher. It turns out that OPEC members can agree, and no doubt oil companies and their investors will be hoping that this outbreak of amity continues into the end of 2016. The oil price continues to dip as traders wonder if Opec will really cut production in November. Brent crude is now down 1.1% at $48.15 per barrel, so still clinging onto most of last night\u2019s 6% jump. Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains why the City may still be sceptical: Even if it is a good news for oil prices, this is just a pre-agreement in which OPEC members agree to trim production without actually specifying who will take the cut or how it will be divided. Therefore, we remain cautious concerning the effects of an actual trim in production, especially in view of the OPEC\u2019s history of consistently failing to reach a consensus. And this charts hows how oil demand (light blue) hasn\u2019t taken off this year, helping to force Opec\u2019s hand. Commerzbank, Germany\u2019s second largest bank, has announced plans to cut 9,600 jobs in a restructuring plan. The cuts represent around a fifth of Commerzbank\u2019s total workforce, and will probably include forced layoffs. Commerzbank is also suspending its dividend payments for this year, as it tries to protect its profitability. The cuts are part of a new strategy drawn up by chief executive Martin Zielke, called \u201cCommerzbank 4.0\u201d, which has just been announced. This includes focusing on two areas - \u2018private and small business customers\u2019 and \u2018corporate clients\u2019, and \u201cdigitalising around 80% of relevent processes\u201d (Reuters reports). It also hopes to create 2,300 new jobs. There were rumours this week that Zielke was planning a deep overhaul of the bank\u2019s operations, after reporting a drop in earnings back in August. Like most banks, Commerszbank has suffered from record low interest rates - which restrict its ability to make profits. Newsflash: The number of mortgage loans granted in the UK has hit its lowest level in 21 months, down by almost 900 to 60,058 in August. But consumers credit is growing, with the public borrowing \u00a31.574bn last month, up from \u00a31.191bn in July. Reuters has the details: British mortgage approvals fell to their lowest level since November 2014 last month as the housing market continued to slow after June\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Bank of England data showed on Thursday. But the BoE figures also showed lending to consumers continued to grow rapidly, expanding at a rate close to the 10-year highs seen in previous months. Mortgage approvals for house purchases numbered 60,058 in August, down from 60,925 in July. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast 60,150 mortgage approvals for August. More City reaction to the Opec agreement: Bloomberg have a good explanation about Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to cut output to push prices higher. They point out that the kingdom\u2019s oil minister, Khalid Al-Falih, has reversed his predecessor\u2019s policy of letting the market set the oil without interference. Here\u2019s why: In 2014, when Saudi Arabia led OPEC\u2019s pump-at-will policy, Riyadh calculated that if it reduced output, prices wouldn\u2019t rise enough to compensate. This time is different. \u201cSaudi Arabia is betting that a small cut will pay for itself through higher oil prices and hence higher revenues,\u201d said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. It\u2019s not as if the pump-at-will policy hasn\u2019t had its moments. Saudi Arabia has achieved some of its objectives. Low prices tossed water on the U.S. oil boom, and energy companies have cut as much as $1 trillion in new projects, creating a possible supply hole in the next decade. The kingdom has also scared investors who are now more likely to think twice before plunging money into risky oil ventures. And from the U.S. to China, sales of gas-guzzling cars have soared, bolstering demand. For all the justifications, the last two years haven\u2019t panned out as Riyadh thought they would. At home, the kingdom has burned through more than $150 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, government contractors have gone unpaid, and this week the king announced unprecedented pay cuts for civil servants. More here: In U-Turn, Saudis Choose Higher Prices Over Free Oil Markets Another interesting chart, from Morgan Stanley, showing how Opec can struggle to stick to its production targets (the blue line): Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t terribly impressed with the Opec deal either, and aren\u2019t changing their oil price forecasts. Goldman analysts still expect US crude oil (or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) ) to hover around $43 a barrel for the end of this year and $53 a barrel in 2017. They told clients that: \u201cIf this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self-defeating medium term with a large drilling response around the world.\u201d But there\u2019s also no guarantee that Opec members will stick to the script, as: \u201cCompliance to quotas is historically poor, especially when oil demand is not weak.\u201d CNBC has more details: Just in... Germany\u2019s unemployment rate remains at a healthy 6.1% this month. The Federal Labour Office reports that the seasonally adjusted jobless total rose by 1,000 to 2.680 million in September. Analysts had expected a fall of 5,000. But strip out seasonal adjustments, and the unemployment total actually fell to 2.608m, from 2.684m, underlining the health of the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. Separate data shows that German industrial orders rose by 2% in August, having been weak earlier in the summer. Domestic demand was strong. This chart shows how many Opec members are pumping at almost maximum capacity, as they try to pull in as much revenue as possible. For last night\u2019s deal to work, at least some members have to agree to cut - and we don\u2019t know who. Plus, other producers will surely turn their taps back up if Opec succeed in pushing the oil price higher. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, says: There is also no guarantee that a cut triggers a meaningful increase in price of course. Nigeria is looking to bring on around a million barrels per day soon \u2013 roughly what analysts expect will be the sum total of these cuts \u2013 whilst you had better believe that shale operators in the US and elsewhere will be looking forward to getting their wild cat operations. Marc Ostwald, analyst at ADM Investor Services, is also a little sceptical, telling clients: There is of course the OPEC \u2018production deal\u2019 to digest, which it has to be said looks to be of the \u2018we must agree something, however vague and lacking in specific detail\u2019, with the fear that downward seasonal pressures would send oil prices into a renewed downward spiral the clear motivating factor. Interestingly, the oil price is now dipping a little, having surged late last night. Brent crude has dropped by 0.4%, or 20 cents per barrel, to $48.50. That\u2019s still almost three dollars higher than yesterday\u2019s lows. But it suggests the markets are looking for more details about this Opec deal to cut production by 700,000 barrels per day. As explained earlier, we simply don\u2019t have the full details - except that apparently Iran won\u2019t have to freeze production. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains A committee has been set up to deal with that [who freezes production] and is likely to be a tall order if history is any guide. Ultimately the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and if history is any judge, the detail will fall short. If anything this looks like another attempt to keep a floor under prices without actually having to do anything. For now it seems to be working, the ultimate in jaw-jaw. In addition the full details won\u2019t be known until the full OPEC meeting at the end of November, which means another two months of capacity output, of over 33m barrels per day. There is also the not insignificant matter of persuading non OPEC members like Russia, who are not party to the deal, to come on board. Good luck with that one! Setting Capita\u2019s woes aside, European stock markets are all rallying as investors move money into riskier assets. It\u2019s all thanks to the oil production deal, say Mike van Dulken &amp; Henry Croft at Accendo Markets: The positive open come almost entirely courtesy of last night\u2019s surprise OPEC production cut agreement. The news sent oil prices sharply higher and has helped Energy names overnight while buoying sentiment in the general commodity space. Shares in Capita, the outsourcing and professional services group, have plunged by 22% at the start of trading. The company has issued a profits warning this morning, saying that clients have been delaying spending decisions following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU in June. Capita cut its profit forecast for this year to between \u00a3535m and \u00a3555m, compared to analyst forecasts of a \u00a3614m profit. It told the City that: Our performance in the second half of the year to date has been below expectations, as a result of a slow-down in specific trading businesses, one-off costs incurred on the Transport for London (TfL) congestion charging contract and continued delays in client decision making. That sent its shares sliding to their lowest level since November 2012, and on track for their worst daily fall ever. Shares in major oil producers have jumped at the start of trading in London. Royal Dutch Shell are up 5%, with BP gaining 4.3%. Mining groups Anglo American and BHP Billiton are also in the top risers, gaining almost 5%. That has sent the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares up 75 points, or 1.1%, to 6925. That\u2019s a one-week high; and would be its highest closing level since mid-August. Smaller producers are gaining too. Hunting, which supplies equipment to the oil industry, has leapt by 13%. Tullow Oil, which finds oil in Africa and the margins of the Atlantic, has gained 11%. The big surprise is that Saudi Arabia has reversed its approach to managing the oil market. Saudi is the biggest producer in Opec, and had appeared happy to push the oil price down to hurt rival producers (particularly the new shale industry). But a lower oil price has hurt Saudi\u2019s economy too; it is expected to run a deficit of 13.5% of GDP this year, and is imposing wage cuts as part of an austerity drive. So the \u2018pump-at-will\u2019 policy appears to have been scrapped. As Bill Blain of Mint Partners puts it on Bloomberg TV: \u201cThey are hoping to turn around a world where they were trying to work the price down and keep new producers out, to a new world where they can wok the price up again.\u201d But that\u2019s a tricky task - if the oil price jumps, American producers will return to the market. John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, told CNBC that Saudi Arabia\u2019s old policy of letting the market set the oil price had backfired. \u201cThe big takeaway is how into a corner the Saudis have backed themselves. This whole plan has backfired on them. They\u2019re going to be bearing most of the cutback if they pull it off, and they\u2019ve had to really kowtow to the Iranians in this whole thing.\u201d It appears that Iran won\u2019t actually cut production itself, but will rein in its ambitions. Associated Press reports: According to Wednesday\u2019s deal, Iran will be allowed to increase production to 3.7 million barrels a day, according to Algerian participants at the meeting. It is currently estimated to be pumping around 3.6 million but had been aiming for 4 million per day. Sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil industry were lifted in January, and it has been aiming to boost production. Stock markets in Asia have jumped on the back of Opec\u2019s surprise deal to cut output, even though details are limited. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the way, jumping by nearly 1.4%. A higher oil price would please Japanese policymakers, as they strive for higher inflation. The other major indices are all up too, as energy stocks benefit: FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says traders had thought an Opec deal was \u201cmission impossible\u201d. But he also wants to see more details... Battered finances of major oil producing countries forced the leaders to put their differences to one side and end a 2-year unofficial war on shale. Crude prices surged by 6% following yesterday\u2019s news and sent Asian equities higher with energy stocks leading the rally. Such a deal should have had a stronger impact on oil, I would say at least a 10-15% rally, but the limited details of the agreement put a limit on the upside and we will now have to wait until November 30 to see whether the agreement will translate into actions, and whether non-OPEC oil producers will follow suit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are heading higher today, after the Opec cartel pulled a big surprise, and agreed to cut oil production, for the first time in eight years. The deal was hammered out at informal talks in Algiers last night. It will see global production cut by up to 700,000 barrels per day, from 33.24m to 32.5-33m. That effectively takes Opec back to the levels in play before the cartel abandoned its targets last December, triggering a glut in production. News of the deal sent the oil price soaring late last night, up around 6%. Brent crude is now worth $48.76 per barrel, up from $45.70 yesterday. Traders had seen little chance of a deal at the Algiers talks, given the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. But instead, Saudi appear to have abandoned its policy of keeping the oil price low to drive rivals, such as shale producers, out of the markets. Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, broke the news, saying: \u201cWe have decided to decrease production by around 700,000 barrels per day. Opec officials say that production levels for each member country will be agreed at its next formal meeting, on 30 November in Vienna. Reuters has more details: After reaching its group target, it will seek support from non-member oil producers to further ease the global glut. Brent crude settled up $2.72, or 5.9%, at $48.69 a barrel, hitting a more than two-week high of $48.96. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose by $2.38, or 5.3%, to settle at $47.05, after a peak $47.45, its highest since 8 September. The oil rally spilled over into the stock market, with Wall Street\u2019s index of energy shares rising 4% for its best one-day gain since January. Some analysts are hailing the deal as a breakthrough. For example, Phil Flynn, analyst at Chicago-based brokerage Price Futures Group, says: \u201cThis is a historic deal. This is the first time Opec and non-Opec will agree together in over a decade. This should put a floor on oil and should see oil move back toward the $60s.\u201d But other experts aren\u2019t convinced; will this cut really be enforced? Which countries will actually cut production? And if the oil price goes up, won\u2019t shale producers simply start pumping more too? For now, though, the markets are happy. Asian markets rallied overnight, and we\u2019re expecting European indices to jump by around 1% this morning.

It is also worth noting that Saudi Arabia\u2019s output usually ebbs after the domestic peak in demand in the summer, so a production cut may have little impact on the country\u2019s exports.<br></li> <li><strong>A final risk for OPEC is that higher prices, if sustained, risk incentivising production outside OPEC, notably in the US</strong>.

This time is different.</p> <p>\u201cSaudi Arabia is betting that a small cut will pay for itself through higher oil prices and hence higher revenues,\u201d said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the pump-at-will policy hasn\u2019t had its moments. Saudi Arabia has achieved some of its objectives. Low prices tossed water on the U.S. oil boom, and energy companies have cut as much as $1 trillion in new projects, creating a possible supply hole in the next decade. The kingdom has also scared investors who are now more likely to think twice before plunging money into risky oil ventures. And from the U.S. to China, sales of gas-guzzling cars have soared, bolstering demand.</p> <p>For all the justifications, the last two years haven\u2019t panned out as Riyadh thought they would. At home, the kingdom has burned through more than $150 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, government contractors have gone unpaid, and this week the king announced unprecedented pay cuts for civil servants.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/in-u-turn-saudis-pick-cash-over-flirting-with-free-oil-markets\">In U-Turn, Saudis Choose Higher Prices Over Free Oil Markets</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ecd018e4b07eb0f44b8519\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:26:30.987Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another interesting chart, from Morgan Stanley, showing how Opec can struggle to stick to its production targets (the blue line):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/781408909701545984\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Opec?src=hash\">#Opec</a> Intervention Not As Good As It Sounds as there is a history of cheating. <a href=\"https://t.co/sLcudBR2Qf\">pic.twitter.com/sLcudBR2Qf</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/781408909701545984\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:26:44.961Z\">at 9.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eccd1ce4b07eb0f44b8509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:18:06.871Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t terribly impressed with the Opec deal either, and aren\u2019t changing their oil price forecasts.</strong></p> <p><strong>Goldman </strong>analysts still expect US crude oil (or West Texas Intermediate (WTI) ) to hover around $43 a barrel for the end of this year and $53 a barrel in 2017.</p> <p>They told clients that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf this proposed cut is strictly enforced and supports prices, we would expect it to prove self-defeating medium term with a large drilling response around the world.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>But there\u2019s also no guarantee that Opec members will stick to the script, as:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cCompliance to quotas is historically poor, especially when oil demand is not weak.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/28/goldman-sachs-opec-production-cut-deal-doesnt-change-oil-price-forecasts-through-2017.html\">CNBC has more details</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarolinCNBC/status/781372311400251392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Goldman Sachs: OPEC oil deal doesn&#39;t change our price outlook <a href=\"https://t.co/SfAtbsyHQP\">https://t.co/SfAtbsyHQP</a></p>&mdash; Carolin Roth (@CarolinCNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolinCNBC/status/781372311400251392\">September 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57eccb2ae4b0c6325341f21a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-29T08:10:03.994Z\">9.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"08dd807a5e1ae6bc108e36982d84e35dfb70b65f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08dd807a5e1ae6bc108e36982d84e35dfb70b65f/0_0_3900_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The national flag of Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Just in...

Women are greatly outnumbered at most major tech companies, and a 2016 survey found that 60% of women working in Silicon Valley had experienced sexual harassment. A 2015 report on Silicon Valley found that men were earning 61% more than their female counterparts. Greathouse largely ascribes such disparities to unconscious bias rather than intentional discrimination. \u201cI happen to believe that this bias is at least somewhat the result of unconscious factors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMuch like a book, people cannot avoid judging their fellow humans by their \u2018cover\u2019.\u201d Greathouse bolstered his case for women to hide their gender by pointing to the \u201cblind auditions\u201d used by orchestras, which helped professional orchestras transform from being 95% male in the 1970s to much more equal. Of course, under the orchestra system, both men and women screen their identities during auditions. The idea has gained traction in the tech industry, where some startups are attempting to transform the hiring process by anonymizing candidates. Interviewing.io, for example, is a platform that allows tech companies to conduct technical interviews through an entirely anonymous system. The program includes voice masking technology that obscures a job applicant\u2019s gender and is already being used by companies including Uber, Twitch, and Lyft. \u201cThere\u2019s this axiom in this article that the status quo is working and we just need to do little tweaks,\u201d said Aline Lerner, the founder and CEO of interviewing.io, in response to the Wall Street Journal article. \u201cThe real issue is that r\u00e9sum\u00e9-based hiring is not working very well. Any kind of hiring that opens up to biases is not working.\u201d Lerner said that using the anonymous interviewing tool helps neutralize those biases by allowing employers to \u201cfocus primarily and exclusively on whether that person can write code or not\u201d. She also pointed out that all candidates need to use the tool, not only the women. \u201cIn order for anonymity to be viable it has to be full anonymity.\u201d Greathouse\u2019s article makes the implicit argument that fixing gender bias is the responsibility of women, not men. His calls for gender neutrality interestingly do not apply to men, suggesting that his idea of neutrality is in fact simply male. Greathouse did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He is a managing partner at Rincon Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in web-based businesses. According to its website, Rincon has two male managing directors. The firm also lists 12 advisors, 11 of whom are men.",

As G4S and Serco found novel ways to shoot themselves in the foot and annoy governments, Capita kept its reputation for reliability. It was a tribute, we thought, to its concentration on dull back-office tasks such as running IT operations for life assurance firms. The company\u2019s status as the sector\u2019s star turn will not evaporate entirely with Thursday\u2019s hefty profits warning that sent the share price down 27%. It is still possible to take a cheerful view that a \u00a370m-ish shortfall in profits this year \u2013 \u00a3545m is now predicted instead of \u00a3614m \u2013 will become just one lost year in a remarkable 25-year run as a public company. At flotation in 1991, turnover was \u00a325m; now it is close to \u00a35bn. But this was Capita\u2019s first profits warning and the alarming part was that the explanation was one damn thing after another. Referendum-related breezes, which slowed stock market flotations and thus demand for Capita\u2019s registrar services, grab attention but most of the confessions had nothing to do with Brexit. A unit reselling IT systems was whacked by competitors. In specialist recruitment, more public sector bodies think they don\u2019t need to use a middleman. Delays in installing new IT for the London congestion zone caused a \u00a320m-\u00a325m one-off hit. And, by way of diversion, Capita\u2019s lawyers are quarrelling with the Co-op Bank over a mortgage-outsourcing contract. Just a series of unfortunate slips? Possibly, but the nagging doubt is that G4S and Serco went off the rails, in part, because their businesses became so big and sprawling that central management couldn\u2019t keep all the balls in the air. Capita sensibly never shared its rivals\u2019 dreams of spanning the globe but it is vastly more complicated than in the good old days of easy growth. It employs 75,000 people, 17,000 of them abroad, and some of the thousands of contracts run on fine margins. In the circumstances, the share price plunge looks fair: Capita has to show it has not grown too large. Car trouble There is silliness on both sides of the business-related debate about Brexit. Liam Fox, the trade secretary, provided a prime example recently when he said British business was too fat and lazy to exploit the wonderful trading opportunities he will soon be negotiating. His clarifying remarks about the opportunities in a \u201cpost-geography trading world\u201d were equally vague. But here, from the opposite direction, comes Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn with a truly off-the-wall demand. Nissan is contemplating where to build its next Qashqai sports utility vehicle and, if the choice is Sunderland, he would like to be paid compensation by the UK government if the European Union puts tariffs on cars imported from Britain. \u201cIf there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for carmakers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation,\u201d he said. What? Should UK taxpayers also be bribing Goldman Sachs to stay in London if Brussels cuts up rough on passporting rights? Nobody would deny that UK carmakers face unique post-Brexit worries, but Ghosn must surely have noticed that the pound has fallen 12% against the euro since the referendum, delivering a nice competitive boost for exporters. Yes, an EU tariff on car imports, if set at 10%, would wipe out most of that advantage, but the sums would still be finely balanced at current exchange rates. Time to take responsibility Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, and Sir John Sunderland, the chairman who has also chaired the company\u2019s health, safety and security committee since 2010, do not share this column\u2019s view that a resignation would have been the right response to the damning remarks made by the judge in Alton Towers rollercoaster-crash case. The two men are staying in post, despite being told that the \u201cneedless and avoidable\u201d accident that caused two women to lose a leg was the result of Merlin\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic failure to assess risk and have a structured system of work\u201d. It\u2019s their decision to make, of course. But please, Merlin, stop telling us (yet again in Thursday\u2019s trading update) that \u201cfrom the beginning the company has accepted full responsibility for the accident\u201d. That phrasing skips over a heavy qualification made by Michael Chambers QC in his sentencing remarks: \u201cWhilst the defendant [Merlin] should have full credit for the plea of guilty, the earlier acceptance of responsibility was tainted by the willingness to blame its employees when the fundamental fault was that of the company.\u201d",

Stumpf was quizzed by the House financial committee for over four hours on Thursday about his staff opening two million unauthorized accounts in order to meet sales quotas imposed by the bank. The hearing followed an equally contentious one in the Senate last week. About 5,300 employees have been fired by Wells Fargo over the past few years for creating as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customer\u2019s permission. Democrats and Republicans are united in their disapproval of Stumpf and Wells Fargo and its handling of the situation. \u201cY\u2019all were rotten,\u201d said South Carolina Republican congressman John Michael \u201cMick\u201d Mulvaney. Stumpf \u201cwouldn\u2019t even be here if I was on the board of that company\u201d. \u201cYou should be downright ashamed of yourself,\u201d said David Scott, a Democrat from Georgia. California Democrats Brad Sherman and Maxine Waters both called for big banks to be broken up. \u201cI\u2019ve come to a conclusion: Wells Fargo should be broken up,\u201d Waters told Stumpf. \u201cIt is too big to manage.\u201d As of 1 October, Wells Fargo has eliminated the practice of sales quotas in its retail banking departments. Stumpf said that the quotas were \u201cmisunderstood\u201d and used by former employees \u201cas a way to be dishonest and break the ethics code\u201d. Wells Fargo \u201cnever had a target of eight\u201d products per customer. \u201cThat was aspirational,\u201d said Stumpf. A former employee told the Guardian that in 2013, sales quotas for employees were to sells 20 products a day. In 2014, they were reduced to 15 products a day. Two days before the hearing, Wells Fargo announced it was launching a new independent investigation into its sales practices going back to 2009. That same day the bank announced that Stumpf, who became chief executive in 2007 and chairman of the bank\u2019s board in 2010, will forfeit unvested equity awards worth about $41m. Stumpf said the decision was made on his recommendation. During last week\u2019s hearing, Stumpf testified that he made $19.3m last year. Stumpf will not receive a salary while the bank launches a new investigation into its sales practices. Another executive to be subject to a clawback \u2013 a recovery of money previously awarded to an executive \u2013 is Carrie Tolstedt, who oversaw retail banking at Wells Fargo during the time that such unauthorized accounts were created. Last week, after Fortune reported that Tolstedt could walk away with as much as $124.6m after she retired this weekend, the bank sent a letter to the US Senate detailing her pay package. The letter notes that Tolstedt owns 960,017 shares of Wells Fargo. At the time of the letter \u2013 16 September \u2013 those shares were worth about $43.6m. Her vested stock options were worth about $34.1m. Her unvested awards were worth about $18.9m. In the aftermath of the scandal, the bank\u2019s independent board decided Toldstedt should forfeit about $19m in unvested awards. That still leaves her with more than $77m. Tolstedt will not receive any severance or bonus for 2016 and agreed not to exercise her outstanding options while the investigation is ongoing. Even as lawmakers called for clawbacks, experts expressed some doubt over whether the bank would be willing to enact them. Wells Fargo\u2019s clawback policy is very strong and thorough in listing what can trigger a clawback of executive pay, according to Matt Moscardi, head of financial sector research at MSCI. MSCI has previously flagged the fact that Wells Fargo is \u201clargely entrenched\u201d and that some of its members, including those on the compensation committee, have been on the board for more than 10 years and some have sat on other boards with Stumpf. \u201cThe influence Stumpf can have being both chief executive officer and chair is not negligible,\u201d said Moscardi. \u201cThese are people that he is on other boards with. There are a lot of cross-board connections.\u201d When the Wells Fargo clawbacks were announced on Tuesday, the board\u2019s lead independent director, Stephen Sanger, noted that the board reserves an option for further clawbacks pending the investigation. Stumpf told Congress that he was not a part of the board\u2019s determination and that the board \u201cacts quite independently\u201d. When questioned about whether there was a conflict with him serving as both chief executive and chairman of the board, he said: \u201cFor our company, I believe we have the right structure. I serve at the will of the board and the board can make a decision about that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sales at HMV went backwards last year as it retreated from the challenging video games market, and Britons\u2019 move away from physical CD, films and games collections continued. HMV turned over \u00a3325m in the year to 2 January compared with \u00a3366m in 2015, a figure that was bolstered by the inclusion of an extra week\u2019s trading. Despite the decline, HMV chair, Paul McGowan, described the figures as \u201cencouraging\u201d, pointing to market-share gains made in physical music and film sales. \u201cWe are very pleased to be approaching our fourth anniversary since we acquired HMV and these encouraging results mirror the exciting year we have witnessed,\u201d said McGowan. McGowan said overall sales had been \u201cin line with budget\u201d, with the decrease down to a 53-week trading period in 2015 as well as the decision to reduce shelf space devoted to video games. The toughness of the games market has been well documented by specialist Game Digital, which has issued a profit warning every Christmas \u2013 which in common with HMV is its most lucrative time of year \u2013 since returning to the stock exchange in 2014. HMV was bought out of administration by restructuring firm Hilco in 2013. The entertainment chain, established in 1921, had been felled by the financial squeeze created by high debt levels and falling sales. Hilco\u2019s \u00a350m buyout salvaged just over half the HMV chain which now trades from around 120 stores. McGowan, also chief executive of Hilco, said HMV increased its share of the physical music market from 26.7% in 2014 to 27.7% in 2015. Its share of the DVD market also increased from 20.1% to 21.2%. Vinyl sales at established stores surged more than 50% as Britons rekindle their relationship with their record players, HMV said. More recently Hilco was involved in the BHS store closure programme. According to Kantar Worldpanel, the market for physical music, video and games declined by 8.3% to \u00a32.1bn in 2015. The most recent quarterly figures for the entertainment market show it continuing to contract at a similar rate, down 8.1% in the 12 weeks to 3 July. The accounts filed at Companies House show HMV Retail made a pre-tax loss of \u00a38.8m after expenses that included \u00a310.3m of payments to sister companies. Top line operating operating profits were \u00a311.7m, down from \u00a315.2m in the previous year. Among the biggest related party transactions is a \u00a37m payment to Hilco company Goodmans Capital Investments, comprising a \u00a36m loan repayment as well as \u00a31.1m of interest. HMV relaunched online last June and McGowan said the site was enjoying strong growth, pulling in around 1m visitors per month. It has also started selling products such as speakers and turntables online, with the latter enabling it to cash in on the resurgence of vinyl. According to the most recent figures from Kantar Worldpanel, HMV increased its share of the physical entertainment market by 2.3 percentage points to 16.3% in the three months to 3 July compared with the same period a year ago. However, its share was down on the previous quarter\u2019s high of 16.9% as Britons jumped online to buy Star Wars: The Force Awakens and shop the back catalogues of the late David Bowie and Prince.",

    "webTitle": "Oil price and stock markets rise as Opec cuts crude output", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil and share prices rose after Opec members struck a deal to limit crude output for the first time since 2008, in an attempt to ease a global glut that has more than halved crude prices in the past two years. The group of leading oil-producing countries agreed to limit production to between 32.5m and 33m barrels per day. It is a small reduction of the current output of 33.24m bpd and was agreed at informal talks at an industry event in Algiers on Wednesday. \u201cWe have decided to decrease production by around 700,000 bpd,\u201d Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, told Reuters. Brent crude rose 2% on Thursday to just over $49.64 a barrel and has gained almost 8% since the agreement was announced on Wednesday evening. The dollar rose to an eight-day high against the yen as traders became less risk averse and the FTSE 100 index rose 1% to a six-week high of 6,919 with oil and commodities companies leading the charge. Royal Dutch Shell, Britain\u2019s largest oil company, was the biggest gainer in the sector, rising more than 6%, and BP rose 4.4%. British Gas owner Centrica, Glencore, the commodities trader, and mining shares also rose strongly as Opec\u2019s move supported the prices of other commodities. Michael Burns, an oil and gas partner at Ashurst law firm, said: \u201cThis could well be a significant turning point. Though the detail is to be worked through, the support from Opec will likely give more confidence to investors on medium to long-term prices, something that has been very much lacking over the last two years.\u201d Opec, whose leading members are Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, will try to agree individual production targets for each country at its meeting on 30 November in Vienna. But analysts warned this would be hard to do because Opec\u2019s members are divided about output levels. Iran has remained unwilling to reduce production, which remains below peak capacity as it recovers from US sanctions lifted in January. Libya and Nigeria are also seeking to increase production after years of disruption caused by internal conflict. The agreement to limit production after several failed attempts is a reversal of policy for Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, which had sworn to maintain output in the hope that low oil prices would force US shale producers out of business. Oil has fallen from $105 a barrel in summer 2014 due to a global glut caused by shale production in the US and oversupply from countries such as Brazil, combined with a slowing global economy and lower growth in demand from China. Dougie Youngson, an analyst at the stockbroker Finncap, said Saudi Arabia has realised its strategy is not working but that it does not want to be the \u201cswing producer\u201d that cuts output while others carry on as before. He said that although some US shale producers had gone bust, those that remain have become more efficient. \u201cThere is a lot of work that has to be done and the agreement could fall apart quite quickly. US shale is not going to go away and arguably Opec has made things worse because the companies that have survived are better placed for when the oil price goes up.\u201d The resistance of the Saudis and Iran to output cuts caused divisions in Opec as low prices inflicted pain on member states\u2019 economies. Saudi Arabia\u2019s resolve has weakened as the prolonged low oil price has forced it to cut public spending to protect its financial reserves. Jason Gammel, an analyst at the stockbroker Jefferies, said Opec\u2019s announcement could be an attempt to push up prices without reducing supply \u2013 but this could ease pressure on rival producers before a likely meeting of supply and demand this year. \u201cWe remain sceptical about any effect in the physical crude market \u2026 The risk of abandoning the market share strategy before the market achieves balance is that a higher price could allow new supply from higher up the cost curve to reach the market.\u201d Negotiations are further complicated by the position of Russia, which is relying on oil production to support its ailing economy. Opec has invited representatives from Russia to attend its meeting in November.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of the revived British Steel has claimed that Tata Steel \u201clost interest\u201d in the Scunthorpe steelworks, one of only two left in Britain, and that the site is back in profit just three months after it was sold by the Indian company. Roland Junck, executive chairman of British Steel, said the Scunthorpe steelworks had become \u201cinward-looking\u201d and \u201cstopped comparing themselves with the best\u201d. British Steel was re-formed in June when investment firm Greybull bought Tata Steel\u2019s long products business, which is primarily the Scunthorpe steelworks, for \u00a31 and renamed it. British Steel disappeared in 1999 when it merged with a Dutch rival to become Corus. Corus was later bought by Tata Steel. Tata Steel offloaded the Scunthorpe site earlier this year as it battled to stop mounting losses in its UK business. The Indian company is still considering the future of Port Talbot, the only other steelworks with blast furnaces in Britain. However, Junck, the former chief executive of ArcelorMittal, said the long products business is back in profit at an underlying level \u2013 before financing costs \u2013 and that the new owners\u2019 financial plan is on track. He is targeting a 10% profit margin on its annual revenues of \u00a31.2bn, meaning it could eventually make a profit of \u00a3120m a year. \u201cIt has gone from making several millions of pounds of losses a month to positive financial results month-on-month,\u201d he said at an event in Scunthorpe to mark 100 days since the new company was formed. \u201cWe are exactly on track so far and expect to meet our financial targets in this fiscal year.\u201d British Steel has focused on controlling costs and rebuilding its relationship with customers, which include Network Rail, Toyota, and Transport for London. The company supplies rail for train tracks, high-strength wire-rods for deepwater mooring and steel for construction projects such as the Shard in London and the new stand at Liverpool\u2019s football stadium Anfield. It plans to invest \u00a350m into modernising facilities this year and one of its first acts was to ask staff to take a 3% pay cut, which they agreed. \u201cThe former owner at some point lost interest in these activities,\u201d Junck said of British Steel\u2019s plan. \u201cWhen you understand what good looks like you see significant differences. One of the big weaknesses was they had seemingly years ago stopped comparing themselves with the best ones.\u201d British Steel employs 4,800 people, including 400 in France, and produces more than 2.8m tonnes of steel a year. The Scunthorpe steelworks is one of the biggest industrial sites in the country. Its perimeter is 15 miles long and more than 100 miles of railway exist inside to transport materials. Junck said Britain could still have a sustainable steel industry but that it would need to be specialised and not based on scale. \u201cFor this size, for this product, for this kind of market, yes I see a sustainable future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is why the UK does not produce 200m tonnes of steel anymore.\u201d He called on the government to do more to help the industry. \u201cThe transformation of our business will make sure we maintain the pace of growth and move forward as an outward-looking profit-making business. But while our future remains firmly in our hands, the UK steel industry still faces many challenges,\u201d Junck said. \u201cThat is why we are pleased to remain in constructive dialogue with the government about the strategy needed to support British Steel and ensure that it is operating on a level playing field. It goes without saying that any strategy must be long-term and cross all political divides if it is to achieve the goals we share.\u201d Junck said the implications of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union were \u201cstill unclear\u201d but that it had \u201cnot made things easier\u201d. The British Steel management team and the workers expressed their support for Greybull, the owners, despite other businesses it controls running into trouble. My Local, the convenience store business, has collapsed while the future of Monarch, the low-cost airline, is also in doubt. Paul McBean, the trade union chairman of the Scunthorpe steelworks, said he had been impressed by the investment firm in talks before and after it bought the business. \u201cDo I still have faith in our investors? Yes I do,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Capita, the outsourcing company that collects the London congestion charge and the BBC licence fee, have crashed after it issued a surprise profit warning for 2016, blaming Brexit jitters as customers delayed making big investment decisions. Shares plunged 28% \u2013 Capita\u2019s worst ever one-day fall and the biggest decline on the FTSE 100 \u2013 after the unexpectedly gloomy update on Thursday morning. The company also flagged up a dispute with its client the Co-operative Bank. Investors took fright at the early warning sign that companies are starting to rein in spending because of uncertainty created by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said traders were dumping shares because of the \u201cunexpectedly rapid slowdown\u201d suggested by Capita. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant downturn in our expectations that we\u2019re calling out today,\u201d said Andy Parker, Capita\u2019s chief executive. The warning followed a similar Brexit-related alert from outsourcing rival Mitie last week. Capita\u2019s woes hit the rest of the sector, with Serco and G4S shares also falling on Thursday. Capita, which also recruits for the army and runs business travel, debt collection and translation services, said that although it had achieved good profit growth in the first half of 2016, the second half had so far been surprisingly weak. \u201cOur performance in the second half of the year to date has been below expectations, as a result of a slowdown in specific trading businesses, one-off costs incurred on the Transport for London congestion charging contract and continued delays in client decision-making.\u201d Capita, which employs 75,000 people and also provides businesses with support services and staff, said underlying profit before tax for the full year to December was expected to be in the range of \u00a3535m to \u00a3555m. Previously it was forecasting about \u00a3614m. The company also warned there was a high risk of litigation after a contractual dispute with another client, the Co-op Bank. Capita agreed a deal last year to process mortgages for the bank and claims it is owed payment. Parker said: \u201cEverything\u2019s ready to go and the client is refusing to sign off for one reason only \u2013 if they sign off, they have to pay us. We\u2019re still hitting targets and delivering for this bank.\u201d The Co-op Bank rejected the claims, saying: \u201cThe bank strongly refutes Capita\u2019s suggestion that they have delivered an element of the transformation programme which the bank has not paid for. In addition, there are amounts which the bank regards as owing to it by Capita. \u201cThe bank continues to work through the issues surrounding this transformation programme with Capita. The existing outsourcing of mortgage processing to Capita both for new and existing bank customers continues to operate in a satisfactory manner and the bank is committed to ensuring that this remains the case going forward.\u201d Capita\u2019s late delivery of an upgrade to the TfL congestion charge contract is likely to result in one-off costs of between \u00a320m to \u00a325m in the full year, the company said. Parker said: \u201cOur delivery wasn\u2019t up to the standard expected. The upgrade proved more complex than we anticipated and the penalties ramped up very quickly.\u201d The company added: \u201cThe systems have now gone live, the contract is performing well operationally and these costs will not recur next year.\u201d Capita\u2019s business is split 47% in the public sector and 53% in the private sector, with clients including Tesco Mobile and Zurich. It has won \u00a3949m worth of big contracts in the year so far, and was recently selected as preferred bidder to provide customer management services for Three, the telecoms company. \u201cWe remain confident of the strength of our business model and aim to return the group to profit growth next year, excluding the benefit from TfL one-off costs dropping out,\u201d the company said. Rory McKenzie, an analyst at UBS, said the message from Capita was that forecasts should be \u201creset\u201d lower. \u201cAs seen at Mitie, the UK outsourcing market is weak with low levels of contract awards and pressure on discretionary revenues. The magnitude of the impact on profits is a concern, however.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British Airways economy class passengers on short-haul flights will soon have to pay for sandwiches supplied by Marks &amp; Spencer if they want a meal in mid-air. The airline has signed a deal with M&amp;S that will see it replace free meals on flights of less than five hours and join no-frills rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet in charging for sandwiches, crisps and drinks. Previously, economy class passengers could expect a small snack, such as a bacon sandwich, and a complimentary drink. Passengers in Club Europe \u2013 the airline\u2019s short-haul business class service \u2013 will continue to enjoy a complimentary menu, which is being improved and revamped. The decision to jettison free food from economy class comes six months after Alex Cruz took over as British Airways chief executive, having previously run its low-cost Spanish sister airline Vueling. Cruz said the change was a response to passengers clamouring for greater choice of upmarket snacks. \u201cWe know our customers expect a great experience with British Airways,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us we are experts in flying and service, but when it comes to catering on short-haul flights, they want to choose from a wider range of premium products.\u201d The M&amp;S menu includes some of the retailer\u2019s best-known offerings such as the Aberdeen Angus beef and red onion chutney bloomer and packets of Percy Pig sweets. Aviation analyst Alex Macheras said it was unlikely BA would use the money it saved on food to cut ticket prices. \u201cUnfortunately you have to be realistic. This sandwich is basically nothing on the ticket price, so what will disappear from the price? Nothing.\u201d He backed BA\u2019s decision to replace free meals with a wider choice offered at a cost. \u201cSome people are in uproar, asking how BA can ditch food on short haul, but unless you were on club or business class, you were only getting half a sandwich and one drink. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought I\u2019d much rather have the option to pay for quality rather than accept free food that is just one mouthful.\u201d BA released a sample menu comparing its prices favourably with the prices charged by easyJet, Ryanair and Norwegian. A sample meal of the Aberdeen Angus bloomer, a packet of crisps and a bottle of water will cost \u00a37.55, rising to \u00a310.25 if the water is replaced with a quarter bottle of wine. Cruz said the menu, which will change with the seasons, \u201cbreaks the mould and sets a new standard in short-haul catering\u201d. He added that anyone with the airline\u2019s Avios points, earned as a member of BA\u2019s executive club group, would be able to use them to pay for meals. The new menu will start from 11 January next year for passengers flying from Heathrow and Gatwick, while anyone departing from Stansted or London City will still get a snack free of charge until summer 2017. Changes to meals are part of a series of adjustments to BA\u2019s short-haul services, including new interiors and a simplification of its fare structure to just three options. A plane meal Here is what BA and M&amp;S will be offering economy class flyers: Breakfast Greek style natural yogurt with summer berry compote and granola (\u00a31.95) M&amp;S Caf\u00e9 bacon roll (\u00a34.75) Tomato and mozzarella focaccia (\u00a34.75) Lunch Aberdeen Angus beef and red onion chutney bloomer (\u00a34.75) Classic cheese ploughman\u2019s (\u00a33.00) Snacks Super fruit, nut and seed flapjacks (\u00a31.45) Salt &amp; vinegar and lightly salted hand-cut crisps (both \u00a31) Percy Pigs (\u00a31.80)",

      "bodyText": "The British winemaker Chapel Down has seen sales rise by more than 25% in the first half of the year, as people continue to show enthusiasm for English wine and craft beer. Frazer Thompson, the Chapel Down chief executive, said: \u201cWe continue to deliver good growth [in] sales and gross profits. Consumers\u2019 interest in English wines and specialist or craft beer shows no sign of abating and Chapel Down has worked hard to be well positioned to benefit.\u201d The company, based near Tenterden, Kent, has also enjoyed major growth in its beer and cider business, Curious Drinks, which makes Curious Brew lager. In May, Chapel Down became an official wine supplier to Downing Street and its range is sold at Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Majestic, Marks &amp; Spencer and Booths. Overall sales rose by 26% to \u00a34.1m in the six months to 30 June, the company said. Wine sales increased by 14% to \u00a32.6m, and beer and cider sales under the Curious Drinks arm rocketed by 55% to \u00a31.51m. Gross profit for wines was up by 18% at \u00a31m, and beer and cider profit was \u00a3473,000, a 55% increase. Earnings before interest, taxes and other charges grew by 11% to \u00a393,000.

      "bodyText": "The owner of Alton Towers has said visitor numbers remain lower since the rollercoaster crash in June last year that left five people with life-changing injuries and others seriously hurt. While business at the Staffordshire theme park, the UK\u2019s biggest, had begun to recover over the summer, Merlin Entertainments said \u201cabsolute visitor volumes still remain some way below the 2014 level\u201d. Its shares fell by more than 6% to less than 440p after the trading update on Thursday morning. Merlin was fined a record \u00a35m by a court on Tuesday for the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d crash on the Smiler ride on 2 June 2015. The judge, Michael Chambers QC, said the company\u2019s safety procedures were \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and criticised its slow response to the incident. Merlin does not expect visitor numbers to return to normal levels until at least the end of 2017. The chief executive, Nick Varney, said: \u201cFrom the beginning, the company has accepted full responsibility for the accident and strived to support all those injured in every way possible. \u201cWe have learned every lesson from what happened last year and made a number of technical and procedural improvements to make sure that an accident like this cannot happen again. \u201cBoth the judge and the Health and Safety Executive acknowledge [that] we have a good overall track record in safety and we remain committed to achieving the highest standards in this area.\u201d The group, which also owns the Legoland chain, Warwick Castle and Chessington World of Adventures, said revenue rose by 10.6% in the 38 weeks to 17 September, \u201cdespite challenging trading conditions\u201d. On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of new attractions and accommodation, revenue increased by 1.3%. Like-for-like revenue grew in Merlin\u2019s theme parks and Legoland divisions, but dropped by 0.4% at its Midway attractions division, which includes Madame Tussauds and Blackpool Tower. Varney said the company\u2019s Midway attractions were particularly struggling in London, where the group was yet to see any significant benefit from the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June. Merlin said: \u201cMany of our city centre attractions have experienced volatile trading patterns as a result of wider security concerns that have affected domestic and international visitation. \u201cThis continues to have a significant impact on Midway London, the largest division within the operating group, where visitor volumes have also yet to see any material benefit of sterling weakening to current levels.\u201d The twin threats of terrorism and the Zika virus are weighing on tourism in Florida in 2016, Merlin said, hitting visitor numbers at its Legoland attraction in the sunshine state. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said trading in the group\u2019s key summer period had disappointed, but prospects over the longer term should be better. \u201cToday\u2019s headwinds are hopefully short term in nature and the group is set to continue expanding, with 40 new attractions set to be added by 2020.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brooke and Rodney Smith opened their Portland, Oregon cannabis dispensary, Tree PDX, in November 2014 \u2013 the same month Oregon voters approved a ballot initiative for legalizing recreational marijuana. While they were excited to enter what they hope will be a lucrative experiment in entrepreneurship, they say the state\u2019s fluctuating policies, as it transitions from medical marijuana into recreational sales, have been a headache. In order to get started, the Smiths had to pay the city for both a medical and recreational license \u2013 $3,500 and $4,795 annually \u2013 plus an additional $4,750 licensing fee to the state of Oregon. Because their store caters to both patients and potheads, they\u2019ve also had to navigate the rules on the potency and amount of marijuana they\u2019re allowed to sell, depending on whether it\u2019s medical, edible or recreational. \u201cThis was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Brooke Smith. \u201cOur personal finances are all screwed up; our credit cards are maxed ... We love what we do, but it definitely hasn\u2019t been a cakewalk.\u201d The Smiths joined the Oregon Cannabis Business Council to seek guidance on the process, but they say they\u2019re the only African American members. Brooke participates in a number of cannabis organizations and has never run into another African American who owns a marijuana-related business. She only knows of one other dispensary in Portland that is black-owned. The reason for the scarcity, she said, has to do with education and missed opportunity. \u201cThe reality today is that we\u2019re not well educated on how to handle our personal finances,\u201d said Smith, who used to work as an insurance agent before moving into marijuana. \u201cOur parents didn\u2019t pass this down to their kids, so we\u2019ve had to figure it out without a lot of support and backing.\u201d The legal marijuana trade is booming in Oregon. The government has collected more than $25m in sales taxes so far in 2016, according to the state\u2019s Department of Revenue. With a 25% tax on the stuff, that translates to more than $100m-worth of weed sold so far. But a range of cultural, educational and legal barriers may have kept minorities from cashing in. Support for minorities who want to enter the budding trade could come in the form of a new 3% sales tax on recreational weed in Portland, a ballot measure that will be voted on in November. Oregon will tax marijuana at 17% starting in January, and the additional 3% tax aims, in part, to help people of color in launching their own innovative small businesses. The Portland lawmakers behind the bill project that the additional tax could bring in at least $3m per year, part of which would go toward assisting neighborhood minority-owned businesses of any type, in the form of incubator programs, management and job training and financial support. The accrued tax revenue would also be funneled into drug and alcohol education and treatment programs, public safety investments and supporting women-owned businesses. Finally, a portion would go toward a grant program for people who want to expunge past marijuana-related charges from their criminal records but who can\u2019t afford the hefty legal fees involved. \u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of things in that legislation that can help our communities of color,\u201d said Jesce Horton, the Portland-based owner of both a cannabis cultivation facility and a line of gourmet edibles who co-founded the nonprofit Minority Cannabis Business Association (MCBA) last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s really about us making sure we come together and apply for those funds, and put ourselves in a position to take advantage.\u201d Horton\u2019s group wants to help Portland\u2019s people of color benefit from the tax funding by encouraging them to enter the weed business. But he recognizes that it could be an uphill climb for some. As a 1,000-member nationwide organization, only 10% of MCBA members actually work in the cannabis industry, according to Horton. Most are trying to find a way in. And in Portland, Horton only knows a few African Americans who are proprietors of pot. In the absence of hard data on minorities in the legal weed market \u2013 one of the few available estimates pegs minority involvement in dispensaries at 1% nationwide \u2013 the MCBA is currently working on a study with the University of California, Berkeley on the demographics of the cannabis industry. But Horton, who helped Portland commissioner Amanda Fritz draft the language of the proposed 3% tax, believes the lack of people of color in legalized marijuana has to do with heavy regulation, barriers to accessing capital and gaps in the right information. Furthermore, among minorities in Portland, working in legalized cannabis comes with its fair share of taboo. \u201cPeople are a little bit scared of jumping into the industry first and knowing that, looking at statistics, they may be the first to get arrested or they may be putting themselves or their families in jeopardy,\u201d Horton said. Black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, despite comparable usage rates, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). And the decriminalization of marijuana may not do much to change the imbalance. For example, the Colorado Department of Public Safety revealed that, shortly before marijuana was legalized there in 2014, the number of white teenagers arrested on marijuana charges in the state decreased by 8% between 2012 and 2014, the most recent years for which data is available. Yet for black teens, the arrests increased by 58%, and for Hispanics by 29% during the same period. The ACLU of Oregon said that while it doesn\u2019t yet have statewide numbers on marijuana arrests or citations since legalization in July 2015, it\u2019s interested in learning whether Oregon will follow Colorado with a persistent racial disparity in marijuana violations. \u201cMy guess is we will see something similar here, as there\u2019s evidence that racial disparities exist across the criminal justice system, and marijuana legalization won\u2019t correct that larger issue,\u201d said Sarah Armstrong, communications and outreach director of the ACLU of Oregon. While marijuana is now legal in designated quantities in these states, many past offenders still have cannabis convictions tainting their records, ultimately road-blocking them from moving on with their lives. \u201cThere are an awful lot of people with marijuana offenses that are struggling because they have that on the books,\u201d said Oregon state Representative Lew Frederick, who in 2015 proposed legislation that would allow a person to submit a request to have his or her record cleared of a marijuana possession. \u201cThey then get can\u2019t jobs, they can\u2019t get houses or education, they can\u2019t apply for business loans,\u201d he said. That\u2019s something that Fritz hopes Portland\u2019s proposed marijuana tax can abate through a grant program for those who need assistance paying the $1,000 or more in legal fees it can cost to expunge the past cannabis charges from their records. \u201cMy understanding is that when the ballot measure passes, it will be the first in the nation to designate some of the money to correct past inequitable actions in the criminal justice system,\u201d said Fritz. Donald Morse, director of the Oregon Cannabis Business Council, said he\u2019s all too familiar with the drill of expungement. He\u2019s still dealing with his own record after a raid of his dispensary back in 2012, when authorities accused him of selling pot for recreational use, a practice that was then illegal. He and his co-founder accepted a plea bargain for felony drug possession charges, and eventually reopened their dispensary in Portland. With only a handful of minorities on his council, Morse said he would definitely get behind the 3% cannabis tax. \u201cIf we can earmark funds to make loans to help persons of color get a leg up and be their own business owners, I think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d",

The reason for the scarcity, she said, has to do with education and missed opportunity. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe reality today is that we\u2019re not well educated on how to handle our personal finances,\u201d said Smith, who used to work as an insurance agent before moving into marijuana. \u201cOur parents didn\u2019t pass this down to their kids, so we\u2019ve had to figure it out without a lot of support and backing.\u201d<br></p> <p>The legal marijuana trade is booming in Oregon. The government has collected more than <a href=\"http://www.kgw.com/news/local/marijuana/oregon-collects-25-million-in-2016-pot-tax-revenue/305145418\">$25m in sales taxes so far in 2016, according to the state\u2019s Department of Revenue</a>. With a 25% tax on the stuff, that translates to more than $100m-worth of weed sold so far. But a range of cultural, educational and legal barriers may have kept minorities from cashing in.<br></p> <p>Support for minorities who want to enter the budding trade could come in the form of a new 3% sales tax on recreational weed in Portland, a ballot measure that will be voted on in November. Oregon will tax marijuana at 17% starting in January, and the additional 3% tax aims, in part, to help people of color in launching their own innovative small businesses.</p> <p>The Portland lawmakers behind the bill project that the additional tax could bring in at least $3m per year, part of which would go toward assisting neighborhood minority-owned businesses of any type, in the form of incubator programs, management and job training and financial support. The accrued tax revenue would also be funneled into drug and alcohol education and treatment programs, public safety investments and supporting women-owned businesses. Finally, a portion would go toward a grant program for people who want to expunge past marijuana-related charges from their criminal records but who can\u2019t afford the hefty legal fees involved.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of things in that legislation that can help our communities of color,\u201d said Jesce Horton, the Portland-based owner of both a cannabis cultivation facility and a line of gourmet edibles who co-founded the nonprofit Minority Cannabis Business Association (MCBA) last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s really about us making sure we come together and apply for those funds, and put ourselves in a position to take advantage.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa88b1c4455bfdb7df7f31b372baec6091d7040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa88b1c4455bfdb7df7f31b372baec6091d7040/0_49_2182_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minority Cannabis Business Association vice chair Jeannette Ward, left, with a man named Jacob, right, who got his record expunged of marijuana charges in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minority Cannabis Business Association vice chair Jeannette Ward, left, with a man named Jacob, right, who got his record expunged of marijuana charges in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MCBA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Horton\u2019s group wants to help Portland\u2019s people of color benefit from the tax funding by encouraging them to enter the weed business. But he recognizes that it could be an uphill climb for some. As a 1,000-member nationwide organization, only 10% of MCBA members actually work in the cannabis industry, according to Horton. Most are trying to find a way in. And in Portland, Horton only knows a few African Americans who are proprietors of pot.<br></p> <p>In the absence of hard data on minorities in the legal weed market \u2013 one of the few available estimates <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/18/471008253/as-the-legal-pot-industry-booms-african-americans-are-left-behind\">pegs minority involvement in dispensaries at 1%</a> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/18/471008253/as-the-legal-pot-industry-booms-african-americans-are-left-behind\">nationwide</a> \u2013 the MCBA is currently working on a study with the University of California, Berkeley on the demographics of the cannabis industry.<br></p> <p>But Horton, who helped Portland commissioner Amanda Fritz draft the language of the proposed 3% tax, believes the lack of people of color in legalized marijuana has to do with heavy regulation, barriers to accessing capital and gaps in the right information.<br></p> <p>Furthermore, among minorities in Portland, working in legalized cannabis comes with its fair share of taboo. \u201cPeople are a little bit scared of jumping into the industry first and knowing that, looking at statistics, they may be the first to get arrested or they may be putting themselves or their families in jeopardy,\u201d Horton said.<br></p> <p>Black people are <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/new-aclu-report-finds-overwhelming-racial-bias-marijuana-arrests\">3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people</a>, despite comparable usage rates, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). And the decriminalization of marijuana may not do much to change the imbalance. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2829054-2016-SB13-283-Rpt-Colorado-Early-Findings-in.html\">Colorado Department of Public Safety revealed</a> that, shortly before marijuana was legalized there in 2014, the number of white teenagers arrested on marijuana charges in the state decreased by 8% between 2012 and 2014, the most recent years for which data is available. Yet for black teens, the arrests increased by 58%, and for Hispanics by 29% during the same period.<br></p> <p>The ACLU of Oregon said that while it doesn\u2019t yet have statewide numbers on marijuana arrests or citations since legalization in July 2015, it\u2019s interested in learning whether Oregon will follow Colorado with a persistent racial disparity in marijuana violations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbbaeb3253e825ec503ebd13d715568f3c41b2ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbbaeb3253e825ec503ebd13d715568f3c41b2ac/0_0_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tree PDX, the Smiths\u2019 Portland dispensary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tree PDX, the Smiths\u2019 Portland dispensary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brooke Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy guess is we will see something similar here, as there\u2019s evidence that racial disparities exist across the criminal justice system, and marijuana legalization won\u2019t correct that larger issue,\u201d said Sarah Armstrong, communications and outreach director of the ACLU of Oregon.<br></p> <p>While marijuana is now legal in designated quantities in these states, many past offenders still have cannabis convictions tainting their records, ultimately road-blocking them from moving on with their lives.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere are an awful lot of people with marijuana offenses that are struggling because they have that on the books,\u201d said Oregon state Representative Lew Frederick, who in 2015 proposed legislation that would allow a person to submit a request to have his or her record cleared of a marijuana possession. \u201cThey then get can\u2019t jobs, they can\u2019t get houses or education, they can\u2019t apply for business loans,\u201d he said.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/16/colombia-cannabis-growers-legalisation\">Colombia's clandestine cannabis growers keen to come out of the shadows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s something that Fritz hopes Portland\u2019s proposed marijuana tax can abate through a grant program for those who need assistance paying the $1,000 or more in legal fees it can cost to expunge the past cannabis charges from their records.<br></p> <p>\u201cMy understanding is that when the ballot measure passes, it will be the first in the nation to designate some of the money to correct past inequitable actions in the criminal justice system,\u201d said Fritz.<br></p> <p>Donald Morse, director of the Oregon Cannabis Business Council, said he\u2019s all too familiar with the drill of expungement. He\u2019s still dealing with his own record after a raid of his dispensary back in 2012, when authorities accused him of selling pot for recreational use, a practice that was then illegal. He and his co-founder <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/marijuana/index.ssf/2014/06/medical_marijuana_in_oregon_cr.html\">accepted a plea bargain for felony drug possession charges</a>, and eventually reopened their dispensary in Portland.<br></p> <p>With only a handful of minorities on his council, Morse said he would definitely get behind the 3% cannabis tax. \u201cIf we can earmark funds to make loans to help persons of color get a leg up and be their own business owners, I think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s gamble has failed. That, rather than the spike in oil prices, is the real story to emerge from the agreement reached by Opec\u2019s 12 members that they must agree to cut production. Let\u2019s be clear, a deal to actually restrict the flow of crude oil onto the global energy market has not yet been reached. Opec has said that something needs to be done, and has made a vague commitment to trim between 500,000 to 1m barrels a day from current output, but it has yet to flesh out the details. As one analyst rightly noted, Opec seemed to have been taking lessons from EU summits. It has agreed that something needs to be done, but has put off until another day the rather more difficult task of getting its fractious membership to decide what that should be. The realisation that much still needs to be done before Iran agrees to cap its output, which has been rising since global sanctions were lifted, meant the knee-jerk jump in prices that followed the Opec move was short-lived. This was not a game-changing move that will send prices shooting back up towards the $100 a barrel level. For that to happen there would have to be a much more stringent agreement to cut production and, crucially, stronger global demand. Neither looks likely, and as a result Opec\u2019s ambitions are relatively modest. Member states are desperate to put a floor under the price of crude because they depend on oil revenues to finance public spending. The lower the price goes, the more difficult it is for them to balance the books. Saudi Arabia is not immune from these fiscal pressures. To be sure, it built up substantial reserves when the oil price was high but these are rapidly being depleted. Austerity measures have been introduced and are as unpopular in Saudi Arabia as they are everywhere else. Flooding the global market with cheap crude was Riyadh\u2019s answer to the challenge presented by US shale producers. The idea was that an oil price of between $30 and $40 a barrel would make output from the new operations uneconomic and would kill off the industry. The strategy would be painful for Saudi Arabia as well, but Riyadh had deep pockets. Not deep enough, it transpires. Some US rigs have been mothballed, but the cost of producing US shale is coming down all the time. Saudi Arabia has had to accept that it is not going to deliver a knockout blow. The deal tentatively agreed in Algeria is an acceptance of that fact. Opec\u2019s glory days are long in the past and it is a much-diminished force. Having decided to wage an ill-judged war, the cartel has now run up the white flag. Opec\u2019s agreement should underpin the oil price. It might even nudge the cost of crude up a bit. But every dollar a barrel on the oil price is good news for the frackers of North Dakota.",

      "bodyText": "The number of mortgages being approved fell in August, figures show, in the latest sign that the housing market has cooled since the Brexit vote. The Bank of England said mortgage approvals, seen by economists as one of the early indicators of housing market activity, had dropped to the lowest level since November 2014. There were 60,058 mortgages approved for house purchase last month, down from 60,925 in July and slightly fewer than the 60,150 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. However, the figures also showed unsecured borrowing by consumers, such as on credit cards, continuing to grow, echoing other signs that British households have so far largely shrugged off the EU referendum result and not allowed any worries they have about the economy to curb their spending. Consumer credit rose by \u00a31.57bn in August, beating economists\u2019 expectations of a \u00a31.4bn increase. Scott Bowman from consultancy Capital Economics said: \u201cAugust\u2019s UK money and credit figures suggest that the housing market continues to cool, but appetite for debt hasn\u2019t taken much of a hit.\u201d However, he pointed to other indicators, which suggest that confidence is returning to the housing market after an initial post-Brexit vote wobble. The latest monthly report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that for the first time since April, surveyors expect house prices to increase over the next three months. Contrasting that report with the decline in mortgage approvals, Bowman said: \u201cThe Rics survey measure of new buyer enquiries picked up sharply in August, implying [that] this trend won\u2019t last too much longer.\u201d Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the decrease in approvals in August would not have been entirely down to the Brexit vote. \u201cStripping out the extent to which this is a consequence of post-EU referendum uncertainty, as opposed to other factors, including tax rises on buy-to-let properties earlier this year and ever more expensive housing, is problematic,\u201d he said. The Bank\u2019s data chimed with figures from the British Bankers\u2019 Association earlier this week, which showed that the number of homebuyer mortgages approved by UK banks was down by 20% year on year in August, but consumers\u2019 appetite for unsecured borrowing remained strong. Howard Archer, an economist at consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures showed that \u201cconsumers were clearly prepared to continue borrowing and spending in August,\u201d but warned that households may soon begin to feel the pressure from rising inflation and the jobs market weakening. \u201cWe suspect that the fundamentals for consumers will become less favourable over the coming months, with purchasing power likely diminishing and the labour market softening,\u201d Archer said. \u201cOn the one hand, this may make people more cautious over borrowing, but on the other hand, it may increase the need for some people to borrow.\u201d",
