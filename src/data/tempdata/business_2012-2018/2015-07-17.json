      "bodyText": "Five former energy regulators have launched a withering attack on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) dismissing its recent report on the big six power suppliers as fundamentally flawed. Prof Stephen Littlechild, ex-head of Offer, Clare Spottiswoode, former head of Ofgas, and others expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the CMA\u2019s conclusion that the energy companies have been overcharging and condemned its proposed remedy of barring price rises. They said: \u201cThe proposed price control \u2013 a safeguard price cap or default tariff \u2013 has serious disadvantages. It will restrict competition and militate against the CMA\u2019s other remedies to increase customer involvement. \u201cIt will increase regulatory uncertainty and hence the cost of capital, and hence prices to customers. The recommendation also ignores the practical and political implications of such intervention.\u201d The former regulators have made their intervention in a submission to the CMA in response to the watchdog\u2019s report of 10 days ago. Energy companies have been under review since a series of price rises triggered a consumer and political backlash. The CMA said the big six had made excessive profits of \u00a31.2bn between 2009 and 2013, effectively arguing they had done so because customers had been too disengaged to switch to cheaper providers. But the regulators, which also include Sir Callum McCarthy, previously chief of Ofgem, Eileen Marshall, ex-managing director of the energy regulator, and Stephen Smith, a former senior executive there, says the CMA failed to explore the reasons behind the increase in profits and wrongly concluded it was down to customer disengagement. The former watchdog executives also attacked the CMA proposal that the energy regulator, Ofgem, should operate a price comparison site. \u201cIt would not increase trust in existing websites, in practice it would not be more authoritative, and it could reduce or distort competition in the market,\u201d they argued. British Gas and other companies have questioned the CMA\u2019s proposed use of price caps but Peter Atherton, an energy analyst with Jefferies investment bank, described the ex-regulators\u2019 intervention as the most significant. \u201cWe agree with much of their analysis and criticism of the CMA\u2019s initial findings. In particular, we also found the CMA\u2019s rationale for the introduction of a safeguard tariff unconvincing to say the least,\u201d said Atherton. \u201cWe agree with the ex-regulators that the inevitable distortion of the market that this would cause is likely to be to the detriment of consumers and to outweigh whatever limited benefits there might be.\u201d The CMA will not finalise its recommendations on how to reform the energy market until later this year but it has already proposed the scrapping of a recently introduced measure to restrict the number of energy tariffs available. The competition authority\u2019s most critical comments came in an assessment of how large utilities have benefited at the expense of their customers. \u201cThe initial findings of this [CMA] analysis suggest that average prices offered by the big six firms over the period 2009 to 2013 were around 5% above the competitive level in the domestic segment \u2026 this amounts to domestic customers paying around \u00a31.2bn \u2026 more on an annual basis,\u201d it concluded. The five regulators said in their submission to the CMA that it had failed to acknowledge that a variety of previous interventions by the regulator since 2008 had restricted competition. Those interventions were very likely to be an important reason for the increase in profits, they claimed. \u201cIf it had acknowledged this, the CMA would have had to acknowledge that removing those interventions would increase competition and reduce profits which would undermine the case for reintroducing price controls.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The energy regulator has issued a new and more alarming warning about the potential for blackouts, saying Britain\u2019s spare capacity margin could dwindle to zero as early as next year. The prediction from Ofgem has forced the infrastructure operator, National Grid, to consult on another round of subsidies to encourage companies to keep power stations open, a move likely to raise household energy bills further. It could also leave Britain further dependent at times of peak demand on \u201cdiesel farms\u201d, which have been condemned by environmentalists as carbon-intensive and expensive to run. Ofgem predicted earlier this week that capacity margins could fall as low as 1.2% this winter, but admitted in a consultation document on Friday that the demand-supply cushion risks being wiped out completely in 18 months. \u201cOur analysis shows that the Lole (loss of load expectations) could range between two and 15 hours per year for our central view of the risks (corresponding to margins between 0% and 4%),\u201d the document says with regard to the 2016-17 winter period. The power squeeze has been getting steadily worse as coal, nuclear and gas plants have been retired owing to age or environmental legislation. But paying power companies \u2013 many of which are from the big six energy firms that have been criticised for the scale of their retail profits \u2013 will be unpopular when some consumers are already struggling to pay their energy bills. By offering a range of different subsidies, all paid for by the customer, the National Grid has secured 2.56 gigawatts of additional \u201cbalancing services\u201d to ballast supplies this December, bolstering the capacity margin from 1.2% to 5.1%. But the financial aid schemes that encouraged companies to keep power stations on standby or customers to come offline are now at an end. National Grid, whose role involves ensuring the lights stay on, has now said it wants to talk to power companies about what sort of new subsidy regime it needs to put in place to raise capacity margins in 18 months\u2019 time. Rachel Fletcher, senior partner for markets at Ofgem, said the decision to consult on extending ways to bring in new capacity services into the following winter was a prudent one. \u201cHowever, given we are 18 months away from winter 2016/17, there is also plenty of opportunity for generators and other market participants to continue to make more supplies available.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Betfair chief executive Breon Corcoran received a pay package worth \u00a311.6m last year after the online gambling firm paid out \u00a310m on a golden hello granted when he joined the company three years ago. The award, revealed in Betfair\u2019s annual report, was paid after the company met two of three financial performance criteria originally required under the deal agreed with Corcoran when he was poached to run the business from rival Paddy Power in August 2012. The third performance hurdle related to Betfair\u2019s return to shareholders compared with rival companies. In an unusual turn of events, this threshold was removed at a shareholder meeting in January. In a letter to shareholders, Betfair had explained how the third hurdle had been introduced by an administrative error, and that it did not reflect the original terms agreed when Corcoran agreed to leave Paddy Power, relinquishing potential share bonuses, and head up Betfair. At the shareholder meeting, 99.8% of investors sanctioned the removal of the performance threshold. In any event, this had no impact on Corcoran\u2019s payout because Betfair has comfortably been among the best stock market-listed gambling groups at generating returns for its shareholders over the past three years. A spokesman for company confirmed: \u201cThe strong share price performance over the past three years means that the total shareholder return measure would have vested in full [for Corcoran], so the removal of this element of the award has made no difference.\u201d The \u00a310.1m golden hello award, in shares, comes on top of Corcoran\u2019s salary of \u00a3528,000 and an annual bonus of \u00a3953,000. His total package was worth \u00a311.6m, up from \u00a31.3m for the previous year. Speaking from the second Ashes Test between England and Australia at Lord\u2019s, Betfair co-founder Ed Wray, who remains the largest shareholder, with a 9.5% stake, said: \u201cIt is is a large amount, but ... I couldn\u2019t be more happy to be paying him [Corcoran] what we are paying him.\u201d Noting that the lucrative joining award had been offered in 2012, when Betfair was in a very different state, Wray added: \u201cAs a shareholder, I think it is important to reward that kind of value creation.\u201d The scale of Corcoran\u2019s pay has attracted criticism from some investor groups in the past. Last year Pirc, which advises investors on corporate governance issues, recommended a vote against Betfair\u2019s remuneration policy, arguing Corcoran\u2019s \u201cpotential rewards \u2026 under all incentive schemes are considered excessive\u201d. Since taking the helm, Corcoran has grown UK customer numbers by 250% and Betfair\u2019s share value has risen from about \u00a3750m to \u00a32.3bn. The company has developed a conventional bookmaking offer online, complementing its more specialist betting exchange product. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley, Betfair\u2019s new online bookmaking business is already taking bets of \u00a31.2bn, close to the \u00a31.3bn staked with Ladbrokes last year. Addressing investors in Betfair\u2019s 2015 annual report, remuneration committee chair Leo Quinn said: \u201cBetfair has had an excellent year ... the business has successfully increased its market share by attracting recreational customers, as evidenced by the 52% increase in active customers in the year.\u201d He said the reliability of revenues had been improved as the business focus had migrated away from countries where online gambling is considered contentious by regulators. As a result, only 18% of revenues now come from parts of the world which Betfair does not class as sustainable markets.",

The company has developed a conventional bookmaking offer online, complementing its more specialist betting exchange product. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley, Betfair\u2019s new online bookmaking business is already taking bets of \u00a31.2bn, close to the \u00a31.3bn staked with Ladbrokes last year. <br></p> <p>Addressing investors in Betfair\u2019s 2015 annual report, remuneration committee chair Leo Quinn said: \u201cBetfair has had an excellent year ... the business has successfully increased its market share by attracting recreational customers, as evidenced by the 52% increase in active customers in the year.\u201d</p> <p>He said the reliability of revenues had been improved as the business focus had migrated away from countries where online gambling is considered contentious by regulators. As a result, only 18% of revenues now come from parts of the world which Betfair does not class as sustainable markets.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The resignation of a top director at Marks &amp; Spencer has led to renewed speculation about who will take over as head of the retailer when the chief executive, Marc Bolland, eventually departs. Its shares fell by just over 1% to 539p on Friday after it was confirmed that John Dixon, the head of the struggling clothing division, had quit after almost three decades with the company. The departure of Dixon - once viewed as favourite to replace Bolland when he leaves \u2013 has left investors to ponder who will be the next boss at M&amp;S. Focus has been placed on three internal candidates: Steve Rowe, the former head of food who has now taken over the clothing division from Dixon; Helen Weir, the new finance director; and Laura Wade-Gery, the head of the retailer\u2019s multi-channel strategy. Bolland, who joined M&amp;S as chief executive in 2010, revealed at its AGM last week that sales in clothing and homeware had slipped back again. The company had reported the first rise in clothing sales for four years just a few months ago. In May, Bolland sought to quell suggestions he would be stepping down, saying he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be around to present annual results next year. \u201cClearly, Bolland says he is committed for another year, but he would be well advised not to leave it too late to move on to pastures new, lest something else go wrong,\u201d retail analyst Nick Bubb said. Dixon was until recently tipped as a contender to take over from Bolland. He announced that he was leaving \u201cthis great company\u201d after being given the chance to become chief executive at another firm. It is not yet clear which company. Since being appointed head of M&amp;S\u2019s general-merchandise division three years ago, he had failed to arrest the decline in sales, which were down 2.5% last year. He received a bonus of \u00a3217,000 last year, the lowest payout to any of the company\u2019s executive directors. Jonathan De Mello, the head of retail consultancy at Harper Dennis Hobbs, said there was still a lot of confusion among shoppers about who M&amp;S\u2019 clothes were aimed at, with too many lines and different product categories. The division will now be run by Rowe, who was described by Bubb as the favoured internal candidate for the top job. But retail industry observers immediately queried whether running clothing and homewares would be a poisoned chalice for Rowe\u2019s future ambitions, despite his success in the food devision. Dixon successfully ran food before switching to fashion. Who are the contenders to take over from Marc Bolland? Steve Rowe With M&amp;S for the last 26 years, Rowe has worked in store management, in menswear and furniture. He was appointed director of the home division in 2004 and then director of retail. He headed up the food division from October 2012. Rowe\u2019s father, Joe, was a director of Marks &amp; Spencer until 2000. Laura Wade-Gery Wade-Gery held a series of roles with Tesco between 1997 and 2011, amongst them chief executive of Tesco.com and Tesco Direct, before she joined the board of M&amp;S. The Oxford ice-hockey blue faced a difficult initial period at the company when she presided over the botched relaunch of the M&amp;S website in February 2014, which hit sales. The retailer spent \u00a3150m revamping its website with more video and magazine-style content, but many customers struggled to register, leaving sales 2% down over the year. The fortunes of the website appear to have been turned around with a trading update in May showing a 13.8pc rise in online sales. Helen Weir Weir joined the company as chief finance officer on April 1 this year after working as finance director of the John Lewis Partnership. She spent nearly a decade at the B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher before becoming finance director at Lloyds Banking Group in 2004. She later led its retail division in 2008 but left in 2011 after missing out on the top job to Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. Weir was forced to repay bonuses linked to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and in 2013 apologised for the episode and said she regretted the damage it has caused the banking industry. The outsiders Possible external contenders include: Justin King, who stepped down as Sainsbury\u2019s boss in July 2014; Talk Talk\u2019s chief executive, Dido Harding, who was previously Sainsbury\u2019s convenience director; Seb James, the CEO of Dixons Carphone; and the former head of WH Smith Kate Swann.",

      "bodyText": "The outspoken boss of frozen food giant Iceland has dismissed complaints by consumer group Which? about misleading supermarket pricing as \u201cbollocks\u201d. Malcolm Walker\u2019s remarks came after the competition regulator this week published a report criticising the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets over some misleading promotional practices, but conceding the problems were not widespread. The Competition and Markets Authority had launched its investigation after a \u201csuper-complaint\u201d lodged by Which? in April claimed supermarkets\u2019 misleading pricing tactics had duped shoppers out of hundreds of millions of pounds. Speaking to trade publication Retail Week, Walker said the regulator\u2019s conclusion proved supermarkets were not guilty of wrongdoing and he insisted customers were getting an \u201camazing deal\u201d. \u201c[The super-complaint] is bollocks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at the number of investigations into food retailers \u2013 and why? It\u2019s political, we are a cheap target. They never find anything.\u201d He went on to shower praise on his higher-end competitors. \u201cCustomers have always had an amazing deal because even though our margins have been high in the past, the standards in British supermarkets have been phenomenal. \u201cYou go into a Sainsbury\u2019s or Waitrose and they are just beautiful stores with high standards compared to countries abroad.\u201d It is not the first time the controversial Iceland boss has stuck his head above the parapet. Earlier this year he launched an expletive-laden tirade at rivals Aldi, Lidl and Walmart-owned Asda that referenced the first and second world wars. Speaking to the International Business Times in April he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten the Germans twice before and we\u2019ll f*****g beat them again. There are the Germans and then there\u2019s Asda, a bunch of f*****g Americans, we\u2019re inundated with foreigners, Iceland is a British supermarket.\u201d In the same interview he also bemoaned what he called snobbery towards Iceland from \u201cGuardian-reading Waitrose shoppers\u201d. He said this was unfair as its new adverts showed the frozen food chain \u201chad scallops and really good stuff on offer. We\u2019re not just about cheap fish fingers\u201d. Unlike Walker, the bosses at Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s have remained tightlipped about the super-complaint and the subsequent CMA findings. Spokespeople at both supermarkets said the British Retail Consortium had responded on their behalf and that they would not be reacting further. The retailers\u2019 trade body said the allegations in the Which? report were \u201cblown out of all proportion\u201d. \u201cWhile the CMA report noted a limited number of specific examples of potentially confusing practices, it has concluded quite clearly that these problems are not systemic across the industry, as we have always maintained,\u201d said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the BRC. The furore caused by the Which? complaint is unlikely to disappear in a hurry, however. The consumer group and the supermarkets now have 90 days to work together with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Trading Standards to implement some of the recommendations made in the report. These include drawing up clearer best practice guidelines for unit pricing and looking at clarifying the rules on how the law requires items to be unit-priced when on promotion.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s job done as far as Britain\u2019s banks are concerned. The departure of Martin Wheatley as the head of the City\u2019s watchdog marks a triumph for the forex fiddlers and the Libor manipulators, but a defeat for the rest of us. The clock has been turned back eight years to the bad old days when the last Labour government ensured that what the banks demanded, the banks got. George Osborne was, of course, full of praise for Wheatley as his resignation was announced. The outgoing head of the Financial Conduct Authority was \u201cbrilliant\u201d. He was \u201cpassionate\u201d about defending the interests of consumers. A bit too passionate, it seems. Wheatley\u2019s tough approach prompted complaints from the financial sector. The chancellor could not set foot in the City of London or Canary Wharf without being lobbied by a banker or an insurer telling him that the FCA\u2019s zero-tolerance approach to financial malfeasance was threatening to drive business away from the UK. Unspoken, but doubtless lurking in the background, was the warning that donations for the Conservative party were on the line as well. The City wanted Wheatley out. Osborne\u2019s capitulation means the rehabilitation of the banking sector is now pretty much complete. For a while after the financial crash that they caused, the banks decided to lie low.

      "bodyText": "How much is a box of cereal? Fix an answer in your head before you carry on. Now meet Louisa Masters, running her eye over a panoply of breakfast options in my local Tesco, before eventually alighting on a box of Special K, balancing it carefully on top of a small pyramid of other groceries and making for the till. Louisa, an office administrator on her way home from work, pauses outside to discuss the factors that informed her selection. \u201cOoh, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019ve got me thinking now,\u201d she says, seeming a bit uneasy, as if she\u2019d been asked about her tax affairs or her medical records. \u201cWell, I usually get Special K. I like it! And it was on offer, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d It was. Louisa looks chuffed at this news. \u201cI like getting a deal,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous how much money you can save these days.\u201d So, how much is the cereal usually, then? \u201cA box of Special K? I\u2019d say it\u2019s a couple of quid. \u00a31.50 on offer.\u201d How much for, though? \u201cEr \u2026 just for a box, like a normal box. I don\u2019t know! Just the usual box.\u201d Her interrogation over, Louisa is visibly relieved. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about it like that, to be honest. How did I do?\u201d Louisa \u2013 like, I suspect, most of us \u2013 didn\u2019t do brilliantly. Her 360g box of cereal did cost \u00a32, but that was the special offer price, not the usual price, which, according to Tesco\u2019s label, is \u00a33.14. And the meaning of the \u201cspecial offer\u201d was slightly undermined by the fact most of the cereal on display bore the red and yellow labels that denote there\u2019s a money-saving deal to be had. It was further called into question by the fact that, about a mile away, another branch of Tesco was offering another box of Special K for \u00a32, also on special offer \u2013 except this box held 500g of cereal, nearly 40% more than the \u201cNew, bigger pack!\u201d Louisa had bought. You can\u2019t really blame her, or the rest of us. The modern supermarket is a riot of multicoloured discounts and promotions, with a fluctuating lineup of offers that you can hardly be expected to analyse when you\u2019re on your commute. When confronted with such an array of savings, the natural response is to tune it out. Tour the aisles with your eye on the prices, however, and the absurdity of the situation swiftly becomes apparent. For example: why is a box of milk chocolate Krave \u00a34.19 when every other non-luxury brand available \u2013 special offer or not \u2013 sells for less than \u00a33? Why does a pack of plastic pint tumblers retailing for \u00a32 appear in a promotional bin with economical-looking red-and-yellow labelling when it isn\u2019t discounted at all? And if, among the seven well-stocked rows that make up the \u201cworld food\u201d section, only 16 of the 58 items are not on offer, what does the term even mean? Wouldn\u2019t it be more honest to call those 16 products \u201cabnormally expensive\u201d? The answers to these questions are deeply mysterious, known only to the team of street economists who make up Tesco\u2019s pricing unit. But the wider explanation is clear: we are in the crossfire of a price war, one that has only been intensified by the hugely successful emergence of the new discounters, Aldi and Lidl. This week, the industry regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) strapped on its body armour and joined the fray, ruling, after a so-called super-complaint from consumer group Which?, that the supermarkets were guilty of \u201cpoor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers\u201d. Asking the government to issue fresh guidelines, it pointed to complicated unit pricing (where comparison from product to product is made difficult by inconsistent quantities), \u201cwas/now\u201d offers where the \u201cnow\u201d price is available for longer than the \u201cwas\u201d ever was, and sharp practice on subtly shrinking pack sizes as areas of concern. Despite its criticism, though, the CMA\u2019s analysis fell well short of a comprehensive rebuke of the supermarkets\u2019 tactics. Yes, there were examples of bad practice, but it said problems were \u201cnot occurring in large numbers across the whole sector\u201d and stopped short of the legal action it was entitled to take. The trouble, it concluded, was a few bad apples \u2013 or, at least, a few badly priced ones. Even as Which? hailed the report as vindication of its complaint, industry representatives such as the British Retail Consortium declared victory for themselves. Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail research agency Conlumino, says: \u201cIn an industry as vast as this, with all the products they sell, there\u2019s bound to be some of that kind of thing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a really serious cause for concern here.\u201d In fact, he says, pressure from the discounters has improved things: \u201cThe supermarkets are up against that simplicity of message and pricing structure. So, they\u2019ve had to adapt and do the same themselves.\u201d Yet, according to consumer analyst Kantar Worldpanel, 40% of grocery spending is now on promoted items, and the CMA has been lambasted in some quarters. The Guardian\u2019s consumer affairs correspondent, Rebecca Smithers, described the report as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d; financial analyst Louise Cooper accused the CMA of falling to \u201cregulatory capture\u201d \u2013 becoming too close to the industry it is supposed to be overseeing. Perhaps there\u2019s a bigger question in play, one that can\u2019t easily be resolved by a spot analysis of prices or any amount of regulation. \u201cWhatever the report says, it wouldn\u2019t even be possible for someone to look across tens of thousands of products and maximise their choices,\u201d says Leigh Caldwell, partner at behaviour research and pricing firm The Irrational Agency, and author of The Psychology of Price. \u201cThe supermarket is just such a tricky decision-making environment. The potential for confusion and distraction is high. No one remembers the price of the cereal they bought two months ago. And the CMA doesn\u2019t really have the ability to focus on that. It\u2019s very hard to write rules that say, \u2018You are not allowed to create this level of cognitive complexity for the consumer.\u2019\u201d Whenever he goes into a supermarket, Leigh says, he looks for a two-litre bottle of Coke. \u201cYou\u2019d think it would be such a standard product. But every time you go in to a given store you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a different price: \u00a31.15; \u00a32.09. And it\u2019s frequently promoted, 2 for \u00a32, or something that will be an absolute no-brainer. I think this is so that people don\u2019t have any memorable price that seems \u201ccorrect\u201d. If it\u2019s a category where people have a strong anchor, the supermarkets want to disrupt it.\u201d I try Leigh\u2019s exercise in Tesco, and find the Coca-Cola with a sense that I\u2019ve stumbled on a secret key to the mystery. It\u2019s priced at \u00a31.94. Not brilliant, I think, but not bad, within the reasonable range, comparable to the other brands in the soft drinks aisle. It\u2019s only when I note down the details that I realise that, whereas the competitors are all two litres, the identical-looking Coke is a quarter-litre less. Is all this part of a dastardly plan to part us from our cash? Maybe not. With so many items to keep track of, it wouldn\u2019t be very surprising if some of the problems that have so exercised Which? are the product of cock-up, not conspiracy. The Guardian\u2019s own readers\u2019 anthology of dubious deals \u2013 crusty rolls 40p, two for \u00a31! \u2013 seems simply too bonkers to be put down to malice. \u201cI\u2019d love to say it\u2019s this big, machiavellian plan, but the main thing to blame is human stupidity,\u201d says Phillip Adcock, author of Shoppology: The Science of Supermarket Shopping. \u201cIt\u2019s inexperienced junior people running a formula. They\u2019re all running so fast to keep up with each other, but they can\u2019t keep up with the offers in their own stores.\u201d If you imagine every supermarket price is set by a ruthlessly efficient algorithm that examines all the figures and works out the sweet spot for maximum profitability, think again: this isn\u2019t Amazon. Instead, says Caldwell, \u201cit\u2019s often pricing teams with dozens of people looking through data and making decisions: let\u2019s look at soft drinks, let\u2019s see what promotional spend Coca-Cola will give us and let\u2019s price things accordingly\u201d. This pattern is set by a belief that the simplest way to make money is by extracting as much as possible from suppliers, not consumers. \u201cThey\u2019re obsessed with \u2018back margin\u2019 \u2013 the money you make by charging suppliers for ancillary things,\u201d says Adcock. \u201cSo, they start to create these almost fictitious things they can sell, whether it\u2019s a prime shelf [at the height a shopper is most likely to see] or a gondola end [the promotional buckets often found at the top of the aisle]. Their whole job is screwing the suppliers.\u201d Indeed, the famous psychological tricks designed to make you spend as much as humanly possible have lost the supermarkets\u2019 attention: where fiendishly innovative store designers once set aisles deliberately wide in the belief that doing so made shoppers walk more slowly, and moved items around to force us to look more closely (a theory that was later debunked), the focus has shifted. \u201cThe battle now is getting them in the store in the first place,\u201d says Saunders. Adcock agrees: \u201cThese days, they\u2019re just warehouses with forklifts,\u201d he says, sounding rather mournful. \u201cAll that psychological stuff, it\u2019s all gone.\u201d A retail pricing specialist with extensive experience of one of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s deliberate at all,\u201d he says. \u201cBuyers aren\u2019t as clever as people make out. They\u2019re fixated on what their competition is up to \u2013 everyone is following everyone else.\u201d In his view, this is the reason for the fluctuation in prices that stops customers figuring out an \u201canchor\u201d: not conscious policy, but the consequence of each supermarket constantly reacting to the others, an endless merry-go-round of adjustment without much reason behind it. Indeed, none of this is really about what works for consumers. The bottom line, says Adcock, is that the sector is \u201cin an absolute mess at the moment\u201d. \u201cThey have reputations worth billions of pounds, but they put it at risk with an absolutely manic obsession with short-termism,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one in supermarkets cares what next year looks like \u2013 they\u2019re talking about the next six weeks.\u201d Against all of this, the discounters like to set themselves up as revolutionary idealists. \u201cWe have a fundamentally different model,\u201d Aldi said in a statement after the CMA report appeared. The idea, it went on, is to provide \u201cthe lowest prices in grocery in a simple and transparent way\u201d. And, it\u2019s true: when you visit Aldi or Lidl, the mood is different, the frantic discounting replaced by an agreeably spartan sense that supermarkets have been Ikea-ed. But even in these utopian surroundings all is not as it seems. \u201cGo into the discounters and look at the price labels,\u201d Phillip Adcock says. \u201cWe\u2019re conditioned to look for the price on the shelf below the item. But, at the discounters, they put the prices on the shelf above, and the top shelf ones on the wall. So, you look and you see the price below, and you think that\u2019s what you\u2019re paying.\u201d I\u2019m sceptical about this. But, when I arrive at Lidl from Tesco, I see Adcock is absolutely right \u2013 and that, by accident or design, items tend to get cheaper as you go down the shelves, which means that by looking at the price below you think you\u2019re getting a steal. As I absorb this latest piece of evil genius, and wonder how you are supposed to keep this stuff straight, a man who introduces himself as Dennis is picking a swede (79p) off the shelf directly above the white cabbage (45p). How much does he think it costs? He looks at me like I\u2019m mad, then says: \u201cIt\u2019s 45p, mate.\u201d No! It\u2019s not! Dennis looks again at the labels, and looks at the swede and shrugs. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says. Then he puts it in his trolley and walks off. In the end, Dennis may have the right idea. For those on the tightest budgets, the pennies will add up to a critical difference at the checkout. But, for many others, the obsession it takes to beat the shops simply isn\u2019t worth it. \u201cWhat we really want,\u201d says Caldwell, \u201cis a psychological journey, these little moments of pleasure where we think we\u2019ve got one over on the supermarket. That\u2019s more important than the receipt at the end.\u201d Leigh Caldwell is obsessed with prices. It\u2019s his life\u2019s work. And yet, he says: \u201cI see myself falling for the tricks all the time. When I started learning about this stuff, my first reaction was, \u2018Don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 take your time to make the right decision.\u2019 But I was taking so long that I was driving myself mad. So, I\u2019ve taught myself to remember that, if it\u2019s only a few pence, the \u2018correct\u2019 choice may not matter that much.\u201d \u201cThe problem is,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwe\u2019re maybe expecting people to be too rational. It\u2019s OK to say: \u2018It\u2019s not worth the hassle. I\u2019m going to let it go.\u2019\u201d Tricks of the trade Unit confusion When items aren\u2019t labelled with a consistent price per kilogram or litre, it can be difficult for consumers to tell which is better value. According to Which?, 87% of consumers are unaware of unit prices. Dodgy offers Sometimes the price of an item mysteriously rises just as a \u201cbargain\u201d two-for-one offer comes in. For example, Asda lifted the price of frozen pizza from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32 as a \u201ctwo for \u00a33\u201d offer appeared \u2013 and dropped the price again when the offer concluded. Pricy multipacks You might expect a multipack to be better value, but sometimes \u2013 despite claiming to be \u201cgreat value\u201d \u2013 a larger pack may actually cost more per unit. One supermarket sold a 10-pack of toilet roll for more per roll than the same brand\u2019s four-pack. Seasonal \u2018bargains\u2019 Special products that only sell at one time of year might be sold at a steep price out of season to justify a \u201cmoney off\u201d designation. For example, Ocado sold an easter egg for \u00a37.49 for 10 days in January, then priced it as \u201con offer\u201d at \u00a35. Shrinking packs Customers don\u2019t like having to pay more \u2013 but they might not notice getting slightly less for their money. So, a packet of Philadelphia cream cheese can shrink from 200g to 180g without any corresponding decrease in price. \u2018Was\u2019 pricing that wasn\u2019t There are examples of products sold at a higher price for a brief period before being sold at a \u201creduced\u201d price for far longer, allowing the suggestion that it\u2019s a good deal, or the price fluctuating so much that the term becomes meaningless. One supermarket sold handwash for \u00a31.80 for a week, then labelled it as \u201cWas \u00a31.80, now 90p\u201d for nearly three months.",

Why does a pack of plastic pint tumblers retailing for \u00a32 appear in a promotional bin with economical-looking red-and-yellow labelling when it isn\u2019t discounted at all? And if, among the seven well-stocked rows that make up the \u201cworld food\u201d section, only 16 of the 58 items are <em>not</em> on offer, what does the term even mean? Wouldn\u2019t it be more honest to call those 16 products \u201cabnormally expensive\u201d?</p> <p>The answers to these questions are deeply mysterious, known only to the team of street economists who make up Tesco\u2019s pricing unit. But the wider explanation is clear: we are in the crossfire of a price war, one that has only been intensified by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/18/lidl-german-discounters-uk-supermarkets-ronny-gottschlich\">hugely successful emergence of the new discounters, Aldi and Lidl</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bb83693dcf682e4fe88ae5c5f11de65071fc890\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/17/1437144210919/be23cabe-faf8-4c68-8851-cc3c357a9a1a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lidl aisle\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lidl: where prices sit above, not below, the products.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cole/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This week, the industry regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) strapped on its body armour and joined the fray, ruling, after a so-called super-complaint from consumer group Which?, that the supermarkets were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/uk-supermarkets-criticised-misleading-pricing\">guilty of \u201cpoor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers\u201d</a>. Asking the government to issue fresh guidelines, it pointed to complicated unit pricing (where comparison from product to product is made difficult by inconsistent quantities), \u201cwas/now\u201d offers where the \u201cnow\u201d price is available for longer than the \u201cwas\u201d ever was, and sharp practice on subtly shrinking pack sizes as areas of concern.</p> <p>Despite its criticism, though, the CMA\u2019s analysis fell well short of a comprehensive rebuke of the supermarkets\u2019 tactics. Yes, there were examples of bad practice, but it said problems were \u201cnot occurring in large numbers across the whole sector\u201d and stopped short of the legal action it was entitled to take. The trouble, it concluded, was a few bad apples \u2013 or, at least, a few badly priced ones. Even as Which? hailed the report as vindication of its complaint, industry representatives such as the British Retail Consortium declared victory for themselves. Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail research agency Conlumino, says: \u201cIn an industry as vast as this, with all the products they sell, there\u2019s bound to be some of that kind of thing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a really serious cause for concern here.\u201d In fact, he says, pressure from the discounters has improved things: \u201cThe supermarkets are up against that simplicity of message and pricing structure. So, they\u2019ve had to adapt and do the same themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, according to consumer analyst Kantar Worldpanel, 40% of grocery spending is now on promoted items, and the CMA has been lambasted in some quarters. The Guardian\u2019s consumer affairs correspondent, Rebecca Smithers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/which--report-supermarket-pricing-whitewash\">described the report as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d</a>; financial analyst Louise Cooper accused the CMA of <a href=\"http://www.coopercity.co.uk/?p=1264\">falling to \u201cregulatory capture\u201d</a> \u2013 becoming too close to the industry it is supposed to be overseeing. Perhaps there\u2019s a bigger question in play, one that can\u2019t easily be resolved by a spot analysis of prices or any amount of regulation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b1cbe49700e789a6d9b80ee8ae5464626cb7bb6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/17/1437142001840/c5c24159-8dd8-4786-a3bb-e343718d1f68-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Asda fruit\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018According to consumer analyst Kantar Worldpanel, 40% of grocery spending is now on promoted items.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhatever the report says, it wouldn\u2019t even be possible for someone to look across tens of thousands of products and maximise their choices,\u201d says Leigh Caldwell, partner at behaviour research and pricing firm The Irrational Agency, and author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/psychology-of-price.html\">The Psychology of Price</a>. \u201cThe supermarket is just such a tricky decision-making environment. The potential for confusion and distraction is high. No one remembers the price of the cereal they bought two months ago. And the CMA doesn\u2019t really have the ability to focus on that. It\u2019s very hard to write rules that say, \u2018You are not allowed to create this level of cognitive complexity for the consumer.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whenever he goes into a supermarket, Leigh says, he looks for a two-litre bottle of Coke. \u201cYou\u2019d think it would be such a standard product. But every time you go in to a given store you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a different price: \u00a31.15; \u00a32.09. And it\u2019s frequently promoted, 2 for \u00a32, or something that will be an absolute no-brainer. I think this is so that people don\u2019t have any memorable price that seems \u201ccorrect\u201d. If it\u2019s a category where people have a strong anchor, the supermarkets want to disrupt it.\u201d</p> <p>I try Leigh\u2019s exercise in Tesco, and find the Coca-Cola with a sense that I\u2019ve stumbled on a secret key to the mystery. It\u2019s priced at \u00a31.94. Not brilliant, I think, but not bad, within the reasonable range, comparable to the other brands in the soft drinks aisle. It\u2019s only when I note down the details that I realise that, whereas the competitors are all two litres, the identical-looking Coke is a quarter-litre less.</p> <p>Is all this part of a dastardly plan to part us from our cash? Maybe not. With so many items to keep track of, it wouldn\u2019t be very surprising if some of the problems that have so exercised Which? are the product of cock-up, not conspiracy. The Guardian\u2019s own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/gallery/2011/nov/05/daftest-in-store-deals\">readers\u2019 anthology of dubious deals</a> \u2013 crusty rolls 40p, two for \u00a31! \u2013 seems simply too bonkers to be put down to malice. \u201cI\u2019d love to say it\u2019s this big, machiavellian plan, but the main thing to blame is human stupidity,\u201d says Phillip Adcock, author of Shoppology: The Science of Supermarket Shopping. \u201cIt\u2019s inexperienced junior people running a formula. They\u2019re all running so fast to keep up with each other, but they can\u2019t keep up with the offers in their own stores.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"917545d85c3e8aa8fbff03481aa8804792881ea9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/17/1437142300019/e8be26ab-7347-4404-8d91-e5cc9db6f8e9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sainsbury's clearance shelf\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One retail pricing specialist says \u2018buyers aren\u2019t as clever as people make out\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you imagine every supermarket price is set by a ruthlessly efficient algorithm that examines all the figures and works out the sweet spot for maximum profitability, think again: this isn\u2019t Amazon. Instead, says Caldwell, \u201cit\u2019s often pricing teams with dozens of people looking through data and making decisions: let\u2019s look at soft drinks, let\u2019s see what promotional spend Coca-Cola will give us and let\u2019s price things accordingly\u201d. This pattern is set by a belief that the simplest way to make money is by extracting as much as possible from suppliers, not consumers. \u201cThey\u2019re obsessed with \u2018back margin\u2019 \u2013 the money you make by charging suppliers for ancillary things,\u201d says Adcock. \u201cSo, they start to create these almost fictitious things they can sell, whether it\u2019s a prime shelf [at the height a shopper is most likely to see] or a gondola end [the promotional buckets often found at the top of the aisle]. Their whole job is screwing the suppliers.\u201d Indeed, the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/the-myths-of-supermarket-selling-are-the-big-food-retailers-reading-us-all-wrong-7661663.html\">famous psychological tricks designed to make you spend</a> as much as humanly possible have lost the supermarkets\u2019 attention: where fiendishly innovative store designers once set aisles deliberately wide in the belief that doing so made shoppers walk more slowly, and moved items around to force us to look more closely (a theory that was later debunked), the focus has shifted. \u201cThe battle now is getting them in the store in the first place,\u201d says Saunders. Adcock agrees: \u201cThese days, they\u2019re just warehouses with forklifts,\u201d he says, sounding rather mournful. \u201cAll that psychological stuff, it\u2019s all gone.\u201d</p> <p>A retail pricing specialist with extensive experience of one of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s deliberate at all,\u201d he says. \u201cBuyers aren\u2019t as clever as people make out. They\u2019re fixated on what their competition is up to \u2013 everyone is following everyone else.\u201d In his view, this is the reason for the fluctuation in prices that stops customers figuring out an \u201canchor\u201d: not conscious policy, but the consequence of each supermarket constantly reacting to the others, an endless merry-go-round of adjustment without much reason behind it.</p> <p>Indeed, none of this is really about what works for consumers. The bottom line, says Adcock, is that the sector is \u201cin an absolute mess at the moment\u201d. \u201cThey have reputations worth billions of pounds, but they put it at risk with an absolutely manic obsession with short-termism,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one in supermarkets cares what next year looks like \u2013 they\u2019re talking about the next six weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Against all of this, the discounters like to set themselves up as revolutionary idealists. \u201cWe have a fundamentally different model,\u201d Aldi said in a statement after the CMA report appeared. The idea, it went on, is to provide \u201cthe lowest prices in grocery in a simple and transparent way\u201d.</p> <p>And, it\u2019s true: when you visit Aldi or Lidl, the mood is different, the frantic discounting replaced by an agreeably spartan sense that supermarkets have been Ikea-ed. But even in these utopian surroundings all is not as it seems. \u201cGo into the discounters and look at the price labels,\u201d Phillip Adcock says. \u201cWe\u2019re conditioned to look for the price on the shelf below the item. But, at the discounters, they put the prices on the shelf above, and the top shelf ones on the wall. So, you look and you see the price below, and you think that\u2019s what you\u2019re paying.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m sceptical about this. But, when I arrive at Lidl from Tesco, I see Adcock is absolutely right \u2013 and that, by accident or design, items tend to get cheaper as you go down the shelves, which means that by looking at the price below you think you\u2019re getting a steal. As I absorb this latest piece of evil genius, and wonder how you are supposed to keep this stuff straight, a man who introduces himself as Dennis is picking a swede (79p) off the shelf directly above the white cabbage (45p). How much does he think it costs? He looks at me like I\u2019m mad, then says: \u201cIt\u2019s 45p, mate.\u201d No! It\u2019s not! Dennis looks again at the labels, and looks at the swede and shrugs. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says. Then he puts it in his trolley and walks off.</p> <p>In the end, Dennis may have the right idea. For those on the tightest budgets, the pennies will add up to a critical difference at the checkout. But, for many others, the obsession it takes to beat the shops simply isn\u2019t worth it. \u201cWhat we really want,\u201d says Caldwell, \u201cis a psychological journey, these little moments of pleasure where we think we\u2019ve got one over on the supermarket. That\u2019s more important than the receipt at the end.\u201d</p> <p>Leigh Caldwell is obsessed with prices. It\u2019s his life\u2019s work. And yet, he says: \u201cI see myself falling for the tricks all the time. When I started learning about this stuff, my first reaction was, \u2018Don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 take your time to make the right decision.\u2019 But I was taking so long that I was driving myself mad. So, I\u2019ve taught myself to remember that, if it\u2019s only a few pence, the \u2018correct\u2019 choice may not matter that much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is,\u201d he goes on, \u201cwe\u2019re maybe expecting people to be too rational. It\u2019s OK to say: \u2018It\u2019s not worth the hassle. I\u2019m going to let it go.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Tricks of the trade</h2> <p><strong>Unit confusion<br></strong>When items aren\u2019t labelled with a consistent price per kilogram or litre, it can be difficult for consumers to tell which is better value. According to Which?, 87% of consumers are unaware of unit prices.</p> <p><strong>Dodgy offers<br></strong>Sometimes the price of an item mysteriously rises just as a \u201cbargain\u201d two-for-one offer comes in. For example, Asda lifted the price of frozen pizza from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32 as a \u201ctwo for \u00a33\u201d offer appeared \u2013 and dropped the price again when the offer concluded.</p> <p><strong>Pricy multipacks<br></strong>You might expect a multipack to be better value, but sometimes \u2013 despite claiming to be \u201cgreat value\u201d \u2013 a larger pack may actually cost more per unit. One supermarket sold a 10-pack of toilet roll for more per roll than the same brand\u2019s four-pack.</p> <p><strong>Seasonal \u2018bargains\u2019<br></strong>Special products that only sell at one time of year might be sold at a steep price out of season to justify a \u201cmoney off\u201d designation. For example, Ocado sold an easter egg for \u00a37.49 for 10 days in January, then priced it as \u201con offer\u201d at \u00a35.</p> <p><strong>Shrinking packs<br></strong>Customers don\u2019t like having to pay more \u2013 but they might not notice getting slightly less for their money. So, a packet of Philadelphia cream cheese can shrink from 200g to 180g without any corresponding decrease in price.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Was\u2019 pricing that wasn\u2019t<br></strong>There are examples of products sold at a higher price for a brief period before being sold at a \u201creduced\u201d price for far longer, allowing the suggestion that it\u2019s a good deal, or the price fluctuating so much that the term becomes meaningless. One supermarket sold handwash for \u00a31.80 for a week, then labelled it as \u201cWas \u00a31.80, now 90p\u201d for nearly three months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has forced out the tough-talking head of Britain\u2019s financial watchdog after he angered the banking community with a string of record fines. Martin Wheatley quit as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority after he was told earlier this week by the chancellor that his five year contract would not be renewed next year. The chancellor\u2019s vote of no confidence immediately prompted speculation that it was Wheatley\u2019s attacks on bank misbehaviour which had generated a loss of support inside No 11. John Mann MP, a member of the influential Treasury select committee, said the chancellor was \u201cwrong\u201d and the decision \u201cundermined the independence of the regulator\u201d. The watchdog\u2019s remit to clamp down on misselling prompted it to levy a record \u00a31.4bn in fines last year and keep a focus on bank efforts to clean up their acts in the wake of the \u00a320bn payment protection insurance scandal. Sources close to the Treasury denied that Wheatley\u2019s departure would bring a more softly-softly approach, saying that his successor would still get support for tackling poor practice in the City. Osborne said: \u201cBritain needs a tough, strong financial conduct regulator. Martin Wheatley has done a brilliant job of launching the FCA in tough circumstances. \u201cNow that phase is complete, the government believes that different leadership is required to build on those foundations and take the organisation to the next stage of its development. \u201cThe government is launching a worldwide search; Martin\u2019s replacement will \u2013 like him \u2013 need to be passionate about protecting consumers, promoting competition and completing the job of cleaning up the City, so it is the best-regulated market in the world.\u201d However, Mann said: \u201cTo play politics with our biggest financial regulator shows the chancellor hasn\u2019t learnt the lessons of the financial crash. \u201cMartin Wheatley has led the FCA with distinction since its creation following the failures of the FSA. Under his watch the biggest banks have been held accountable for their failings, predatory payday lenders have been brought to task and consumers have finally had someone stand up for them.\u201d It is understood that several banks and insurers have complained to the chancellor about the FCA under Wheatley, whom they accuse of having a \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d attitude to regulation. Wheatley, who helped set up and spearhead the chancellor\u2019s beefed-up regulator in its first two years, famously said he would \u201cshoot first and ask questions later\u201d at the launch of the watchdog. The FCA is the second pillar of the chancellor\u2019s regulatory system alongside the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, which supervises the financial security of the banking and insurance sectors to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Wheatley, who was also head of the FCA\u2019s predecessor, will continue to act as an adviser to the FCA board until 31 January next year, the regulator said, to help implement the Fair and Effective Markets Review, which he co-chaired. John Griffith-Jones, the FCA chairman, said: \u201cMartin has done an outstanding job as chief executive setting up and leading the FCA over the last four years. We owe him a lot and I and my board would like to thank him for his great efforts in setting up the organisation and for the contribution he has made to putting conduct so firmly at the top of the financial services agenda.\u201d Wheatley said the FCA would \u201cbuild on that strong start and work so that the financial services industry continues to thrive\u201d. Tracey McDermott, currently director of supervision, will take over as acting chief executive from 12 September while the search for a permanent chief executive takes place. Wheatley\u2019s low points Insurance The FCA told the Daily Telegraph in March 2014 that it would review 30m closed life insurance policies going back decades and potentially scrap exit fees on such policies. Around \u00a36bn was wiped off insurance company shares when the report appeared. FCA executive Clive Bannister, who made the comments in an exclusive interview, fell on his sword and there was an official enquiry. Wheatley, however, managed to keep his job. HBOS Even though seven years have now passed since the banking crisis the former directors of HBOS \u2013 which had to be rescued by Lloyds in a shotgun takeover \u2013 have so far escaped censure . The FCA has repeatedly failed to produce a report on former chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby or ex-chairman Lord Stevenson, or even say when its report will be published. Wheatley\u2019s high points Fines The FCA imposed fines of \u00a31.4bn during the last financial year 2014-15, more than for the previous four years combined. Bosses at Lloyds Banking Group forfeited almost \u00a333m in past and future bonuses after the bank paid a record fine of \u00a3117m for the mishandling of PPI complaints. Barclays paid a record \u00a3284m for \u201cunacceptable practices\u201d relating to forex trading. Five other global banks were also hit with heavy penalties. Last year, Ian Hannam, the former chairman of capital markets at JPMorgan and one of the City\u2019s star investment bankers, lost the fight to clear his name after the regulator fined him \u00a3450,000 for disclosing to a client inside information about a potential takeover of the oil and gas company Heritage.",

      "bodyText": "A showdown between hardheaded corporate culture and the Scandinavian ideal of consensus and equity comes to a head this weekend as Ryanair prepares to pull out of Denmark to avoid a trade union blockade. On Friday night Ryanair is due to close its base at Billund airport, which brings flocks of visitors to the nearby Legoland theme park, an hour before unions plan to launch a full-scale boycott of the airline over its refusal to adapt to Denmark\u2019s generous working conditions. Since introducing a service to Copenhagen this spring, Ryanair has come under sustained attack from unions and officials who have accused it of violating workers\u2019 rights in the country. On occasion the war of words has spilled over into a slanging match in the press and social media. After Copenhagen\u2019s mayor banned city employees from using the airline because its low wages amounted to \u201csocial dumping\u201d, the airline issued a crudely Photoshopped image of the mayor as Marie Antoinette, saying \u201cLet them eat cake!\u201d and \u201cLet them pay high fares!\u201d The Social Democrat MP Peter Hummelgaard hit back with an equally vulgar image of Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary apparently in an intimate entanglement with one of his jets, under the slogan: \u201cRyanair: screwing over its staff since 1985.\u201d After Ryanair held a press conference in Copenhagen last week at which some of its pilots praised their working conditions, unions claimed they were not on the same contracts as most Ryanair staff, who are paid worse. Other Ryanair workers went to the media with claims that in some months their wages were as low as \u20ac500 (\u00a3348), or less than half the salaries of local low-cost airlines. \u201cThis was shocking to the public that this could be happening in our backyard,\u201d said Anders Mark Jensen, vice-president of the Flight Personnel Union, which organises pilots and cabin crew in Denmark. \u201cRyanair\u2019s style is management by fear,\u201d said Morten Windel\u00f8v, a Ryanair pilot from 2007-2011, and now a leading voice in the unions\u2019 campaign to persuade the airline to negotiate. \u201cThere is a widespread disdain for employees, you are not treated with trust or respect as an individual \u2013 irrespective of whether you are a pilot or cabin crew. I cannot comprehend that you can be treated like that.\u201d Staff are ordered where to work and when to take holidays, and are under pressure to meet targets to sell merchandise, he claimed. Pilots compete to save fuel, with their performance disclosed in the crewroom for all their colleagues to see. \u201cCompetition at its worst in my opinion,\u201d Windel\u00f8v said. In response to the unions\u2019 allegations, Ryanair, which is Europe\u2019s largest airline in terms of the number of passengers, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on false or secondhand claims made by former pilots. The fact that Ryanair has a waiting list of over 5,000 pilots and cabin crew who wish to join speaks for itself.\u201d The unions won a legal battle last month when a labour tribunal ruled that they could take sympathy industrial action against the airline anywhere in the country, even though the unions have no members among Ryanair staff. By withdrawing its bases from the country, however, Ryanair would make any such action illegal \u2013 the carrier will continue to fly in and out of Danish airports, but with planes and staff based in Britain, Lithuania and Ireland. Its Danish staff are being relocated. Transport union 3F, which represents the ground staff, asked an external consultancy to compare working conditions at Ryanair with those of other airlines in Denmark. It concluded that the disposable income of Ryanair employees is 23,000 kroner (about \u00a32,150), or 15%, lower annually for a cabin attendant. Unions claim the research shows that an extra 37 kroner \u2013 or \u00a33.45, roughly half the price of a packet of cigarettes \u2013 on each ticket would be enough to pay for decent working conditions and a collective agreement that would uphold custom and practice in relations between unions and business in Denmark. The Irish discount carrier\u2019s reputation has gone steeply downhill in Denmark this year, and the company is solidly in last place in YouGov surveys of corporate reputation. However, in this battle between price and principle, customers are apparently indifferent. A poll this week suggested more Danes would choose Ryanair today than before the dispute with the unions broke out. Ryanair says it does not negotiate with unions because for 30 years its people have preferred to negotiate directly with the company. The dispute in Denmark demonstrates that \u201cthe Danish model cannot be applied\u201d to the airline industry, it says. \u201cWe did not expect the sea of negative publicity and the fact that nobody would give us a fair hearing in Denmark,\u201d O\u2019Leary told the Danish newspaper Berlingske in June. \u201cIf we sign a collective agreement with the Danish unions, we will then be asked to sign 15 French collective agreements, 55 Spanish collective agreements and a lot of Italian collective agreements. We are not going to do that.\u201d The unions say that if Ryanair carries out its threat to abandon its last base in the country on Friday night, they will welcome its return to Denmark \u2013 but only if the airline agrees to negotiate. \u201cOur campaign is not to put Ryanair in a bad situation \u2013 we are always saying welcome, but please sign a collective agreement with us so we can have fair competition with the other airlines,\u201d Jensen, of the Flight Personnel Union, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a Ryanair society in Denmark, we won\u2019t let them export it here.\u201d",

We are not going to do that.\u201d </p> <p>The unions say that if Ryanair carries out its threat to abandon its last base in the country on Friday night, they will welcome its return to Denmark \u2013 but only if the airline agrees to negotiate. </p> <p>\u201cOur campaign is not to put Ryanair in a bad situation \u2013 we are always saying welcome, but please sign a collective agreement with us so we can have fair competition with the other airlines,\u201d Jensen, of the Flight Personnel Union, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a Ryanair society in Denmark, we won\u2019t let them export it here.\u201d</p>",

The eurozone is expected to start formal talks with Greece on securing a bailout worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn), once national parliaments in Germany, Austria and other countries have given their approval. The Bundestag is expected on Friday to support Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to open talks with Greece on a third bailout, despite the view of Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, that Grexit may be a better option. France and Finland have already voted in favour of talks with Greece. Austria, Estonia, Latvia and Spain will also hold votes.

      "bodyText": "The pound has hit a seven-and-a-half year high against the euro after Mark Carney signalled that the first rise in interest rates since the global financial crash could take place around the turn of the year. A speech by the Bank of England governor, indicating that the period of 0.5% borrowing costs was coming to an end within months, worked to strengthen the pound against the single currency. Sterling pushed on from Thursday\u2019s new high against the euro on Friday morning, up 0.24% at \u20ac1.4384 (\u00a30.974177) Against the dollar, the pound stood at $1.5664, up about 0.2% and moving back towards a two-week peak of $1.5676 scaled on Wednesday. Sterling also hit its highest level since early 2008 against a basket of currencies. A rise in interest rates \u2013 which have been at the historic low of 0.5% for more than six years \u2013 had previously not been expected until the middle of 2016. However, Carney changed those expectations on Thursday night. He said: \u201cIt would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. \u201cIn my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year.\u201d The pound has already been strengthening against the euro as the fallout from the Greek debt crisis means the European Central Bank is seen as unlikely to curtail its monetary support for the single currency any time soon. The Bank of England interest rate has remained the same since March 2009, when it was cut to help prop up the UK economy at the height of the financial crisis. This represents the longest period of unchanged rates since the second world war. It was last increased in July 2007 when it went up to 5.75%. Angus Campbell, a senior analyst at brokers FxPro, said there was an immediate benefit for British tourists travelling to the continent. \u201cIt is tremendous for people going to the continent. [On] a year ago, your holiday is going to be 10% cheaper,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at levels last seen before the credit crisis. 2007 was when the euro sterling [rate] was at this level. It is quite a significant breakthrough \u2026 It is a technical level that makes euro investors fear exposure to the euro even more. \u201cThe upside to the euro is limited. It has become quite a toxic currency because of what has happened with Greece and there is still a rift between factions of the creditors.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain has been put on alert to expect its first interest rate rise since the global financial crash at around the turn of the year as the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned that the long period of 0.5% borrowing costs was coming to an end. Carney told businesses and consumers that Threadneedle Street would have to respond to the economy\u2019s stronger growth by announcing the first tightening of policy since rates were increased to 5.75% in July 2007 \u2013 the month before the US subprime mortgage crisis erupted. However, the governor added that after an extended period of what were expected to be emergency rates, borrowing costs were likely to peak at just over 2% \u2013 half their average historic norm since the Bank was founded in 1694. \u201cIt would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year.\u201d Carney said that since the Bank began to target inflation in 1992, the tendency during periods when interest rates were rising was for borrowing costs to increase by 0.5 percentage points every three months. The warning to Britain to prepare for the first move in borrowing costs in either direction since March 2009 reflects the Bank\u2019s concern that debt levels remain high and that many households have never seen their monthly mortgage payments rise. Inflation is at 0%, well below the government\u2019s 2% target, but Carney said price pressures would emerge over the coming months and become more evident when last year\u2019s sharp fall in oil prices ceased to bear down on the cost of living. \u201cThe MPC\u2019s intention is to return inflation to target in a sustainable manner within two years. That means setting Bank rate to eliminate the remaining slack in the economy, bringing about the sustained increase in costs necessary to achieve overall inflation of 2%,\u201d the governor said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral. \u201cI expect that this will involve raising Bank rate over the next three years from its current all-time low of 0.5%. The need for Bank rate to rise reflects the momentum in the economy and a gradual firming of underlying inflationary pressures \u2013 a firming that will become more apparent as the effects of past commodity price falls drop out of the annual inflation rate around the end of the year.\u201d Carney said it would take time for the increase in interest rates to feed through into the economy, and that the peak impact would come around 18-24 months after the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee made its move. If the committee does move around the turn of the year, it will bring an end to a period when rates have been lower than at any time since the Bank was founded. The last time interest rates went unchanged for a longer period was between 1939 and 1951. The governor said the path of interest rates was more important to the Bank than the precise timing of an increase, and left room for manoeuvre in the event that economic circumstances change. Carney said shocks to the economy could easily affect the timing and scale of interest rate increases. He also noted that the largest cumulative increase in interest rates in the era of inflation targeting had been 1.5 percentage points, half the average in the US over the same period. \u201cThis likely reflects in part the greater sensitivity of UK household balances sheets in the medium term to floating interest rates, something that could be particularly relevant in our still heavily indebted post-crisis economy \u2026 We will learn more about the importance of these sensitivities as interest rates increase.\u201d The governor said the level of the pound might also be a factor, since the strengthening of sterling would tend to depress inflation by making imports cheaper and exports dearer. \u201cThis risk is particularly relevant at present when the monetary policy stance of our largest trading partner [the euro] is diverging with ours.\u201d He added that Britain was running the biggest current account deficit in the world of almost 6% of national incomes. This meant that the right policy mix leant towards tough budgetary policies from the Treasury, looser monetary policy and steps by the Bank to forestall boom-busts in the housing market. \u201cGiven these considerations, the MPC will have to feel its way as it goes \u2026 There is, in fact, a wide distribution of possible outcomes around any expected path for Bank rate, reflecting the inevitability that the economy will be buffeted by shocks and that monetary policy will have to adjust accordingly.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain has been put on alert to expect its first interest rate rise since the global financial crash at around the turn of the year as the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned that the long period of 0.5% borrowing costs was coming to an end.</p> <p>Carney told businesses and consumers that Threadneedle Street would have to respond to the economy\u2019s stronger growth by announcing the first tightening of policy since rates were increased to 5.75% in July 2007 \u2013 the month before the US subprime mortgage crisis erupted. </p> <p>However, the governor added that after an extended period of what were expected to be emergency rates, borrowing costs were likely to peak at just over 2% \u2013 half their average historic norm since the Bank was founded in 1694.</p> <p>\u201cIt would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year.\u201d</p> <p>Carney said that since the Bank began to target inflation in 1992, the tendency during periods when interest rates were rising was for borrowing costs to increase by 0.5 percentage points every three months.</p> <p>The warning to Britain to prepare for the first move in borrowing costs in either direction since March 2009 reflects the Bank\u2019s concern that debt levels remain high and that many households have never seen their monthly mortgage payments rise.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/01/buy-to-let-boom-jeopardise-financial-stability-bank-england-house-prices\">Buy-to-let boom could jeopardise financial stability, says Bank of England</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> is at 0%, well below the government\u2019s 2% target, but Carney said price pressures would emerge over the coming months and become more evident when last year\u2019s sharp fall in oil prices ceased to bear down on the cost of living.</p> <p>\u201cThe MPC\u2019s intention is to return inflation to target in a sustainable manner within two years. That means setting Bank rate to eliminate the remaining slack in the economy, bringing about the sustained increase in costs necessary to achieve overall inflation of 2%,\u201d the governor said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral.</p> <p>\u201cI expect that this will involve raising Bank rate over the next three years from its current all-time low of 0.5%. The need for Bank rate to rise reflects the momentum in the economy and a gradual firming of underlying inflationary pressures \u2013 a firming that will become more apparent as the effects of past commodity price falls drop out of the annual inflation rate around the end of the year.\u201d</p> <p>Carney said it would take time for the increase in interest rates to feed through into the economy, and that the peak impact would come around 18-24 months after the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee made its move.</p> <p>If the committee does move around the turn of the year, it will bring an end to a period when rates have been lower than at any time since the Bank was founded. The last time interest rates went unchanged for a longer period was between 1939 and 1951.<br></p> <p>The governor said the path of interest rates was more important to the Bank than the precise timing of an increase, and left room for manoeuvre in the event that economic circumstances change.</p> <p>Carney said shocks to the economy could easily affect the timing and scale of interest rate increases.</p> <p>He also noted that the largest cumulative increase in interest rates in the era of inflation targeting had been 1.5 percentage points, half the average in the US over the same period.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Interest rate graph\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1437139174759/interest_rates.svg&quot;style=\u201dwidth:100%;\u201d&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis likely reflects in part the greater sensitivity of UK household balances sheets in the medium term to floating interest rates, something that could be particularly relevant in our still heavily indebted post-crisis economy \u2026 We will learn more about the importance of these sensitivities as interest rates increase.\u201d<br></p> <p>The governor said the level of the pound might also be a factor, since the strengthening of sterling would tend to depress inflation by making imports cheaper and exports dearer. \u201cThis risk is particularly relevant at present when the monetary policy stance of our largest trading partner [the euro] is diverging with ours.\u201d</p> <p>He added that Britain was running the biggest current account deficit in the world of almost 6% of national incomes. This meant that the right policy mix leant towards tough budgetary policies from the Treasury, looser monetary policy and steps by the Bank to forestall boom-busts in the housing market.</p> <p>\u201cGiven these considerations, the MPC will have to feel its way as it goes \u2026 There is, in fact, a wide distribution of possible outcomes around any expected path for Bank rate, reflecting the inevitability that the economy will be buffeted by shocks and that monetary policy will have to adjust accordingly.\u201d</p>",
