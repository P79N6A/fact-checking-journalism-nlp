      "bodyText": "It seemed the page had been turned, the future of rail was now rosy. The chancellor announced on Wednesday that key projects were back on track: Network Rail was trumpeting that no infrastructure project would now be axed after all. Yet if the review set to draw a line under the crisis that erupted in June, when major upgrades were canned, was such good news, one commentator mused, why bury it on a busy autumn statement day? It may be that neither ministers nor Network Rail wanted to publicly relive the mess when, weeks after the election, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, had to tell the Commons that the grand five-year plan for the biggest investment in the railways since Victorian times had gone off track. But the timing has fuelled suspicions that the rail industry is only climbing halfway out of its hole, and at great expense. Sir Peter Hendy, installed as the Network Rail chairman by the government at short notice this summer to bang heads together, has formed a more sympathetic view. With George Osborne demanding action after the cancelled electrification of the TransPennine route and Midland mainline started to undermine his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d rhetoric, Hendy made it clear that more money would be needed for projects. That has added at least \u00a32.5bn to the bill, to be funded by borrowing and selling off assets. That money appears to have made the difference, allowing Network Rail to claim it is still delivering the plan, after predictions that more notable projects would have to be axed. But what the whole plan ends up costing, when improvements come \u2013 and what embryonic projects never gestate \u2013 remains to be seen. The rail historian Christian Wolmar said: \u201cIt\u2019s smoke and mirrors, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s managed to say we\u2019re not cutting very much by kicking some things to the right, sticking \u00a3700m on the credit card and selling stuff.\u201d Flogging off depots, retail space and land under railway arches, it is hoped, will raise \u00a31.8bn, though the fire sale will also curb a significant commercial revenue stream in future. Meanwhile, that \u00a3700m will swell Network Rail\u2019s \u00a338bn debt, the very issue that brought the rail crisis to a head, when the Treasury tried to force it to live within its means after Network Rail borrowing was reclassified as national debt in September 2014. That loan will be the last, Hendy now suggests. \u201cPersonally, I think we\u2019ve done rather well in what was a difficult spending round. We need to buckle down and deliver it. It\u2019s got to be done in the knowledge that that\u2019s the money, and there isn\u2019t a golden credit card any more,\u201d he said. Wolmar said: \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that the government hasn\u2019t got more disciplinarian, but as they\u2019ve set so much store by the \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019 and HS3, perhaps they don\u2019t want to treat them too harshly. \u201cIf it were the NHS, there would be talk of billion-pound holes in the budget, but Network Rail seems to be able to continue blithely on.\u201d But at this stage, he says, without assurances and detail on how Network Rail is going to make savings, the review is little more than \u201cwishful thinking\u201d. Hendy rebuts this claim: \u201cThe truth is, we\u2019ve been through a process that no one has been through before, because a lot of projects were at such an early stage and you couldn\u2019t be clear about their scale or costs.\u201d Network Rail\u2019s budget was effectively drawn up as an estimate years before work began on key projects, and finalised in January 2014. The majority of the cost overrun has come on electrification of the Great Western mainline, whose price has been re-evaluated from \u00a31.6bn to \u00a32.8bn in the past year. But as Network Rail\u2019s chief executive, Mark Carne, pointed out, the government was warned early in 2014 that the budget was spiralling. There has also been a 10% or \u00a3400m increase in the budget to rebuild the Thameslink route. Hendy warns: \u201cThere still are some risks. The fact is, until you start digging up railways that are between 90 and 120 years old, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s there. But the programme is in a much better place than it was.\u201d While his review promises every project will be completed within rail\u2019s next accounting period, from 2019-2024 \u2013 known as CP6 \u2013 that could mean either a short overrun, or a delay of several years. Welsh politicians fear electrification of the line to Swansea may never happen. Development work on at least five projects will now not begin until after the 2019 deadline for this five-year plan. And the level of funding for those five years still has to be negotiated. The rail industry will have to fight for more investment. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of the rail union Aslef, said: \u201cThe additional money is to just stick a plaster over over-running projects. What are they doing to address the poor planning and the problems they already have? \u201cI wonder if we\u2019ll have a similar statement in eighteen months, saying things will slip into CP7?\u201d He fears other budgets will be trimmed within rail. \u201cWe\u2019ve a real worry that we\u2019re going into managed decline, a period of less investment. Passengers and people working on the railway will suffer,\u201d Whelan said. Wolmar goes as far as to say there is \u201csomething rotten at the core of Network Rail\u201d \u2013 an inability to manage projects efficiently. If Hendy\u2019s remit was not to point fingers, a report by the economist Dame Colette Bowe, a non-executive director at the Department for Transport, does. The role of the Office of Rail and Road, the rail regulator, should be fundamentally reviewed, she said. She also speaks of inadequate planning, costing errors and blurred lines of responsibility and accountability within the government and Network Rail. In an illustration of the accounting bedlam, Bowe cites Network Rail managers responding to an imposition of efficiency savings by attempting to reclassify renewals work as enhancements \u2013 whose budget was someone else\u2019s concern. That move might be inspired by a fiscal regime that pares day-to-day spending to the bone while finding billions for infrastructure, a delineation of investment and spending that saw the chancellor lead in on a 37% cut to the DfT budget \u2013 wiping out Transport for London\u2019s operational subsidy \u2013 while still committing \u00a311bn to infrastructure in the capital by 2021, and an eventual \u00a356bn to HS2. Even leading figures in London, politically aligned to the Conservative mayor, Boris Johnson, have made their unease clear at such distinctions between so-called resource and capital spending. As Whelan asks: \u201cHow does this rail investment chime with the reduced budgets for maintenance and renewals?\u201d A further review by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, may have more serious ramifications for Network Rail\u2019s future. For now, this week\u2019s reviews have the air of an unsatisfactory accord between a government that overdemanded and overpromised, and a rail industry which never expected to be called entirely to account.",

      "bodyText": "The billionaire founder of the Foxtons estate agency group has won a legal battle with the French government allowing him to press ahead with plans to dig a mega-basement under his London home to house his vintage car collection. Jon Hunt\u2019s grade II-listed four-storey mansion, once occupied by the Russian embassy, is situated in Kensington Palace Gardens, the most expensive residential address in the UK. It lies next door to the French ambassador\u2019s residence, whose government has been fighting his plans for a vast underground garage under the back lawn, even though it was granted planning consent in 2008. The 62-year-old property entrepreneur and his wife Lois, whose neighbours include steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, Roman Abramovich and the Sultan of Brunei, had already begun work on the property. But the French government challenged the validity of certificates of lawfulness granted by Kensington and Chelsea council, arguing that they compromised its security. At the high court Robert Griffiths QC, representing the embassy, told Mr Justice Holgate there had been inadequate consultation, and that the excavations already carried out were only repairs required under the terms of the Hunts\u2019 lease, rather than part of the vast underground car showroom planned by the billionaire. But the judge rejected an application for judicial review on the bulk of the embassy\u2019s complaints, agreeing only that the council had acted unlawfully by failing to enter the certificates on its planning register. The French government will now have to pay the bulk of the council\u2019s costs, estimated to be more than \u00a3100,000. Paul Brown QC, who represented the Hunts, told the judge: \u201cThey are acting lawfully. They have permission.\u201d He said the French government had only launched legal action \u201cbecause they don\u2019t want Mr Hunt to complete the basement\u201d. Hunt sold the Foxtons chain to the private equity firm BC Partners in 2007 for \u00a3370m, just weeks before the credit crunch hit and the property market slumped. He owns an array of other assets, including a restaurant and private members\u2019 club in Kensington, a golf course in Suffolk and a nearby 18th century Grade I-listed country estate, Heveningham Hall. In 2012 he established Bacchus Partners, which develops derelict buildings and properties in urban areas. Basement building has become a highly controversial issue in London, where some underground schemes are so cavernous they have been dubbed \u201ciceberg homes\u201d because only a tiny fraction of the property is now visible above ground. Last December Kensington and Chelsea council won a battle to stop some expansion schemes. Local councillor Tim Coleridge said homes near to big projects \u201cexperienced years of misery from noise, vibration, dust and construction traffic.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy has slowed after poor overseas trade figures put a record drag on growth, leaving household spending to drive the recovery and casting further doubt on George Osborne\u2019s hopes that strong tax receipts will help him hit ambitious budget targets. Official figures confirming that GDP growth slipped in the third quarter came alongside a warning from a leading credit rating agency that the chancellor\u2019s latest package of tax and spending measures left him at risk of missing his goal to run a surplus on the public finances by the end of the decade. Fitch Ratings said the chancellor was heavily reliant on economic growth holding up to balance the books. But rival ratings agency Moody\u2019s said the move to a slower pace of deficit reduction helped make the government\u2019s fiscal plans \u201cmore realistic and deliverable\u201d. At the same time, however, Moody\u2019s remained sceptical that the chancellor would actually achieve a budget surplus by the end of the decade. \u201cWe continue to expect a small deficit by the end of the current parliament,\u201d it said in an update to financial markets. There was also bad news for the chancellor in the detail of the latest GDP figures which showed growth of 0.5% in the third quarter of the year, down from 0.7% in the second quarter. A breakdown of the figures showed net trade, the gap between exports and imports, took a record 1.5 percentage points off quarterly growth. GDP growth slows The figures were at odds with the government\u2019s pledge to rebalance the UK economy towards exports and away from reliance on consumer spending. However, in the latest quarter the weaker trade picture was a result of a jump in imports rather than weakness in exports, economists noted. Imports rose at the fastest pace in almost a decade, up 5.5% on the quarter, while exports grew a smaller 0.9%. \u201cThe principal story here is one of a two speed economy, with domestic drivers performing well but with overseas demand weak,\u201d said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. \u201cTaken over the past year as a whole, net trade has subtracted 0.4% from growth, while consumer spending has added 1.9%, indicative of a growing divergence between the internally and externally facing sectors of the economy.\u201d Manufacturing recession The GDP figures also showed manufacturing output fell 0.4% in the latest quarter, confirming that the factory sector is in recession after three consecutive quarters of contraction. That follows warnings from UK manufacturers that demand from abroad has waned as the global economy slows, led by China and other emerging market countries. The construction sector, where growth tends to be volatile from quarter to quarter, contracted 2.2% in the third quarter, the ONS said. It was left to consumer spending to be the main driver of GDP growth over the July to September quarter. Household spending was up 0.8%, its ninth consecutive quarter of growth. \u201cIn terms of the breakdown, consumer spending did most of the heavy lifting ... Business investment was also punchy,\u201d said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. \u201cAt the other extreme, net exports were a big drag.\u201d Net trade drag At his autumn statement and spending review this week, Osborne said a projected \u00a327bn improvement in the public finances compared with his last budget in July, meant he had been able to soften a planned spending squeeze and lift the threat of tax credit cuts. But leading thinktanks have been quick to cast doubt on the chancellor\u2019s plans . The Institute for Fiscal Studies called Osborne\u2019s 2020 target to run a surplus on the public finances \u201ccompletely inflexible\u201d and warned there was a 50-50 chance he would have to revisit his plans. Fitch similarly warned the chancellor had \u201climited fiscal space if growth or revenues underperform\u201d. \u201cDebt reduction is increasingly being driven by underlying growth and revenue trends, which could reverse,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cUsing better-than-expected revenue forecasts to scale back previously announced expenditure cuts suggests that this may pose downside risks to fiscal targets,\u201d it added. \u201cFitch maintains its view that the nominal deficit target implies limited fiscal flexibility to respond to modest adverse economic shocks.\u201d Despite the latest slowdown in quarterly growth, economists forecast a solid pace of GDP expansion for the year as a whole. The ONS data showed GDP was up 2.3% in the third quarter on a year earlier. Last year, the UK economy grew 2.9%, beating other major industrialised nations. John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, said he still expected the UK to remain one of the fastest-growing economies in the G7 group of nations with GDP up 2.4% in both 2015 and 2016. \u201cToday\u2019s figures show no change in the big picture of a steady UK economic recovery led by a broad-based expansion in private sector services, but held back by weakness in both manufacturing and construction in the third quarter,\u201d he said. The Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, is estimating that GDP will grow 2.4% both this year and next.",

    "webTitle": "Black Friday: UK shoppers stay calm, but websites buckle under pressure", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A year ago the Black Friday discount shopping event prompted mini-riots at some stores, requiring police intervention. This year, in the UK at least, the day was more about mince pies, Christmas music and shopping from the sofa. While brawls broke out in US shopping malls and the discount day concept appeared to have reached mainland Europe, ultra-cautious British retailers fended off the chaotic scenes of last year with later opening times, a heavy security presence and price-cutting deals spread over several days. However, with demand soaring, a number of retail websites struggled to cope with the volume of traffic. Argos, Tesco, John Lewis and Boots all had difficulties at some point during the day. John Lewis apologised to customers for the problems which happened despite it increasing capacity on its website by a third compared with last year. Retail analysts still expect Friday to be Britain\u2019s biggest-ever shopping day, with consumers set to spend as much as \u00a32bn online and in stores. That\u2019s equivalent to \u00a31.4m every minute. Last year, British shoppers spent \u00a31.75bn, according to Visa. But in the early hours of the morning there were only small queues outside some stores around the country as poor weather and fear of disturbances put people off. Many shoppers chose to look for bargains onlinerather than on the high street. British shoppers spent 52% more online on Friday morning than they did in 2014 according to payment processing firm Worldpay - as people tried to grab a deal before work. Online electrical goods retailer AO.com said it had already rung up double last year\u2019s Black Friday\u2019s sales by 9am. It had nearly sold out of TV sets by lunchtime. Clothing and homewares website Very.co.uk said it had welcomed 60% more visitors than last year with 10am its busiest time of day. Currys PC World, which had bought in 40% more stock compared with Black Friday last year, said it booked 30 times as many orders in the morning as the same time a week before. Argos said its website had received 6.5m visits by mid afternoon - equivalent to a tenth of the UK\u2019s population. While many websites were busy as soon as their deals went online at midnight, it was a different picture on British high streets. A huddle of keen gamers queued for several hours to buy a PS4 at Game in Manchester\u2019s Arndale centre late on Thursday evening, but only journalists were present when the flagship Boots store on London\u2019s Oxford Street opened its doors at midnight. Lindsay Stewart, senior sales assistant at Baby Game in Manchester, said: \u201cWe expected it to be busier than it has been but everyone has been able to get what they want. It\u2019s been good.\u201d Most retailers on Oxford Street did not open their doors before 8am and the street was quiet, with more TV crews around than shoppers in the early morning drizzle. Kevin was the only person queuing outside John Lewis at 6am: \u201cI want a laptop. I thought there\u2019d be loads of people here,\u201d he said. At Tesco\u2019s Lea Valley supermarket in north London, which opened at 5am, there were roughly 50 people in the queue when its doors opened. The shop was far quieter than last year\u2019s Black Friday sales, when it opened at midnight and police and paramedics were called. This year there was a heavy security presence and Tesco used an orderly queuing system which let between 10 and 20 people into the store at a time. A police van sat by the main entrance, but the four officers never left the vehicle. \u201cWe are just trying to keep it calm and look after staff and customers,\u201d Rebecca Rabadia, the store manager said. For bargain-hungry shoppers there was a mixture of delight and frustration. John Nash, from Enfield, north London,was looking for Christmas presents for his grandchildren but walked away instead with a \u00a3100 TV. He said: \u201cLast year was much better. This year there were less deals. You could get lost in stuff last year. \u201cThere is a lot of security, it has to be to protect the public. I like that. There were a lot of fights last time.\u201d Staff from nearby Tesco stores were drafted in to provide support, with mince pies served to customers and Christmas music playing out over the Tannoy system. But some ordinary shoppers were frustrated as only those interested in Black Friday deals were allowed entry to a single aisle between 5am and 7am while the rest of the store was closed. \u201cI just wanted to buy a sandwich, but they won\u2019t let me until 7am,\u201d one shopper said. Analysts suggested the lacklustre response to early morning openings was likely to mean more retailers would follow the lead of supermarket chain Asda and scale back their Black Friday plans in stores next year. Bryan Roberts from analysis firm Kantar said retailers would be disappointed by the turnout after spending money on extra security and longer staff hours. \u201cFor food, fashion and footwear retailers Black Friday seems to be seriously disruptive with very little reward,\u201d he said. Richard Cristofoli, marketing director of Debenhams, said he was expecting the day to deliver 10 times the sales of a regular Friday with 3 million visitors to its website. The department store\u2019s Oxford Street branch had 400 more staff working than on a normal day and drafted in some head office managers to work the shop floor at key times. While there was no queue outside in the early morning, Cristofoli said he was not concerned and still expected to ring up more sales than last year. \u201cThis store builds into lunchtime and the evening is when it really takes off,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year we were open until 10pm and this year we\u2019ll be open until 11.\u201d",

John Lewis apologised to customers for the problems which happened despite it increasing capacity on its website by a third compared with last year.</p> <p>Retail analysts still expect Friday to be <a href=\"http://%20http//www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/20/will-black-friday-break-all-uk-retail-records\">Britain\u2019s biggest-ever shopping day, with consumers set to spend as much as \u00a32bn online and in stores</a>. That\u2019s equivalent to \u00a31.4m every minute. Last year, British shoppers spent \u00a31.75bn, according to Visa.</p> <p>But in the early hours of the morning there were only small queues outside some stores around the country as poor weather and fear of disturbances put people off. Many shoppers chose to look for bargains onlinerather than on the high street.</p> <p>British shoppers spent 52% more online on Friday morning than they did in 2014 according to payment processing firm Worldpay - as people tried to grab a deal before work.</p> <p>Online electrical goods retailer AO.com said it had already rung up double last year\u2019s Black Friday\u2019s sales by 9am. It had nearly sold out of TV sets by lunchtime. Clothing and homewares website Very.co.uk said it had welcomed 60% more visitors than last year with 10am its busiest time of day. Currys PC World, which had bought in 40% more stock compared with Black Friday last year, said it booked 30 times as many orders in the morning as the same time a week before.</p> <p>Argos said its website had received 6.5m visits by mid afternoon - equivalent to a tenth of the UK\u2019s population. </p> <p>While many websites were busy as soon as their deals went online at midnight, it was a different picture on British high streets. A huddle of keen gamers queued for several hours to buy a PS4 at Game in Manchester\u2019s Arndale centre late on Thursday evening, but only journalists were present when the flagship Boots store on London\u2019s Oxford Street opened its doors at midnight.</p> <p>Lindsay Stewart, senior sales assistant at Baby Game in Manchester, said: \u201cWe expected it to be busier than it has been but everyone has been able to get what they want. It\u2019s been good.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/nov/27/black-friday-calm-start-uk-tesco-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4etbv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2414745\"            data-video-name=\"Black Friday gets off to a calm start across the UK \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SWNS\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/27/1448622139244/KP_616622_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56583845e4b02121560a9c77\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/27/1448622139244/KP_616622_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/27/151127BlackFridayUK_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/27/151127BlackFridayUK_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/27/151127BlackFridayUK_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/27/151127BlackFridayUK.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/27/151127BlackFridayUK_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Shoppers in Elgin, Dundee and Sheffield on the hunt for Black Friday bargains.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Most retailers on Oxford Street did not open their doors before 8am and the street was quiet, with more TV crews around than shoppers in the early morning drizzle. Kevin was the only person queuing outside John Lewis at 6am: \u201cI want a laptop. I thought there\u2019d be loads of people here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At Tesco\u2019s Lea Valley supermarket in north London, which opened at 5am, there were roughly 50 people in the queue when its doors opened. The shop was far quieter than last year\u2019s Black Friday sales, when it opened at midnight and police and paramedics were called. </p> <p>This year there was a heavy security presence and Tesco used an orderly queuing system which let between 10 and 20 people into the store at a time. A police van sat by the main entrance, but the four officers never left the vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just trying to keep it calm and look after staff and customers,\u201d Rebecca Rabadia, the store manager said.</p> <p>For bargain-hungry shoppers there was a mixture of delight and frustration. John Nash, from Enfield, north London,was looking for Christmas presents for his grandchildren but walked away instead with a \u00a3100 TV. </p> <p>He said: \u201cLast year was much better. This year there were less deals. You could get lost in stuff last year.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of security, it has to be to protect the public. I like that. There were a lot of fights last time.\u201d</p> <p>Staff from nearby Tesco stores were drafted in to provide support, with mince pies served to customers and Christmas music playing out over the Tannoy system.</p> <p>But some ordinary shoppers were frustrated as only those interested in Black Friday deals were allowed entry to a single aisle between 5am and 7am while the rest of the store was closed. \u201cI just wanted to buy a sandwich, but they won\u2019t let me until 7am,\u201d one shopper said.</p> <p>Analysts suggested the lacklustre response to early morning openings was likely to mean more retailers would follow the lead of supermarket chain Asda and scale back their Black Friday plans in stores next year.</p> <p>Bryan Roberts from analysis firm Kantar said retailers would be disappointed by the turnout after spending money on extra security and longer staff hours. \u201cFor food, fashion and footwear retailers Black Friday seems to be seriously disruptive with very little reward,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Richard Cristofoli, marketing director of Debenhams, said he was expecting the day to deliver 10 times the sales of a regular Friday with 3 million visitors to its website. </p> <p>The department store\u2019s Oxford Street branch had 400 more staff working than on a normal day and drafted in some head office managers to work the shop floor at key times.</p> <p>While there was no queue outside in the early morning, Cristofoli said he was not concerned and still expected to ring up more sales than last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis store builds into lunchtime and the evening is when it really takes off,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year we were open until 10pm and this year we\u2019ll be open until 11.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p><br><br></p>",

The settlement relates to undisclosed alleged wrongdoing dating from 2012-13, the South African lender said in a statement to investors. Both the SFO and ICBC Standard Bank will ask a UK judge to approve the settlement. The SFO insisted that full details of the facts of the case and the terms of the settlement would be set out in open court on Monday. The approval from Lord Justice Leveson is expected to be a formality as he has already agreed to it in principle during an earlier hearing that took place in private. Under the previous SFO director Richard Alderman, prosecutors had struck deals behind closed doors with corporate defendants. These deals, known as civil settlements, were criticised for being too weak and for allowing companies to keep evidence of wrongdoing from the public eye. Deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) were introduced in February last year. They allow prosecutors to suspended a prosecution for an agreed period of time, and then withdraw it. In exchange, companies must pay a fine, repay related profits and assist in the prosecution of any individuals. Standard Bank Group told investors any agreed payment is not expected to exceed $40m. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China took a 60% controlling stake in the London division in February this year, though it agreed any penalty relating to matters under SFO investigation would be borne by the South African lender. The SFO has said it expects to have secured a second DPA by the end of the year. It is currently investigating an unprecedented number of large, stock market-listed companies, including Tesco, Barclays and Rolls-Royce, some of which are reportedly exploring DPA options.",

      "bodyText": "Every time the latest GDP figures appear, the Treasury would have us use the occasion to look at the sunny image of the economy in the round. The third quarter data indeed confirms that the economy is on track to grow by 2.4% this year and many City economists have pencilled in 2.5% next year. Even the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), reckoned a cautious forecaster, has picked 2.4% as the most-likely growth rate. There is little doubt that every member of the eurozone would gladly hand over another slice of sovereignty in exchange for such stellar growth. But a more detailed look presents a different picture: a two-speed economy, with the services sector pushing ahead while manufacturing industry continues its long, slow slide. The struggle to sell abroad seems to have been the main drag on factory output in the last quarter, although one quarter does not make a trend and the export figures have proved hugely volatile over the past 18 months. But what we can say is that manufacturing has been struggling since the summer of 2014 and the wild swings in export performance have probably played a part. Exporters hate volatility and none more so than manufacturers. They rightly say that investment is a long-term commitment. With a government determined to retrenching and leaving the private sector to fend for itself, R&amp;D and capital spending budgets are likely to be cut. Business lobby groups have blamed the 12% rise in the trade-weighted value of the pound over the past year and near 20% appreciation against the euro. It must have an effect, they say. The Bank of England\u2019s repeated warnings over the past year of looming interest rate rises will also have dissuaded manufacturers from investing. Not so much because it will increase the cost of credit, but for the simple reason that it will further push up the value of sterling. The recent volte face indicating that interest rates will probably not rise until well into next year has not removed the threat, but instead added to the uncertainty. Meanwhile, the services sector grew robustly with the help of consumers who are simultaneously increasing their borrowing and running down their savings. Most Bank policymakers will take growth in any form, rather than argue over the balance between making things and buying them. In their regulatory role, they plan to limit the rush to easy credit. Not by too much, though. A large rise in household borrowing underpins the UK recovery, according to the OBR. Government spending is also due to play a stronger role in supporting growth over the next three years after George Osborne relaxed his plans to chop tax credits and slash Whitehall budgets. Most of his spending cuts are still in place, leading anti-poverty campaigners to maintain their anti-austerity protests. But credit ratings agency Fitch was unnerved. It warned that Osborne would be less able to cushion the economy from a further global downturn now he planned to spend the gains from higher growth before it had even arrived. \u201cDebt reduction is increasingly being driven by growth and revenue trends, which could reverse if growth slows or revenue forecasts are revised back down,\u201d the agency said. So it seems that six years after the recession, the economy is still unable to survive without ultra low interest rates, soaring household borrowing and a government running a sizeable funding deficit. Expect the economy to become ever more unbalanced.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re bringing this live blog to a close now, though the reason is certainly not to ensure its authors can catch the few hours of Black Friday sales. Thanks for all your comments and tweets. America, the ancestral home of Black Friday, is now in full swing at the sales. Shops across the pond also seem quieter than usual, but there are big queues at some out of town malls and discount stores. It\u2019s expected 135m Americans will shop this Black Friday weekend, according to the National Retail Federation. There have been conflicting tactics from retailers this year about whether to embrace Black Friday, says Andrew Lewis, a senior lecturer in retail operations at Manchester Metropolitan University Retailers such as Aldi and Lidl are not jumping on the Black Friday bandwagon, retailers such as Asda [cancelled] their event this week and John Lewis has prevented their staff from receiving their staff discounts on Black Friday website items. However, there have been some interesting macro factors that are shaping consumers\u2019 spending confidence. George Osborne announced a U-turn on tax credits in his spending review, unemployment falls to a seven-year low, an increase in real wages, a flat rate of inflation culminating in low mortgage rates and excellent credit card deals. Retailers have extended the event to incorporate a week of deals such as Very and Currys suggesting that consumers have greater spending confidence than in 2014. The continued rise in smartphones usage makes it even easier to shop on the go, as illustrated by the latest PayPal television advertisement. The BRC\u2019s prediction of breaking the \u00a31bn barrier could well come true. Van rental firm Hertz report they are seeing a 20% increase on van rentals contrasted with a normal Friday, which they have put down to shoppers hiring bigger vehicles to take large purchases home from the sales. Many journalists and brands have attempted to subvert Black Friday and failed, so comrades at Vice\u2019s Motherboard site decided the best tactic may just be to be as blatant as possible. As blatant as taking all the key Google search terms for Thanksgiving and Black Friday, as well as the names of the most popular items and retailers, and splice them into a post of the Communist Manifesto. Shopping centres are looking a little busier now, with these pictures just in from the Bull Ring in Birmingham and the West Quay shopping centre in Southampton. It may be far quieter on the streets, but that\u2019s because most shoppers are staying on their sofas - this Black Friday is set to become the biggest online shopping day in UK history, according to retail analysts Experian-IMRG. The group predicts spending online will top \u00a31.07bn, a 32% increase on the \u00a3810 million spent last year. Some of the promotional tweets today really are proving you can get pretty much anything in a Black Friday sale, from an adopted kitten to curried goat. The streets of Madrid are far from chaotic but there are signs in the shop windows with slogans about \u2018Black Friday\u2019 and hopeful shoppers looking to get a bargain, as the sales day grows more popular in Spain. El Mundo has published a list this year of where Spanish shoppers can find the best bargains The Argos website continues to struggle, the Press Association reports, with pages taking almost four seconds to load during the hour to 1pm. The entire site remained unavailable at least 20% of the time. Websites which have shown consistently good performance so far include Amazon, John Lewis and Boots, all of which have been available online for 100% of Black Friday. Both Debenhams and Tesco have improved on their earlier difficulties. Between 12pm and 1pm, Debenhams\u2019 speed was down to 0.8 seconds and Tesco\u2019s stood at 0.9 seconds. A spokesman for Tesco told the Press Association its site was \u201cfully operational and we are happy with the number of orders received so far\u201d. Some good news for the high street. While it may have been quiet this morning, traders are reporting that footfall is picking up. In the West End, the number of visitors is up 10% compared to Black Friday last year in the first four hours of trading apparently. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said: There is a terrific atmosphere on the streets, with shoppers enjoying the first discounts of the season in an unashamedly festive setting. I have seen people bringing suitcases with them in order to carry their purchases home\u2013 and with retailers offering discounts of up to 50% off, it is no surprise that a predicted \u00a3100m will be taken in West End tills today and a total of \u00a3200m from Friday to Sunday. In light of the footfall figures we have seen so far, we look set to be on course for the busiest trading day in London\u2019s West End so far this year.\u201d In the US, where the shopping is just getting started, an insight into the Black Friday traditions... Here is another video of what it was like inside Tesco stores this morning at 5am when they opened. This is the Lea Valley store in North London. Police were called here last year, bit different this time.. Here is an empty shopping mall in Brooklyn This is interesting. It is not just the UK where the Black Friday crowds have gone missing, this is the latest from the US So, what are most the popular purchases on Black Friday? Well, according to Very.co.uk, the top search on its website is \u201cconsoles\u201d followed by \u201ctv\u201d. This is a trend echoed by Currys PC World, which is shifting an extraordinary 30 televisions every minute online. Another popular purchase is hair curlers, with lots of Tesco customers walking away from its stores with the beauty product Here is our news story on Black Friday so far, including some comments from shoppers who braved the cold to queue for the opening of Tesco stores at 5am Westfield, owner of two major shopping centres in London, still believes Black Friday will be a strong day of trading in physical stores. However, they are being a bit coy on exact figures. Myf Ryan, Westfield director, said: Last year, Black Friday cemented itself in the UK festive calendar for both shoppers and retailers. At Westfield, we saw nearly 300,000 people pass through our doors and we expect similar record numbers of visitors this year as shoppers take advantage of the special deals on offer. Black Friday is quickly becoming a marker of the start of Christmas shopping in the UK, with many people using the weekend to get ahead with their purchasing.\u201d The Argos website is coming in for criticism about how slowly it is running, but the company insists it is doing what it can. A spokesman for Home Retail Group, owner of Argos, said: We are actively managing the flow of traffic through our website which is at extremely high levels right now and we have processes in place to ensure all customers can complete their transactions. We are very sorry if some customers are experiencing delays as a result. Lots of successful orders are being placed so we ask them to please bear with us and keep trying.\u201d As a reminder, retail analysts are forecasting that as much as \u00a32bn could be spent online and in stores today, which would be a record. This works out as \u00a383m every hour, \u00a31.4m every minute and more than \u00a323,000 every second. Crazy. There was an early peak in spending between midnight and 1am as shoppers logged on to websites to hunt for deals, but high street stores believe their busiest period could come later in the day Where are all the shoppers? This is the Trafford Centre in Manchester Bryan Roberts, analyst at Kantar Retail, has some interesting views on the slow start to Black Friday on the high street: TV crews outnumbered shoppers on London\u2019s Oxford Street, while many stores that we visited were virtually deserted. Only electricals retailer Currys and a couple of department stores were showing any signs of incremental business. If observations on social media are to be believed, it also appears that participating supermarkets such as Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s were not exactly rushed off their feet during early trading. A couple of retailers, including Debenhams, have asserted that they are anticipating a decent uptick in shoppers after people finish work, but it remains to be seen if this more of an optimistic wish rather than a scientific forecast.\u201d Talking of Asda, while they may not be offering deals on electrical items on Black Friday, they have knocked four pence off a litre of fuel across its 277 petrol stations for three days. Drivers can expect to pay 99.7ppl on unleaded and 103.7ppl on diesel. On Monday, Asda will revert back to its original price of 103.7ppl on unleaded and 106.7 ppl on diesel. Given the costs to retailers of bringing in security and the police to watch over stores on Black Friday, the photos showing how quiet everywhere is begs the question as to whether it is really worth it. There are also examples of shoppers complaining that they can\u2019t buy grocery items while the Black Friday promotions are going on. Asda, Britain\u2019s third biggest supermarket, has scrapped its Black Friday promotions this year, and more could follow.... This shows the quiet start to Black Friday on Oxford Street. Evidence suggests that shoppers are focusing their spending online this year We now have some videos that show the \u201ccalm\u201d start to Black Friday. This video is from Tesco stores in Scotland and Sheffield.... One of the UK\u2019s biggest online retailers, AO.com, says that as of 9am its Black Friday sales are double what they were at the same time last year. AO.com is offering some big discounts on televisions, fridges, and other kitchen appliances. John Roberts, the boss of AO.com, who is never short of a word or two, says: We are having a fantastic Black Friday so far. It looks like online has definitely been the winner this morning as we\u2019ve seen lots of existing and new customers choosing to get their knock out deals online to avoid the fear of getting knocked out in-store. At 9am sales were double those we saw at the same time last year, with food preparation appliances and TV deals flying out the door.\u201d There is a major security presence at supermarkets after police heavily criticised retailers for their lack of preparation last year. This is Tesco Lea Valley, which also had a police van outside. There were about 50 people in the queue when Tesco opened in Lea Valley, way down on the crowds of last year. This was partly down to the 5am opening time We\u2019ve got some photos of some bargain-hunters at Tesco in Lea Valley in North London this morning. Police were called to this supermarket last year, but it was more serene on opening this time So is the lack of queues at high street stores a sign that Black Friday is dead in the UK? Some interesting analysis now starting to come through about what is actually going on. Basically, the answer is no, it\u2019s not dead. Rather, retailers have been ultra-cautious in their planning to avoid a repeat of last year, and shoppers are buying online instead. If I was a betting man, I would say today is still likely to be the biggest ever shopping day in Britain. Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says: Stores were caught unaware last year and are likely to have made much better preparations this year. Additionally, shoppers may also be wary after last year\u2019s excesses and many are becoming more inured to holiday season sales. There is an awareness now that Black Friday runs through until Cyber Monday and, even after this, there are plenty of shopping dates like Super/Panic Saturday and Manic Monday to choose from. Stores are also spreading sales out too. Amazon began its Black Market sales a week before Black Friday and offers daily flash deals anyway. \u201cThought for the Day on Radio 4 this morning warned me against the rampant consumerism of Black Friday,\u201d writes independent City analyst Louise Cooper. But I fear I am already tempted. Rather than buying a second hand bike for my son on Ebay, I almost got the credit card out to buy a new Black Friday one. But a little investigation showed that the deal was not quite as good as initially it appeared (nothing new there).\u201d Talking more generally about the outlook for the high street, she says: I expect this year to be the first really good year for retailers. That\u2019s because wages are rising (at 3%) a lot faster than inflation (which is flat at zero percent). This is the first year this has happened since the start of the crisis. Britons have money to spend and are finally feeling the recovery in their pockets. However there remains massive pricing pressure. And game theory ensures that once one retailer begins to discount, almost all others have to, to avoid losing revenue.\u201d In Ipswich, trade wasn\u2019t as brisk as last year soon after shops opened. Rebecca Smithers reports: In the first half hour of trading, business in this popular Currys PC World store (which also houses sister company Carphone Warehouse) was steady if unremarkable. The customers \u2013 predominantly men \u2013 were attracted like magnets to the TV section \u2013 where staffing levels have been beefed up (to a total of 60) after the retailer was caught out last year by shoppers\u2019 enthusiasm for Black Friday offers. Not only did both its websites crash, but it was also unable to guarantee next day delivery on online orders. Strategically placed at the front of the store, lined up like plastic-clad soldiers though being ignored by shoppers - are ranks of Hotpoint washing machines, with the normal price of \u00a3379.99 slashed to \u00a3239.99. An early shopper, who knew exactly what he wanted, was Paul Roche of Eye in Suffolk, who had already visited the nearby Tesco Extra which had opened an hour earlier \u2013 in pitch blackness - at 5am. Brandishing his ticket which Tesco is handing out to restrict numbers, he said: \u201cI had a quick look round but what I wanted was here and I\u2019m very happy.\u201d Pointing to the box in the back of his car, he said: \u201cI got a LG soundbar for my LG TV, which I bought here a few months ago, and it was down to \u00a3129 for \u00a3220. That will be a nice little boost for our Christmas TV watching.\u201d Currys PC World has predicted that this Black Friday will be even bigger than last year [see previous post]. But in Ipswich things were not as busy as last year soon after opening. Rebecca writes: Staff \u2013 many rubbing their eyes - seemed to outnumber customers, but were approaching every one and offering their help. Charlotte Lemon, team leader, said: \u201cLast year we opened at 9am and it was much busier than today. Last year we didn\u2019t have enough staff on the TV section \u2013 only two \u2013 but today we have six and that seems to have paid off so far.\u201d Currys PC World says it has seen a strong start to its Black Friday sale: Eight sales per second 30 TVs per minute selling online Yesterday\u2019s website traffic almost as high as Boxing Day last year Seven million visitors to the site this week alone Peak in mobile traffic as deals went live at 6am The retailer says that since the Black Friday deals went live online, the \u00a330 off Apple iPads deal proved particularly popular, with the Dyson V6 Animal Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (\u00a3239, down from \u00a3349.99) and the Samsung Ultra HD 4K 43 inch TV (\u00a3399, down from \u00a3549) also going down well with shoppers. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb has sent us his thoughts on Black Friday: Well, it looks as if Black Friday spending has been more spread out this year and more weighted to online, but every indication is that the combined event will be bigger than last year overall. However, as that will merely represent spending sucked forward from December, it is too soon to say whether the retail sector will be any better off in net terms once the dust settles...\u201d On the roads around Britain\u2019s biggest shopping centres, congestion levels increased by nearly a quarter this morning, according to traffic analysts INRIX. It said the peak this morning was between 7am and 8am, when levels of congestion were 33% higher than last Friday, as eager bargain hunters added to the regular rush hour commute (despite anecdotal evidence that Black Friday got off to a quieter start than last year). Bryan Roberts, analyst at Kantar Retail, has been to the shops. The Carphone Warehouse website is holding up well, says chief executive Sebastian James. Sir Charles Dunstone, co-founder and chairman of the mobile phone company, has been spotted in its Currys PC World store in Bury St Edmunds. The Boots and Game websites have also been crashing, according to a live tracker by commerce agency Ampersand. Boots later said that its website had NOT crashed. Darryl Adie, managing director of Ampersand, says: Ever-extending sales periods like this are notoriously hard to predict. Retailers should immediately delve deep into hour-by-hour analytics reporting and cross check with how and when systems outages occurred. Starting load and performance testing right away will give retailers the best chance of avoiding outages next year.\u201c As shoppers are going online to pick up Black Friday bargains, most websites appear to be working ok, for now. Of the big retailers, Argos is struggling to keep up with demand on its website, according to Capacitas, a firm that monitors (and claims to help prevent) website crashes. The Argos website has struggled from the start, and is taking a long time to load and has gone down several times. Tesco also appears to have some trouble managing the load of bargain hunters. Although page load times are good, researchers from Capacitas have begun to see errors whilst shopping on the website. You can compare load times for 11 websites Aand read the analysis here. The Debenhams marketing director Richard Cristofoli expects a late rush after people leave work tonight, as Sarah Butler reports. Christofoli at Debenhams said he expected the rush on Oxford Street to come at the end of the day after people finish work. The store will stay open until 11pm tonight, an hour later than last year when it found it had to escort people out of the door at 10pm. He says every store has its trading patterns but Oxford Street tends to take off later in the day than other store building up from lunchtime.\u201d Black Friday appears to be a quiet affair in Dublin too. Many shoppers appear to have chosen to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than venture out into the rain. Following last year\u2019s shambolic scenes when fights broke out between bargain hunters, retailers have opened later, laid on extra security and introduced queuing systems. Retail analysts are predicting today will be Britain\u2019s biggest-ever shopping day, with consumers set to spend as much as \u00a32bn. My colleague Rebecca Smithers reports from Ipswich: Quite lively at Currys/PC World and chatted to lots of customers, though staff said quieter than last year. Absolutely dead at Argos and Sainsbury\u2019s didn\u2019t open till 8am...\u201d Here is Graham Ruddick\u2019s report in full. If you want to protest against Black Friday\u2019s rampant consumerism, Friday is also Buy Nothing Day, as reported earlier. Some 36,000 people have said they were taking part in Buy Nothing Friday on Facebook, with another 15,000 interested. There are other alternatives offered by some retailers. A new UK charity called Shop4Charity is taking part in the US-inspired shopping day(s). Every time someone makes a purchase, some of the proceeds go to the causes it is involved with, such as Delete Blood Cancer. Shop4Charity was founded by Adam Maddock who lost his sister to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia. Its Black Friday deals include a Casio Analog-digital black tele-memo world time 100M WR watch for \u00a343.99, a large Disney Frozen Adventure book at \u00a313.56 and a Minions Courier Bag at \u00a312.79. At fashion chain Fat Face, today is \u201cthanks for giving\u201d day, while ethical brands Traidcraft and People Tree are telling their shoppers it\u2019s \u201cJust Friday\u201d and independent booksellers are promising that Saturday will be \u201cCivilised Saturday\u201d. Sarah Butler has more on charitable alternatives to the shopping frenzy. Harsh and Sweet is offering a 20% off on its eco-friendly jewellery. Enter BLACKFRIDAY at checkout. US online clothing company Everlane is also taking a different approach. Instead of running a Black Friday sale, the firm is giving its profits to the workers who sew T-shirts in its LA factory. More here. Sarah Butler is behind the scenes at Debenhams in Oxford Street, where staff are preparing for the store opening. My colleague Graham Ruddick is reporting from Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s in north London. Following last year\u2019s mayhem, Tesco decided to open its Extra stores across the country at 5am rather than at midnight as in 2014 and stepped up security. He writes: A year ago there were mini-riots and the police were called, this year there was mince pies, Christmas music, and some disappointed shoppers. An ultra-cautious approach by Tesco to the Black Friday sales has helped to avoid the chaotic scenes of last year, and dampened demand for discounts among keen shoppers. At Tesco\u2019s Lea Valley supermarket in North London, there was a heavy security presence, a 5am opening time, and an orderly queuing system that saw between 10 and 20 people let into the store at a time. A police van stood by the main entrance in case of any trouble, but the four officers never left their seats. There was a mixture of delight and frustration among bargain-hungry shoppers. John Nash, from Enfield, who was looking for Christmas presents for his grandchildren and walked away with a \u00a3100 television, said: \u201cLast year was much better. This year there were less deals. You could get lost in stuff last year. There is a lot of security, it has to be to protect the public. I like that. There were a lot of fights last time. It\u2019s better letting in ten people at a time.\u201d However, Figen Akgul from Tottenham and here family ended up spending \u00a3600 on items including a Dyson vacuum cleaner, haircurler, and microwave. \u201cI think we saved 70%,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest with you we just came to see what was here. Last year we just stumbled across it and there were riots. This year they have done well, only letting 20 people in at a time.\u201d The best deals, such as a PlayStation 4 for \u00a3249 and a \u00a334 tablet, were only offered behind a counter where customers had to wait to be served, ensuring the manic scenes of a year ago were not repeated. There were similar scenes at a nearby Sainsbury\u2019s, where there was more security outside than customers.\u201d People have always loved a good bargain, as this video Sale Time at Selfridges (1970) demonstrates. It\u2019s a similar picture at Debenhams on Oxford Street. I guess people don\u2019t like getting up early, and the rain isn\u2019t helping. An update on the latest deals: Gap is offering 40% off full-price styles online until Sunday (with the code FRIDAYGAP) and 50% off some items in stores until Saturday. Graham Ruddick has moved on to Sainsbury\u2019s at Harringay Green Lanes. As at Tesco, it\u2019s quieter than last year, and all very orderly, he says. My colleague Sarah Butler is on Oxford Street where she has found one person waiting outside John Lewis: So far, so calm, it seems. Press Association reports things got off to a slow start on Oxford Street this morning: The Boots flagship store on Sedley Place was one of a handful of shops which opened extra early, advertising deals on huge posters by the shop entrance. But the doors flung open to two waiting journalists and no customers. Elsewhere Norfolk Police were on site at Blue Boar Tesco in Norwich in case of trouble, but the queue of around 18 people moved slowly and politely through the doors as they opened up. The scene at Surrey Quays Tesco was more calm than last year, when police were called to reports of arguments breaking out. Around 30 people waited in the queue before making their way into the store as security guards looked on. Entrance to Tesco\u2019s Western Avenue store in Cardiff was limited to 10 people at a time, as people waited in the rain. The 100-strong queue at Tesco Extra in Kingston Park, Newcastle upon Tyne were assured the store had plenty of stock, as the shutters were raised at 5am. But there are some happy shoppers out there, says Graham Ruddick. Deals at Tesco\u2019s shops include \u00a350 off Dyson hoovers and 49 inch TVs for \u00a3199. And free festive snacks and entertainment. Branches of Tesco are opening, and it looks like the number of people being allowed into shops is being strictly limited. My colleague Graham Ruddick is in north London at the Lea valley branch: Jim Durkin of the Bournemouth Echo has tweeted: People are queueing outside some branches of Tesco An idea of what they can expect in the shops: In the UK, Tesco is due to open some of its large stores in about 10 minutes. If you are planning some shopping today on the high street or at a supermarket, remember if you panic buy something you later think better of, you might not be able to take it back. Retailers are only obliged to give you and exchange or a refund if something is faulty, not if you just change your mind. Some do allow people to return goods they simply don\u2019t want, but not always sales items - check what the policy is before you pay. Some of the stuff in the shops is ordered just for sales - these things are often marked \u201cspecial purchase\u201d or similar. Bear in mind that they might not be as good a deal as they first look. How much do you love a bargain? Is it as much as this man, Jarvis Johnson? He camped out since Sunday to buy 49\u201d TVs for $149. He\u2019s already got a lot of mod cons, as he showed a reporter on Fox 10: You can see it here. In the end, he bought five. He says it was worth it. Although Black Friday is seen by many as harmless fun there are plenty of reminders that things can turn sour. The New York Daily News has put together a list of some really dreadful things that have happened on previous Black Fridays, including the death of a shop worker in a stampede in 2013. In the UK, a survey by shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw found half of staff were abused last year and 10% were attacked. Black Friday definitely has an ugly side. For those who don\u2019t just want to avoid Black Friday but actively protest against consumerism, Friday is also Buy Nothing Day. As well as keeping your wallet closed all day, the campaign has produced a poster you can display and suggests people organise free events to celebrate. On Thursday, Michelle McGagh wrote about how she was planning to stop spending for a whole year: I\u2019m not the first person to attempt this. There is a growing movement of people who are turning their back on consumerism and purchasing possessions in favour of buying experiences and travelling the world. In the US, the Minimalists have encouraged people to live with less, while in Canada Cait Flanders \u2013 who blogs at Blonde on a Budget \u2013 transformed her finances with a shopping ban. In the UK, Kath Kelly lived on just \u00a31 a day for a year in order to buy her brother a lavish wedding gift. These people have encouraged me to look at what I consume and take control of my money, as well as given me hope that a spending ban won\u2019t mean a year sat indoors. They didn\u2019t live like hermits for a year, they found new ways to entertain themselves, pushed themselves out of their comfort zones and enhanced their lives. Reuters says crowds to brick-and-mortar shops in the US have been subdued, although online sales have jumped. It quoted Craig Johnson, president of analysts Customer Growth Partners: \u201cIt\u2019s still early, and from what we are seeing so far the crowds are good but not great.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that there haven\u2019t been queues - or that some things haven\u2019t flown off the shelves, as the following tweets show. And more bargain bears (don\u2019t worry, he doesn\u2019t get left there): In New York, Jana Kasperkevic has braved Toys R Us, where shoppers were taking advantage of deals on Lego and other favourites: For some families, shopping after Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday evening or Friday morning is a family tradition. There is no place where that is more evident than Toys R Us in New York city\u2019s Time Square. Despite security analysts saying earlier today on CNN that the area is a soft target for future terrorist attacks, the streets were full of tourists and shopped at 8pm local time. Inside Toys R Us shoppers hurried, some pushing strollers, some dragging their offspring by hand and others on a mission without their children, determined to buy their Christmas presents without them. Also among the crowd were dancers from the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade, wearing sweatshirts with names of their dance teams, groups and marching bands. The line for the cash register on the ground floor was about 10 people long at most times. And while it seemed that no many left the store empty handed, some of the youngest shoppers did not get the things they wanted and they were sure to let everyone know by crying at the top of their lungs. Some more photos from Macy\u2019s flagship store in New York, showing just how many shoppers were out and about on Thursday evening. Despite the late hour, it seems there must be people shopping for bargains online as the Tesco website is stumbling occasionally. My colleague Dan Thompson says that the shops that were open in Manchester tonight were quieter than expected: It\u2019s all gone quiet in Manchester - with the early Black Friday rush over. The only shops offering deals in the city centre on Thursday evening were two branches of Game in the Arndale centre. While around 100 shoppers queued to get into the stores ahead of their 9pm opening times, both were largely deserted by 1am. Lindsay Stewart, senior sales assistant at Baby Game, said: \u201cWe expected it to be busier than it has been but everyone has been able to get what they want. It\u2019s been good.\u201d She said the most popular deal was the PS4 FIFA 16 bundle for \u00a3299.99 - a saving of \u00a3100. Stewart added: \u201cThis year it\u2019s cheap and a better choice of games.\u201d The next Manchester shops to open offering Black Friday savings are the Tesco Extra supermarkets in Stretford and Gorton at 5am. Some more deals have gone live, including what might be one of the most unusual over at Amazon, where you can save \u00a35 on Psychedelic Salad Kit. Tesco\u2019s site is up and running, and deals include: \u00a3300 off a Bosch bean to cup coffee maker with milk frother, now at \u00a3399.99 \u00a360 off an Apple iPad Air 16GB WiFi, now at \u00a3259.99 \u00a350 off a Dyson DC34 handheld vacuum cleaner, now at \u00a399 Middle England\u2019s favourite retailer has reported \u201ca solid week\u2019s trading\u201d, with total sales up 2.6% on the same week in 2014 at \u00a3117.2m. Week-on-week sales were up 6.2%. The growth has been driven by the cold snap, with shoppers suddenly dashing out to buy coats and jumpers: sales of mens outerwear leapt by 16.6%, while sales of winter boots jumped by 24.7% and casualwear was up by 23.9%. \u201cThere were clear signs that shoppers were planning ahead for Black Friday discounts,\u201d the retailer said. \u201cDemand for televisions and computers was lower during the week with customers anticipating Black Friday offers.\u201d The store is price matching other retailers offers. Among the offers now online are: \u00a330 off an Amazon Fire Kids Edition 7 tablet, now at \u00a369.95 \u00a3300 off a Samsung RSG5UURS American-style fridge freezer, now at \u00a3999 \u00a340 off Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay H2 on-ear headphones, now at \u00a3169 Argos has effectively closed its online shop until 1am: Its website has crashed several times over the past few weeks as it has launched different rounds of deals. Will enough people still be awake to bring it down tonight? To New York, where Jana Kasperkevic has been to Macy\u2019s. The store, which was founded back in 1858, sponsors the city\u2019s annual thanksgiving parade (commonly known as Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade). Up until 2013, it used to open up early morning on Black Friday, but in November 2013, it opened its doors on Thanksgiving at 8pm, then last year it moved that forward to 6pm local time. At 6:03, there was still quite a crowd waiting to get in through the front door but the side entrance - which had a metal barricade outlining a near path in (just in case a line had to form) - was accessible. https://twitter.com/kasperka/status/670016296407465984https://twitter.com/kasperka/status/670016296407465984 It\u2019s busy inside: If you are shopping online in the UK you have the right to change your mind about anything you buy, unless you\u2019ve had an item made to your specification or personalised \u2013 say, for example, you have had someone\u2019s name put on a football shirt. Otherwise, under the consumer contracts regulations you can cancel an order at any point from the day you place it up until 14 working days from the day after it is delivered. You should do so in writing - either a physical letter or an email. You then need to return the goods. The retailer cannot insist that the items are returned in their original packaging \u2013 you are only obliged to make sure the things you bought are returned in reasonable condition. If you had to get them out of the packet to inspect them, that is OK. The retailer\u2019s terms and conditions should tell you if you are responsible for paying to return an unwanted order, so if you have any doubts before you press \u201cBuy\u201d, make sure you have checked this out. Retailers with a high street presence will often let you take goods back to their stores, which can be much handier than having to queue at the Post Office. If the retailer does not say who is responsible for paying, it will have to stump up the cost. If you have any problems cancelling an item, Which? has a range of template letters you can use to take on a retailer. Some of the deals that have gone live or will do at midnight include: \u00a340 off an iPad Mini 2 16GB (space grey) at Argos, bringing the price to \u00a3199 \u00a3450 off a Samsung UE55J6300 55\u201d Smart Curved TV at AO, bringing the price to \u00a3699 \u00a3110 off an Xbox One, games and Now TV bundle from Game, bringing the price to \u00a3249.99 Thanksgiving turkey at Apple? Meanwhile, at the Gap... Chris Addison raises a glass to Black Friday With so many stores offering deals early, my colleague Jana Kasperkevic in the US wonders if Black Friday will be quieter this year than last. The fourth Thursday of each November, which to make is known as Thanksgiving, is in some circles known as Gray Thursday. It\u2019s the younger sibling of the ultimate consumer holiday Black Friday, when many of US stores and retailers offer steep discounts. Black Friday used to be a huge holiday shopping in the US. That\u2019s right - used to be. Last year, Black Friday sales were down by as much as 11%. As we reported then: The greatest shopping day of the year wasn\u2019t, according to a survey released by the National Retail Federation, which polled 4,631 consumers and estimated that sales at stores and online dropped by 11%. Sales were $50.9bn, $6.5bn less than 2013, and the overall haul was 6% smaller, with consumers spending, on average, $380.95 each over the holiday weekend. Could it be that 2015 would continue the trend? It\u2019s very likely considering the fact that many of the discounts that in the past were exclusively available on Black Friday are now often offered days in advance. Radio Shack said it would offer its deals on Wednesday and Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, began offering some deals as early as 20 November - a week in advance. America gears up for Black Friday It may be Thanksgiving in the US today - but that is not stopping more than a dozen major retailers including Macy\u2019s, Target and Kohl\u2019s from opening their doors. Admittedly they\u2019ve left it until about now - after the turkey has been carved (on the East Coast at least). However, J.C. Penney decided to fling open its doors at 3pm, while Staples has decided to stay closed today. I guess those packs of A4 and plastic sleeves will just have to stay on the shelves. And for shoppers who just couldn\u2019t wait, Walmart and Target made all the deals on offer in their stores available online this morning. You may be wondering \u201cwhat is all this Black Friday business and where did it come from\u201d. According to my colleague Graham Ruddick, the term was in use as long ago as the 1950s to describe the shopping frenzy that followed Thanksgiving. Amazon brought it to the UK about five years ago, and now many retailers focus their pre-Christmas sales around the date. Some are offering alternatives this year - booksellers, for example, are planning Civilised Saturday. It involves tea and cake, rather than queuing in the cold, which makes it sound pretty appealing. Dan Thompson is in Manchester, where people have already bagged some bargains. He writes: The Black Friday sales have begun in Manchester - with shoppers queuing for hours to snap up the best deals. Bargain hunters huddled outside Game in the city\u2019s Arndale centre as the shop opened at 9pm tonight. First in the queue was tourism student Lisa Ye, 19, who had been waiting for more than three hours to buy a PS4 for her little brother, Jason, at a saving of \u00a3120. She said: \u201cI thought there was going to be a big line so I came early and there wasn\u2019t!\u201d Physics student Liam Gittins, 20, bought the same console shortly after. He said: \u201cI\u2019m quite a big gamer and the PS4 was quite expensive when it came out so Black Friday has given me the opportunity to get one. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of all the commotion but I suppose that\u2019s what comes with big sales. This has been decent though. In America it\u2019s crazy. There were no elbows in the face here.\u201d Game store manager Gary Lloyd said last year\u2019s Black Friday sale was \u2018absolute mayhem\u2019 and he expected this year\u2019s to be even bigger. He added: \u201cThe whole country is more aware of it now. It was quite new last year and retailers didn\u2019t really know what to expect.\u201d Lloyd said he thought the store\u2019s best deal was \u00a3100 off an XBOX. My colleague Julia Kollewe has put together this guide to Black friday sales in the UK - so if you\u2019re still undecided about staying up/setting the alarm for 4am tomorrow, this might help you make up your mind. We\u2019re not expecting the same kind as scenes as last year, when fights broke out at 1am because most of the retailers are scaling things back a bit. The main supermarkets will only start opening from 5am on Friday, and while there has been a lot of advertising, there isn\u2019t the same level of pre-sales hype this year. Hello and welcome to our Black Friday blog. It\u2019s been a tradition in the US for a while, and it\u2019s now taken off in the UK too - an annual opportunity to buy your Christmas presents at bargain prices, snap up a cut-price TV for yourself in time for the festive specials, or have a fight with a stranger in a supermarket. We\u2019ll be pulling together the latest deals, bringing you any news from the high street and online, and, with your help, compiling a list of the worst \u201cbargains\u201d out there. Let me know what you\u2019ve spotted, what you hope to buy - or if you plan to stay as far away from it all as possible.",

Some interesting analysis now starting to come through about what is actually going on. Basically, the answer is no, it\u2019s not dead. Rather, retailers have been ultra-cautious in their planning to avoid a repeat of last year, and shoppers are buying online instead. If I was a betting man, I would say today is still likely to be the biggest ever shopping day in Britain. <em>Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stores were caught unaware last year and are likely to have made much better preparations this year. Additionally, shoppers may also be wary after last year\u2019s excesses and many are becoming more inured to holiday season sales. There is an awareness now that Black Friday runs through until Cyber Monday and, even after this, there are plenty of shopping dates like Super/Panic Saturday and Manic Monday to choose from. Stores are also spreading sales out too. Amazon began its Black Market sales a week before Black Friday and offers daily flash deals anyway.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5658319ae4b02121560a9c5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-27T10:35:50.666Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cThought for the Day on Radio 4 this morning warned me against the rampant consumerism of Black Friday,\u201d <em>writes independent City analyst Louise Cooper</em>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But I fear I am already tempted.

Following last year\u2019s mayhem, Tesco decided to open its Extra stores across the country at 5am rather than at midnight as in 2014 and stepped up security. <em>He writes:</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A year ago there were mini-riots and the police were called, this year there was mince pies, Christmas music, and some disappointed shoppers. An ultra-cautious approach by Tesco to the Black Friday sales has helped to avoid the chaotic scenes of last year, and dampened demand for discounts among keen shoppers.</p> <p>At Tesco\u2019s Lea Valley supermarket in North London, there was a heavy security presence, a 5am opening time, and an orderly queuing system that saw between 10 and 20 people let into the store at a time. A police van stood by the main entrance in case of any trouble, but the four officers never left their seats.</p> <p>There was a mixture of delight and frustration among bargain-hungry shoppers. John Nash, from Enfield, who was looking for Christmas presents for his grandchildren and walked away with a \u00a3100 television, said: \u201cLast year was much better. This year there were less deals. You could get lost in stuff last year. There is a lot of security, it has to be to protect the public. I like that. There were a lot of fights last time. It\u2019s better letting in ten people at a time.\u201d</p> <p>However, Figen Akgul from Tottenham and here family ended up spending \u00a3600 on items including a Dyson vacuum cleaner, haircurler, and microwave. \u201cI think we saved 70%,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest with you we just came to see what was here. Last year we just stumbled across it and there were riots. This year they have done well, only letting 20 people in at a time.\u201d</p> <p>The best deals, such as a PlayStation 4 for \u00a3249 and a \u00a334 tablet, were only offered behind a counter where customers had to wait to be served, ensuring the manic scenes of a year ago were not repeated.</p> <p>There were similar scenes at a nearby Sainsbury\u2019s, where there was more security outside than customers.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-27T08:04:22.631Z\">at 8.04am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5657fd55e4b0e0f1bc262356\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-27T06:52:23.102Z\">6.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>People have always loved a good bargain, as this video Sale Time at Selfridges (1970) demonstrates.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoNKUo_X1M8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YoNKUo_X1M8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5657fbc6e4b0d1c309bdabb4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-27T06:45:57.801Z\">6.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Bjergsen/statuses/670128442164178945\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Best black Friday deals so far?

If you had to get them out of the packet to inspect them, that is OK.</p> <p>The retailer\u2019s terms and conditions should tell you if you are responsible for paying to return an unwanted order, so if you have any doubts before you press \u201cBuy\u201d, make sure you have checked this out. Retailers with a high street presence will often let you take goods back to their stores, which can be much handier than having to queue at the Post Office.

It\u2019s the younger sibling of the ultimate consumer holiday Black Friday, when many of US stores and retailers offer steep discounts.</p> <p>Black Friday used to be a huge holiday shopping in the US. That\u2019s right - used to be. Last year, Black Friday sales were down by as much as 11%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/02/black-friday-fizzle-consumers-money\">As we reported then</a>:</p> <p>The greatest shopping day of the year wasn\u2019t, according to <a href=\"https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/early-promotions-online-shopping-and-improving-economy-changing-the-face-of\">a survey released by the National Retail Federation</a>, which polled 4,631 consumers and estimated that sales at stores and online dropped by 11%. Sales were $50.9bn, $6.5bn less than 2013, and the overall haul was 6% smaller, with consumers spending, on average, $380.95 each over the holiday weekend.</p> <p>Could it be that 2015 would continue the trend? It\u2019s very likely considering the fact that many of the discounts that in the past were exclusively available on Black Friday are now often offered days in advance. Radio Shack said it <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/11/20/black-friday-deals-start-days-advance/76055410/\">would offer its deals on Wednesday</a> and Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, began offering some deals as early as 20 November - <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/11/18/amazon-black-friday-2015-eight-days-of-deals/75939548/\">a week in advance</a>. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e13db6a92008cf5d66faa43f08d986fc7ee6bd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e13db6a92008cf5d66faa43f08d986fc7ee6bd0/282_0_4086_2454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon\u2019s fulfilment centre In Hemel Hempstead prepares for Black Friday week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u2019s fulfilment centre In Hemel Hempstead prepares for Black Friday week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-26T23:00:38.208Z\">at 11.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56578653e4b0e0f1bc2622e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-26T22:33:37.703Z\">10.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>America gears up for Black Friday</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de62bbed237e5156779fc621b4e199e17c0880fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de62bbed237e5156779fc621b4e199e17c0880fd/0_0_4504_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers wait outside a Macys department store in Herald Square, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers wait outside a Macys department store in Herald Square, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trevor Collens/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be Thanksgiving in the US today - but that is not stopping more than a dozen major retailers including Macy\u2019s, Target and Kohl\u2019s from opening their doors.

      "bodyText": "Early on the morning of Black Friday, the hallways of Atlantic Terminal and Atlantic Center mall in Brooklyn were empty. Metal barricades lined the sidewalks outside, but there were no shoppers to line up between them. Most shoppers had already come and gone. This year, the real shopping holiday was Thursday, Thanksgiving day, with many US retailers increasingly extending their holiday deals and opening stores in the evening in order to compete with online deals offered by the likes of Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s still early, and from what we are seeing so far the crowds are good but not great,\u201d Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, said late on Thursday. The retail consultancy had 18 members studying customer traffic around the country. In the Harlem neighborhood of New York, Milagros Munez, 39, a law clerk, was shopping for toys at Target. \u201cWe actually came early this morning to miss the crowds,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that some stores are open all night, I feel like more people go in the evening.\u201d In Brooklyn, there were more staff than customers. Asked if things had been busy last night, one cashier said it had not been as busy as she had expected. The cashier, who had been working since 5.30pm on Thanksgiving, was still at work at 7am. In Chicago, the Macy\u2019s store at Water Tower Place mall saw thin crowds in the early hours of Friday after a fairly busy Thanksgiving evening, store associates said. Nia Darrell, a 23-year-old student, was shopping for coats and handbags with two friends. \u201cI shopped online yesterday and picked up most of what I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m out because Black Friday is more like a tradition but the discounts are similar even online this year.\u201d Standing on the visitor center balcony overlooking the ground floor of the sprawling flagship Macy\u2019s store in New York City, Shirene Shoushtarizadeh, 20, and her mom Judy Webb smiled for the camera. Shoushtarizadeh is studying at a college in upstate New York. For the last three years, while she has been away at college, her and her mom \u2013 who lives in California \u2013 have made it a tradition to spend Thanksgiving in New York and go shopping at Macy\u2019s. The store used to open early on Black Friday. In November 2013, for the first time in 155 years, the store opened its doors at 8pm on Thanksgiving. In 2014, the store opened at 6pm local time \u2013 as all Macy\u2019s stores did this year. On Thursday morning, Shoushtarizadeh and Webb had attended the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving parade. Then they went shopping at Lord and Taylor\u2019s, another large department store. \u201cIt was nice. It was open all day,\u201d said Webb. Were they looking for anything special at Macy\u2019s? \u201cNot really. Just here for the rush,\u201d said Shoushtarizadeh. Their next stop was Victoria\u2019s Secret. Not all shoppers left their homes. Shoppers in the US spent more than $1bn online, 22% more than last year, between midnight and 5pm ET on Thursday, according to the Adobe Digital Index, which tracked 100 million visits to 4,500 US retail sites. Many stores around the country were full on Thanksgiving evening, including Macy\u2019s and Toys R\u2019 US in New York. Local media reported brawling shoppers at a packed Kentucky mall on Thursday evening, leading to intervention by a police officer. As much as 20% of holiday shopping was expected to be done over the Thanksgiving weekend this year, analysts said, adding that the four-day shopping burst would help set the tone for the rest of the season, signalling to retailers if they needed to drop prices or change promotions. The shopping season spanning November and December is crucial for many retailers \u2013 the two months can account for anywhere from 20 to 40% of annual sales. Shoppers are expected to be cautious again this year. The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to rise 3.7%, slower than last year\u2019s 4.1%, due to stagnant wages and sluggish job growth. At around 6am on Friday, several hundred cars were in the parking lot at the Ross Park mall in Pittsburgh. There was a good crowd walking the mall although it was not overly crowded. Jorgette Clark, 27, said her budget would probably be lower this year because her husband works in the energy industry. \u201cI feel like we scaled back this year,\u201d she said. \u201cOur husbands work in the oil fields \u2026 It\u2019s probably a smaller Christmas this year.\u201d",

For the last three years, while she has been away at college, her and her mom \u2013 who lives in California \u2013 have made it a tradition to spend Thanksgiving in New York and go shopping at Macy\u2019s. </p> <p>The store used to open early on Black Friday. In November 2013, for the first time in 155 years, the store opened its doors at 8pm on Thanksgiving. In 2014, the store opened at 6pm local time \u2013 as all Macy\u2019s stores did this year.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, Shoushtarizadeh and Webb had attended the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving parade.

    "webTitle": "Fitch warns Osborne lacks flexibility; trade gap hits UK growth - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. New data has confirmed that the UK\u2019s recovery slowed in the last quarter. GDP rose by 0.5% in the July-September period; down on the 0.7% growth recorded in April-June. Britain\u2019s trade gap was to blame. Net trade took a bite out of growth, thanks to a surge in imports in the last quarter. The economy remains as unbalanced as ever. Service sector firms provided the bulk of the growth, while the manufacturing sector shrank last quarter. Here\u2019s the full story: Britain is still outperforming most other countries. Growth of 0.5% matches the US economy, and beats the eurozone. The UK also is outpacing poor old Greece. Its economy shrank by 0.9% in the last quarter; a deeper contraction than feared. Rating agency Fitch has fired a warning shot at the Treasury. It fears that George Osborne has set himself little flexibility to react if the economy suffers a shock. And Britain is refusing to get too excited by Black Friday. After last year\u2019s chaotic scenes, there\u2019s been a welcome outbreak of civility in the aisles. That\u2019s being tracked here: In other news...Herv\u00e9 Falciani, who blew the whistle on the funds sitting in Swiss bank accounts, has just been convicted of economic espionage charges, according to reports. The former IT worker been sentenced to five years in prison, Bloomberg says. However, Falciani was tried in his absence, refusing to leave France and arguing that he couldn\u2019t get a fair trial in a Swiss court. The unencrypted data he took from HSBC has been used by various governments to reclaim unpaid tax. Rating agency Fitch has joined the chorus of experts warning that UK chancellor George Osborne is limited room for manoeuvre if the economy under-performs. In its official response to Wednesday\u2019s Autumn Statement, Fitch cautions that any economic shock could force the Treasury to rethink its plans. And that\u2019s because Osborne used the surprise improvement in the public finances to pay for his u-turn on tax credits, and to protect spending on the police. So if the economy underperforms, he must either impose more austerity or miss his target of a surplus by 2019-20. As Fitch puts it: Debt reduction is increasingly being driven by underlying growth and revenue trends, which could reverse (for example, if growth slows or revenue forecasts are revised back down). Using better-than-expected revenue forecasts to scale back previously announced expenditure cuts suggests that this may pose downside risks to fiscal targets. Here\u2019s the statement: Fitch: UK Consolidation on Track but Fiscal Constraints Show It largely echoes yesterday\u2019s analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Today\u2019s GDP growth report also highlights how UK manufacturing has been struggling over the last year, contributing to the trade gap: That\u2019s partly due to the slowdown in emerging markets. It\u2019s also due to pound\u2019s recent rally against the euro, to an eight-year high, which makes UK exports less competitive in Europe. The service sector, though, has been growing steadily for almost three years: The end of the cost-of-living squeeze is also driving UK growth, argues Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets. He points to the recent drop in inflation (to minus 0.1%), which means real wages are up around 3%. The domestic private consumer is proving resilient and accounting for a good deal of the core underlying real terms growth in the UK economy. A real-terms income boost as the result of falling prices on a number of items of essential household spending is likely to have been an important driver of this. Britain\u2019s trade deficit really is quite shocking -- credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor recently declared the UK has the worst external liquidity metric of any of the 129 countries it rates. That was in July, when S&amp;P put the UK on \u2018rating watch negative\u2019, the first step towards losing its AAA rating. More here. Back to the UK... and today\u2019s GDP report shows that the economy is only slightly larger than before the financial crisis began, once you adjust for population changes. GDP per person (the red line) is now just 0.9% above its pre-downturn peak in the first quarter of 2008, having surpassed it in Quarter 1 2015. Total GDP (the blue line) is around 6.4% above the 2008 peak . We also have disappointing growth figures from Greece. Well, when I say growth... its economy actually contracted by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2015, according to stats body Elstat. That\u2019s rather worse than the 0.5% contraction that was initially estimated two weeks ago. The third quarter, from 1 July to 30 September, was a dramatic time. It included the imposition of capital controls, temporary bank closures, an austerity referendum, the nail-biting EU summit in which Athens agreed to a third bailout, and a snap election. No wonder the economy suffered. Kallum Pickering, economist at German bank Berenberg, predicts that UK growth will accelerate to 0.6% in the current quarter. He believes the domestic economy is strong enough to ride out problems overseas: Today\u2019s GDP and services data reflect an economy driven by domestic demand that is resilient to foreign risks. The idea that the UK economy would be affected in light of accumulating foreign risks through more channels than trade is just that, an idea. Domestic momentum was maintained through the third quarter and going forward we expect it to remain resilient with GDP growth accelerating to 0.6% qoq in Q4 2015 and maintain this pace over the medium-term. And this chart shows how the services sector has outperformed since 2001: Britain\u2019s manufacturing body, the EEF, fears that Britain\u2019s trade gap will not be closed anytime soon: EEF chief economist, Ms Lee Hopley, says: \u201cNo surprises in the second estimate as the economy was ticking over, including a chunky contribution from business investment, which has had an unbroken run of expansion for a year. Pulling sharply in the opposite direction is the contribution from net trade, with modest export growth being swamped by a massive bounce in imports. \u201cThis looks like the pattern of growth we can expect over the next few years, with spending by households and capital investment remaining the key economic players. This will rely on businesses maintaining a strong appetite for continuing to expand, even in the face of some challenging external conditions.\u201d These figures show that talk about rebalancing the UK economy is \u201ccompletely misplaced\u201d. So says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First: \u201cThe latest growth figures from the UK economy have told us a very familiar story; private consumption and government spending are making up for a very poor trade outlook. UK consumers have been ably helped this year by low interest rates, heightened disposable income courtesy of stagnant inflation and rising wages, and a strong pound. On the other side of the coin, the weakness in our trade partners coupled with a pound that is 7.6% higher since this time last year has seen our balance of payments worsen and trade become the heaviest drag on growth it has ever been.\u201d Trade is the only part of the UK economy that didn\u2019t provide some growth in the last quarter. While trade wiped off 1.5 percentage points, Gross capital formation (basically investment in new machinery etc) was the best performing area, contributing 1.2 percentage points to GDP. Household final consumption expenditure contributed 0.5 percentage points to GDP, and government consumption expenditure contributed 0.3 percentage points. Britain\u2019s trade balance deficit almost doubled in the last quarter. It widened from \u00a37.7bn in April-June to \u00a314.2bn in July-September., That\u2019s because imports jumped by 5.5% in the quarter, while exports increased by only 0.9%. These charts show how net trade (exports minus imports) had such a negative effect on growth in the last quarter: Britain\u2019s balance of payments deficit has been a persistent problem, even before the financial crisis, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be getting much better: Britain\u2019s trade gap dragged the economy back in the last quarter, worse than any time in at least the last 18 years. Today\u2019s GDP figures show that net trade wiped 1.5 percentage points off UK GDP. That\u2019s the weakest contribution on record, going back to 1997, following a positive contribution from net trade in the second quarter. Services is the only part of the economy that\u2019s bigger than its pre-crisis level: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank by 0.4% in the last quarter, showing the factory output weakened over the summer. The service sector continues to drive the UK economy. The Office for National Statistics says that services expanded by 0.7% during the last quarter. But industrial output was weaker than expected -- growing by just 0.2%, not the 0.3% first estimated. And construction output is unrevised, at minus 2.2% Here we go... The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2015. That\u2019s a slowdown from the 0.7% expansion recorded in April-June, and bang-in-line with the initial estimate. Unless something seriously odd has happened, today\u2019s GDP figures should confirm that Britain\u2019s economy has now expanded for 11 quarters in a row: But it\u2019s been a bumpy road. Growth slowed to just 0.3% in January-March, only to rebound to +0.7% in April-June. It isn\u2019t even December yet, and the Bank of England has wheeled out the Christmas decorations: Across Fleet Street, reporters are returning to their desks after an extra-early start to watch Black Friday unfold. This year, though, Britain\u2019s consumers have taken a relaxed approach to the bargain bonanza. No repeats of last year\u2019s pushing\u2019n\u2019shoving. And as the FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel (an American) points out, we\u2019re not really embracing the full spirit of the season: Turkey sandwich-lovers may have been disappointed..... FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga reckons the pound could be hit by today\u2019s UK GDP figures (due in an hour\u2019s time). The lingering impact of Mark Carney\u2019s inability to provide a concise timeframe on a UK rate rise has punished the Sterling this week. This single currency continues to face headwinds from the Bank of England\u2019s clear reluctance to raise UK interest rates and this has encouraged sellers to depreciate the pound further. Even though economic data from the UK has picked up in November, the non-existent rise in inflation has contributed to UK interest rate expectations being pushed back further. If the second estimate of the UK\u2019s Q3 GDP points towards slowing economic growth, there is going to be further potential for the Pound to face losses. It\u2019s more of a Red Friday than a Black Friday in the City, where shares are falling in early trading. The FTSE 100 is down 30 points or 0.5% at 6362. Other European markets are also dropping, after a big selloff in China. The Shanghai market has tumbled 5%, its biggest fall since the summer. The selloff was sparked by news that China\u2019s securities regulator is now investigating two top brokerages over the causes of August\u2019s market mayhem. This could lead to new curbs on leveraged trading (where investors borrow money to buy shares) We shouldn\u2019t read *too* much into one month\u2019s data, but it appears that UK house price growth stalled last month. Nationwide reports that prices rose by a modest 0.1% month-on-month, meaning the average house cost 3.7% more than a year ago (leaving little change from two hundred grand) Nationwide also warned that few properties are coming onto the market (which would keep prices high). Robert Gardner, its chief economist, says \u201cSurveyors have continued to report a dearth of properties on the market in recent months, with the number of available homes reportedly at the lowest level since the late 1970s. Therefore it is positive that policymakers are focusing on the need to increase home building, with the Chancellor announcing a range of measures aimed at boosting housing supply in his Autumn Statement. The current rate of construction activity is well below the projected rate of household formation. Only 135,000 new homes were built in England in the twelve months to September 2015, well below the c220,000 new households that are projected to form each year over the next decade. Ouch. French consumers kept their hands in their pockets last month, suggesting the country\u2019s economy may been slowing down this autumn. Consumer spending fell by 0.7% during the month, with car sales dropping particularly sharply. It could mean that France struggles to match its 0.3% growth in the last quarter, let alone beating it. Today\u2019s growth figures could highlight how Britain find itself between a strengthening US economy, and a weaker European one. That tussle is hitting sterling - which is close to a seven-month low against the US dollar (at $1.509), and a near eight-year highs against the euro (\u20ac1.42). As Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets points out, policymakers would favour a weaker pound: Either way you swing it, the UK is caught in the middle of the extreme policy divergence between the US and Europe. With Europe the biggest export destination for British businesses, you can understand Governor Mark Carney erring towards trying to combat sterling\u2019s strength versus the euro when he said rates are to remain low \u201cfor some time.\u201d Good morning. Is Britain\u2019s economy really as rosy as Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement implied? We\u2019ll find out in 90 minutes, when the Office for National Statistics releases its second estimate of growth in the last quarter. This Second Estimate of UK GDP gets under the bonnet of the economy, showing how private consumption, government spending, business investment and trade all changed from the start of July to the end of September. It\u2019s likely to show that the UK is still relying on the service sector, and consumer spending, for growth (but after Wednesday\u2019s surprisingly upbeat figures, I\u2019ll avoid any reckless predictions...) The first estimate, released last month, showed growth of 0.5% in the quarter. That may be confirmed today too - if so, Britain is growing roughly as fast as the US, and faster than the eurozone. The fun (?!) starts at 9.30am GMT. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Portugal, where a left-wing, anti-austerity government was sworn in last night. It could be the start of another chapter in the eurozone debt crisis, with prime minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa keen to implement more growth-friendly policies. And it\u2019s Black Friday, for those who worship at the altar of commerce: We\u2019re tracking the bargains, bracing weather and bust-ups (if any), here.....",

      "bodyText": "Justin Bieber has pulled out of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade. But don\u2019t worry: the Reverend Billy is still planning to entertain the holiday crowd on Black Friday and maybe, just maybe, add a few Beliebers to his Church of Non-Shopping. The holiday season is a busy time for Bill Talen \u2013 the performance artist, actor and activist who styles himself as Reverend Billy. Last week at Joe\u2019s Pub, the downtown music venue where Adele recently performed three of her songs to an intimate crowd of 184 people, Talen was warming up for the big day. About a dozen homeless New Yorkers \u2013 three of them under the age of five \u2013 took the stage with Talen to share their stories of being hassled for living on the street, of being arrested for blocking sidewalks with their carts. \u201cHow can this happen in America?\u201d asked a homeless retired marine, his voice trembling. \u201cTalk to us, don\u2019t talk about us,\u201d said another as the audience looked on silently. \u201cI could be a decent person,\u201d he added, which was met with echoes of \u201cYou are!\u201d. Seconds later, he was enveloped in a hug from Talen. The show may have been more than the audience bargained for. If homeless people are in the audience or up on the stage, you can\u2019t avert your eyes or walk faster until you have passed them. In a performance lasting just over an hour, Talen and his Church of Stop Shopping tackle GMOs, police brutality, racism, homelessness, capitalism, climate change and the environment. They are not there to give you a good show \u2013 they are there to make you question your way of life. The Church of Stop Shopping has been around for 15 years. Talen first developed his Elvis-meets-Bill Graham preacher character in the alternative theaters of San Francisco. The character and the church soon morphed into a vehicle for protesting against what he sees as the destructive rise in consumerism. At first, the group was resisting \u201cconsumerism in the broadest sense\u201d, says Talen. Then he identified targets. Talen is banned from every Starbucks in the world after a series of protests against its \u201cfake Bohemia\u201d in which he tried to \u201cexorcise\u201d the demon of cookie-cutter capitalism from its stores. He\u2019s been arrested outside Disney stores, where the group duct-tapped Mickey Mouse to a cross. Ten years ago the group began an annual tradition of staging a performance-like protest outside Macy\u2019s flagship store in New York City. But even for Talen some things are bigger than shopping. \u201cLast year, for the first time in 10 years, we were not at the front door of Macy\u2019s in Herald Square at the door buster event,\u201d Talen says. \u201cWe were in Ferguson.\u201d After visiting a Monsanto headquarters in St Louis to perform another exorcism, the group traveled to Ferguson to participate in protests held just days after a grand jury in St Louis County declined to indict Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown. The group also participated in die-ins at the local stores. When Talen and Savitri D, his partner and director, describe that experience as moving and transformative. Just minutes into his show at Joe\u2019s Pub, Reverend Billy announced that US has reached a landmark \u2013 about 1,000 people have been killed by police in 2015. The church \u2013 or the choir, if you will \u2013 then launched into one of their songs, Man Down, Brother Down. Moments later, a member of the choir began to the list names of those who have been killed: Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, Corey Jones, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin. A moment of silence followed. The only sound was that of drinks clinking on servers\u2019 trays. The show, which will run every Sunday until 20 December, is not all about being uncomfortable. \u201cDo you feel her presence?\u201d Reverend Billy says at one point, referring to Adele. He continues, singing: \u201cRumor has it \u2026\u201d Talen likes to mix the sacred and the profane \u2013 he sees it as a way to remove the barriers he believes people erect to stop them questioning their unbridled consumerism. When people protest or attend a performance, \u201cwe start to meet in the streets again,\u201d says Talen. These interactions come after years of people distancing themselves from each other. \u201cI distance myself from you. I keep buying and buying and buying. Everything around me is monetized and you go farther away as a person. You start to have more and more cars and perfumes and multiple phones, screens and billboards and [you are] way over there \u2013 we used to be within hailing distance, within talking distance, within touching distance.\u201d It all changed in Ferguson, he says: \u201cWe were laying down together. We were dying in together. We were touching each other in new ways. We were talking. We were making new relationships.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d adds Savitri D. \u201cSocial movements \u2013 or movements, period \u2013 of the last couple of decades, they all originate or come from people who really cannot shop or don\u2019t shop. That are cut off or divorced from consumerism because the aspirational model is impossible for them.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what Thanksgiving has to become this year,\u201d Reverend Billy chimes in. \u201cWe have got to celebrate the soft, deep emotions: graciousness, trust, intimacy \u2026\u201d \u201cGratitude,\u201d says Savitri D. \u201c\u2026 Forgiveness, being quiet together without football on or video games.\u201d \u201cHow do you resist?\u201d says Savitri D. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to find yourself in a store buying something you didn\u2019t even need.\u201d This Friday, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping will return to its old stomping ground, the Herald Square Macy\u2019s on 34th street in New York, to urge people to \u2013 what else \u2013 stop shopping. The church\u2019s shooting and shopping protests are closely aligned, at least in Talen\u2019s head. \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shop,\u201d was shouted many times in Ferguson, he said. It\u2019s all part of his struggle with \u201cthis shared hallucination in the United States, this national fundamentalist religion, which could be expressed in a phrase \u2018Shoot and buy, shoot and buy, shoot and buy\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe main ritual in our society right now is shopping,\u201d explains Talen. \u201cIt\u2019s the national religion. It\u2019s the thing we all do that we don\u2019t even question any more. That\u2019s how fundamental religions are \u2013 you don\u2019t even question any more and if somebody does anything a little bit different, it\u2019s very weird. He is a stranger. He is a threat.\u201d So while Bieber will not be singing at this year\u2019s Macy\u2019s Parade, Talen and the choir will be there the following day to treat its customers to anti-shopping choral performance. \u201cWe will exorcize this big department store, so that its products tremble on the shelves, but we won\u2019t go flash mobbing inside like former years. The carbon emissions and sweatshop labor of their Black Friday sales will be sung to passersby.\u201d Corporations \u201chave taken Thanksgiving utterly!\u201d Talen said. He\u2019s hoping he can take a little back.",

      "bodyText": "This Black Friday, Lucia McBath will not be shopping. Three years ago her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot dead in the parking lot of a Gate gas station in Jacksonville, Florida. His killer, Michael Dunn, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In an interview with Democracy Now, McBath said her son had been excited about going shopping on Black Friday and had picked out what he wanted to buy. Now, to honor his memory, McBath will participate in a national boycott campaign under the #notonedime hashtag, by not spending any money from 26 to 30 November. The boycott aims to highlight the purchasing power of the African American community. \u201cMy hope is that the 2015 boycott will again channel our collective community rage towards an economic boycott that empowers people of all ages and ethnic groups to participate in economic resistance,\u201d said Rahiel Tesfamariam, founder and publisher of Urban Cusp, who launched the #notonedime hashtag last year. Shortly after St Louis grand jury declined to indict police officer Darren Wilson for the killing of Michael Brown, a friend of Tesfamariam posted on Urban Cusp\u2019s Facebook page that \u201cnot one dime\u201d should be spent on Black Friday. According to Tesfamariam, the point of the boycott is remembrance of victims of state violence and police brutality. The boycott is also designed to unite poor African American communities and demonstrate their collective purchasing power \u201cin opposition to a broken system that condones institutionalized racism\u201d. That power is not insignificant. In 2013, the shopping power of 43 million African Americans amounted to $1tn a year, according to Nielsen, a global analytics firm. By 2017, that number is expected to increase to $1.3tn a year. \u201cWith the $1tn buying power of the African American community, it is absolutely necessary to withhold our hard-earned earnings from a broken system that often values property over people,\u201d Tesfamariam told the Guardian. \u201cIt is a way for us to assert that we have had enough and will spend \u2018not one dime\u2019. We refuse to be driven by America\u2019s rampant materialism and capitalistic values at a time of communal grief and rage.\u201d In 2014, in addition to withholding their dollars from some of the largest retailers, protesters also disrupted their business days by marching through malls chanting \u201chands up, don\u2019t shop\u201d and staging \u201cdie-ins\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for companies to not take notice of mall die-ins and freeway shutdowns that prevent shoppers from accessing stores. It would be unwise for companies to ignore last year\u2019s 11% drop in spending and forecasts for a bleak Black Friday,\u201d said Tesfamariam, who added that last year\u2019s boycott had been a major success. Retail analysts, however, say sales figures were down thanks to other consumer holidays like Gray Thursday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, and Black Friday deals being offered days if not weeks in advance of the actual holiday. While Tesfamarian did not predict the exact impact that this year\u2019s boycott would have, she said reaction so far had been \u201cvery strong\u201d. The boycott is to last from Thanksgiving Day, Thursday 26 November, until Monday 30 November. The #notonedime boycott will be followed by a #BlackDecember campaign, which will urge African American consumers to abstain from all retail spending unless at black-owned shops.",

Three years ago her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot dead in the parking lot of a Gate gas station in Jacksonville, Florida. His killer, Michael Dunn, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/florida-man-guilty-first-degree-loud-music-retrial\">convicted of first-degree murder</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/17/michael-dunn-sentenced-life-without-parole-florida\">sentenced to life in prison</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/23/jordan-davis-parents-justice-reform-fight-hbo-film\">Jordan Davis's parents fight for reform ahead of HBO film on teenager's death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2015/1/26/black_lives_matter_new_film_on\">interview with Democracy Now</a>, McBath said her son had been excited about going shopping on Black Friday and had picked out what he wanted to buy. Now, to honor his memory, McBath will participate in a national boycott campaign under the <a href=\"http://www.notonedimeboycott.com/\">#notonedime</a> hashtag, by not spending any money from 26 to 30 November. The boycott aims to highlight the purchasing power of the African American community. </p> <p>\u201cMy hope is that the 2015 boycott will again channel our collective community rage towards an economic boycott that empowers people of all ages and ethnic groups to participate in economic resistance,\u201d said Rahiel Tesfamariam, founder and publisher of Urban Cusp, who launched the #notonedime hashtag last year.</p> <p>Shortly after St Louis grand jury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/24/ferguson-police-darren-wilson-michael-brown-no-charges\">declined to indict police officer Darren Wilson</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">killing of Michael Brown</a>, a friend of Tesfamariam posted on Urban Cusp\u2019s Facebook page that \u201cnot one dime\u201d should be spent on Black Friday.</p> <p>According to Tesfamariam, the point of the boycott is remembrance of victims of state violence and police brutality. The boycott is also designed to unite poor African American communities and demonstrate their collective purchasing power \u201cin opposition to a broken system that condones institutionalized racism\u201d.</p> <p>That power is not insignificant. In 2013, the shopping power of 43 million African Americans amounted to $1tn a year, <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/african-american-consumers-are-more-relevant-than-ever.html\">according to Nielsen</a>, a global analytics firm. By 2017, that number is expected to increase to $1.3tn a year.</p> <p>\u201cWith the $1tn buying power of the African American community, it is absolutely necessary to withhold our hard-earned earnings from a broken system that often values property over people,\u201d Tesfamariam told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a way for us to assert that we have had enough and will spend \u2018not one dime\u2019. We refuse to be driven by America\u2019s rampant materialism and capitalistic values at a time of communal grief and rage.\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, in addition to withholding their dollars from some of the largest retailers, protesters also disrupted their business days by marching through malls chanting \u201chands up, don\u2019t shop\u201d and staging \u201cdie-ins\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for companies to not take notice of mall die-ins and freeway shutdowns that prevent shoppers from accessing stores. It would be unwise for companies to ignore last year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/dec/02/black-friday-fizzle-consumers-money\">11% drop in spending</a> and forecasts for a bleak Black Friday,\u201d said Tesfamariam, who added that last year\u2019s boycott had been a major success.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UrbanCusp/statuses/654429931921907716\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotOneDime?src=hash\">#NotOneDime</a> from November 26-30.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On Friday, as thousands of Americans take advantage of Black Friday deals, hundreds of others will be at work restocking stores\u2019 shelves, ringing up the purchases and cleaning up after excited shoppers. Many of those workers will be busy at Walmart, the world\u2019s second-largest retailer. Some Walmart employees reporting for shifts on Thanksgiving and Black Friday have spend the last few two weeks fasting, as part of a protest to lobby for a $15 wage. Others will spend their holidays protesting outside Walmart stores, demanding that the company pay its employees a living wage and give them full-time schedules. Such protesters say that the wages Walmart is paying are not sustainable and that they and many of their co-workers have a hard time making ends meet. A Walmart spokesman dismissed such protests as media stunts that have become an annual tradition. Additionally, the company accused the protesters of making \u201cfalse attacks\u201d. \u201cOur average full-time hourly associate earns more than $13 an hour in addition to the opportunity for quarterly cash bonuses, matching 401k and healthcare benefits,\u201d said the Walmart spokesman. \u201cWalmart is investing $2.7bn over this year and next in wages, education and training for our associates because we know they make the difference.\u201d Here are profiles of five workers who have participated in protests organized by OUR Walmart, a workers organization, this year. Nancy Reynolds, 68 Reynolds works as a cashier at Walmart store in Merritt Island, Florida. In January, she will turn 69 and the following month will mark eight years since she was hired. In that time, she has worked her way up to earning $11.20 an hour. In the days leading up to Thanksgiving and Black Friday, Reynolds urged Walmart to give its employees a 10% in-store discount on food and asked co-workers to sign a petition outlining that demand. OUR Walmart claims that the lowest-paid Walmart workers sometimes skip lunch because they cannot afford food. Earlier this year, Walmart announced it was raising wages for about half a million employees. The retailer now pays alls of its employees at least $9 an hour and plans to increase such pay to at least $10 an hour next year. Reynolds, who described herself as a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, said that she could not stand to see people go hungry. \u201cMy mother grew up during the Depression and she passed along lessons of getting through in difficult times \u2013 lessons that I use today while working at Walmart,\u201d she said. \u201cI always try to keep a couple dollars on me for my co-workers if they need food and I can\u2019t afford to buy lunch at the store that isn\u2019t bad for my diabetes. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to food banks and churches for food, where I\u2019d run into many of my co-workers who told me about them. Hunger is an urgent crisis at Walmart \u2013 we all deserve more and we\u2019re asking for no less than $15 and full-time this Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The discount is something the corporation can do now.\u201d Reynolds celebrated Thanksgiving earlier in the week, sharing a small turkey dinner with a neighbor. She would be working at Walmart on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. During her shift on Friday, she was set to hand her petition to her store manager. Jasmine Dixon Jasmine Dixon, 22, is a single mother of two boys. She works as an optician at a Walmart in Colorado. After working for Walmart for three years, she earns $12.95 an hour. In the days leading up to Black Friday, she joined a fast for a $15 wage. \u201cI\u2019ll be fasting with my mother to bring attention to the struggle of working moms everywhere who can barely put food on the table with Walmart\u2019s low wages. My situation is no different than the hundreds of thousands of other working moms at Walmart,\u201d she said. When she became pregnant with her second son, Dixon said, she had to take an early unpaid maternity leave. \u201cWithout my income, my children and I became homeless. I\u2019m now employed at another Walmart location, but constantly live with that experience and fear of losing my job and the income that my family depends on,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for food stamps and government programs for my kids, I don\u2019t know what I would do. Too many times, I have had to go to food banks just to try and scrape up some rice and beans for my kids to eat.\u201d This Thanksgiving will be the third in a row that Dixon has had to work. \u201cMy kids are still small so don\u2019t really understand. It\u2019s sad to leave them,\u201d she said. Emily Dehart Three months ago, Emily Dehart gave birth to Rylan. Before getting pregnant, Dehart worked as an associate in the jewelry department at a Walmart store in Cocoa, Florida, for four years. She hoped to go back to her job after giving birth but was recently hospitalized for a blood clot in her leg. \u201cSince Rylan\u2019s birth, I\u2019ve been very sick. I tried to get on Walmart\u2019s health insurance and was denied coverage \u2013 since I wasn\u2019t working enough hours to qualify,\u201d said Dehart, whose husband Andrew works at the same store on overnight maintenance. He works 40 hours a week and earns $9.50 an hour. Worried about her health, Dehart recently made a decision not to return to her job, which paid $9.70. On Friday, Deharts will travel to New York with OUR Walmart and join the protest in front of Walmart heiress Alice Walton\u2019s residence. \u201cWe\u2019d like Walmart to pay enough for one person to be able to work and take care of bills without worrying if we will have enough food to get us through the end of the month,\u201d said Dehart. \u201cWe\u2019ll rely on Andrew\u2019s income, food stamps and Women, Infants and Children [WIC] supplemental benefits to survive.\u201d Lisa Pietro Lisa Pietro, 57, works as a produce associate at a Walmart in Winter Haven, Florida. She has worked at the store since April 2013. \u201cAfter a recent raise, I earn just $9.90 an hour and it\u2019s hardly enough to survive on,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to work full time and be able to care for myself and my family but instead Walmart is cutting workers\u2019 hours across the country. Even though I\u2019ve asked repeatedly for full-time hours my hours drop as low as 28 hours some weeks. No one can live like that.\u201d Pietro said that she likes her job and loves Walmart customers, but is constantly afraid that she might lose her job for speaking out about her low pay. \u201cI\u2019ve already been homeless and I\u2019m not willing to go back to those days,\u201d she said. \u201cI work hard to put a roof over my head and food in my stomach and clothes on my back. Unfortunately, at the end of the month, there is nothing left over for my family.\u201d This week, Pietro had to work on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. As a result, she missed spending Thanksgiving with her mom. \u201cMy mother is in a nursing home and I won\u2019t get to see her, which is really unfortunate since this is one of the few days we\u2019re able to bring her home to spend time with the family,\u201d she said. Denise Barlage Denise Barlage, 56, will also spend the Friday morning outside Walton\u2019s New York City condo. Barlage used to work as a sitting room operator at a Walmart in Pico Rivera, California. She is one of about 530 associates who were laid off earlier this year, when the retailer closed five stores in order to fix problems with plumbing. According to Walmart, about 75% of displaced workers from the five stores were placed at nearby locations. Before being let go, Barlage had worked for Walmart for nine years. At the end of that time, she was earning $12 an hour. Barlage was also part of the group that visited Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters last week. \u201cClinton was a Walmart board member for six years, and was reportedly paid $18,000 annually in addition to $1,500 for each meeting she attended as a board member,\u201d Barlage said. While Barlage is in New York protesting about the low wages at Walmart, her family will be at home, enjoying Thanksgiving.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s teatime in a home for the elderly in Rochdale, Manchester. Dawn Nicholls is leading a sing-along and some of her colleagues have served cakes and sandwiches. Nicholls is a Co-operative Group employee, not a care home worker. She is taking part in a pilot project in the town where the mutual was founded 171 years ago, which could be a key part of the future of the business. After a turbulent year in 2013, when the business nearly collapsed and its ethical image took a bashing \u2013 partly thanks to revelations about drug use by the Co-op bank\u2019s former chairman Paul Flowers, the Co-op is trying to get back in touch with its roots. Its chief executive, Richard Pennycook, who took the helm last year, sees community projects as a way to make the the group\u2019s grocery stores, funeral parlours and insurance businesses attractive again. He wants the Co-op\u2019s staff and 7 million members to play an important role in their communities \u2013 bringing people together, raising money and helping to support local groups. It is about giving people a reason to choose the Co-op over bigger and better resourced rivals. \u201cWe have got to create businesses that are really quite different,\u201d he says. With his corporate background at Morrisons, Laura Ashley and JD Wetherspoon, many Co-op members suspected the besuited and fastidious Pennycook was hired to shape the business up for sale. He admits he would not have taken the helm of the company unless a rejig of its corporate governance set-up had been approved by members last year. But he insists the Co-op\u2019s mutual status is vital to its future. \u201cI think an absolutely fundamental reason the whole new team is here is a passionate belief in what the Co-op should be about: owned by members with democratic control by members and rooted in communities we live and work in,\u201d he says. The trial in Rochdale is one of 55 pilot schemes looking at how membership can be rebooted. These include paying staff to devote a few hours a week to being community liaison workers or \u201cchampions\u201d alongside their day job. \u201cOver the years, the Co-op has become a bit corporate and a bit centralised. We are unpicking that. We want engagement to be at a local level. We are in every postcode. We have units in about 2,000 communities in the UK and the new member proposition will be about those communities,\u201d Pennycook says. Members will be encouraged to get involved in reviewing and selecting products and choosing community projects or charitable partners that will benefit from local funds. A policy group is also being established to enable members\u2019 representatives to help develop ethical policies. Pennycook has hired Mike Bracken, the government\u2019s former executive director of digital, to bring membership into the 21st century by developing new ways for everyone to communicate with each other and the Co-op. \u201cIn a post-financial crisis world, there is inherent distrust of big institutions and for good reason. Look at the banks, supermarkets and now automotive companies,\u201d says Pennycook. \u201cHuge complex institutions which are a long way away are now the subject of suspicion while the Co-op is back to its roots as an organisation owned by you where you have an influence and economic returns come back to you and the your community. Nobody else can do that. It\u2019s completely unique and I think there is a real place for it.\u201d Pennycook believes there is strong \u201clatent demand\u201d for attachment to such an organisation and signing up large numbers of people as members is the most important thing for the future of the business. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen we haven\u2019t got a bright future because we are just a bunch of indistinct businesses,\u201d he says. The dividend was suspended in 2014 as the Co-op was forced to pump hundreds of millions of pounds into rescuing its bank, which had to be bailed out by hedge funds leaving the mutual with just a 20% stake. Pennycook says the dividend is an \u201ciconic part of being a member\u201d. It will return, but not until 2017 at the earliest \u2013 at the end of the rebuild phase of his turnaround plan. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the financial firepower at the moment,\u201d he says. The last payment, of \u00a334m, was made in 2013. \u201cDay to day now we are in calm waters, we are well away from the tough stuff when the fire was blazing and this was something close to collapse, but there is more to do.\u201d There remains uncertainty over whether the slimmed down Co-op, which was forced to sell off its farms and successful pharmacy business to reduce its debts, will be able to fight off bigger and better resourced rivals. Its grocery chain, which makes up the vast majority of sales and profits, is trying to compete in a market in the throes of a bitter price war, commodity price deflation and rapidly changing shopping habits which favour those with an online presence. The Co-op tried and ditched efforts to sell groceries online. Given his widely known reluctance to take on the job, will Pennycook stick around to get the job done? He says he is \u201cat the board\u2019s disposal\u201d, but typically doesn\u2019t commit himself to any particular timetable. Quietly spoken and imbued with a zen-like calm, Pennycook is an easy man to underestimate. But he has proved himself tenacious enough to deal with some retail heavyweights from Sir Ken Morrison to Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland and the Co-op\u2019s current chairman, Allan Leighton. Pennycook says he is seeking inspiration from previous bold moves, such as the introduction of Fairtrade goods in all its shops in 1999, in order to find new ways the Co-op can intervene in markets that are not serving its members well. \u201cWe need to go back to being brave and different,\u201d Pennycook says. He suggests the Co-op could get involved in energy, childcare or telecoms \u2013 areas that are \u201copaque and don\u2019t give good customer service\u201d. Pennycook has plenty of ideas for the future. \u201cIf you look at the last 50 years, the Co-op has been benignly neglected and in relative decline. A turnaround doesn\u2019t happen in a year, but do we think we can prepare the Co-op for the next 100 years? Absolutely. Overwhelmingly people want it to succeed.\u201d",

Dawn Nicholls is leading a sing-along and some of her colleagues have served cakes and sandwiches. <br></p> <p>Nicholls is a Co-operative Group employee, not a care home worker. She is taking part in a pilot project in the town where the mutual was founded 171 years ago, which could be a key part of the future of the business.</p> <p>After a turbulent year in 2013, when the business nearly collapsed and its ethical image took a bashing \u2013 partly thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/07/co-op-bank-paul-flowers-court-drug-charges\">revelations about drug use by the Co-op bank\u2019s former chairman</a> Paul Flowers, the Co-op is trying to get back in touch with its roots. </p> <p>Its chief executive, Richard Pennycook, who took the helm last year, sees community projects as a way to make the the group\u2019s grocery stores, funeral parlours and insurance businesses attractive again. He wants the Co-op\u2019s staff and 7 million members to play an important role in their communities \u2013 bringing people together, raising money and helping to support local groups. It is about giving people a reason to choose the Co-op over bigger and better resourced rivals. \u201cWe have got to create businesses that are really quite different,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf039a86b6cd58a24340dfe94e0448cb4749ecb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf039a86b6cd58a24340dfe94e0448cb4749ecb1/0_235_3499_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The group, which has 7 million members, introduced Fairtrade goods in all its shops in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The group, which has 7 million members, introduced Fairtrade goods in all its shops in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> With his corporate background at Morrisons, Laura Ashley and JD Wetherspoon, many Co-op members suspected the besuited and fastidious Pennycook was hired to shape the business up for sale.</p> <p>He admits he would not have taken the helm of the company unless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/30/co-operative-group-radical-shakeup-ursula-lidbetter\">a rejig of its corporate governance set-up had been approved by members last year</a>. But he insists the Co-op\u2019s mutual status is vital to its future. \u201cI think an absolutely fundamental reason the whole new team is here is a passionate belief in what the Co-op should be about: owned by members with democratic control by members and rooted in communities we live and work in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The trial in Rochdale is one of 55 pilot schemes looking at how membership can be rebooted. These include paying staff to devote a few hours a week to being community liaison workers or \u201cchampions\u201d alongside their day job.</p> <p>\u201cOver the years, the Co-op has become a bit corporate and a bit centralised. We are unpicking that. We want engagement to be at a local level. We are in every postcode. We have units in about 2,000 communities in the UK and the new member proposition will be about those communities,\u201d Pennycook says. <br></p> <p>Members will be encouraged to get involved in reviewing and selecting products and choosing community projects or charitable partners that will benefit from local funds. A policy group is also being established to enable members\u2019 representatives to help develop ethical policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"572c86aca4e6d100c762a2766d501238aef7e670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/572c86aca4e6d100c762a2766d501238aef7e670/0_0_3630_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Co-op is \u2018well away from the tough stuff when the fire was blazing \u2026 but there is more to do\u2019, Pennycook admits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Co-op is \u2018well away from the tough stuff when the fire was blazing \u2026 but there is more to do\u2019, Pennycook admits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pennycook has hired Mike Bracken, the government\u2019s former executive director of digital, to bring membership into the 21st century by developing new ways for everyone to communicate with each other and the Co-op. \u201cIn a post-financial crisis world, there is inherent distrust of big institutions and for good reason. Look at the banks, supermarkets and now automotive companies,\u201d says Pennycook.</p> <p>\u201cHuge complex institutions which are a long way away are now the subject of suspicion while the Co-op is back to its roots as an organisation owned by you where you have an influence and economic returns come back to you and the your community. Nobody else can do that. It\u2019s completely unique and I think there is a real place for it.\u201d</p> <p>Pennycook believes there is strong \u201clatent demand\u201d for attachment to such an organisation and signing up large numbers of people as members is the most important thing for the future of the business. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen we haven\u2019t got a bright future because we are just a bunch of indistinct businesses,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The dividend was suspended in 2014 as the Co-op was forced to pump hundreds of millions of pounds into rescuing its bank, which had to be bailed out by hedge funds leaving the mutual with just a 20% stake. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b3c40d914c7919899206c38f3f2f37f34370cac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b3c40d914c7919899206c38f3f2f37f34370cac/0_269_3999_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Co-op was forced to sell off its successful pharmacy business to pay down its debts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-op was forced to sell off its successful pharmacy business to pay down its debts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pennycook says the dividend is an \u201ciconic part of being a member\u201d.

The last payment, of \u00a334m, was made in 2013. \u201cDay to day now we are in calm waters, we are well away from the tough stuff when the fire was blazing and this was something close to collapse, but there is more to do.\u201d</p> <p>There remains uncertainty over whether the slimmed down Co-op, which was forced to sell off its farms and successful pharmacy business to reduce its debts, will be able to fight off bigger and better resourced rivals. </p> <p>Its grocery chain, which makes up the vast majority of sales and profits, is trying to compete in a market in the throes of a bitter price war, commodity price deflation and rapidly changing shopping habits which favour those with an online presence. The Co-op tried and ditched efforts to sell groceries online.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Given his widely known reluctance to take on the job, will Pennycook stick around to get the job done? He says he is \u201cat the board\u2019s disposal\u201d, but typically doesn\u2019t commit himself to any particular timetable.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1ff31744555667b12fc8fae065212a0d1e5a568\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1ff31744555667b12fc8fae065212a0d1e5a568/0_0_3942_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The group is looking for new ways to intervene in markets that are not serving its members well.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The group is looking for new ways to intervene in markets that are not serving its members well.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quietly spoken and imbued with a zen-like calm, Pennycook is an easy man to underestimate. But he has proved himself tenacious enough to deal with some retail heavyweights from Sir Ken Morrison to Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland and the Co-op\u2019s current chairman, Allan Leighton.</p> <p>Pennycook says he is seeking inspiration from previous bold moves, such as the introduction of Fairtrade goods in all its shops in 1999, in order to find new ways the Co-op can intervene in markets that are not serving its members well. \u201cWe need to go back to being brave and different,\u201d Pennycook says.</p> <p>He suggests the Co-op could get involved in energy, childcare or telecoms \u2013 areas that are \u201copaque and don\u2019t give good customer service\u201d.</p> <p>Pennycook has plenty of ideas for the future. \u201cIf you look at the last 50 years, the Co-op has been benignly neglected and in relative decline. A turnaround doesn\u2019t happen in a year, but do we think we can prepare the Co-op for the next 100 years? Absolutely. Overwhelmingly people want it to succeed.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Budget deficit narrowing is manna from heaven for Scott Morrison | Stephen Koukoulas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The treasurer, Scott Morrison, must be feeling pleased with the recent news on the budget. None is of his own making, but the budget data for the first four months of 2015-16 has the underlying cash deficit running at $1.6bn below the estimate made in the budget back in May. If this sort of narrowing of the deficit continues over the remainder of the year, the final budget outcome for 2015-16 could be as low as $30bn, a good deal below the $35.1bn deficit estimate of his predecessor, Joe Hockey. Especially good for Morrison is that the narrowing in the deficit has been evident for four months and is not, it appears, a one-off blip. That means the path to a narrower deficit is likely to continue. The rate of jobs growth is far exceeding budget-time estimates, which by itself should underpin the income tax paid by those extra workers. Wages growth, the other element of income tax payments, is low but is no weaker than the budget time estimates, so there are no concerns over income tax collections. The stronger employment levels in the first third of 2015-16 have the unemployment rate tracking well below the budget-time forecast. This lower than forecast unemployment rate is a key factor holding back growth in some big-ticket items of government spending. The improved budget bottom line has occurred with both revenue and spending tracking a little below budget forecasts. The very low inflation rate may account for this uniform step-down in both sides of the budget ledger. Going forward, there is enough in the more recent run of economic news to expect that the budget deficit will not only come in lower for the current financial year, but that the good news will extend into the budget forward estimates. If the economy can register the pick-up in economic growth over the next few years broadly as was forecast in the budget, lower deficits and a possible earlier return to surplus could well be in the offing. There is some risk that the recent business investment outlook data will crimp some growth in the next year. Luckily, the economic strength outside business investment appears solid enough to lead to decent economic outcomes, at least in the near term. The government and its budget are also certain to benefit from solid dividends to be paid by the Reserve Bank. One of Hockey\u2019s early policy tricks was to give the RBA $8.8bn it did not need or request, but he did so to make the budget deficit in 2013-14 look bad, and blame Labor for it. It was obvious to all, and especially Hockey, that the RBA would pay back this dividend over time, which is what will happen. The fact that the Australian dollar is tracking in the low US70c range has meant a massive windfall to the RBA, meaning that the annual dividends to the government are likely to be $2bn or more in each of the next few years. So where does this all leave the budget? The short answer is a near-term surplus, barring some hare-brained spending or tax cuts from Malcolm Turnbull. The May budget estimates were projecting a budget deficit of only $6.9bn in 2018-19. Based on recent data, the better than forecast state of the labour market and likely chunky dividend payments from the RBA, next month\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) could well show 2018-19 being in surplus. To be sure, there are many other moving parts in the budget \u2013 the weak iron ore and coal prices, for example, are dampening revenue \u2013 but the lower Australian dollar is working the other way. Account also needs to be taken of decisions of the government and the Senate, which has blocked some of the budget measures, and these will be vital to the bottom line. The big test will come next month when Morrison releases the regular Myefo. This will incorporate all of the updated data for the budget and new forecasts for the economy which will underpin the estimates of government spending and revenue. Unless there are reckless spending decisions, the budget bottom line will have smaller deficits than those assumed at budget time. As a final aside, this budget \u201crepair\u201d goes to the issue of tax reform. As economic efficiency gains would be completely extinguished if the revenue from a GST increase is merely recycled back into the community via welfare and income tax compensation and a lower company tax rate, and with the budget already on track to hit a surplus, why disrupt the functioning of the economy with tax reform only those with a vested interest are lobbying for?

    "webTitle": "Consumer confidence slumps to its lowest level since summer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumers confidence slumped last month to its lowest level since the summer as British households expressed concerns about the prospects for the economy next year. The GfK consumer confidence index dropped one point to +1 from the previous month and a high of +7 in July, after respondents said the prospects for the global economy had weakened. The market research company\u2019s survey echoed a poll by YouGov/Cebr, which said its consumer confidence index dropped by 0.7 points from September and now stands at 113.6 \u2013 its lowest figure since June. A spokesman for GfK said that while consumers have benefited from the boost to disposable incomes from rock-bottom inflation, falling fuel prices and higher wages growth, \u201cconfidence appears to be depressed by a combination of wider economic, political and social events\u201d. Since the summer, when China signalled that its strong growth of previous years was beginning to wane, stock markets have remained volatile. Figures showing global trade and the forecasts for global growth have fallen. Signals from the European Central Bank that it will need to embark on a third major stimulus of the eurozone economy and warnings of an interest rate rise in the US have also unnerved markets. Scott Corfe, associate director at the Cebr economic consultancy, said: \u201cThese are uncertain times for UK consumers. The economic picture is still quite blurry, with positive news \u2013 such as encouraging employment figures \u2013 usually matched by an unwelcome development \u2013 like the increase in the UK\u2019s budget deficit in October compared with a year ago. \u201cThis flux is perhaps reflected in November\u2019s consumer confidence measures, with many people growing more worried about the future. Consumer confidence is still relatively high, but it is not without its fragilities.\u201d The falls in consumer confidence came as the CBI reported that the services industry improved in the three months to November, but at a slower pace than seen in the previous quarter. The business lobby group said the volume and value of consumer services \u2013 which includes hotels, bars, restaurants, travel and leisure firms \u2013 saw steady and strong growth. Weaker growth was experienced by business and professional services \u2013 which includes accountancy, legal and marketing firms. They expanded at the slowest pace since 2013. While cost pressures eased in this sector, they rose at the fastest pace in eight years across consumer services firms. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said: \u201cThe UK services sector\u2019s good run continues, and it\u2019s encouraging that business volumes are expanding across the board, and that companies still expect healthy growth in profits. \u201cEmployment growth is expected to slow a little in the quarter ahead, and given concerns over a lack of skilled workers \u2013 remaining close to a seven-year high in business and professional services \u2013 companies are increasingly looking to invest in new technologies that could raise their productivity.\u201d",

Figures showing global trade and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/slowing-growth-china-commodities-global-economy\">the forecasts for global growth</a> have fallen. </p> <p>Signals from the European Central Bank that it will need to embark on a third major stimulus of the eurozone economy and warnings of an interest rate rise in the US have also unnerved markets.</p> <p>Scott Corfe, associate director at the Cebr economic consultancy, said: \u201cThese are uncertain times for UK consumers. The economic picture is still quite blurry, with positive news \u2013 such as encouraging employment figures \u2013 usually matched by an unwelcome development \u2013 like the increase in the UK\u2019s budget deficit in October compared with a year ago. </p> <p>\u201cThis flux is perhaps reflected in November\u2019s consumer confidence measures, with many people growing more worried about the future. Consumer confidence is still relatively high, but it is not without its fragilities.\u201d</p> <p>The falls in consumer confidence came as the CBI reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/british-service-sector-back-in-growth-according-to-latest-data\">the services industry</a> improved in the three months to November, but at a slower pace than seen in the previous quarter.<br></p> <p>The business lobby group said the volume and value of consumer services \u2013 which includes hotels, bars, restaurants, travel and leisure firms \u2013 saw steady and strong growth.</p> <p>Weaker growth was experienced by business and professional services \u2013 which includes accountancy, legal and marketing firms. They expanded at the slowest pace since 2013.</p> <p>While cost pressures eased in this sector, they rose at the fastest pace in eight years across consumer services firms.</p> <p>Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said: \u201cThe UK services sector\u2019s good run continues, and it\u2019s encouraging that business volumes are expanding across the board, and that companies still expect healthy growth in profits.</p> <p>\u201cEmployment growth is expected to slow a little in the quarter ahead, and given concerns over a lack of skilled workers \u2013 remaining close to a seven-year high in business and professional services \u2013 companies are increasingly looking to invest in new technologies that could raise their productivity.\u201d</p>",
