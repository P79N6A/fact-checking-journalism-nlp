      "bodyText": "A \u00a32.8bn government scheme funded by energy bill payers which aims to keep the lights on in Britain has been condemned as wasteful, expensive and \u201cunfit for purpose\u201d in a damning report. The claims from the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) comes on the day that one of the UK\u2019s biggest coal-fired power stations, Ferrybridge, formally closes, with several others threatening to follow. There was also a new warning from a leading academic and adviser to energy regulator Ofgem that Britain\u2019s electricity supply is facing \u201ccrunch time\u201d this coming winter. Under the Capacity Market scheme, more than \u00a3370m alone has been paid to coal plants that are simultaneously being hit by a higher carbon price floor, ensuring \u201cconsumers are hit by a double whammy, paying for two subsidies,\u201d warns the IPPR. \u201cThe government rightly wants to secure the country\u2019s power supply. But its primary mechanism for doing so is failing to meet any of the government\u2019s own objectives. It is absurd that consumers are paying for subsidies to the most polluting forms of generation such as diesel and coal while in a separate policy also paying to discourage them,\u201d said Byron Orme, IPPR research fellow and author of the report. Orme believes a revamped scheme should not support the most polluting plants such as diesel generators, provide proper support for demand reduction schemes and halt support for existing nuclear reactors. \u201cThe Capacity Market needs fundamental reform if the lights are to be kept on at reasonable cost to households and businesses.\u201d The government has itself been changing the Capacity Market gradually in new efforts to incentivise energy companies to keep their electricity generation levels up amid the growing number of plant closures. It said it was doing enough to ensure the lights were kept on. \u201cWe are clear that providing a secure supply of affordable energy for our families and businesses is non-negotiable,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. \u201cThe closure of Ferrybridge was announced last May, sometime before reforms to the Capacity Market were set out. These reforms will ensure that the Capacity Market remains fit for the purpose of securing our energy supply by bringing forward new power stations as older, less efficient, plants close.\u201d National Grid, which has the job of balancing power demand and supply, said it was continuing to monitor the situation with regard to next winter. Power company SSE confirmed the closure of the Ferrybridge coal-fired power station in Yorkshire but said that its Fiddlers Ferry plant in Cheshire might apply for subsidies on offer for 2016-17. Last week the Longannet coal-fired power plant in Scotland ended production while the Rugeley facility in Staffordshire, operated by Engie of France, is scheduled to switch off this summer. Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change policy at University College London and an adviser to Ofgem, said he believed the demand-supply margin was still very close. \u201cWith the first backup under the capacity mechanism not in place until next year, this winter coming will be the crunch time for the UK\u2019s electricity transition,\u201d he said. \u201cYet despite the tight margins, extreme weather is still far more likely to cause any household disconnections than insufficient generating capacity.\u201d Paul Massara, former chief executive of the major energy supplier RWE npower, said that the closure of coal-fired power stations might have drastically narrowed the gap between demand and supply, but that they needed to go nonetheless. \u201cThe phase-out of coal-fired power stations in the UK is a good thing, for a number of reasons. Coal hasn\u2019t been paying its way for some time now, notably in terms of its impact on air pollution and the climate. The targets we face for keeping levels of global warming within \u2018safe\u2019 levels also mean that coal, as the most polluting of all fossil fuels, has to go as quickly as possible, not just here but across Europe,\u201d he said. Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said the ministers needed a rethink. \u201cThe UK government has taken the right approach by announcing a coal phase-out, but they forgot about the other half of the job. What Britain badly needs are clear, robust policies to drive more investment in clean energy and power-saving technologies. \u201cWhat we have instead is a random collection of pet projects, like the Hinkley nuclear reactor and fracking, that are going nowhere, with highly polluting diesel farms thrown in to plug the gap.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has flown back to Britain for emergency talks with ministers over the financial crisis engulfing Tata Steel\u2019s British operation \u2013 amid warnings that the firm has just weeks to secure a rescue deal on which up to 40,000 jobs could depend. The Indian-owned company said it was losing \u00a31m a day, with a source claiming that the government\u2019s failure to back calls in Europe for higher tariffs against cheap Chinese imports was the \u201clast straw\u201d, prompting the decision to sell the business that was once British Steel and more recently Corus. Labour accused the government of being in \u201cdisarray\u201d as Cameron and his business secretary, Sajid Javid, scrambled back to the UK after Tata announced it would be selling off British plants including the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales as well as sites at Rotherham in South Yorkshire, Corby in Northamptonshire and Shotton in Deeside. Jeremy Corbyn has urged Cameron to treat the unfolding situation as a national crisis by recalling parliament and considering bringing Britain\u2019s ailing steel industry back into public ownership. However, Javid rejected the idea of nationalisation, which government officials believe will carry a pricetag of \u00a31.5bn a year. \u201cI don\u2019t think that nationalisation is going to be the solution,\u201d said Javid. \u201cI think everyone would want a long-term viable solution and, if you look around Europe and elsewhere, I think nationalisation is rarely the answer, particularly if you take into account the big challenges the industry faces.\u201d But the government is thought to be considering other forms of aid, including stepping in with temporary financial support during the search for a buyer. The prime minister will travel to Washington DC on Thursday where dozens of world leaders are gathering for the Nuclear Security Summit, hosted by the US president, Barack Obama. Cameron is expected to raise the issue of Tata Steel with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The financial problems facing Tata are so significant that the value of its British steel operations are now \u201calmost zero\u201d. The company source said Tata was now prepared to \u201cgive it away for nothing\u201d. They warned that Tata had tried and failed to find a buyer over the past 18 months because of the amount of money needed to get the company back on track. \u201cThey have spent nearly \u00a34bn in the last eight years. It would need another \u00a34bn.\u201d The company\u2019s pension costs are a \u201chuge problem\u201d, they added, with Tata warning last year that it faced a \u00a32bn pension deficit in the UK. The decision to sell the operation could cost 15,000 jobs inside the company but the thinktank IPPR said that up to 40,000 could be affected more widely across the supply chain. Tata\u2019s decision came after Javid opposed calls last month to scrap a regulation known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which would have allowed the EU to increase tariffs on Chinese steel beyond the current 9%. The government said this would lead to higher costs for users of steel and was not a proportionate response. The government was also accused of failing to support British industry last year when it emerged that the Ministry of Defence would use Swedish steel for a multibillion pound contract for armoured cars and ships. Officials said rules had been changed to make that less likely in future. Labour was able to dominate the debate about the future of Britain\u2019s steelworks because key government figures were out of the country when the decision was taken by Tata\u2019s board late on Tuesday. Cameron was on holiday in Lanzarote, while Javid was in Australia, despite knowing that the decision was likely to be made this week. Photographs of the business secretary at a black tie dinner in Sydney on Wednesday proved embarrassing for the government. George Osborne is in Paris for G20 talks, where he will raise the issue of Tata Steel with European counterparts. Corbyn cut short a holiday in the UK to head to the Port Talbot plant. He wrote to the prime minister to warn that the move had put \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d and \u201ca strategic UK-wide industry\u201d at risk. \u201cSteelworkers and their families will be desperately worried about the uncertainty. The government is in disarray over what action to take. Ministers must act now to protect the steel industry, which is at the heart of manufacturing in Britain and vital to its future,\u201d he added. He accused the government of flip-flopping because of a suggestion from the minister Anna Soubry that part-nationalisation would be considered as part of a rescue. Corbyn said he was shocked to hear Javid pull the option off the table. Roy Rickhuss of the Community trade union said: \u201cSeeing confusion and mixed messages from ministers will only increase the worry of steelworkers across the UK. \u201cThe fact that one minute they are saying they are looking at all the options and the next they\u2019re saying some form of nationalisation is not a solution shows a government divided and without the political will to take the tough action necessary to save our industry.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, where the Port Talbot plant is located, travelled with Rickhuss to Mumbai for last-minute talks with Tata, in which they tried to persuade the company to consider keeping hold of the operations. He said the government had not offered support to the delegation and accused ministers of failing to take action to protect British steel, which has been in decline as a result of Chinese dumping. \u201cWe are rolling out the red carpet for Beijing,\u201d he said, arguing that Britain \u2013 and particularly Osborne \u2013 was pushing for China to get market economy status at the World Trade Organisation despite the fact that the vast majority of its steel industry was state-owned. He described Britain as a \u201cringleader\u201d in blocking European commission attempts to improve anti-dumping policies. \u201cThey are in hock to China. Our commercial policy, our approach to trade and manufacturing, and our overall industrial strategy, is being dictated by Beijing.\u201d Javid spoke on the phone with the Tata Steel chairman, Cyrus Mistry, in what sources called a \u201cconstructive\u201d conversation. The prime minister spoke to the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, to discuss the \u201curgent\u201d situation. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cBoth the PM and first minister agreed it was an extremely worrying time for the workers and wider community in Port Talbot, and south Wales more broadly. They also agreed that the UK and Welsh governments would continue to work together closely to do everything possible to secure the future of steelmaking at Port Talbot and elsewhere in the UK. \u201cThe PM and first minister pledged to work to support a sales process that delivers a sustainable long-term future for the plant. They also agreed to remain in close contact in the days ahead at both official and ministerial level.\u201d The situation has been seized on by Brexit campaigners with Labour MP Kate Hoey saying EU \u201cregulations on energy production are killing our steel industry\u201d. But Remain supporters say Britain was the country holding back the EU from taking action against China. Port Talbot, and other Tata sites with blast furnaces that actually make steel, are understood be particularly at risk because the financial losses are so large. Senior staff at Port Talbot are thought to be willing to launch a management buyout, but this is likely to need the unions to agree to cuts to the pension scheme and financial support from the government. Tata has written off \u00a32bn from the value of its UK assets, meaning they are effectively worthless. Koushik Chatterjee, the finance director of Tata Steel, said the UK business had become \u201cquite a burden for the company\u201d and that the board had decided \u201cwe can\u2019t sustain this kind of exposure\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The Port Talbot steelworks faces a race against time to secure its survival and save thousands of jobs, with Tata Steel looking to resolve the future of its UK business within weeks as it emerged that billions of pounds are needed to make it viable. About 15,000 jobs are at risk in Tata Steel\u2019s UK business and a further 25,000 in the supply chain after the Indian company revealed plans to pull out of the country. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is on his way home from Australia to tackle the crisis, and David Cameron is also returning from a holiday in Lanzarote. A senior source close to Tata said there were weeks rather than months to agree a rescue deal, with Port Talbot and the wider UK business losing significantly more than \u00a31m every day. The financial problems facing Port Talbot are so significant that Tata is ready to \u201cgive it away for nothing\u201d, the source said. However, they warned that Tata had been trying to find a buyer for the UK steel division for 18 months and there were no candidates willing to press ahead with a deal, with billions of pounds needed to get the business back on track. \u201cThey have spent nearly \u00a34bn in the last eight years,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt would need another \u00a34bn.\u201d The company\u2019s pension costs are a \u201chuge problem\u201d, they added. Tata warned last year that it faced a \u00a32bn pension deficit in the UK. The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of \u00a314.5bn, according to its latest accounts. The trustees of the pension scheme said on Wednesday night that they would seek talks with Tata and are in contact with the Pensions Regulator about the crisis. The comments highlight the grave situation facing Port Talbot, the UK\u2019s largest steelworks, and will add to the pressure for the government to step in with support. Tata has worked closely with the government over the last few months but decided to pull out of the UK after the government refused to back calls in Europe for higher tariffs against Chinese steel imports. The source said this was the \u201clast straw\u201d for the company. Javid opposed calls last month to scrap a regulation known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which would have allowed the EU to increase tariffs on Chinese steel beyond the 9% they sit at. The government said this would lead to higher costs for users of steel and was not a proportionate response. The chances of Tata keeping hold of its UK steel operations are thought to be extremely slim, meaning the options are a sale of the entire business to one buyer, a breakup of the business to different buyers, or the closure of all the sites. \u201cIt is losing more than \u00a31m a day. Put yourself in their shoes,\u201d the source added. \u201cThey are in trouble with the stock exchange in India.\u201d Port Talbot, and other Tata sites with blast furnaces that actually make steel, are understood to be particularly at risk because the financial losses are so large. The management at Port Talbot is thought to be willing to launch a management buyout, but this is likely to need the unions to agree to cuts to the pension scheme and financial support from the government. Tata has written off \u00a32bn from the value of its UK assets, meaning they are effectively worthless. Koushik Chatterjee, the finance director of Tata Steel, said the UK business had become \u201cquite a burden for the company\u201d and that the board had decided \u201cwe can\u2019t sustain this kind of exposure\u201d. Liberty House, which has agreed to buy Tata sites in Scotland, said its interest in the business would depend on support from Tata and the government. It said: \u201cLike others in the industry we will have to take time to reflect on Tata\u2019s announcement and its implications. The scale and timing of yesterday\u2019s decision was much more dramatic than anyone was expecting. While the downstream operations will be of interest, we\u2019re clear that taking on the iron and steelmaking facilities present a huge challenge. \u201cWe have shown in Scotland that we are capable of working constructively with all stakeholders to achieve a positive outcome. Our engagement will depend very much on what Tata and the government are prepared to do to help save these businesses.\u201d Greybull Capital, an investment firm, is in the process of buying Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe plant and is thought to be keen to focus on that deal at this stage, rather than buying more from the Indian company. Jeremy Corbyn has called for parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis facing the steel industry. The Labour leader, who visited Port Talbot on Wednesday afternoon, described the government as being \u201cin disarray\u201d in a letter to David Cameron calling for the recall of MPs from the Easter break. Corbyn has already cut short his holiday in Devon. The government is considering providing financial support for Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, including Port Talbot, to allow time for a buyer to be found. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said the government was prepared to look at a number of options to save Tata\u2019s British business, which employs 4,000 people at Port Talbot. The IPPR thinktank has claimed that at least 40,000 jobs are at risk from the crisis, including 15,000 at Tata Steel and 25,000 posts in the supply chain. Corbyn said: \u201cThe news that Tata is preparing to pull out of steelmaking in Britain puts thousands of jobs across the country and a strategic UK-wide industry at risk. MPs must have the chance now to debate the future of steel and hold ministers to account for their failure to intervene. \u201cSteelworkers and their families will be desperately worried about the uncertainty. The government is in disarray over what action to take. Ministers must act now to protect the steel industry, which is at the heart of manufacturing in Britain and vital to its future.\u201d The prime minister has been on holiday in Lanzarote while George Osborne is also out of the country and heading to Paris for a meeting of the G20 finance ministers. Javid is flying back from a ministerial trip to Australia and is understood to have spoken to the Tata Group chairman, Cyrus Mistry, on Wednesday morning. The business secretary is \u201cmonitoring the situation closely and getting regular updates\u201d, according to a government source. But Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose south Wales constituency of Aberavon includes Port Talbot, accused the government of \u201cabject failure\u201d in not standing up for the industry before Tata decided to pull out of the UK. One option under consideration is for the government to step in with temporary funding to keep Port Talbot open if a sale looks likely, but any fuller form of nationalisation is said to be off the table. Tata Steel, part of the Indian Tata conglomerate, announced late on Tuesday night that its board had rejected a turnaround plan for Port Talbot. Instead, it decided to sell the UK business, which includes the remnants of British Steel. Union leaders travelled to Mumbai to discuss the company\u2019s UK business, hoping that Tata would agree to a turnaround plan to keep steelmaking in Port Talbot and at other UK plants. The decision to sell will affect other Tata plants, including Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up our live blog coverage (for now) of the steel crisis. At this point, the Port Talbot steelworks still faces a race against time to secure its survival and save thousands of jobs, with Tata Steel looking to resolve the future of its UK business within weeks as it emerged that billions of pounds are needed to make it viable. About 15,000 jobs are at risk in Tata Steel\u2019s UK business and a further 25,000 in the supply chain after the Indian company revealed plans to pull out of the country. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is on his way home from Australia to tackle the crisis, and David Cameron is also returning from a holiday in Lanzarote. It would be foolish to pretend that there would be no problem facing steelmaking in Britain that determined state intervention could not solve, according to a Guardian editorial. It adds, however, that government should not be let off the hook: There are things it could and should do to defend UK steel \u2013 and things earlier governments should have done too. David Cameron may have told the industry minister Anna Soubry to do everything she could to keep steel alive. But the industry secretary, Sajid Javid, who rightly cut short a visit to Australia, is a laissez-faire Tory who has not shown much interest. After the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese steel, the EU could have followed suit, but the UK appears not to have voted for them. It concludes If we think the steel industry is important enough \u2013 which it is \u2013 and if industrial strategy is more than a slogan \u2013 and it ought to be \u2013 government must intervene to calm the uncertainties in the public interest. This is not a time for dogma. It is a time for a practical rescue plan and an overdue long-term commitment. As the business secretary flies back from Australia, here\u2019s Kipper Williams on the Port Talbot steel crisis: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s petition calling for David Cameron to recall parliament over the Tata steel crisis has taken a fairly big jump in the past few hours. It\u2019s now close to 50,000. Hitting 100,000 presents the vista of MPs potentially having to come back from their holidays. It looks like a calm evening in Port Talbot, where evening shift workers have been clocking on (picture via Alex Thomson of Channel 4 News) Remember Corbynomics? Richard Murphy, the man behind that radical policy platform insists that the money to save steel in the UK could come from \u2018People\u2019s Quantitative Easing\u2019 - the policy of using money created by the Bank of England to invest in public infrastructure projects, at the same time as boosting employment and economic growth. Murphy hasn\u2019t quite been as prominent in recent times in the formation of economic strategy on the part of the Labour leadership. More now from Jeremy Corbyn in Port Talbot, where it was put to him by Jon Snow of Channel 4 News that the crisis is essentially a \u201cgreat collision between a polluting industry and [the Labuor leader\u2019s] commitment to saving the environment.\u201d Isn\u2019t the problem a question of \u2018green taxes\u2019 which make steel production more expenseive? Corbyn said he did not necessarily agree that such a collision was taking place, adding: \u201cThis is an efficient industry. This is an industry that recycles a lot of the products it produces.\u201d The Labour leader reiterated his view that it may be time to look at the \u201clack of regulation\u201d and suggested that steel imported from countries that do not have similar environmental standards (ie China) should be prevented from coming in. He added: You can turn this into a collective good by saying that any imported steel should have the same conditions which the steel are subject to in this country. Vince Cable, the former holder of Sajid Javid\u2019s post of secretary of state for business, innovation and skill, has been offering his views on the crisis, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s not be dogmatic about it\u201d. What followed from the former Liberal Democrat MP was a straight forward appeal for the government to intervene. He told Sky News: \u201cIt might be that a term period of public ownership is necessary as part of the transition\u201d. Cable cited the example of the measures taken by the Scottish government last week to facilitate the acquisition of two former Tata mills by the commodities investor Liberty House. \u201cIt may be that someone of that nature may be required in Wales,\u201d said Cable. He was asked if such an arrangement would be hugely expensive. The reply: Whatever happens I\u2019m afraid the tax payer is going to be in line for big losses. If many thousands of people lose their jobs there is goin to be an enormous cost in the communities.. workers will beed training... the whole transitional process is going to be very costly. The crisis continues provide a new theatre of battle in EU referendum hostilities, particularly for \u2018vote leave\u2019 campaigners. Here\u2019s a tweet from Tory MP William Wragg The Leave.EU campaign have meanwhile put this together: The West Cumbrian Labour MP, Jamie Reed, has published a letter he has written to David Cameron in which he tells the prime minister that the government has a \u201cresponsibility to intervene\u201d on behalf of communities affected by market failures: Communities cannot be left to suffer the decline of market failure as a result of Government\u2019s reluctance to intervene. The cumulative and knock-on impact of a closure of a facility such as Chapelbank on the local economy would be felt for years to come and the Government has a duty to ensure this does not happen. Reflecting on his own area, Reed said that Tata\u2019s Chapelbank site in Workington, West Cumbria has been a critical part of the Energy Coast economy for decades despite facing repeated challenges: The facility plays a key role in the nuclear sector in the region and, through work with supply chain businesses in the area and major nuclear partners, helps to maintain and expand the skills base necessary to cement West Cumbria\u2019s place as world leaders in nuclear engineering. Meanwhile, this is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog from Graeme Wearden. A quick recap of the last few hours. David Cameron has called a crisis meeting for Thursday morning, to discuss the future of the steel industry. The prime minister is cutting short his holiday to address the deepening crisis caused by Tata\u2019s decision to sell its UK operations. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is visiting the Port Talbot steelworks tonight. He urged the government to intervene, and commit to using British steel for domestic infrastructure projects. Industry insiders have warned that Tata\u2019s operations in the UK need billions of pounds of investment. There is also little time left to reach a deal, they warn. More than 20,000 people have now signed Corbyn\u2019s petition, calling for parliament to be recalled. Downing Street is resisting pressure to summon MPs back from their Easter break, though. Business secretary Sajid Javid is flying home to the UK. He was forced to cancel his trip to Australia, shortly after addressing a black-tie dinner. Javid has suggested that nationalising the steel industry probably isn\u2019t the solution to the crisis. That will disappoint unions, and some Tory MPs, who believe the goverment must step in to save at least 40,000 jobs. Dave Hulse, from the GMB union, isn\u2019t impressed with the government\u2019s performance today. \u201cDavid Cameron should be ashamed of himself for ruling out a recall of Parliament. He makes out that the Government cares about working people but this clearly confirms that holidays are more important than the members we represent and the communities that they come from. Hulse also urges Sajid Javid to rethink his claim that nationalisation isn\u2019t the answer: If he is committed to doing the right thing then he has to rethink and listen to everyone connected with the steel industry or our steel manufacturing base will be lost forever.\u201d (thanks to the Press Association for the quotes) Downing Street has now issued a statement, confirming there are \u201cno plans\u201d to recall MPs from their holidays to discuss the steel crisis. A spokesperson says: Ministers will continue to hold briefings to update representatives of other parties on the situation but we have no plans to recall Parliament. Our focus is on finding a long-term sustainable future for steel making at Port Talbot and across the UK. Industry insiders have told The Guardian that Tata\u2019s UK steel operations need billions of pounds of investment. My colleague Graham Ruddick has also heard concerns about Tata\u2019s pension costs. He reports: A senior source close to Tata said there were weeks rather than months to agree a rescue deal, with Port Talbot and the wider UK business losing significantly more than \u00a31m every day. The financial problems facing Port Talbot are so significant that Tata is ready to \u201cgive it away for nothing\u201d, the source said. However, they warned that Tata had been trying to find a buyer for the UK steel division for 18 months and there were no candidates willing to press ahead with a deal, with billions of pounds needed to get the business back on track. \u201cThey have spent nearly \u00a34bn in the last eight years,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt would need another \u00a34bn.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Jeremy Corbyn is now speaking to Sky News in Port Talbot. He warns that Britain risks losing a century of steelmaking expertise, if the government does not step in to rescue the industry. I suggest that the government listen to what people who have given their lives to the steel industry are saying, says Corbyn. Does the government really want to be remembered for allowing the steel industry to be recalled, he asks. Steel workers believe there is a future for this industry, and so do I, the Labour leader continues. But there must be a declaration from the UK government that it is prepared to step in and save the steel industry. The word from Downing Street is that the government is \u201ccompletely focused\u201d on working with Tata, the trade unions and other interested parties, to deliver a \u201csustainable future\u201d for the plant at Port Talbot, and the wider industry. Here\u2019s a clip of Jeremy Corbyn speaking in Port Talbot: Jeremy Corbyn is meeting with steel workers in a social club in Port Talbot right now. He also addressed them, warning that the future of the industry is at stake. The Labour leader says: If we don\u2019t intervene to protect this steel works, and the other steel works, we will have no steel industry in Britain. We will see a continual running down of our manufacturing capacity. We will no longer be able to call ourselves a proper manufacturing economy without a steel industry that goes with it. Our call to the government is \u2018intervene now\u2019 to protect these plants. (earlier typo corrected) Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has just spoken to the steel workers in Port Talbot. Corbyn says he is in Wales to \u201ctry and save our steel industry\u201d, declaring: In saving our steel industry we\u2019re saving the future, for thousands of families not only in Port Talbot but all over the country. The steel industry is vital for the country, he continues, as its products are used in so many other industries, from food and drink to the railways. And Corbyn also challenges the government to give steel more support - and a pledge to use British steel for infrastructure projects. He says: We need a government that is prepared to intervene and say there should be strategic produrement of steel from steelworks in Britain for the railways, the bridges and the buildings and all the other things we are constructing in this country. More in a moment... Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has now arrived in Port Talbot to meet with steel workers. That was quick! Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s petition for parliament to be recalled to debate the steel crisis has reached 10,000 signatures after just two hours. This means the government has to officially respond: Unofficially, Downing Street has already been telling reporters that there are no plans to bring MPs back from their Easter break. The petition is here: Call on David Cameron to act to protect our steel industry &amp; recall Parliament David Cameron is planning to speak by phone to Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones later this afternoon, government insiders say. He\u2019s then expected to hold the crisis meeting in London tomorrow morning. A couple more photos from Sajid Javid\u2019s (flying) visit to Australia: Is this the moment that the business secretary decided to cut his Australia trip short?.... Earlier today we asked Guardian readers to give their views on the steel crisis (here). We asked three different questions - here\u2019s our pick of the responses... Q1: How do you think the British and Welsh governments should react to Tata Steel\u2019s intentions? The government should intervene and purchase Tata steel - at a good negotiated price. This is not about globalization, it is about China dumping its own product. This is also a strategic sector. Allowing the Chinese to take control of the market through irregular means would place the UK in a disadvantaged position. This effort should also signal the UK\u2019s decision to act through its own policy and also signal intent to get EU to act in defence of the sector and open-market policies: not to allow these types of market distorting behaviours. Until China and other countries act fairly, the UK should protect its industry. Name withheld, England Given that there is no way that we can compete with the global cheapness of the steel imports, I feel we should let the market take its course and let the plant go. The money we would have spent trying to save a dying industry we can reinvest in training and creating new jobs in an area where the UK is now leading the way, finance. Keith Penfold, Haywards Heath It\u2019s all too easy to shut these plants down and put the work force out on the street. It is a financial decision for the moment but steel prices will rise and when it does the UK will have a gun to its head because foreign suppliers will know that we have not got the plants to switch back on. All of this will cost the country dear in the long term. I am just an ordinary retired working bloke but even I can see the devastating effects this will have on our great country. From a lifetime Conservative voter come on Mr Cameron, these are very special circumstances. Name withheld, Worcestershire Q2: What do you think the impact will be on communities near to the existing steel works? If steelworks are allowed to close the effect on communities will be as devastating as that of the mines closing. Communities which are dependent on one industry take decades to recover during which time health, education and welfare all suffer irreversible damage. Liz Taylor, Bristol Q3: Summarise in one sentence, if you can, what the steel industry means to you The steel industry means nothing to me personally, but as a nation we depend on having our own steel production for so many of the things we do : we cannot afford to lose the skills and plant to enable us to be independent in steel production. Andy Miles, Leicestershire Like chimney sweeps, an outdated occupation. Sean Kirby, East Yorks Britain\u2019s steel industry was once the envy of the world. But in recent decades, it has experienced economic problems, industrial disputes, privatisation, mergers, and relentless competition from abroad. Here\u2019s a two-minute history: Business secretary Sajid Javid has spoken to reporters in Australia, before leaping on a flight back to the UK. He said steel was \u201cabsolutely vital for the country\u201d, but wasn\u2019t convinced that nationalisation was the solution. Here\u2019s the full statement: \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the situation. I think it\u2019s absolutely clear that the UK steel industry is absolutely vital for the country and we will look at all viable options to keep steel making continuing in Port Talbot. We are also very much alive to the human cost and we want to make sure no worker is left behind so where workers are affected that we are doing everything we possibly can to help them and their families.\u201d \u201cAt this stage, given the announcement from Tata has just come out, it\u2019s important I think we talk to them properly and understand the exact situation and we look at all viable option. I don\u2019t think nationalisation is going to be the solution because I think everyone would want a long-term viable solution. \u201cAnd if you look around Europe and elsewhere I think nationalisation is rarely the answer, particularly if you take into account the big challenges the industry faces.\u201d The government says it has no plans to recall parliament to discuss the steel crisis, despite Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s request earlier today. The petition to recall MPs back from their holidays has already attracted 5,000 signatures in the first hour. You can sign here. ITV\u2019s deputy political editor Chris Ship reports that Sajid Javid\u2019s cabinet colleagues will be pleased to see him back: Sajid Javid - the business secretary - is on his way home from Australia to tackle the crisis, while David Cameron is also returning from a holiday in Lanzarote. Downing Street sources said the prime minister was always due to fly home today, but he is now expected to meet with ministers tomorrow for an emergency meeting to discuss the Tata Steel decision. After that, he will head to Washington DC for the Nuclear Security Summit. Javid has been forced to cut short a trip to Australia, during which he was going to attend a meeting on cyber security tomorrow. Newsflash: Business secretary Sajid Javid is abandoning his trip to Australia to help tackle the steel crisis. The Press Association explains: Business Secretary Sajid Javid is cutting short his trip to Australia and returning to the UK because of the steel crisis, his office has said. This follows the criticism from Labour that he left the country when the crisis over steel industry was unfolding. Tom Newton Dunn of The Sun reckons it\u2019s a sensible decision: Javid was due to address a business lunch tomorrow, but is now facing a long flight home... The steel crisis has lead to the surprising sight of Conservative MPs supporting state ownership of the industry. Asked about nationalisation, David Davies, who chairs the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, said \u201cI\u2019m not against that idea at all\u201d. He told Radio 4\u2019s World At One that: We do need to have a viable steel industry in this country. It\u2019s very important from a defence point of view. Here\u2019s the clip: Tory MP \u2018not against\u2019 nationalising UK steel industry Tom Pursglove, Tory MP for Corby, is also backing the \u201csave our Steel\u201d campaign. There is a Tata plant in his constituency, and Pursglove is arguing that all option should be considered: Jeremy Corbyn has created a petition to encourage David Cameron to recall parliament. It\u2019s currently got 178 signatures. Sorry, make that 189 , 198, 208.... The UK government is under mounting pressure to help the British steel industry, after Indian conglomerate Tata announced plans to sell its operations across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has demanded that parliament is recalled from its Easter break. He accused the government of being \u201cin disarray\u201d, and urged David Cameron to convene an urgent meeting on the issue. Corbyn declared: Ministers must act now to protect the steel industry, which is at the heart of manufacturing in Britain and vital to its future.\u201d Corbyn has now cut his own holiday, in Devon, short, to head to South Wales - apparently tweeting on his way: Wales first minister, Carwyn Jones, has put the wheels in motion to recall the Welsh Assembly next Monday Government minister Anna Soubry has insisted that the government is committed to British steel, and will consider all options. Speaking on Radio 4, Soubry appeared to suggest that partial nationalisation is an option, if Tata\u2019s UK sites can be sold to another company. Soubry also pleaded with Tata to give Britain time to find a buyer for Tata\u2019s sites, including at Port Talbot, Rotherham, and Scunthorpe. She said: \u201cThat is our priority, to look for a buyer. But we are being realistic about the state of the industry.\u201d Downing Street insiders have told us that financial support is possible, but full nationalisation is not on the table. Business secretary Sajid Javid has been criticised for flying to Australia for an official trip. Shadow minister John Healey has called on Javid to head home, but the government insists Javid is in full control. The IPPR think tank has warned that 40,000 jobs are at stake - 15,000 at Tata, and another 25,000 in the supply chain. Several unions have urged the government to consider partial nationalisation. And the British Chambers of Commerce has also weighed in, saying everything possible should be done. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Port Talbot, has revealed that Tata\u2019s top management were frustrated with the UK government. He told The Guardian that Britain had \u201crolled out the red carpet\u201d to Beijing, rather than clamping down on cheap steel imports. The steel crisis is also threatening to merge with another political hot potato, the EU referendum. Brexit campaigners are blaming Brussels for imposing too many regulations on the steel industry, and for helping Chinese steel makers to undercut British slab makers. Attention, Port Talbot. Jeremy Corbyn is heading your way... Ben Wright of the Press Association is tweeting the scene at Port Talbot - from the media circus to the homes of worried steel workers: My colleague Graham Ruddick has analysed the crisis facing the steel industry, and explained why it can\u2019t all be blamed on Europe: Would Brexit really help the steel industry, as campaigners are claiming? One counter-argument is that UK industry would find it harder to sell products to the continent if Britain left the EU, especially if punitive tariffs were imposed. That weaker demand could feed through to the steel industry. And although Brexit would allow Britain to slap much higher tariffs on cheap Chinese steel, that might not be a brilliant negotiating strategy if you\u2019re trying to charm Beijing into a new trade deal..... Here\u2019s another sign that Brexit campaigners believe the steel crisis helps their case: Labour MP, and Brexit campaigner, Kate Hoey has blamed Brussels for the plight of the UK steel industry. She writes: \u201cThe EU\u2019s regulations on energy production are killing our steel industry. It is impossible for the UK to compete with non-EU countries like the US, where electricity costs half the price, and Norway, where energy is 25% of the UK price. They unlike us are free from dogmatic, ineffective rules on energy sources. She also criticises the EU for allowing China to \u201cdump cheap steel on European countries\u201d. (Although as we pointed out earlier, Britain actually blocked attempts to raise tariffs on Chinese steel). Hoey also singles out the EU ban on state aid: \u201cThe European Union also ties the UK\u2019s hands on state aid, preventing us from temporarily nationalising the industry under their inflexible single market competition rules. This would allow Port Talbot to ride out the storm until steel prices recover and a new buyer is found. (Reminder: EU rules ban countries from propping up failing companies, but do allow support to boost competitiveness) Jeremy Corbyn has now tweeted a photo of his letter calling for MPs to be recalled to Westminster. No response from @David_Cameron yet.... My colleague Nazia Parveen is meeting with Tata steel workers in Rotherham. They have told her they are desperately worried about their jobs, and urged the government to help. Workers are also unhappy that Chinese steel is being imported and used for local projects, rather than steel milled in the area. Nazia has also met with people who were laid off by Tata recently: As well as recalling parliament, Jeremy Corbyn is asking David Cameron to convene a meeting of all interested parties to discuss the steel crisis. That would include government, unions, and industry groups. The Labour leaders also says that state ownership should be considered: \u201cIf necessary ministers must be prepared to use their powers to take a public stake in steel-making to protect the industry and British manufacturing. The Government must do whatever it takes to save this strategic industry.\u201d Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, tweets that the business secretary must \u2018get a grip\u2019 of the steel crisis. Sajid Javid spoke to Tata Steel chair Cyrus Mistry this morning, we hear. The business secretary is \u201cmonitoring the situation closely and getting regular updates\u201d despite being in Australia, according to a government source. The IPPR think tank has calculated that at least 40,000 jobs are at risk across the steel industry, and in industries that rely on it. That includes 15,000 employed by Tata Steel in the UK, and 25,000 jobs in the supply chain -- at manufacturers and suppliers of iron, coke, petroleum, and machinery used at steel works. In his letter to David Cameron, Jeremy Corbyn urges the government to take urgent action to protect the UK steel industry. The Labour leader says: \u201cThe news that Tata is preparing to pull out of steel-making in Britain puts thousands of jobs across the country and a strategic UK-wide industry at risk. MPs must have the chance now to debate the future of steel and hold ministers to account for their failure to intervene. \u201cSteelworkers and their families will be desperately worried about the uncertainty. The Government is in disarray over what action to take. Ministers must act now to protect the steel industry, which is at the heart of manufacturing in Britain and vital to its future.\u201d Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for the UK parliament to be recalled to debate the steel crisis. That\u2019s via Seumas Milne, Labour\u2019s executive director of strategy and communication: As covered earlier, Wales\u2019s first minister has already asked for the Welsh Assembly to be recalled, for a debate next Monday. The Houses of Parliament are currently on Easter recess, with MPs not due back at their desks until 11 April. But Corbyn has now cut his own holiday short -- he\u2019s been visiting Exmouth, in Devon, where he apparently enjoyed a slice of cake for breakfast. Jeremy Corbyn has his cake and eats it during Exmouth holiday The GMB union has also backed the idea of temporary nationalisation, to protect steel from the current crisis. Dave Hulse, national officer of the GMB, said: We have to look at nationalising the steel industry, even over a short period of time, to protect the assets. Otherwise, we will end up with the same situation we had with SSI in the North East where the Government badly let everyone down. The SSI steelworks in Redcar, Teesside, shut last autumn after its owner went into liquidation, with the loss of 1,700 jobs. The European Commission says Britain hasn\u2019t been in touch about potential support for the steel industry. The EC\u2019s official position is that governments may not use public money to rescue and restructure failing steelmakers. However, EU countries are allowed to boost the global competitiveness of steel companies, by funding research and development or helping with high fuel costs. In January, the EC ordered Belgium to recover \u20ac211m in aid handed to steelmaker Duferco. It also opened a formal probe into claims that Italy had wrongly provided \u20ac2bn to help its Ilva steelworkers to modernise itself. Shadow government minister John Healey has urged business secretary Sajid Javid to cut his trip to Australia short, and head home. Mr Healey said (via the Yorkshire Post): \u201cI want to see the Business Secretary back from Australia to get a grip on the Government\u2019s response and I want to see the Prime Minister saying to the Community union, which has led the charge in this: \u2018yes, I will meet you, yes, I will discuss the future of steelmaking in this country,\u2019 because it is too important for us to lose.\u201d Healey criticised Javid for not flying to India to lobby Tata, ahead of yesterday\u2019s crunch board meeting: \u201cOf course they should have sent a minister to the meeting in Mumbai. The Business Secretary is 6,000 miles away in Australia, but I\u2019m afraid this is characteristic of this Government. They dragged their feet over putting in place a scheme to help with high energy costs and they blocked early moves to stop Chinese dumping in UK and European markets. Then two weeks ago in the Budget they failed to change the business rates system to reflect the investment needed in steelmaking and manufacturing, which the industry, the unions and MPs from all parties have been calling for. More here. The chief executive of Neath Port Talbot Council has also backed the nationalisation of the local steel works, following Tata\u2019s decision not to support its turnaround plan. Interviewed by the Municipal Journal (the MJ), Stephen Phillips said urgent action was needed to preserve jobs at the site, and the surrounding area. Phillips said. \u2018I would support a government acquisition. Frankly, we\u2019re not in a position to pick and choose. If there is a prospect of a sustainable disposal to a third party so be it, if that requires the Government to intervene on a temporary or permanent basis so be it. More here: Chief backs steel plant nationalisation The Unite union is calling for full-scale nationalisation: The FT\u2019s chief political correspondent, Jim Pickard, reckons there are four options on the table to save Britain\u2019s steel industry, and only a few weeks in which to do it. Easing the path to a private sale. This is what happened in Scotland, where the government agreed to briefly own two Tata steel plants before immediately selling them to a new owner. Business minister Anna Soubry has already indicated this option is on the table (despite some initial haziness about the details). However any buyer would need convincing that the steel industry has a bright future, despite Tata warning that conditions have deteriorated. Full nationalisation. Unions and some opposition MPs would support this plan, but it runs against David Cameron\u2019s free-market ethos. But as Jim points out, there is precedent... Supporters of the idea say that it would be no different to the rescue of the big banks after the credit crunch of 2008: the business could be sold on once steel prices recover at some point in the future, they argue. It could also fall foul of EU state aid rules, which prevent government from propping up failing businesses. Part-nationalisation. Taking a stake in Tata UK would provide capital to cover its current losses. It could also potentially help a management/workers buyout. However, Brussels state rules could be problematic. Allow Britain\u2019s steel industry to fail. The government could conclude that steel-making is no longer profitable. This would destroy thousands of jobs across the country, both at steel works and related industries. It would also be politically damaging. As Jim puts it: For the Tory government, the political consequences would be obvious: critics would see it as further proof of its apparent callousness in the face of Britain\u2019s decline in conventional manufacturing. Wales first minister, Carwyn Jones, has called for the Welsh Assembly to be recalled to discuss the crisis. Jones has written to Rosemary Butler, president officer of the Assembly, formally asking for a debate next Monday. The Assembly is currently on its Easter recess. Business minister Anna Soubry is hitting back at critics of her Today Programme interview, via Twitter. As covered earlier, she was asked why Westminster couldn\u2019t copy the Scottish example of buying steel assets from Tata and selling them onto another buyer. Soubry is defending her claim that the Scottish government didn\u2019t actually buy the two plants, because they are being immediately sold on to metals firm Liberty House. The important point, I think, is that the Scottish deal gave Tata reassurance that it would sell the assets, and also allowed Liberty House to avoid a long-winded due diligence process. Political editor Anushka Asthana has the latest word from Westminster about the steel crisis: One option that is likely to be considered is stepping in temporarily with financial support that could keep the site open if a sale looks likely. However, fuller nationalisation is not thought to be under consideration. A Government source said that Tata Steel\u2019s decision to look for a seller did provide more options. \u201cWe will now want to work very hard to support that process. We want to look at ways we ways that we can continue to support Port Talbot.\u201d Ministers do not accept that they have been too soft when it comes to blocking Chinese steel dumping. Officials have argued that granting China market status economy does not stop Europe increasing tariffs on Chinese steel, and claimed that its action in the EU has been to stop changes to a ruling that could harm British consumers in areas other than steel. Britain\u2019s business secretary has been spotted, just 10,000 miles away from Port Talbot. Sajid Javid has been meeting with Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in Sydney to discuss economic ties between the two countries. Important stuff, but thousands of steel workers would probably rather see Javid back home - or lobbying Tata in Mumbai like opposition MP Stephen Kinnock. Javid\u2019s absence leaves the stage free for the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer to step in.... The British Chambers of Commerce has urged Britain\u2019s government to pull out all the stops to save the steel industry. Dr Adam Marshall, the BCC\u2019s acting Director General, argues that other countries would do everything in their power to save such a vital industry. The steel crisis, he says, also shows the downside of globalisation. \u201cAssuring domestic production of steel is hugely important to the UK\u2019s future growth prospects, and to our aspirations for the manufacturing and construction sectors, which are having a hard enough time in an uncertain global market as it is. \u201cThe price the UK pays for dependence on overseas suppliers is often high, particularly in manufacturing and energy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being part of global supply chains, but there is something very wrong with losing domestic production and skills in a strategically-important industry. The loss of steelmaking would leave the UK vulnerable to global shocks, with dangerous consequences across the economy. \u201cThe mistakes made in the nuclear industry decades ago must not be repeated in the steel industry today. There is a clear case for further government action to protect British steelmaking capacity, as it underpins so much of British manufacturing and construction. Our global competitors would not hesitate on an issue like this.\u201d One example could be America\u2019s bailout of its auto industry in 2008. Around $80bn was poured into the US car giants, once they fell foul of economic forces following the financial crisis. Our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, points out that Britain has been blocking efforts to stop Chinese steel-makers undercutting the UK industry. Last month, the UK repelled efforts to scrap the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, allowing EU members to block cheaper steel imports from China. Business secretary Sajid Javid argued that UK consumers and businesses would suffer if higher tariffs were imposed on Chinese steel - hurting UK growth, jobs and exports. Unions, though, warned, that allowing Chinese firms to \u2018dump\u2019 steel at unfairly cheap prices risked killing off the British steelmaking sector..... More here: One of Britain\u2019s top actors has urged the government to deliver on its promises, and keep the steel industry running. Michael Sheen, who grew up in Port Talbot, says the area has already suffered from the economic crisis over the last eight years. The steel industry was shaken hard by the financial crisis in 2008. The banking industry was helped enormously to recover from that. I hope that we can see as much support for the steel industry and its workers now that they face their time of greatest need. Steel has been at the very foundation of our national identity for generations. It has given so much to us a country. Now is the time to honour that contribution. More here: Eight years ago, Britain\u2019s government poured tens of billions into the banking sector. Should it now give steel a bailout? Or should we accept that steel is a declining industry, and focus on developing cutting edge technology instead? And what about the European angle - is it right that state aid rules enforced by Brussels could determine UK steel\u2019s future? Let us know what you think here: A \u201cSave Our Steel\u201d sign has been set up outside the Port Talbot plant. Senior figures at Tata Steel have expressed frustration at the lack of action from the British government to support the steel industry, according a Labour MP who met with senior executives at the company yesterday. Stephen Kinnock, the local MP for Port Talbot, says company executive Koushik Chatterjee \u201cmade it clear that he wanted to see a British Government doing more\u201d. Our political editor, Anushka Asthana, spoke with Kinnock and reports: Chatterjee met with the delegation - which included Kinnock and union leader Roy Rickhuss - twice, including at 1.30am after the board agreed the decision. The MP, who was speaking from Mumbai after the meeting, said no one would criticise Tata Steel because it had been investing in its British arm for seven or eight years. \u201cWe appreciate that Tata steel is not a charity but a business,\u201d he told the Guardian. But he accused the Government of \u201cabject failure\u201d when it came to protecting the steel industry, arguing that it had not only failed to tackle Chinese dumping, but had been a \u201cringleader\u201d in trying to prevent the European Commission from being given more powers to tackle the situation. \u201cWe are rolling out the red carpet for Beijing,\u201d he added, arguing that Britain was pushing for China to get market economy status at the World Trade Organisation despite the fact that 80% of its steel industry was state owned. \u201cThey are in hoc to China. Our commercial policy, our approach to trade and manufacturing, and our overall industrial strategy, is being dictated by Beijing.\u201d Guardian photographer Gareth Phillips has visited Port Talbot, to capture these images of a town built around its steel works: Here\u2019s more reaction to business minister Anna Soubry\u2019s interview on Today. The Huffington Post\u2019s Graeme Demianyk reckons Soubry\u2019s comments on temporary nationalisation are significant: James Wright of the Co-operatives UK argues that a management buyout could be the answer: Rory Broomfield, director of the Better Off Out campaign, argues that steel could get more support if Britain leaves the EU: Anna Soubry sounded somewhat confused about how Scotland\u2019s government had rescued its own steel industry earlier this year. She told Today Programme that: \u201c I think, and I\u2019m using that word very carefully, I think they may have kept some of the staff on. I may be wrong about that, but they didn\u2019t take ownership of the Clydebridge and Dalzell plants. However, the official announcement states that Tata sold the sites to the Scottish government, who are now selling them on to international metals group Liberty House. And when asked about how the government could take temporary ownership of Tata\u2019s sites, Soubry admits that \u201cI don\u2019t know the fine detail of it.\u201d It does suggest that the crisis may have caught ministers on the hop, as James Reed, political editor of the Yorkshire Post, tweets: Anna Soubry adds that there is \u201chuge sympathy\u201d for Tata, given the sums it has invested, but it is losing \u00a31m per day. Q: Couldn\u2019t you pick up those losses? We have to be compliant with state aid rules, the business minister replies. But there is absolute determination to make sure that steel is made in Port Talbot, not just rolled and milled there. And the government doesn\u2019t want Tata\u2019s UK assets to be split up too much, Soubry concludes. Business minister Anna Soubry is on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme now. Q: Is the government willing to take a stake in Tata\u2019s steel assets? The first thing we need to establish is what Tata means about its decision to leave the UK being \u2018time-bound\u2019 [see earlier statement], says Soubry She says that Tata has done an \u201coutstanding job\u201d in Britain, citing its ownership of Jaguar Land Rover. But the British government wants enough time to secure a buyer. That will take months. Q: Could the government hold the assets until a buyer can be found, if Tata wants to sell up now? That is an option, Soubry says. Q: Are you saying that a Conservative government would be prepared in extremis to own a part of UK steel? I\u2019m not sure \u2018own\u2019 is the right term. We do need to look at all options, but first we need to get time from Tata to run a proper sale process. Wales first minister, Carwyn Jones, has urged Tata to be a \u201cresponsible seller\u201d and keep its UK sites operating while a buyer is found. Jones also believes that \u201ctemporary nationalisation\u201d needs to be considered. He told Sky News that: We can\u2019t do it - we haven\u2019t got the resources, but the UK government has got those resources. Jones insists that the steel industry can have a profitable future, even though Port Talbot is currently loss-making. State ownership has to be considered if the industry is to move forwards.... and face the future with confidence. The head of Community, the steel union, tweets: Business secretary Sajid Javid doesn\u2019t appear to be scrapping his trip to Australia. Javid is due to address the Australian British Chamber of Commerce tomorrow. Terry Scouler, the chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, believes the UK government should consider taking Britain\u2019s steel industry under temporary ownership. He told the Today programme that: The government in Westminster and South Wales seems to be absolutely committed to maintaining steel production in Port Talbot.... I don\u2019t think nationalisation is the right way forward, but what\u2019s being hinted at is temporary nationalisation. Temporary nationalisation could allow the steel industry to ride out the current tough market conditions. Scouler points out that the steel price has halved in the last 18 months. The government could do more to help, by \u201caggressively\u201d looking at the state aid rules and clamping down on \u201cillegal steel dumping\u201d, he says. The UK government is considering whether a workforce management buyout could save the steel industry, according to the BBC\u2019s assistant political editor, Norman Smith. Smith told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that the government is also considering the option of \u201cdirect state involvement\u201d. He told listeners that: The view in government is that Port Talbot and the steel industry is a vital economic and strategic interest... and it\u2019s the role of government to intervene to protect it. However, the government is also concerned that Tata wants to sell its UK assets quickly, giving only a few weeks to find a potential buyer. And there is also concern that any financial assistance could run foul of European state aid rules.... Opposition MPs have moved swiftly to pile pressure on the government, to prevent the steel industry collapsing. Angela Eagle MP, the shadow business secretary, says this \u201cvital strategic industry\u201d must be saved. \u201cSteel workers at Tata, their families and their communities will be desperately worried this evening as they face ongoing uncertainty. \u201cSteel is a foundation industry that is hugely important for our economy. The Government should be doing everything possible to protect the industry in the short term as it faces this perfect storm. Awkwardly for the government, the actual business secretary - Sajid Javid - was on an aeroplane to Australia when Tata\u2019s bombshell landed. Eagle isn\u2019t impressed, saying: \u201cAfter months of complacency and after a budget with no strategy for steel, Sajid Javid and his team seem to have gone missing in action at this crucial time. Good morning. Britain\u2019s steel workers are under a dark cloud of gloom and uncertainty this morning, after India\u2019s Tata announced it is pulling out of the UK. Tata dashed hopes that it would back turnaround plan for the steelworkers in Port Talbot, Wales. Instead, it will sell all its other sites across the UK, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton, The move puts around 15,000 jobs at risk across the former British Steel operation, and the whole future of the UK steel industry is now in doubt. In a statement issued overnight, Tata claimed the turnaround plan for Port Talbot was simply too risky and uncertain given the deteriorating economic conditions. It warned: \u201cWhile the global steel demand, especially in developed markets like Europe has remained muted following the financial crisis of 2008, trading conditions in the UK and Europe have rapidly deteriorated more recently, due to structural factors including global oversupply of steel, significant increase in third country exports into Europe, high manufacturing costs, continued weakness in domestic market demand in steel and a volatile currency.\u201d As we reported last night, the UK government is under serious pressure to act and protect the UK steel industry, led by the local MP. The MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, who was in Mumbai to lobby the Tata board, was briefed after the board meeting by Tata\u2019s chief financial officer. Kinnock told the South Wales Evening Post on Tuesday night: \u201cWe will not allow the closure of Port Talbot steelworks. One way or another we will continue to make steel in Port Talbot but it looks like Tata do not back the plan. We will work with Tata and the UK government to help find a buyer for the plant.\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking all the main developments through the day, and other news across the world economy, the financial markets and business.",

This is not about globalization, it is about China dumping its own product. This is also a strategic sector. Allowing the Chinese to take control of the market through irregular means would place the UK in a disadvantaged position. This effort should also signal the UK\u2019s decision to act through its own policy and also signal intent to get EU to act in defence of the sector and open-market policies: not to allow these types of market distorting behaviours. Until China and other countries act fairly, the UK should protect its industry.</p> <p><em>Name withheld, England<br></em></p> <p>Given that there is no way that we can compete with the global cheapness of the steel imports, I feel we should let the market take its course and let the plant go. The money we would have spent trying to save a dying industry we can reinvest in training and creating new jobs in an area where the UK is now leading the way, finance.<br></p> <p><em>Keith Penfold, Haywards Heath<br></em></p> <p>It\u2019s all too easy to shut these plants down and put the work force out on the street. It is a financial decision for the moment but steel prices will rise and when it does the UK will have a gun to its head because foreign suppliers will know that we have not got the plants to switch back on. All of this will cost the country dear in the long term. I am just an ordinary retired working bloke but even I can see the devastating effects this will have on our great country. From a lifetime Conservative voter come on Mr Cameron, these are very special circumstances.<br></p> <p><em>Name withheld, Worcestershire<br></em></p> <h2>Q2: What do you think the impact will be on communities near to the existing steel works?</h2> <p>If steelworks are allowed to close the effect on communities will be as devastating as that of the mines closing. Communities which are dependent on one industry take decades to recover during which time health, education and welfare all suffer irreversible damage.<br></p> <p><em>Liz Taylor, Bristol<br></em></p> <h2>Q3: Summarise in one sentence, if you can, what the steel industry means to you</h2> <p>The steel industry means nothing to me personally, but as a nation we depend on having our own steel production for so many of the things we do : we cannot afford to lose the skills and plant to enable us to be independent in steel production.<br></p> <p><em>Andy Miles, Leicestershire<br></em></p> <p>Like chimney sweeps, an outdated occupation.<br></p> <p><em>Sean Kirby, East Yorks<br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56fbece8e4b0c9ed7992f783\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-30T15:16:45.367Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u2019s steel industry was once the envy of the world.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with being part of global supply chains, but there is something very wrong with losing domestic production and skills in a strategically-important industry. The loss of steelmaking would leave the UK vulnerable to global shocks, with dangerous consequences across the economy.</p> <p>\u201cThe mistakes made in the nuclear industry decades ago must not be repeated in the steel industry today.

      "bodyText": "The mood among Tata Steel employees on Wednesday was one of incredulity that ministers are refusing to follow the example of the 2008 banking bailout and commit to the state-funded rescue of a key industry. Workers at the Port Talbot steel plant, digesting the news that the site is up for sale with little hope of finding a buyer, urged the government to rescue the site and save 4,000 jobs. In the Gossip Cafe in the south Wales town there was only one topic of conversation among customers \u2013 how to save Britain\u2019s largest steel plant. Paul, who has worked at the steelworks for more than 30 years, argued that ministers could have done more to help. \u201cIf they can put billions in to save the banks, why can\u2019t they help our steelworks? They pulled the banks out of the shit,\u201d he said. Nationalisation, he added, would at least force the government to address the issue that according to workers is at the heart of Port Talbot\u2019s problem: ruinous competition from cheap Chinese steel imports. \u201cI think the government has got to have [the plant] back,\u201d said Paul, who asked to have his full name withheld. \u201cThey would soon stop importing Chinese steel, because that\u2019s what\u2019s killing us.\u201d Paul\u2019s view was echoed elsewhere in Port Talbot. Tomos Price, 27, a contractor at the site, said: \u201cThe government managed to find the money to bail out the banks that caused the recession. Now they should do the same to save the British steel industry after we\u2019ve battled through the years. \u201cThey should do whatever is necessary \u2013 can you imagine Great Britain without steel? It is part of our heritage and must be part of our future, too.\u201d Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks accounts for about one-third of the country\u2019s total annual production. Every Heinz food tin sold in the UK, every roof for the Nissan Juke car and every new 1p and 2p coin \u2013 plated in copper \u2013 is made from Port Talbot steel. Pete Walker, owner of the Gossip Cafe, said closure would decimate the town and would put huge pressure on his own business, which relies on custom from the families of steel workers to stay afloat. \u201cI can\u2019t see how the town can survive without it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no industry around here any more. What are house prices going to be like without jobs in the area?\u201d Former site employee Michael Evans, 71, expressed hope that a saviour can be found for the plant, but said he feared the worst. \u201cIt\u2019s a real body blow,\u201d he said. \u201cHow the hell can you sleep at night thinking \u2018am I going to have a job in the morning?\u2019.\u201d Evans said closing the plant would destroy the economy of Port Talbot and the surrounding area. \u201cNothing can fill that gap,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s left. It\u2019s going to lead to second-rate jobs and there are already no quality jobs in the area. We are fast becoming a service country to other people\u2019s industries.\u201d Like many in the town, Evans spent more than 30 years at the works, and recalls the plant\u2019s better days in the 1960s, when more than 20,000 worked there. Port Talbot was a town with virtually full employment when the plant was operating at its peak, but the effect of its decline is evident in a town centre that has a significant number of charity shops and payday loan stores offering \u2018cash for gold\u2019. It is not just Port Talbot that will suffer if Tata fails to find a buyer for its UK arm. The Welsh economy is particularly reliant on the business. A study by Cardiff University\u2019s Welsh economy research unit found that Tata Steel supports more than 18,000 jobs in Wales and estimates it is worth around \u00a33.2bn to the Welsh economy. At another Tata site in Rotherham, government support will come too late for hundreds of workers who will now lose their jobs. Tata is cutting 720 jobs across the whole of South Yorkshire, including 500 in Rotherham at its Aldwarke plant. Stuart Sansome, senior trade union official at the plant, was made redundant after almost 40 years at the site. The 57-year-old, who is also a local councillor, said: \u201cWhen I started in the steel industry I had a job for life. I was very fortunate, but kids who started in this business from the 2000s onwards, they have no idea if it is for five years or five months. They have been dropped from the greatest height.\u201d Thomas Armstrong, 25, one of the people who lost his job on Wednesday morning, started working at the Rotherham plant when he was 19, following in the footsteps of his uncle and grandfather. He said workers were angry and in shock. \u201cThe most difficult thing was saying goodbye. I started working here when I was just 19 and I have grown up with these people \u2013 my uncle and my grandfather worked here \u2013 and now it has all gone. The government needs to do something to help us all.\u201d",

They pulled the banks out of the shit,\u201d he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Nationalisation, he added, would at least force the government to address the issue that according to workers is at the heart of Port Talbot\u2019s problem: ruinous competition from cheap Chinese steel imports. \u201cI think the government has got to have [the plant] back,\u201d said Paul, who asked to have his full name withheld. \u201cThey would soon stop importing Chinese steel, because that\u2019s what\u2019s killing us.\u201d</p> <p>Paul\u2019s view was echoed elsewhere in Port Talbot. Tomos Price, 27, a contractor at the site, said: \u201cThe government managed to find the money to bail out the banks that caused the recession. Now they should do the same to save the British steel industry after we\u2019ve battled through the years.</p> <p>\u201cThey should do whatever is necessary \u2013 can you imagine Great Britain without steel?

      "bodyText": "General Motors sold a car with a faulty ignitions switch but the switch was not to blame for a 2014 car accident, a New York jury found on Wednesday. The verdict is the first in a series expected after GM admitted to selling cars with faulty ignition switches and recalled a record 30.4m cars and trucks. The two-week lawsuit related to a 2014 crash in which Dionne Spain and Lawrence Barthelemy of New Orleans said they were driving in Spain\u2019s 2007 Saturn Sky when, they argued, a faulty switch slipped out of position and caused it to crash. The two plaintiffs said they suffered back pain and other injuries in the accident. GM lawyer Mike Brock argued that the ignition switch was not to be blamed and that the crash was due to to the wintry weather. \u201cWhat\u2019s the simplest explanation for the outcome here?\u201d Brock asked jurors. \u201cIce.\u201d In its statement on the verdict, GM once again pointed to weather as the main factor in the accident. \u201cThe jurors studied the merits of the case and saw the truth: this was a very minor accident that had absolutely nothing to do with the car\u2019s ignition switch,\u201d GM spokesman Jim Cain said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence was overwhelming that this accident \u2013 like more than 30 others that occurred in the same area that night \u2013 was caused by the driver losing control on an icy bridge during a state-wide winter weather emergency.\u201d Jurors began deliberating Tuesday afternoon on the sole question of whether a defective switch in Spain\u2019s vehicle caused it to crash. While they agreed that the switch was not to be blamed for this particular incident, the eight jurors also noted that the faulty switch made the car \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d. When the ignition switch slips out of position, the engine stalls making it difficult to steer or stop. The jurors found that the auto company had failed to warn the public about such safety risks. \u201cWe definitely disagree with the overall verdict,\u201d Randall Jackson, a lawyer who represented Spain and Barthelemy. \u201cBut we\u2019re pleased with the findings that the jury made with regard to the fact that our client\u2019s car was unreasonably dangerous.\u201d GM has been accused of covering up the problem for more than a decade before acknowledging it and launching recalls. The carmaker has admitted that some of its employees knew about the problems as early as 2001, but failed to flag it as a safety issue and order a recall. In September, GM announced it had settled 1,385 death and injury cases for $275m and a class-action shareholders\u2019 lawsuit for $300m. The company paid nearly $600m to settle 399 claims made to a fund it established. Those claims covered 124 deaths and 275 injuries. GM\u2019s fund rejected more than 90% of the 4,343 claims it received, according to figures the company released in December. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious the outcome in this case might not dictate the outcome in other cases,\u201d said US district judge Jesse M Furman. Before he announced the verdict on Wednesday, Furman warned attorneys and the public not to read too much into the outcome. Six trials were scheduled this year to help resolve claims stemming from an ignition switch problem. The first trial ended abruptly in January, without a verdict, after the judge raised concerns about the plaintiff\u2019s truthfulness. The next trial is scheduled to start 2 May.

    "webTitle": "Boeing to cut 4,000 jobs as battle with Airbus continues", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boeing is cutting about 4,000 jobs and could double that number this year to slash costs as the world\u2019s biggest aeroplane maker faces intense competition from Europe\u2019s Airbus. The Chicago-based company said it would reduce the headcount in its commercial airlines division by 4,000, with around one-third through voluntary layoffs and the rest by leaving positions unfilled, a spokesman said. \u201cWhile there is no employment reduction target, the more we can control costs as a whole the less impact there will be to employment,\u201d Boeing\u2019s Doug Alder told Reuters. The job cuts would include hundreds of executives and managers, and employees would only be forced to leave as a last resort, he said. Boeing will also cut about 10% of the 5,700 jobs in its test and evaluation division, which conducts flight and lab tests, the company said. Boeing had a total of 161,400 employees at the end of December, with the commercial airlines division making up about half that number. The Seattle Times reported that the company, which has dominated the global airline business for decades, was aiming for a 10% overall cut in Washington \u2013 which would mean about 8,000 jobs going in the north-western US state, where Boeing employs almost 80,000. In February, Ray Conner, the head of Boeing\u2019s aircraft business, warned employees that job cuts were necessary to \u201cwin in the market, fund our growth and operate as a healthy business\u201d. The American company, maker of the famed 747 jumbo jet and the US\u2019s biggest exporter, has been overtaken as the world number one for future orders by Airbus. Conner told employees Boeing needed to slash costs because it was in a price war with its European rival. \u201cTheir biggest weapon that they\u2019re using ... today is price. They are attacking us with price in every single campaign [for orders]. And as a result of that, you know, we\u2019re being pushed to the wall,\u201d he said. In January, Airbus claimed it had 57% of the market by units ordered, with the 1,036 planes in 2015 making its cumulative order book more than $1tn (\u00a3693bn). Its fuel-efficient A320neo family of planes had given it a dominant position in the market for smaller, short-haul aircraft, it said, although Boeing was selling more wide-body planes. Boeing delivered a record 762 planes in 2015 for revenues of $125bn, compared with Airbus\u2019s 635 aircraft, earning it $91.6bn. Analysts had expected Boeing\u2019s aircraft deliveries to rise this year but in January it indicated the number would be down by about 20 on last year due to internal production changes. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s new chief executive, tried to reassure investors that the lower number of deliveries was not due to declining demand for planes \u2013 but the announcement, coupled with a lower-than-expected profit outlook, sent Boeing\u2019s shares tumbling on 27 January. Boeing is attempting to overhaul its sprawling commercial jetliner manufacturing arm as Muilenburg seeks to make his mark. Muilenburg, who took over last July, used cost cuts to shore up profits in a period of constrained defence spending when he ran Boeing\u2019s defence unit. The company is seeking savings beyond job cuts by renegotiating supplier contracts, consolidating spending programmes, slashing business travel and trying to boost productivity and reduce excess stocks. The total number of job cuts required will in part be dictated by the success of those initiatives. \u201cWhile there is no employment reduction target, the more we can control costs as a whole the less impact there will be to employment,\u201d the company said.",

Boeing had a total of 161,400 employees at the end of December, with the commercial airlines division making up about half that number.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-job-cuts-this-year-could-reach-10-percent/\">Seattle Times</a> reported that the company, which has dominated the global airline business for decades, was aiming for a 10% overall cut in Washington \u2013 which would mean about 8,000 jobs going in the north-western US state, where Boeing employs almost 80,000.</p> <p>In February, Ray Conner, the head of Boeing\u2019s aircraft business, warned employees that job cuts were necessary to \u201cwin in the market, fund our growth and operate as a healthy business\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The American company, maker of the famed 747 jumbo jet and the US\u2019s biggest exporter, has been overtaken as the world number one for future orders by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/airbus\">Airbus</a>. Conner told employees Boeing needed to slash costs because it was in a price war with its European rival.</p> <p>\u201cTheir biggest weapon that they\u2019re using ... today is price. They are attacking us with price in every single campaign [for orders]. And as a result of that, you know, we\u2019re being pushed to the wall,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In January, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/airbus-overtakes-boeing-in-aircraft-orders\">Airbus claimed it had 57% of the market</a> by units ordered, with the 1,036 planes in 2015 making its cumulative order book more than $1tn (\u00a3693bn). Its fuel-efficient <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.airbus.com/aircraftfamilies/passengeraircraft/a320family/\">A320neo family</a> of planes had given it a dominant position in the market for smaller, short-haul aircraft, it said, although Boeing was selling more wide-body planes. </p> <p>Boeing delivered a record 762 planes in 2015 for revenues of $125bn, compared with Airbus\u2019s 635 aircraft, earning it $91.6bn. Analysts had expected Boeing\u2019s aircraft deliveries to rise this year but in January it indicated the number would be down by about 20 on last year due to internal production changes.</p> <p>Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s new chief executive, tried to reassure investors that the lower number of deliveries was not due to declining demand for planes \u2013 but the announcement, coupled with a lower-than-expected profit outlook, sent Boeing\u2019s shares tumbling on 27 January.</p> <p>Boeing is attempting to overhaul its sprawling commercial jetliner manufacturing arm as Muilenburg seeks to make his mark. Muilenburg, who took over last July, used cost cuts to shore up profits in a period of constrained defence spending when he ran Boeing\u2019s defence unit.</p> <p>The company is seeking savings beyond job cuts by renegotiating supplier contracts, consolidating spending programmes, slashing business travel and trying to boost productivity and reduce excess stocks. The total number of job cuts required will in part be dictated by the success of those initiatives.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there is no employment reduction target, the more we can control costs as a whole the less impact there will be to employment,\u201d the company said.</p>",

Lululemon, the upmarket \u201cathleisure\u201d brand favoured by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cameron Diaz, on Wednesday reported annual sales of more than $2bn (\u00a31.4bn). The surge in sales, up from $1.8bn the previous year, and the company\u2019s prediction that sales could double to $4bn by 2020 sent Lululemon\u2019s shares soaring on Wall Street.

Unlike Britain, it runs a large surplus on trade in goods. The German steel industry has not buckled under the pressure of dumping by China. So what\u2019s the secret? How can high-cost, high-tax Germany thrive as an industrial superpower while Britain has seen the progressive hollowing-out of its manufacturing base? Let\u2019s start with a couple of qualifications to these stereotypes. Not everything in Germany is wonderful. Export growth in recent years has been based on a decade-long suppression of wages, which has meant the benefits of growth have gone to the owners of companies rather than the people who work for them. Nor is Britain quite the industrial wasteland of popular myth. There are world-class UK companies \u2013 Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems \u2013 and there are plenty of mid-sized firms employing between 200 and 500 people that in Germany would be classified as being part of a \u201cMittelstand\u201d. That said, Germany is in a different league to Britain. It has more world-class companies in a broader range of sectors \u2013 Siemens, BMW, Bosch, to name a few \u2013 supported by a more densely packed network of Mittelstand companies. Part of the story involves history and culture. Germany\u2019s industrial power was built on a core of family-owned businesses, many of which date back to the 19th century and which often operate out of small towns. They plan for the long term, pride themselves on quality and see themselves as having social obligations to the local community. These companies thrived in the decades immediately after 1945, when the economy boomed as a result of the need to rebuild a war-ravaged country. Whereas UK companies were often hindered by an overvalued pound, the mark was undervalued, making German exports extremely competitive in world markets. Another part of the story involves the structure of German industry. The emphasis on vocational education combining academic studies and on-the-job training for apprentices is globally admired. German companies are also the beneficiaries of close links between industry and the banking sector that ensure guaranteed long-term funding. While UK companies regularly fret about hitting short-term targets, their German rivals have been able to concentrate on making small improvements to their products that help to keep them ahead of the field. The final piece of the tale involves the support given by the state. One key pillar of support is provided by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, a part publicly-funded research organisation that provides applied science for companies that would otherwise find the cost prohibitive. The German government has also used tax incentives to foster industries seen as having growth potential \u2013 the development of the solar panel sector through feed-in tariffs being a recent example. One lesson for Britain is that there is a virtue in having an industrial strategy \u2013 and patiently sticking to it.",

    "webTitle": "Number of City bankers earning above \u20ac1m rises to nearly 3,000", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of City financiers who were paid more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3800,000) per year jumped to nearly 3,000 in 2014, with one earning up to \u20ac25m. The European Banking Authority (EBA) said the UK, with the Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre in London, had more than three times as many high-earning bankers as the rest of the EU combined. Critics of high pay said the soaring wages showed little has been learned from the financial crisis. The regulator\u2019s data showed that the number of high earners across the EU rose 21.6% to 3,865 in 2014, from 3,178 in 2013. The majority \u2013 2,429 \u2013 worked in investment banking. It was the first year when the EU bonus cap was implemented and new EBA rules on banks reporting staff remuneration took effect. The overall increase was driven by a 40% leap in the number of high earners in the UK, to 2,926 from 2,086, which partly reflected exchange rate effects as most City bankers are paid in sterling. Stripping out currency effects, the increase would have been 16%, or 339, more high earners in the UK. The EBA put this down to banks making higher net profits. The soaring number of high earners drew criticism from the Trades Union Congress, which said the increase did not reflect the economic reality for most people. \u201cThese are staggering numbers \u2013 for parts of the banking sector, it\u2019s like the credit crunch never happened,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cIt would be easier to understand if there was evidence that the activities of the banks were supporting stronger growth, stronger manufacturing, higher productivity and better wages across the board. \u201cBut instead the economy has seriously underperformed across all these areas.\u201d Paul Marsland, deputy director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said efforts to address risky behaviour in the financial world were having little effect. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise really to see London, as the main financial centre in Europe, with the heaviest number of people covered by these regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is a surprise to see the numbers increasing at the rate they are, given that the rules that have given us this information are aimed at jobs with an element of risk-taking. \u201cThe fact that these are predominantly investment banking jobs seems to suggest that the riskier nature of their work is alive and kicking. Given the uncertainty of the economic climate, it\u2019s a surprise to see that expanding.\u201d In Germany, the number of high-earning bankers fell to 242 from 397, mainly due to a decline at subsidiaries or branches of UK firms in Germany. In all other countries, the number remained broadly stable. The London-based regulator\u2019s data showed 16 people at financial firms based in Britain were paid more than \u20ac10m in 2014, with one earning \u20ac24m-\u20ac25m. Since the bonus cap was introduced in 2014, limiting bankers\u2019 bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve, the UK and France have implemented waivers. The UK has excluded hundreds of smaller, less risky firms such as asset managers and brokers, the EBA found in December, and supports amending the EU directive to exclude small firms from the bonus cap across the trading bloc. The regulator said the introduction of the bonus cap had led EU banks to shift remuneration towards fixed salaries. As a result, the average ratio between variable and fixed pay for high earners more than halved to 127% in 2014 from 317% in 2013. This had little impact on banks\u2019 costs and financial stability, the regulator found, contrary to the fears they voiced ahead of the change. The EBA\u2019s Bernd Rummel said: \u201cThe banks said during the consultation of EBA guidelines that the bonus cap would be very negative for them in terms of cost flexibility and financial stability. \u201cWe analysed this and found that there was only a small increase in the fixed administrative cost. There was no big impact on the financial stability or cost flexibility.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2016 to change, in two places, the phrase \u201ctook home\u201d to \u201cwere paid\u201d, because the related figures are for gross remuneration, including salary, bonuses, long-term awards and pension contributions.",

The telecoms regulator Ofcom said complaints made to Vodafone surged to 32 per 100,000 pay-monthly customers in the final three months of 2015. The figure was up from 20 in the previous quarter, and is now three times higher than rival phone providers. Ofcom said complaints received about Vodafone related to billing, pricing and charges, as well as complaints handling and fault, service or provision issues. It reflects the Guardian\u2019s own complaints postbag, which has seen a big surge in complaints about Vodafone in recent months. Ofcom said Vodafone was the only provider to have more complaints than the industry average of 10 per 100,000 customers. Tesco Mobile had by far the fewest complaints according to the data. Vodafone\u2019s problems stem from its decision to introduce a new billing system at the end of last year. Ofcom is separately investigating Vodafone over its complaints handling procedures, while conducting another inquiry into the supplier\u2019s sales of pay-as-you-go mobile services. Overall, Ofcom said total complaints across the telecoms and paid-for TV sectors fell in the three months to the end of December 2015. The regulator said it receives just under 300 telecoms complaints a day from consumers who are unhappy with their service. TalkTalk received the most landline complaints, at 30 per 100,000 customers, while EE, Plusnet, Post Office and BT also continued to generate landline complaints significantly above the industry average. EE again attracted the most complaints for fixed-line broadband, while grievances about Plusnet, TalkTalk and BT remained higher than the rest of the industry. Sky and Virgin recorded the fewest phone/broadband complaints. Vodafone apologised to affected customers following the company\u2019s \u201chighly complex\u201d switchover of customers on to its new billing system. \u201cWe would like to apologise to any customer who has had an issue with our service. We are working hard to improve our customers\u2019 experience and more recent data is showing an improvement,\u201d it said. The company said it had improved its customer call centre teams to help deal with complaints and resolve billing issues. Elsewhere, BT held on to its spot as the most complained-about pay-TV provider over the fourth quarter, although the numbers dropped to 15 per 100,000 from 25 over the previous three months. Low-cost rival TalkTalk also received above-average complaints about paid-for TV, at 14 per 100,000 customers.",

    "webTitle": "Corbyn urges Cameron to recall parliament over Tata Steel crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has called for parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis facing the steel industry after Tata Steel put thousands of jobs at risk by revealing it plans to pull out of its UK business, including the country\u2019s biggest steelworks at Port Talbot. The Labour leader described the government as being \u201cin disarray\u201d in a letter to David Cameron calling for the recall of MPs from the Easter break. Corbyn has already cut short his holiday in Devon. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, is now on his way home from Australia to tackle the crisis, while Cameron is also returning from a holiday in Lanzarote. Downing Street sources said the prime minister was always due to fly home on Wednesday, but he is now expected to meet with ministers tomorrow for an emergency meeting to discuss the Tata Steel decision. After that, he will head to Washington DC for the Nuclear Security Summit. Javid, who has faced mounting criticism for flying to Australia just as the steel industry crisis intensified, has been forced to cut short a trip during which he was going to attend a meeting on cyber-security on Thursday. The government is considering providing financial support for Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, including Port Talbot, to allow time for a buyer to be found to save thousands of jobs. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said the government was prepared to look at a number of options to save Tata\u2019s British business, which employs about 15,000 workers, including 4,000 at Port Talbot. The IPPR thinktank has claimed that at least 40,000 jobs are at risk from the crisis, including 15,000 at Tata Steel and 25,000 posts in the supply chain. Corbyn said: \u201cThe news that Tata is preparing to pull out of steelmaking in Britain puts thousands of jobs across the country and a strategic UK-wide industry at risk. MPs must have the chance now to debate the future of steel and hold ministers to account for their failure to intervene. \u201cSteelworkers and their families will be desperately worried about the uncertainty. The government is in disarray over what action to take. Ministers must act now to protect the steel industry, which is at the heart of manufacturing in Britain and vital to its future.\u201d Cameron has been on holiday in Lanzarote while George Osborne is also out of the country and heading to Paris for a meeting of the G20 finance ministers. Javid is understood to have spoken to Tata boss Cyrus Mistry on Wednesday morning while in Australia. The business secretary has been \u201cmonitoring the situation closely and getting regular updates\u201d while he has been away, according to a government source. But Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose south Wales constituency of Aberavon includes Port Talbot, accused the government of \u201cabject failure\u201d in not standing up for the industry before Tata decided to pull out of the UK. Asked if the government could take a temporary stake in Port Talbot so that a buyer could be found, Soubry said: \u201cThat is an option. We\u2019ve looked at all options.\u201d Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Soubry declined to commit the government to taking control of a large part of the British steel industry. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether \u2018own\u2019 would be the right word. The most important thing is that we look at and continue to look at all options, and I do mean all options,\u201d she said. One option under consideration is for the government to step in with temporary funding to keep Port Talbot open if a sale looks likely, but any fuller form of nationalisation is said to be off the table. Soubry said finding a buyer for the business would take months and called on Tata Steel to allow the government time to save the plant. Tata said it had given no specific deadline but that the business was under severe financial strain, and it said it had written down more than \u00a32bn of assets while trying to keep the plant open in the past two years. Tata Steel, part of the Indian Tata conglomerate, announced late on Tuesday night that its board had rejected a turnaround plan for Port Talbot. Instead, it decided to sell the UK business, which includes the remnants of British Steel. Union leaders travelled to Mumbai to discuss the company\u2019s UK business, hoping that Tata would agree to a turnaround plan to keep steelmaking in Port Talbot and at other UK plants. The decision to sell will affect other Tata plants, including Rotherham, Corby and Shotton. It is in the process of selling its business in Scunthorpe to investment company Greybull Capital. Kinnock also travelled to Mumbai to make the case for Tata remaining in the UK. He said the company was not to blame and had invested large sums of money in an effort to keep the business going. Instead, Kinnock pointed the finger at the British government, which he accused of being a \u201cringleader\u201d in seeking to prevent the European commission from being given powers to stop China dumping cheap steel. \u201cWe are rolling out the red carpet for Beijing,\u201d Kinnock said, arguing that Britain was pushing for China to get market economy status at the World Trade Organisation, despite the fact that 80% of its steel industry is state owned. \u201cThey are in hock to China. Our commercial policy, our approach to trade and manufacturing, and our overall industrial strategy, is being dictated by Beijing.\u201d He said Tata executives in Mumbai expressed frustration at the government\u2019s lack of action to support the industry. Kinnock criticised ministers for agreeing to a multibillion-pound defence contract late last year that will use Swedish steel. Soubry said she did not know \u201cthe fine detail\u201d of the Scottish government\u2019s rescue deal for the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants that allowed their sale to metals group Liberty House last week. She said the government was determined to save Port Talbot, but that it would be a far bigger task than the Scottish rescue. \u201cThere is this absolute determination by the prime minister, myself and business secretary Sajid that we want to see steel being made \u2013 not just rolled and milled \u2013 at Port Talbot,\u201d Soubry said. The actor Michael Sheen, who grew up in Port Talbot, said the government had to provide as much support as possible and that Tata should be a responsible seller. Writing for the Guardian, he said: \u201cThe \u2018determination\u2019 that business minister Anna Soubry declared her government has to ensure that Port Talbot continues to make steel needs to now produce urgent action.\u201d A government source said Tata Steel\u2019s decision to look for a seller instead of shutting its operations gave ministers more options. \u201cWe will now want to work very hard to support that process. We want to look at ways that we can continue to support Port Talbot,\u201d the source said. The government does not accept that it has been too soft on blocking Chinese steel dumping. Officials have argued that granting China market economy status does not stop Europe increasing tariffs on Chinese steel, and claimed that the government\u2019s action in the EU has been to stop changes to a ruling that could harm British consumers in areas other than steel. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union, called on Cameron to meet him urgently to discuss how to save Port Talbot and the wider industry. \u201cThe UK is now on the verge of a national crisis. Tata Steel withdrawing completely from the UK risks destroying our entire steel industry. That would be a disaster both for those communities reliant on steel jobs and our entire industrial base,\u201d he said. \u201cI am calling on David Cameron to meet with me urgently to discuss how his government and my union can work together to safeguard the future of our steel industry.\u201d",

After that, he will head to Washington DC for the Nuclear Security Summit. <br></p> <p>Javid, who has faced mounting criticism for flying to Australia just as the steel industry crisis intensified, has been forced to cut short a trip during which he was going to attend a meeting on cyber-security on Thursday.<br></p> <p>The government is considering providing financial support for Tata Steel\u2019s UK business, including Port Talbot, to allow time for a buyer to be found to save thousands of jobs.<br></p> <p>Anna Soubry, the business minister, said the government was prepared to look at a number of options to save Tata\u2019s British business, which employs about 15,000 workers, including 4,000 at Port Talbot.</p> <p>The IPPR thinktank has claimed that at least 40,000 jobs are at risk from the crisis, including 15,000 at Tata Steel and 25,000 posts in the supply chain.</p> <p>Corbyn said: \u201cThe news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tata\">Tata</a> is preparing to pull out of steelmaking in Britain puts thousands of jobs across the country and a strategic UK-wide industry at risk.

We\u2019ve looked at all options.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Soubry declined to commit the government to taking control of a large part of the British steel industry. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether \u2018own\u2019 would be the right word. The most important thing is that we look at and continue to look at all options, and I do mean all options,\u201d she said.</p> <p>One option under consideration is for the government to step in with temporary funding to keep Port Talbot open if a sale looks likely, but any fuller form of nationalisation is said to be off the table. </p> <p>Soubry said finding a buyer for the business would take months and called on Tata Steel to allow the government time to save the plant. Tata said it had given no specific deadline but that the business was under severe financial strain, and it said it had written down more than \u00a32bn of assets while trying to keep the plant open in the past two years.</p> <p>Tata Steel, part of the Indian Tata conglomerate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">announced late on Tuesday night</a> that its board had rejected a turnaround plan for Port Talbot.

Our commercial policy, our approach to trade and manufacturing, and our overall industrial strategy, is being dictated by Beijing.\u201d</p> <p>He said Tata executives in Mumbai expressed frustration at the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/crisis-british-steel-tata-40-years-making\">lack of action to support the industry</a>. Kinnock criticised ministers for agreeing to a multibillion-pound defence contract late last year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/steel-workers-marchparliament-sajid-javid-talks-eu-redcar-tata\">that will use Swedish steel</a>. <br></p> <p></p> <p>Soubry said she did not know \u201cthe fine detail\u201d of the Scottish government\u2019s rescue deal for the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants that allowed their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/24/tata-scottish-steel-works-rescued-by-liberty-house\">sale to metals group Liberty House</a> last week.

Christian Taxil said a raft of changes to the Somerset reactor scheme agreed over the past three years significantly raised the risk for EDF, while a promise to commission the plant within 72 months of concrete being poured was \u201cnot credible\u201d. Taxil, the first EDF board member to go public with his concerns, added: \u201cToday I can only say that the conditions do not exist for me to give a positive opinion if such a project was submitted to me.\u201d The blow from the employee director, who is sponsored by the CFE-CGC trade union, came after the publication in the Financial Times on Wednesday (\u00a3) of an advice note from senior engineers saying that the plant should be redesigned and the 2025 start date put back to 2027. The dissent follows weeks of behind the scenes bickering and the resignation of the finance director, Thomas Piquemal, despite continual promises from the chief executive of EDF, Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, that the controversial project will go ahead. A final investment decision has yet to be taken but Vincent de Rivaz, the head of EDF Energy, the UK arm of the business, said he was working on a target date set by French ministers of mid-May. EDF dismissed the latest rows, saying that it was well known that the unions, who only hold six out of the 18 places on the board, are opposed to Hinkley, while the criticism from the engineers was contained in a paper that was not taken to the board. \u201cThe date for the first operation of Hinkley Point C has not changed. It will be 2025,\u201d the company, which is 85% owned by the state, said. It later went on to angrily dismiss \u201cunfounded rumours and fantasy information\u201d in the media. EDF is in the middle of negotiations with the French government over further funding, having been financially hurt by falling power prices, cost overruns on other projects, and demands to upgrade French reactors to make them safer. All six union members on the EDF board are expected to vote against Hinkley when it finally comes to a vote. They believe that it is too expensive and a risk to the company\u2019s future given the scale of the company\u2019s debts. While some non-union board members have voiced doubts about the project in private, all are expected to vote with the management when \u2013 as expected \u2013 the board meets on 11 May to make a final decision on the project. Developing two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley has been heavily promoted by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as key to keeping the lights on in Britain. The last of the UK\u2019s coal-fired power stations will be closed under government diktat in 2025.",

    "webTitle": "Who is to blame for the steel crisis?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The crisis in the UK steel industry has deep roots. Globalisation and the opening-up of world markets; a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing, creating massive over-capacity in its steel plants; a subsequent boom in cheap Chinese exports and a collapse in the global steel price. Those pressures have become intense since 2012: but the story of steel in the UK has also been one of a 40-year decline in output and employment. In the early 1970s, the UK industry was producing almost 29m tonnes and employing 325,000 people; by last year, the figures were 12.5m tonnes and 30,000 people. But decline is also relative. The business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, in a detailed review of the government\u2019s response to the steel crisis last December, made an important point: other major EU countries, notably Germany, Italy, France and Spain, have done better at protecting their steel industries. In terms of production, the UK has been bottom of that mini league table since 2001, having once been second only to Germany. Should the UK government \u2013 and successive governments \u2013 have foreseen the crisis? Could it have been handled better? What could politicians have done differently? Energy costs The UK steel industry has complained bitterly for years that it pays higher energy costs than European peers. The Eurostat figures quoted in the BIS committee report make the point. In 2014, UK steelmakers paid about 80% above the EU median for their electricity. UK government policies to meet legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions are partly responsible. Yet the desire to give a helping hand to heavy industries was also recognised in the 2011 autumn statement via the Energy-intensive Industries Package. In practice, the full package was only implemented last year. The BIS committee commented: \u201cSuccessive governments have not prioritised the issue sufficiently to force it up the agenda at the European commission, which could have approved the full package years ago. This delay has directly affected the competitiveness of the UK steel industry and been a contributory factor to the current crisis.\u201d Compensation packages and exceptions from environmental taxes have costs elsewhere, of course: in the end, other consumers are obliged to pay. But the point seems clear \u2013 the government was prepared to help steel, but actual remedies were slow to arrive. Business rates UK steel companies have claimed they pay up to seven times as much in business rates than European competitors. They have argued that the UK business rate regime discourages investment in new plant and machinery. The BIS committee sympathised: \u201cWe recommend that the government demonstrates its support for rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing, and the steel industry, by reforming business rates.\u201d In the event, the chancellor\u2019s budget this month was friendlier to the oil and gas industries than to steel, which was mentioned only once in the context of the protections from climate change levies. Procurement Here the government was a belated convert to the idea of helping UK steel producers compete for UK public-sector contracts. New guidelines were published last October to \u201chelp steel producers compete on a level playing field with international suppliers\u201d. The worry, however, is that other EU countries would be less fussy and would actively tilt the playing field. Look at Hinkley Point, the proposed new nuclear power station in Somerset. While EDF, the constructor, says the project is a \u201cbig opportunity for UK steel\u201d and there is an \u201cexpectation\u201d that a large proportion will come from the UK, everything is subject to a competitive process. Quite right too, purists would say: Hinkley Point is already hideously expensive. It is hard, though, to believe that all EU countries wouldn\u2019t favour their own steelmakers more explicitly. As for the government\u2019s new procurement guidelines, the BIS committee said: \u201cThe impact of these changes will not be apparent for some considerable time. We regret that this change in policy was not made many months, if not years, earlier.\u201d Tariffs The UK has flip-flopped on the wisdom of encouraging the EU to imposes tariffs on Chinese steel. Anti-protectionism used to be the philosophy but the UK backed an extension of long-standing tariffs on wire rod steel last year. \u201cSuccessive governments should have done much more to press for accelerated action at the EU,\u201d concluded the BIS committee. Another difficulty is that the US is faster and more determined than the EU to impose tariffs when it judges that illegal Chinese dumping is taken place. But there is also a suspicion \u2013 again identified by the committee \u2013 that UK steelmakers are uniquely vulnerable to Chinese imports because other EU countries interpret European law to suit their own industries, albeit sometimes falling foul of the European commission\u2019s state aid rules. Industrial policy Here the charge is that the government\u2019s warm words about the importance of the steel industry as part of a manufacturing revival have not been met by action until the closure of the SSI plant in Redcar crisis led to a government-sponsored \u201csteel summit\u201d last October. \u201cThe government identified steel as an industry of vital importance but, like its predecessors, did not have the effective early warning systems in place to detect and address mounting problems,\u201d said the BIS committee. Even the speed of the current crisis at Tata Steel appears to have taken ministers by surprise. At the start of this week, Whitehall officials did not believe that the Indian firm would put all its UK steel assets up for sale. Almost by default, the government has adopted a holding position while it, and Tata, seek private buyers. But, if no bidders emerge for a business said to be losing \u00a31m a day, the size and nature of any government-sponsored rescue plan is a mystery.",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/crisis-british-steel-tata-40-years-making\">crisis in the UK steel industry</a> has deep roots. Globalisation and the opening-up of world markets; a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing, creating massive over-capacity in its steel plants; a subsequent boom in cheap Chinese exports and a collapse in the global steel price. </p> <p>Those pressures have become intense since 2012: but the story of steel in the UK has also been one of a 40-year decline in output and employment. In the early 1970s, the UK industry was producing almost 29m tonnes and employing 325,000 people; by last year, the figures were 12.5m tonnes and 30,000 people.</p> <p>But decline is also relative. The business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, in <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmbis/546/546.pdf\">a detailed review of the government\u2019s response to the steel crisis last December</a>, made an important point: other major EU countries, notably Germany, Italy, France and Spain, have done better at protecting their steel industries. In terms of production, the UK has been bottom of that mini league table since 2001, having once been second only to Germany.</p> <p>Should the UK government \u2013 and successive governments \u2013 have foreseen the crisis? Could it have been handled better? What could politicians have done differently?</p> <h2>Energy costs</h2> <p>The UK steel industry has complained bitterly for years that it pays higher energy costs than European peers. The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/prodcom/overview/steel-data\">Eurostat figures</a> quoted in the BIS committee report make the point. In 2014, UK steelmakers paid about 80% above the EU median for their electricity. UK government policies to meet legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions are partly responsible. Yet the desire to give a helping hand to heavy industries was also recognised in the 2011 autumn statement via the Energy-intensive Industries Package.</p> <p>In practice, the full package was only implemented last year. The BIS committee commented: \u201cSuccessive governments have not prioritised the issue sufficiently to force it up the agenda at the European commission, which could have approved the full package years ago. This delay has directly affected the competitiveness of the UK steel industry and been a contributory factor to the current crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Compensation packages and exceptions from environmental taxes have costs elsewhere, of course: in the end, other consumers are obliged to pay. But the point seems clear \u2013 the government was prepared to help steel, but actual remedies were slow to arrive.</p> <h2>Business rates</h2> <p>UK steel companies have claimed they pay up to seven times as much in business rates than European competitors. They have argued that the UK business rate regime discourages investment in new plant and machinery. The BIS committee sympathised: \u201cWe recommend that the government demonstrates its support for rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing, and the steel industry, by reforming business rates.\u201d</p> <p>In the event, the chancellor\u2019s budget this month was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/16/budget-north-sea-oil-price-plunge-burden-on-taxpayers\">friendlier to the oil and gas industries</a> than to steel, which was mentioned only once in the context of the protections from climate change levies.</p> <h2>Procurement</h2> <p>Here the government was a belated convert to the idea of helping UK steel producers compete for UK public-sector contracts. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/27/time-running-out-for-uk-steel-industry-trade-chief-tells-ministers\">New guidelines were published last October</a> to \u201chelp steel producers compete on a level playing field with international suppliers\u201d.</p> <p>The worry, however, is that other EU countries would be less fussy and would actively tilt the playing field. Look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-on-track-engineers-reportedly-request-delay\">Hinkley Point</a>, the proposed new nuclear power station in Somerset. While EDF, the constructor, says the project is a \u201cbig opportunity for UK steel\u201d and there is an \u201cexpectation\u201d that a large proportion will come from the UK, everything is subject to a competitive process.

Only Richard Thomas and Baldwins, at the time the UK\u2019s largest steel company and owner of the Ebbw Vale works, stays in public ownership. 1967: Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government passes the Iron and Steel Act 1967, renationalising the industry and bringing 14 big private companies \u2013 about 90% of UK production \u2013 together as the British Steel Corporation, with a workforce of 268,500. 1980: A pivotal year. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government, elected in 1979, sets out to cut British Steel\u2019s losses at a time of overcapacity in the industry, rising energy prices and a deepening recession. 1980 begins with the first national strike by steel workers for more than 50 years, over pay and the threat of plant closures. A deal is eventually struck after nearly 14 weeks, but in May the government appoints Ian MacGregor as British Steel chairman to drive through its savage rationalisation programme and by the end of the year Consett, Corby and Shotton steelworks have closed, with the loss of more than 20,000 jobs. Total employment in the industry almost halves between 1979 and 1981, from 156,600 to 88,200. 1988: Privatisation by the Thatcher government creates British Steel plc, a FTSE 100 company. In 1989-90 the company makes a pre-tax profit of \u00a3733m. UK steel workforce: 55,000. 1992: After the UK slides into another recession in the early 1990s, demand for steel declines.

      "bodyText": "Premier Foods, the company behind Mr Kipling cakes, Bisto gravy and Ambrosia custard, has described a new takeover bid from US spice and sauce maker McCormick as too low but said for the first time that it is prepared to discuss the proposal. The British company has come under pressure from shareholders over the way it has been handling the takeover approach. It said McCormick\u2019s revised bid of 65p a share in cash, which gives an enterprise value of \u00a31.5bn, \u201ccontinues to undervalue Premier and its prospects\u201d. The Premier board is, however, prepared to meet to discuss the business and to \u201cestablish whether McCormick will increase its offer price to a recommendable level\u201d. McCormick will also have to demonstrate that any revised proposal is deliverable, Premier said. \u201cThe board has informed McCormick that it will be expected to provide an improved proposal following these meetings.\u201d Premier\u2019s shares, which surged by more than 70% on news of the takeover approach last week, rose by nearly 7% to 60.4p on Wednesday afternoon. Two of its biggest shareholders, Edinburgh-based Standard Life and US hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co \u2013 which each hold a stake of about 7% \u2013 have urged the company to talk to McCormick, after it swiftly rejected two earlier bids of 60p and 52p. The Maryland-based food group, which makes Schwartz dried spices and sauces, said its revised offer \u201cshould be well received by Premier Foods\u2019 shareholders, employees, pensioners, creditors and other stakeholders\u201d. A week ago, Premier announced a cooperation agreement with Japan\u2019s Nissin, which invented instant noodles in 1958 and is known for Top Ramen and Cup Noodles. Within 24 hours, Nissin became the British company\u2019s biggest shareholder when it bought the 17.3% stake held by US private equity company Warburg Pincus for 63p a share. Nissin is expected to take a seat on Premier\u2019s board. Premier loaded itself with heavy debts when it gobbled up a series of well-known food brands in the years before the financial crisis, but it has since sold off Hovis bread, Hartley\u2019s jam and other brands, and carried out a \u00a31.1bn refinancing, including a rights issue. McCormick said: \u201cMcCormick continues to believe that, with its 127-year heritage, it would be an outstanding custodian for the Premier Foods brands and, with the strength of its balance sheet, can provide benefits for Premier Foods, its pensioners, creditors and other stakeholders, which Premier Foods\u2019 current capital structure cannot deliver with or without the proposed cooperation with Nissin Foods.\u201d Under UK takeover rules, McCormick has to table a firm offer by 5pm on 20 April.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK steel industry has been thrown into its biggest crisis for a generation after Tata Steel announced it was pulling out of the country, putting at least 15,000 jobs at risk. Campaigners for Britain to leave the EU say the turmoil supports their argument. But would Brexit really help Britain\u2019s steel industry? Why is Britain\u2019s steel industry in crisis? A collection of powerful forces have put increasing pressure on steelworks. Demand for the metal in the UK has never recovered since the financial crisis, remaining 30% lower than pre-2008 levels, while energy costs, business rates, and environmental taxes have further squeezed the industry. However, Tata and other steelmakers argue that the biggest problem is China dumping steel into Europe. The majority of Chinese steelmakers are state-owned and are estimated to have lost billions of dollars in 2015 as domestic demand slowed. In response, the Chinese steelmakers are trying to increase the amount of steel they export. Steel exports from China to Europe have more than doubled since 2013, helping to send the price of the metal down to roughly half 2011 levels. Can Europe do anything about this? Simplistically, yes: it could introduce tariffs. One of the reasons China is dumping so much steel into Europe is that other countries have introduced heavy tariffs on such exports the US, for example, has slapped 236% on Chinese steel. Crucially, India has also introduced tariffs, with steel prices predicted to grow by 15% in the country in the first six months of 2016 as a result. This has led to pressure being put on Tata Steel in India to pull out of the UK and focus on the growing domestic market. So why hasn\u2019t the EU responded? The member states of the EU cannot agree what to do. In fact, at a meeting last month, it was Britain which opposed a plan to scrap a regulation known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which would have allowed the EU to increase tariffs on Chinese steel beyond the 9% they sit at. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, argued that this would lead to higher prices for businesses that buy steel. He said: \u201cThere are many British companies ... that would tell you if duties got out of control ... then it would cost them jobs and growth and it would certainly cut their exports.\u201d Downing Street has subsequently argued that Britain is in favour of higher tariffs, but that scrapping the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d was not a proportionate response and could lead to protectionism. So is the EU at fault? The inability of the member states to introduce higher tariffs appears to be an example of European bureaucracy leading to a slow response to a crisis. However, the ambiguity of the government\u2019s position means that is far from clear whether the Conservative government would have introduced higher tariffs if Britain was outside the EU anyway. Britain is also bound by the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), to which China was admitted in 2001, and any trade agreements it would sign in the event of Brexit. Do EU rules prevent the government bailing out Tata Steel? Procurement and state-aid rules mean the government cannot simply hand every state infrastructure project to Tata or hand over cash to prop up Port Talbot. For example, the EU has called for Belgium to take back \u20ac211m of state aid used to prop up steelmaker Duferco Group, while an investigation has been launched into Italy\u2019s support for Ilva. The Belgian support was considered illegal because \u201cyou could not find a market investor that would give them the kinds of loans they got from the authorities\u201d. But again, it is not clear whether the UK government actually wants to go down this path. There are also ways around the rules, such as offering loans instead of cash. While the EU blocks support for \u201cmanufacturers in difficulties\u201d, it allows nurturing the \u201clong-term competitiveness and efficiency\u201d of industry. But has the EU actually helped the steel industry? According to Javid, the EU helps to protect the British steel industry from retaliation in the event of higher tariffs being introduced and ithas the power to slow the flow of Chinese imports. Labour agrees, but claims the government is trying to use the EU to hide its inaction over the crisis. Angela Eagle, the Labour business spokeswoman, has questioned why the government supports handing China market economy status within the WTO, which would severely limit the ability to introduce new tariffs. \u201cGranting market economy status to China in the absence of important safeguards would significantly diminish the capacity of the European Union to guard against Chinese dumping and it has the potential to destroy the UK industry,\u201d she told parliament last month. In addition, other problems facing the steel industry, such as energy prices and business rates, are issues specific to the UK.",

      "bodyText": "EDF has insisted that its plans to complete the \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset by 2025 remain on track, despite reports that some of its engineers had called for a two-year delay and a redesign. It came as an EDF board member representing senior staff said in a letter to employees that he would vote against the controversial project. Christian Taxil, who represents the managers\u2019 union CFE-CGC, is the first board member to go public with doubts about the project. The Financial Times reported that senior engineers at the French energy company had supported a wait of at least two years on the project because of its complexity and advocated a redesign of the reactor technology to make it smaller and cheaper to build. In an internal white paper sent to top executives and seen by the FT, the engineers argued that the \u201crealistic service date was 2027\u201d. But in a statement emailed to Reuters on Wednesday, EDF, which is the 85% owned by the French government, dismissed \u201cunfounded rumours and fantasy information\u201d in the media. \u201cEDF denies these rumours [and] confirms that the start up date for the first reactor is fixed for 2025 and that no delay is envisaged,\u201d the company said. Taxil said EDF should not launch the project now because of difficult power market conditions, technical problems with the two planned reactors and EDF\u2019s weak financial position. He wrote in the letter to staff: \u201cToday, conditions are not right for me to give a positive opinion if such a project were presented to me.\u201d There are growing signs of opposition to the project within EDF, including the resignation of its finance director. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy, has written to staff insisting that it needed more financial backing from the state and would not go ahead without this. The six union members on EDF\u2019s 18-person board are expected to vote against Hinkley Point. They believe that it is too expensive and a risk to the company\u2019s future; EDF is struggling with rising debts. While some non-union board members have voiced doubts about the project in private, all are expected to vote with the management when the board meets on 11 May to make a final decision on the project. A new nuclear reactor at Hinkley in Somerset has been heavily promoted by the chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as key to keeping the lights on in Britain. The last of the UK\u2019s coal-fired power stations is due to close in 2025.",

Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot plant, said company executive Koushik Chatterjee \u201cmade it clear that he wanted to see a British government doing more\u201d. He met the delegation \u2013 which included Kinnock and Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community steelworkers\u2019 union \u2013 twice, including at 1.30am after the board agreed the decision. The MP, who was speaking from Mumbai after the meeting, said no one would criticise Tata Steel because it had been investing in its British arm for seven or eight years. \u201cWe appreciate that Tata Steel is not a charity but a business,\u201d he said. But he accused the government of \u201cabject failure\u201d when it came to protecting the steel industry, arguing that it had not only failed to tackle Chinese dumping, but had been a \u201cringleader\u201d in trying to prevent the European commission from being given more powers to tackle the situation. \u201cWe are rolling out the red carpet for Beijing,\u201d he added, arguing that Britain \u2013 and particularly George Osborne \u2013 was pushing for China to get market economy status at the World Trade Organisation despite the fact that 80% of its steel industry was state owned. \u201cThey are in hock to China. Our commercial policy, our approach to trade and manufacturing, and our overall industrial strategy, is being dictated by Beijing.\u201d He also criticised the government for agreeing to a multibillion pound defence contract late last year that will use Swedish steel. Kinnock said Tata Steel understood its investment in Port Talbot was not just about \u201cpounds and pence\u201d but \u201cfamilies and livelihoods\u201d and had tried to keep the business going. The MP travelled to Mumbai as part of a delegation, with union leaders, to present a plan of how the company could turn the situation around. \u201cWe knew when we flew out that there were three scenarios,\u201d he said, pointing to keeping the plants open, a \u201chard closure\u201d, or looking for a buyer. \u201cSo I\u2019m relieved they have gone for finding a buyer and no hard closure.\u201d He said the situation was not just about the employees but all those linked to the plant in the supply chain. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find a buyer \u2026 we are potentially looking down the barrel at 40,000 jobs. Sajid Javid [the business secretary] flew off to Australia. I\u2019m sure that is important but Tata Steel has just taken the biggest decision to affect the British economy since Gordon Brown bailed out the banks,\u201d he said. People in Port Talbot were \u201cdeeply worried, despondent, unsure about the future\u201d, he said, but there was some relief that the company would be looking for a sale. Kinnock travelled to Mumbai with Rickhuss, and two more representatives from Port Talbot. They put forward ideas to cut costs that had been drawn up by consultants, including \u201csalami slicing\u201d across the business. \u201cIt was always a long shot,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cIt is inconceivable for Britain to stop making steel.\u201d He said he found it frustrating that the government had not done more to support the delegation making the case in Mumbai, saying there had been barely any contact from officials.",

The job cuts would include hundreds of executives and managers, but would not done through forced layoffs, he said. However, the Seattle Times reported that the company, which has dominated the global airline business for decades, was aiming for a 10% overall cut \u2013 which would mean about 8,000 positions in Washington.

In January, Airbus claimed had 57% of the market overall by units ordered, with the 1,036 orders in 2015 making its cumulative order book more than $1tn (\u00a3693bn). its fuel-efficient A320neo family of planes had given it a dominant position in the market for smaller, short-haul aircraft, it said, although Boeing was selling more wide-body aircraft. Boeing delivered 762 planes in 2015 for revenues of $125.bn compared with Airbus\u2019s 635 aircraft, earning $91.6bn.",
