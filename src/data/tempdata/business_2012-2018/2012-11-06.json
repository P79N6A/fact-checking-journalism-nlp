    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has dropped celebrities in its Christmas adverts for the first time in 12 years to focus on product-driven marketing, ending a run of festive campaigns that have featured names including, Twiggy, Antonio Banderas, David Beckham, Helen Mirren, Dannii Minogue and, most recently, The X Factor finalists. Chief executive Marc Bolland said: \"I think celebrities could play an important role for some things, but not for everything.\" This year's campaign \u2013 which starts on Wednesday night \u2013 stars a four-year-old child with Downs syndrome but the focus is on the clothes being modelled. On Tuesday M&amp;S reported better than expected half-year results, though profits were down for the second year in a row. In line with other retailers, sales fell during the Olympics with Bolland describing London as \"a village\" because it was so quiet. The Dutch-born boss, who was under pressure earlier this year after admitting the company failed to buy enough stock on some advertised lines and missed significant fashion trends in womenswear, insisted it was now on track to become a \"multichannel\", international business by the end of 2013. When the disastrous first quarter results were revealed, Kate Bostock, head of general merchandise \u2013 fashion and homewares \u2013 left the business. Since then a string of senior appointments have been made to womenswear, menswear, lingerie and home and beauty. Bolland said: \"We took steps to address the short-term issues in general merchandising and as a result we delivered an improved performance.\" He appointed a new style director, former Debenhams and Jaeger boss Belinda Earl, and has moved head of food John Dixon to replace Bostock, who has since joined online rival Asos. He said Dixon and Earl had \"good chemistry\", adding that Earl, \"has a very good feel for the style of what the British woman wants\". Janie Schaffer from US chain Victoria's Secret has also been hired to head up lingerie, freeing up current lingerie boss Frances Russell to switch to the high-profile womenswear division. To combat the problems which resulted in top lines selling out under the old regime, leaving shoppers frustrated, Bolland instructed buyers to purchase five times the number of important lines they were advertising, especially knitwear, coats and shoes. The company also backed fashion trends with more confidence. M&amp;S said it had already shifted 44,000 military-style coats. Bolland added that the Olympics brought more confidence to customers, but not to the bottom line. He said: \"It was like a village in London and you could drive around in a couple of minutes because there was hardly anyone there. \" Did we see retail sales increase? No. Did we believe it was important to have done it, leading to that positive mood swing? Absolutely.\" As part of his three-year turnaround plan, which is halfway through, Bolland said he wants to turn the company into a multichannel international brand and plans further expansion overseas. Bolland said that when he took over the company M&amp;S had a strong brand, but a \"complex and inflexible supply chain\" with \"unclear sub-brands\" and stores that were \"lacking inspiration\". To combat the issues, it has launched a next-day delivery service on its website and wants its new iPhone app to be used more than any other fashion retailer's. Currently, 43% of all online sales are for store collection. Pre-tax profits fell 10% to \u00a3290m in the six months to the end of September, which was ahead of City expectations of \u00a3280m. Like-for-like general merchandise sales were down 1.8% in the second quarter compared with the near 7% slump recorded in the previous period. Like-for-like sales at its food division rose 1.6%. In common with Next boss Lord Wolfson, Bolland said recent trading had been volatile: \"This, coupled with continuing pressure on consumers' disposable incomes, makes us cautious about the outlook for the rest of this year. However, we are well set up for the Christmas trading period.\" By comparison, Primark announced a 15% jump in operating profits to \u00a3356m for the year to 15 September. Like-for-like sales climbed 3% with owner Associated British Foods (ABF) flagging strong trading in Britain, particularly over the summer months, and \"encouraging\" sales of its winter ranges in the new financial year. Chief executive of ABF, George Weston, said recent expansions in Europe went better than expected and the UK business continues to be strong. He added: \"We sold 7.5m items of clothing with the Union Jack between the Olympics and diamond jubilee.\" However, he revealed that, like M&amp;S, sales fell during the Olympics as shopping crowds stayed away from central London. \"We put on extra temporary staff but then rather regretted it.\" The company said sales in Spain continue to impress, despite the downturn, with Weston adding that when they recently opened a store in the Alicante region they received 26,000 applications for the 200 jobs on offer.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's oldest man, Reg Dean, celebrated his 110th birthday on Sunday. But it may not be long before he is overtaken in the age stakes by a new breed of \"supercentenarians\". The boss of one of Britain's main financial bodies on Tuesday revealed that several insurers are currently modelling pension products on the basis that their customers could reach the age of 120 or even 125. Speaking to hundreds of actuaries at a conference, Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, added that within our lifetime it will be \"the norm\" for people to live to 100 or more. But this, he said, threw up huge challenges in terms of getting people to save more for what may end up being a very long retirement. Life expectancy has been growing steadily for decades, and the government has already predicted that 27% of today's under-16s will reach 100 \u2013 a total of 3.3 million people. Born in November 1902, former church minister Reg Dean, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, is the first British man born in the 20th century to become a supercentenarian \u2013 someone who has reached the age of 110 \u2013 but he won't be the last. Legal &amp; General on Tuesday quoted Office for National Statistics data showing that the number of UK people aged 100 or more has increased five-fold \u2013 from 2,500 in 1980 to 12,640 in 2010 \u2013 and said that projections suggest the number of centenarians in the UK will exceed 160,000 by mid-2040. During his speech in Brussels, Thoresen said the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had identified the ageing population as \"one of the greatest threats to the UK's fiscal sustainability in the next 50 years\". He added: \"I know of several insurers, and you may be among them, who are now modelling pensions and retirement savings products on the assumption that customers could live to be 120 or 125 \u2013 and with very different patterns of retirement. \"With men and women living on average 30 years longer than they did 100 years ago, by 2100 people living to over 100 years old will be the norm. How will we ensure that mankind's greatest achievement of prolonging life in this way doesn't lead to poverty for millions of people, and health and social care systems which cannot cope with the increased demands being made of them?\" He set out a plan to tackle the UK \"savings gap\" through pension charges that are clear and easily understood to be value for money; investment options that are transparent and relevant to savers; better communication with customers; a more flexible approach to help people approaching retirement understand the options available; and \"adaptable post-retirement options to meet changing financial challenges, such as costs of funding long-term care\".",

He said pressures including new capital requirements and stricter regulations meant further cuts were to be expected. \"All of our clients are re-evaluating this [job cuts] almost on a monthly basis,\" said Burrowes. \"Many of the banks still need to go through major change \u2026 I think the only conclusion you can really reach is that there will be further job cuts, particularly in investment banking.\" Last month PwC's joint survey of the finance industry, in conjunction with the CBI, found 60% of banks reporting lower headcount for the three months to the end of September. Last week UBS announced up to 3,000 posts would go at its London offices, part of a wider cull of 10,000 staff. Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have also announced job cuts, while Barclays and Societe Generale have indicated the are looking at shrinking their respective investment banking operations. The CEBR chief executive, Douglas McWilliams, said: \"The fall in activity is partly a function of the weak economy, partly a hangover effect from the financial crisis and partly caused by increasing regulation which limits access to bank cash to bankroll financial transactions. The business model for many firms in the City, which was based on taking a percentage from yields of 8% plus, has to change in a world where low yields are likely for many years to come.\" Meanwhile, job vacancies in financial services in the UK dropped by 24% for the three months to the end of September compared with a year ago, according to eFinancialCareers. The careers website said there were double-digit falls around the world, with declines in Australia reaching 34%. In the US the drop was 18%.",

      "bodyText": "On that note, I'm stopping the live blog until tomorrow morning, when we'll pick up the second day of the general strike and all the action from the Greek parliament as the austerity package is voted on. In the meantime, there's the small matter of the US election to resolve - we're live-blogging that nail-biter here. Until tomorrow, thanks for reading...and goodnight! Greece's finance minister Yiannis Strournaras has racheted up the pressure on the eve of the austerity vote, reports Helena Smith who says he has described the ballot as coming at \"the most crucial juncture\" since the debt crisis erupted in Athens three years ago. Stournaras told a parliamentary committee: The country has to adopt this package of measures to which it has committed to avoid bankruptcy ... We are now at the most crucial crossroads and we have to make the right decision... The road ahead is difficult and steep but it is our historic responsibility to to complete the effort that we began,\" Stournaras added, adding the country is \"going though a peculiar economic war.\" Alas, it appears that Athens hasn't been quite as peaceful as we'd hoped. Not only was a car set alight in the Athens district of Exarchia, but the fire engine that went to its aid was then attacked with molotov cocktails. Our correspondent Helena Smith explains: I just spoken to the Hellenic Police press spokesman Lt Col Christos Manouras who said molotov cocktails were indeed lobbed at a fire engine that had rushed \"to put out the flames engulfing a car in Exarchia.\" \"The fire engine went up in flames,\" he said. \"But other than that, today's protests thanks be to God went very, very peacefully,\" he said. Manouras refused to be drawn on how many police participated in today's operation but he put the number of demonstrators at \"between 35 to 40,000 people.\" Anthony Verias, who has been reporting from Athens today, has more details: Above is some video of the blazing fire truck courtesy of Newsbeast. European stock markets are closed, and all the main indices have posted gains. FTSE 100: up 45 points at 5884, + 0.79% German DAX: up 48 points at 7375, + 0.66% French CAC: up 29 points at 3478, + 0.86% Italian FTSE MIB: up 139 points at 15683, +0.9% Spanish IBEX: up 19 point at 7837, + 0.24% And with the Dow Jones industrial average now 128 points higher on Wall Street, up nearly 1%, the mood is really quite upbeat. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains that the City was cheered by some decent financial results this morning: The stand-out performer was BMW, as the company posted a record Q3 profit, boosted by sales in China and Japan. Better than expected numbers from high street retailers Marks and Spencer and Primark have also helped. For more info: \u2022 M&amp;S's first-half profits fall for second year running \u2022 BMW enjoys sales record after 30% jump in China NIESR, the think tank, had some gloomy news for UK readers this afternoon - it will take another two years before Britain's returns to its peak GDP level. NIESR predicted that the UK economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to October (suggesting a slowdown last month, after the official reading of 1% growth in the three months to September). That, though, leaves total GDP 2.8% lower than in autumn 2008, before the financial crisis struck. Day one of Greece's general strike is drawing to a close with a quite dramatic sunset: Here's an example, via freelance journalists Janine Louloudi (who has several more in her tweet feed) While today's demonstrations were taking place in Greece, the European Union was being criticised by its auditors for failing to run its accounts properly. For the 18th year in a row, the EU's auditors refused to sign off its accounts. It said that almost 4% of funds were wasted in the last financial year. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, explains: Vitor Caldeira, president of the court of auditors ,which examines the EU books every year, said the message was \"consistent with previous years, but this year it matters more than ever\". He added: \"With Europe's public finances under severe pressure, there remains scope to spend EU money more efficiently and in a better targeted manner.\" The court found \"an estimated error rate\" of 3.9% was found in payments from the \u20ac130bn budget to the 27 member states in 2011, slightly up from the waste identified for the previous year. The overall criticism of the administration of the budget was in line with the verdict delivered annually for many years, in what has become a Brussels ritual. Here's the full story: EU budget watchdog says funds were wasted last year. Marks &amp; Spencer has pledged that it will not pull out of Greece, despite the country's long recession and the prospect of fresh austerity. Speaking at the company's half-year results presentation today, chief executive Marc Bolland said: We have closed one or two stores in Greece, but we have no plans to leave the country completely. A small vote of confidence from the high street retailer. (that's via my colleague Simon Neville) We've received more photos from today's demonstrations and general strike in Greece; here's a selection of the best: Wall Street has just opened on US Election Day, and the Dow is creeping higher -- up 32 points, or 0.25%, at 13144 in very early trading. That matches the gentle rise in most European markets today (see 2.07pm for a round-up) Reuters estimates that there were around 16,000 people protesting outside the Greek parliament today, which is rather fewer than in recent protests. CNN, though, puts the total number of protesters in Athens at 35,000. The financial markets are as calm as the scenes in Greece right now, with most European stock markets showing minor gains. FTSE 100: up 36 points at 5875, + 0.63% German DAX: up 37 points at 7364, + 0.5% French CAC: up 9 points at 3458, + -0.28% Italian FTSE MIB: up 30 points at 15571, +0.18% Spanish IBEX: down 1 point at 7817, - 0.02% This morning's weak economic data from the eurozone (see 9.11am) and the UK (see 9.35am) have not alarmed traders. Instead, the City appears to be waiting for the results of the US election, and the austerity vote in Greece tomorrow night.... Here's an update from Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens: In the history of protests that Greece has seen so far today's will surely go down as one of the shortest and sweetest. Around me, as I write these words in front of the Athens parliament, municipal cleaners are hard at work, brooms and giant black plastic bags in hands. Municipal trucks likewise are swishing the boulevards clean - riot police are going home. You have to wonder in this funfare atmosphere whether Greeks are angry at all. Panos Skourletis, the Syriza party spokesman who I bump into in front of the parliament, says Greeks are an unpredictable people and I shouldn't be fooled. \"At any moment there could be an eruption of blind violence,\" he says. \"Even if these measures are passed, they will never be able to enforce them because Greeks are at the end of their tether.\" But not everyone is happy with today's events. The head of the private sector union GSEE, Yannis Panagopoulos, has blamed striking transport workers for preventing more people getting to the centre of Athens. Panagopoulos told a radio station: Unfortunately, the turnout in today's rally is not as big as it should be. This shouldn't be as much of a problem tomorrow, though, when more transport systems are working (as explained at 1.15pm) Greek residents confirm the theory that tomorrow's protests will be larger (see 12.05pm). As Keep Talking Greece explains, transport links will be less disrupted tomorrow. Here's the details of which systems will be working tomorrow, and from when: Metro staff are officially on strike tomorrow too, but it will operate from 3pm because conductors have agreed to work (Theodora Oikonomides kindly explains). Meanwhile, the BBC's Mark Lowen agrees that today's protests have gone pretty smoothly: It appears that the protests in Athens are subsiding pretty peacefully. Some marches are taking place, but this photo (from the live feed I linked to at 11.13am) shows that Syntagma Square is returning to normal* * - although scenes of thousands of protesters are also pretty normal for Syntagma these days. And Spyros Gkelis, another source of accurate information from Greece, reports that this morning's protests in the city of Thessaloniki ended peacefully. Here's another photo from Anthony Verias in Athens, showing that one demonstrator took a guillotine along to today's protests: Not exactly the cuts that the Troika has in mind.... French president Francois Hollande has announced plans to hike taxes and cut government spending this morning -- including a partial u-turn on his a pre-election pledge not to raise VAT. This is in response to an official report calling for radical action to stimulate the French economy. However, the plan does not go quite as far as veteran industrial Louis Gallois proposed yesterday. The basis of the plan is a \u20ac20bn tax break for businesses over the next three years, which will cut French labour costs by 6%. It will be paid for though: \u2022 \u20ac10bn of government 'cost savings' in 2014 and 2015. \u2022 Raising two sales taxes (the main rate rises to 20% from 19.6%, while the second band jumps to 10% from 7%). \u2022 Cutting the lowest rate (levied on 'cultural' items such as books) to 5% from 5.5%. Gallois argued that French firms needed a \u20ac30bn \"competitiveness shock\". That, though, was a step too far for a Parisian government already facing unpopularity over its existing austerity plans. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, has been talking to trade unionists who say today\u2019s protests are but \u201ca dress rehearsal\u201d for the major demonstrations that will grip the country tomorrow. Helena writes: Greek police may be out in force \u2013 dispatched from the early hours along the boulevards and side-streets of Athens\u2019 historic centre \u2013 but even trade unionists are saying they are not expecting \u201cmuch of a turn out\u201d today. The news black out, triggered by the decision of journalists to walk off the on Monday, has resulted in far fewer people turning out for the mass rallies organised by unions representing the public and private sector this morning, activists say. \u201cToday\u2019s demonstrations are smaller than usual mostly because journalists, wrongly in our opinion, decided to stage their own industrial action yesterday,\u201d said Ilias Iliopoulos at ADEDY, the civil servants\u2019 union as protestors gathered at the Pedio tou Areos park. \u201cThe big day after this dress rehearsal will be tomorrow when we expect thousands to descend on Syntagma square for the vote itself,\u201d he told me. \u201cThese policies have brought nothing but tragedy to our country; more than two million people are now unemployed, 500,000 households have no income whatsoever and 70 percent of the population are living on, or below, the poverty line. They are clearly not working. We are all praying that this bone-headed decision to enforce more of the same will not lead to a social explosion and with it unseemly behaviour.\u201d So far, the protests in Athens have been peaceful \u2013 as these new photos from Anthony Verias show. The first is a snap of the main opposition party, Syriza, taking part in today's march, and the second shows a calm scene from Syntagma Square. Anthony says he's planning to tweet during the two-day general strike, so worth a follow if you're on Twitter (and if you're not, I'll doubtless be using his tweets again here!). Aleka Papariga, the head of the Greek Communist Party, has urged members to take up civil 'disobedience' against the country's government, in an attempt to block its ongoing austerity programmes. Speaking in Athens this morning, Papariga called for: systematic and well-organised disobedience not only to the government's decisions but to the overall system. Zougla TV is another good place to watch live footage from Athens: just click here. (that's via the ever clued-up Yiannis Mouzakis who blogs as The Prodigal Greek) Looking for a live video feed from Greece? Look no further: It's currently showing a large, peaceful group marching through the streets of Athens (once the advert has finished) If you're on twitter, you can use the hashtags #6ngr and #7ngr to track today and tomorrow's general strikes. It's a great way of seeing the latest photos and action across the country, and hearing what people are saying. For example, Gina Ware who runs Aegean Light, an art and photographic prints business in the face of the Greek crisis, comments: Confirmation that the Greek riot police are ready for action in Syntagma: Just in, this photo of Syntagma Square filling up with demonstrators as the communist union march arrives. All looks peaceful, and there are no reports of violence at any of the demonstrations. The mood is still tense, though. The tweet below includes a photo of a protest at Kalamata, in southern Greece. The text on the map reads: Greece is on sale, do you care? Martin Koehring of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons that this week's two-day general strike could sway some government MPs against supporting the austerity plan in tomorrow night's vote. Socialist members of the coalition are particularly vulnerable, he suggested: The strike may convince more MPs from the centre-left Pasok party to vote against the latest austerity package; Pasok is part of the fragile three-party government coalition but has seen its support among voters eroded as a result of backing austerity. With the junior coalition partner, Democratic Left, abstaining, the government only has a small majority in the parliament. The Greek unions have arrived in Syntagma Square: here's a snap of the communist PAME union on their way in typical regimented fashion. Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura International, has predicted that the Greece government will get its austerity package approved - but it won't receive a final decision on its next aid tranche next Monday (despite Olli Rehn's encouraging comments - see 8.13am). Speaking on Bloomberg a few minutes ago, Cailloux forecast a \"narrow majority\" in favour of the austerity package in the vote on Wedensday night, and a \"larger majority\" in Sunday night's vote on the 2013 budget. He added: I don't think we'll get a fully-fledged deal on the 12th - we've learned the hard way that there's always a deal after the deal. That next deal could be a vote in the German parliament over new aid terms for Greece, he suggested. Greek students have also been taking part in today's strike, and here's a video clip from the city of Veroia (warning, don't have your volume turned up too loud...) Despite the uncertainty over Greece's future, it just sold \u20ac1.3bn of short-term bonds. The auction of \u20ac1.3bn six-month bills was well subscribed (with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.7), and an average yield (interest rate) of 4.41%. That's slightly lower than the 4.46% at last month's sale. There was gridlock on the Athens' ring road this morning. The general strike forced more workers into their cars, as taxi drivers, metro, tram and train workers are all taking part in the 48-hour walkout. And in contrast: The Greek general strike is meant to sway MPs as they decide whether to support the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package, but it is also causing disruption to citizens in Greece. I just spoke with one private sector employee who works in the financial sector (let's call him D.A), who argues that this issue doesn't get enough attention. D.A told me: The issue is that most people focus on the minority that strikes and pays little attention to the private sector workforce who give support to most measures but their work is dampened because they cannot go to work, deal with customs, lawyers, or tax authorities because of the strike. Greece's private sector has already been battered by the long recession - a survey last month showed that almost a third of stores in the Athens commercial districts have closed since the crisis began. More economic gloom. UK industrial production tumbled by 1.7% in September compared with August -- the second-biggest monthly fall since August 2009 (behind June, which was hit by the Jubilee double-bank holiday). That means UK's industrial output was 2.6% less than a year ago - alarming economists. The slump was primarily due to a drop in oil and gas extraction, which suffered its biggest monthly fall since 1997. Police officers are gathering at Syntagma Square in the centre of Athens, where union demonstrations will converge in an hour or two's time. This tweet shows the latest scene: Meanwhile, the communist PAME union have given their speeches (which were broadcast life - see 8.52am), and have begun their march to Syntagma. And here's a picture of that: Back to this morning's economic surveys, which show that the eurozone service sector's downturn worsened in October. The picture is particularly alarming in France, where its service sector PMI fell to a one-year low of 44.6, down from 45 in September. That means output shrank at a faster rate. Germany's service sector also shrank, for the sixth month in a row, with a PMI of 48.4 vs 49.7 in September. That's suggest Germany's economy could contract this quarter. The overall eurozone service sector PMI also contracted, to 46.0 - it's lowest since July 2009. It's not a great day to be a tourist in Athens - as the picture above shows, the Hadrian's Library archaeological site has shut its doors for today's general strike. Members of the Communist PAME union have gathered at Omonoia Square in Athens for their march (see 7.43am for details). This video shows a live feed from the scene -- so far the event is noisy, well-attended, and peaceful. That's via Twitter user and blogger @Inflammatory_, who is on the streets of Athens today covering the strike. Just in: Spain's service sector has shrunk for the 16th month in a row. But there is a glimmer of optimism - the rate of contraction has slowed. Markit's Spanish services PMI came in at 41.2, up from September's 40.2 and better than analysts had expected. However, it's also a long way from the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction (for example, UK service sector PMI came in at 50.6 yesterday, the lowest in 22 months). Markit's Andrew Harker said it had been another \"dreadful month\" for Spanish service companies, who are battling a long recession and further austerity measures. There is one piece of encouraging news for Greece this morning - Olli Rehn, European Commissioner responsible for the euro, had declared that eurozone leaders are on track to agree a new deal for Greece next Monday. Speaking in Mexico City last night, Rehn said: We need to have a common view on how to reduce the debt burden by the 12th of November Eurogroup meeting, and I am confident that we will be able to reach that common view... As is quite well known, there is a need to fill in the financing needs of Greece in mid-November. Rehn's comments came after unnamed EU officials briefed reporters that a deal was unlikely on the 12th, even though Greece faces a \u20ac4bn debt redemption on the 16th (that's the 'financing needs' that Rehn alludes to). Here's another photo from Athens Eleftherios Venizelos airport, showing that the railway station is shuttered: Greek unions will be holding protest marches in Athens later today. The ADEDY (public sector) and GSEE (private sector) unions are holding a joint march. It begins at 11am local time (9am GMT) and will end at Syntagma Square. In a press release (original Greek, Google translation into English), GSEE lambasted the austerity package as \"barbaric\", \"anti-social\" and \"ineffective\". The communist workers union, PAME, is holding a separate demo from 10.30am local time, which will converge with the ADEDY/GSEE march. Reuters reports that police are \"beefing up\" for these rallies, in anticipation of another clash with stone-throwing youths. The best place for full details of today's strike is Living In Greece, which runs a comprehensive list of who's taking part and what the effect will be. It shows that buses, trams and metro lines in Athens will be offline all day, while air traffic control staff will only down tools for a few hours. Some flights have been cancelled, and these pictures from Eleftherios Venizelos airport at Athens, which just arrived, show a pretty quiet scene: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other important developments across the world economy. A two-day general strike is under way in Greece today. Unions and employees are making one last attempt to thwart the \u20ac13.5bn package of cuts and tax rises that which arrived at the Athens parliament last night. Hospital staff, teachers, lawyers, power workers, journalists and transport staff on trains, ferries and at air traffic control stations are all taking part. Unions are promising \"the mother of all strikes\" today, as they try to block the austerity programme which will be voted on tomorrow night, after four months of negotiations. Athens has been plastered with posters promoting the strike, as this photo from Syntagma Square shows: Heavy disruption is expected, with the strike not ending until midnight tomorrow. The main opposition Syriza party supports the walkout, with spokesman Panos Skourletis telling the Guardian: These measures may be voted through, but they cannot be enforced because the tolerance levels of Greeks have really passed their limits.... \"The government does not have the political legitimacy to pass policies which it promised it would renegotiate during the election campaign [in June] and which it knows will lead to the annihilation of our nation. The only way out is fresh elections here and now. But as we reported yesterday, government insiders expected the measures to be approved, narrowly, in Wednesday night's vote. We'll be tracking all the action in Greece today, with parliamentary committees due to consider the austerity bill today. There's also plenty of economic data coming up, including a new survey of Europe's services sector - which will show whether the eurozone's downturn is continuing.",

She urged George Osborne to build on this cautious optimism by offering \"a clear vision from government at the autumn statement about the priorities for our economy and a plan to ensure growth stays on track\". When official figures released last month showed the recession drawing to a close in the third quarter of 2012, the chancellor was careful to give the news a guarded welcome, stressing that growth could weaken again in coming months. Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said the worse-than-expected performance from industry might help tempt policymakers on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to extend its quantitative easing (QE) programme at their monthly meeting on Thursday. \"Signs that the economy is still struggling markedly despite the third-quarter GDP rebound keeps the door wide open to the Bank of England enacting more QE,\" he said. So far, the Bank has pumped \u00a3375bn of electronically created money into the economy to try and offset the impact of the credit drought from crisis-hit banks, and the lack of demand from markets in the eurozone.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A territorial dispute between Japan and China over a group of uninhabited islands is wreaking havoc with Japanese car makers while benefiting German competitors, as Nissan was forced to slash its profit forecast and BMW posted a 40% surge in Chinese sales. Nissan joined Honda and Toyota in suffering plummeting demand in the world's largest car market due to a boycott by consumers angry about Japanese ownership of the the Senkaku Islands, which are known as Diaoyu in China. Nissan cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth to $4bn (\u00a32.5bn), reflecting its dependence on a market that accounts for more than a quarter of sales. The scale of the boycott was revealed by October sales figures, which showed that Nissan and its Chinese joint venture sold 64,300 vehicles \u2013 a decline of 41% on the same month last year. Toyota and Honda reported Chinese sales slumps of 49% and 41% respectively in September. As well as cutting its full-year profit forecast, Nissan trimmed annual sales forecasts as it estimated that sales in China will come in at 1.175m vehicles in 2012, 175,000 fewer than it thought previously. That helped to put a dent in global forecasts, with Nissan predicting sales of 5.08m vehicles in the year to March 2013, down from its former forecast of 5.35m. Nissan said, however, that there had been signs of a revival in China. \"We are gradually seeing signs of recovery [in China],\" said Nissan's chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga. \"Customers are gradually coming back to dealerships.\" Germany's BMW said ongoing Chinese demand for luxury vehicles \u2013 also a boon for UK carmakers such as Bentley \u2013 helped to overcome a weak European performance in the third quarter from July to September. Overall sales rose by 13.7% to a record \u20ac18.8bn (\u00a315bn), while net profit rose 16% to \u20ac1.3bn. Chinese sales rose by 40% to nearly 80,000 units, overshadowing an anaemic European performance that saw a 2.6% increase in sales, with southern Europe dragging down performance. Even BMW's home market disappointed, as German sales fell by 0.5%. Mark Fulthorpe, analyst at IHS Automotive, said non-Japanese car makers were benefiting from the Senkaku dispute. \"Who is likely to win if people are walking away from Nissan, Toyota and Honda? It will have significant benefits for German manufacturers and [Korean car makers] Hyundai and Kia.\" China aside, BMW warned of an \"increasingly uncertain market environment\" with the final three months of the year posing difficulties for an industry \"likely to be confronted with adverse business conditions\". With the eurozone area expected to post flat economic growth next year, hopes of a concerted revival in the European car market are slim. In September, European car sales fell for the 12th consecutive month, with Spain posting a 36.8% fall in sales, exceeded only by Greece, with a fall of 48.5%. UK car sales in October, published on Tuesday, showed that the domestic market was outperforming the continent. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car registrations rose 12% compared with October last year to more than 151,000 units. So far this year, the UK car market has grown 5%. The top three sellers in October were the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa in second place and the Ford Focus. However, a manufacturing expert at Deloitte, David Raistrick, said car makers were preregistering cars - a practice that can flatter monthly sales figures - and 2013 is likely to be a tougher year for the UK market. \"Can the UK defy gravity? The answer is no. Manufacturers are helping support sales,\" said Raistrick.",

      "body": "<p>A territorial dispute between Japan and China over a group of uninhabited islands is wreaking havoc with Japanese car makers while benefiting German competitors, as Nissan was forced to slash its profit forecast and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/06/bmw-sales-record-china\" title=\"\">BMW posted a 40% surge in Chinese sales</a>.</p> <p>Nissan joined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/japanese-car-sales-china-islands-dispute\" title=\"\">Honda and Toyota in suffering plummeting demand</a> in the world's largest car market due to a boycott by consumers angry about Japanese ownership of the the Senkaku Islands, which are known as Diaoyu in China. Nissan cut its full-year net profit forecast by a fifth to $4bn (\u00a32.5bn), reflecting its dependence on a market that accounts for more than a quarter of sales. The scale of the boycott was revealed by October sales figures, which showed that Nissan and its Chinese joint venture sold 64,300 vehicles \u2013 a decline of 41% on the same month last year. Toyota and Honda reported Chinese sales slumps of 49% and 41% respectively in September.</p> <p>As well as cutting its full-year profit forecast, Nissan trimmed annual sales forecasts as it estimated that sales in China will come in at 1.175m vehicles in 2012, 175,000 fewer than it thought previously. That helped to put a dent in global forecasts, with Nissan predicting sales of 5.08m vehicles in the year to March 2013, down from its former forecast of 5.35m. Nissan said, however, that there had been signs of a revival in China.</p> <p>\"We are gradually seeing signs of recovery [in China],\" said Nissan's chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga. \"Customers are gradually coming back to dealerships.\"</p> <p>Germany's BMW said ongoing Chinese demand for luxury vehicles \u2013 also a boon for UK carmakers such as Bentley \u2013 helped to overcome a weak European performance in the third quarter from July to September. Overall sales rose by 13.7% to a record \u20ac18.8bn (\u00a315bn), while net profit rose 16% to \u20ac1.3bn. Chinese sales rose by 40% to nearly 80,000 units, overshadowing an anaemic European performance that saw a 2.6% increase in sales, with southern Europe dragging down performance. Even BMW's home market disappointed, as German sales fell by 0.5%.</p> <p>Mark Fulthorpe, analyst at IHS Automotive, said non-Japanese car makers were benefiting from the Senkaku dispute. \"Who is likely to win if people are walking away from Nissan, Toyota and Honda? It will have significant benefits for German manufacturers and [Korean car makers] Hyundai and Kia.\"</p> <p>China aside, BMW warned of an \"increasingly uncertain market environment\" with the final three months of the year posing difficulties for an industry \"likely to be confronted with adverse business conditions\". With the eurozone area expected to post flat economic growth next year, hopes of a concerted revival in the European car market are slim. In September, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/european-car-sales-fall-new-car-registrations\" title=\"\">European car sales fell for the 12th consecutive month</a>, with Spain posting a 36.8% fall in sales, exceeded only by Greece, with a fall of 48.5%.</p> <p>UK car sales in October, published on Tuesday, showed that the domestic market was outperforming the continent. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new car registrations rose 12% compared with October last year to more than 151,000 units. So far this year, the UK car market has grown 5%. The top three sellers in October were the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa in second place and the Ford Focus.</p> <p>However, a manufacturing expert at Deloitte, David Raistrick, said car makers were preregistering cars - a practice that can flatter monthly sales figures - and 2013 is likely to be a tougher year for the UK market. \"Can the UK defy gravity? The answer is no. Manufacturers are helping support sales,\" said Raistrick.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Executive pay up 27% despite backlash", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pay and benefits of top business executives rose by 27% last year to an average of \u00a34m each, despite a backlash against big basic salaries and bonuses, according to research. Income Data Services found that while basic pay rose slightly and standard bonuses fell noticeably, total executive packages have been bolstered by a big increase in long term incentive plans (LTIPs), share awards based on a company's performance over several years. The study of the biggest FTSE 100 companies shows LTIPs have risen more than 80% across the board in the past year, and in the most recent figures for 2011-12 accounted for more than half of chief executives' total remuneration. The slowdown in basic pay and bonuses will be welcomed by campaigners pushing for tough action on executive pay amid concerns about run-away salary costs, especially when companies perform badly. LTIPs can be fairer as they reward directors for achieving long term goals, not pursuing short term profits at the expense of future business. There are still concerns that some schemes allow big payouts to executives at loss-making businesses. \"Many LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than their own company's historical performance, meaning that directors stand to earn a payment even if their company's performance has worsened \u2013 as long as their chosen peer group has done even worse,\" said Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS report. Another feature of the renewed focus on long-term performance is big handouts of shares, many of them awarded in 2008 and 2009, since when the stockmarket has risen more than 60%. \"When share prices have subsequently risen, as they have since the depth of the recession, directors have had the potential to profit from 'windfall' LTP gains,\" said Tatton. \"Shareholders will not take issue with directors' earnings increasing, provided they are doing so in line with company performance and share price.\" Critics seized on continuing rises in total remuneration when the economy has been in recession. The IDS report says the median increase in FTSE 100 chief executives' packages was 10% to \u00a33.2m each. Deborah Hargreaves, former chairman of the independent High Pay Commission's report into executive pay and now director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: \"At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everybody else. \"The balance of executive pay may have shifted from annual bonuses to complex incentive plans, but the effect remains the same. Performance-related pay still encourages excessive risk-taking for short term rewards. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.\" The figures for executive pay come as the One Society thinktank publishes a report arguing that despite promises to voters by the three big parties at the last general election the gap between the best- and worst-paid workers has widened, and will increase further as a result of existing government policies. The contrast was seized on by Unite, the biggest trade union. \"While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze even more cash from their companies,\" said the general secretary, Len McCluskey. The slowdown in basic pay, up by a median of 3.5%, and reduction in bonuses by a median 4.9%, could be attributed to a number of factors, said Tatton. \"Whether as a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p>Pay and benefits of top business executives rose by 27% last year to an average of \u00a34m each, despite a backlash against big basic salaries and bonuses, according to research.</p> <p>Income Data Services found that while basic pay rose slightly and standard bonuses fell noticeably, total executive packages have been bolstered by a big increase in long term incentive plans (LTIPs), share awards based on a company's performance over several years.</p> <p>The study of the biggest FTSE 100 companies shows LTIPs have risen more than 80% across the board in the past year, and in the most recent figures for 2011-12 accounted for more than half of chief executives' total remuneration.</p> <p>The slowdown in basic pay and bonuses will be welcomed by campaigners pushing for tough action on executive pay amid concerns about run-away salary costs, especially when companies perform badly.</p> <p>LTIPs can be fairer as they reward directors for achieving long term goals, not pursuing short term profits at the expense of future business.</p> <p>There are still concerns that some schemes allow big payouts to executives at loss-making businesses.</p> <p>\"Many LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than their own company's historical performance, meaning that directors stand to earn a payment even if their company's performance has worsened \u2013 as long as their chosen peer group has done even worse,\" said Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS report.</p> <p>Another feature of the renewed focus on long-term performance is big handouts of shares, many of them awarded in 2008 and 2009, since when the stockmarket has risen more than 60%.</p> <p>\"When share prices have subsequently risen, as they have since the depth of the recession, directors have had the potential to profit from 'windfall' LTP gains,\" said Tatton. \"Shareholders will not take issue with directors' earnings increasing, provided they are doing so in line with company performance and share price.\"</p> <p>Critics seized on continuing rises in total remuneration when the economy has been in recession. The IDS report says the median increase in FTSE 100 chief executives' packages was 10% to \u00a33.2m each.</p> <p>Deborah Hargreaves, former chairman of the independent High Pay Commission's report into executive pay and now director of the High Pay Centre thinktank, said: \"At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everybody else.</p> <p>\"The balance of executive pay may have shifted from annual bonuses to complex incentive plans, but the effect remains the same. Performance-related pay still encourages excessive risk-taking for short term rewards. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.\"</p> <p>The figures for executive pay come as the One Society thinktank publishes a report arguing that despite promises to voters by the three big parties at the last general election the gap between the best- and worst-paid workers has widened, and will increase further as a result of existing government policies.</p> <p>The contrast was seized on by Unite, the biggest trade union. \"While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze even more cash from their companies,\" said the general secretary, Len McCluskey.</p> <p>The slowdown in basic pay, up by a median of 3.5%, and reduction in bonuses by a median 4.9%, could be attributed to a number of factors, said Tatton.</p> <p>\"Whether as a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,\" he added.</p>",
