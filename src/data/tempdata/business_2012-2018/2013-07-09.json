Yet there is little sign in the hard data that the economy has turned the corner. Manufacturing output fell by 0.8% in May, while the trade deficit has widened, to \u00a32.4bn.

The pound was close to a three-year low against the dollaron Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "The British sugar giant Tate &amp; Lyle has imported large volumes of sugar from Cambodia through a supplier that is accused of using child labour and being complicit in expropriating land and inflicting violence on local people. Tate &amp; Lyle \u2013 which is the EU\u2019s largest cane sugar producer and whose ingredients are used in a wide range of foods around the world \u2013 , has used the Thai KSL Group since 2011 for its supplies from Cambodia. However, KSL is alleged to have been complicit, along with the Cambodian government, in the eviction of people from their land, arson and theft. Villagers interviewed by the Guardian claim they had their homes and property destroyed and land taken. They also say they were subjected to physical violence and that one of them was killed during the process of land clearance for plantations. Children as young as nine work on Cambodian plantations run by KSL. The allegations against Tate &amp; Lyle call into question the ethics of the sugar industry\u2019s supply chain in much the same way that the clothing and precious metals sectors have been scrutinised. Two hundred Cambodian families have launched a lawsuit against Tate &amp; Lyle in the high court in London. The families claim the company knew \u2013 or should have known \u2013 of the allegations against its supplier and say they want to be compensated for the value of sugar grown on land they allege still belongs to them. Many of those who claim to have lost land say they have since been forced to work on the plantations, where they can earn as little as 79p a day cutting down 1,000 stems of sugar cane. Activists say nearly 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) have been cleared in three provinces to make way for sugar plantations since 2006. Most of that land, they argue, has been stolen from subsistence farmers. \u201cI had to pull my kids out of school and send them to work on the plantation after they took our land away because we couldn\u2019t afford to eat,\u201d said Chea Sok, 38, one of the claimants in the lawsuit. \u201cWe lost five hectares, around $2,500 of income, and got no compensation, not even one riel.\u201d Tate &amp; Lyle contends that it used third-party auditors to vet KSL for legal, ethical and sustainability standards and believes that land concessions were purchased legitimately, compensation paid to villagers and that the sugar it buys is free of human rights abuses. However, it has also clarified that it is ready to break its contract with KSL if it finds the supplier has been guilty of any wrongdoing. KSL did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "More than 100,000 postmen and women will be promised a personal windfall of up to \u00a32,000 each as part of the controversial \u00a33bn privatisation of Royal Mail. Vince Cable, the business secretary, is expected to say on Wednesday that the government has decided to give Royal Mail staff 10% of the shares in the privatised company for free, almost free or on a buy-one-get-one-free basis. In a statement to the House of Commons at 1.30pm to formally kickstart the sale, Cable will say Royal Mail's 150,000 UK employees will eventually collect up to \u00a3300m worth of shares by the time the government sells all of the company. The government has already committed to granting 10% of the shares to Royal Mail staff, but has yet to state whether they would be given away for free or at a steep discount. Sources close to the government said they expected the shares would be given away for free, but stressed that a final decision had yet to be made. Cable hopes the offer of free shares will win over staff who are vehemently opposed to privatisation, expected to come in a \u00a32bn-3bn flotation on the London Stock Exchange this autumn. However, Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents more than 100,000 postal workers, said they would not \"sell their soul\" for a 10% stake. \"Nobody outside of government and their potential investors wants their postal service sold,\" he said. \"The public consistently oppose the sale and recently 96% of workers voted against.\" The union will continue to protest against the \"great British flog-off\" of Royal Mail, which dates back 497 years to the reign of Henry VIII, by taking its open-top protest bus to parliament as Cable gets to his feet. Hayes warned Cable that the union would continue to \"fight every step of the way\" and said a strike was certain. The CWU hopes the threat of sustained industrial unrest will scare off institutional investors from buying shares in the state-owned delivery service and force the collapse of the sell-off. Hayes promised on Tuesday night to meet ministers at any time to discuss other alternatives to privatisation. \"It's never too late to change direction. We are offering the government the opportunity to discuss how best to genuinely take Royal Mail forward,\" he said in a letter to the business department. \"It's time for vested interests and political opportunism to be set aside and to seize the chance to make the mail service work for customers, the company and the workforce.\" Staff will not be able to collect all of the shares at the time of the flotation, with the release staggered over several years. Workers will not end up with 10% of the equity until the state has sold all of its shareholding. Cable is expected to announce the government intends to float just over half of the company in the first instance, with the remainder to be sold in coming years. The public will also be able to buy Royal Mail shares, in a similar way to the \"Tell Sid\" campaign to encourage people to buy into the privatisation of British Gas in 1986. Royal Mail workers will have preferential access enabling them to buy even more shares.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer's chairman pleaded with investors to give the company time to turn around its fortunes on Tuesday after it reported underlying sales of clothing and non-food items fell for an eighth consecutive quarter. At the retailer's annual meeting at a suite in London's Wembley Stadium, Robert Swannell told shareholders: \"We are here to make decisions for the long term. It takes time and we want to do it right and get it right, even if there is some short-term pain.\" The board tackled questions about whether chief executive Marc Bolland deserved his \u00a32.1m pay packet, whether the company was focusing on international expansion at the cost of the UK business, and the state of the toilets in the Marble Arch flagship store. Shareholders were treated to a catwalk show of the autumn-winter collection. The company is hoping the range will turn around recent bad fortunes when it goes on sale later this month. However, before any upturn, Bolland revealed that like-for-like sales of clothes and non-food fell by 1.6%, offset by a 1.8% gain from the food side. Bolland said sales had been hit by the poor weather in April, which triggered heavy promotional activity across the sector in June as retailers attempted to catch up. \"More than a third of the market was on promotion, so the average sales price was lower as a result,\" he said. \"Market share was slightly down but we were not surprised because we have an extremely high share in tops and bottoms so, if the summer doesn't kick off, we are hit more than others.\" Total UK sales were up by 2.7%, with food growing by 4.5% and general merchandise by 0.5%. The online division M&amp;S.com pushed sales ahead by almost 30%, boosted by the introduction of free next-day delivery to stores. International sales rose by 8.7%. Bolland has been under increasing pressure to stem the decline in M&amp;S's core clothing division and is pinning his hopes on the autumn and winter ranges. He has assembled a new management team including a new head of general merchandise, John Dixon, and part-time fashion director Belinda Earl. The autumn-winter range is the first designed by his new team. Bolland admitted he was disappointed with the clothing part of the business, but pointed out that three out of four sectors \u2013 food, online and international \u2013 were successful. \"We need to reassert leadership in quality, drive aspiration, style and fashionability. We will not cut corners at M&amp;S and we will not do anything to lose the trust we have,\" he said. Shareholders raised concerns over his pay, which included a bonus of \u00a3829,000, although profits fell for the second year in a row, and asked for more focus on the UK business. Almost 4.5% of shareholders voted against Bolland's re-election to the board, while 8.6% opposed the remuneration report, which included Bolland's bonus. One shareholder said: \"Marks &amp; Spencer makes 80% of its profits in Britain, and we need to get the home market right before looking at more international expansion. Just how long do we have to wait before we see a recovery?\" Swannell replied: \"We've got our eyes incredibly and entirely focused on the UK and I agree with you that the UK is the absolute heart of our business, but we are going through the biggest logistics and IT transformation ever. These things take time. If you think taking 110 distribution centres down to three should be done in a year then you'd be wrong.\" Bolland added: \"Nine years ago, the IT systems were crap. Nine years ago, the distribution systems were crap. So we've come a long way.\" The company has recently opened superhub warehouses to replace the current crop of smaller warehouses dotted throughout the country in order to compete against rivals with its online business and click and collect services. Another shareholder wanted the board to allay fears of a possible takeover, with rumours swirling that the Qatari sovereign wealth fund has been eyeing up a possible bid for the company. He said: \"I remember when Philip Green tried to buy the company and we fought him off, but I now read that the Qataris are interested. I am fearful because they already own Harrods, the Shard and the apartments in the Olympic Park. Can the board reassure me that there will be no takeover, ever?\" Swannell refused to answer the question directly, saying: \"It is obviously a matter we take seriously\". He revealed that he helped M&amp;S fight off Green's aborted takeover in 2004. \"Let's just say, I don't think I'm right at the top of Philip Green's Christmas card list,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Empty and boarded-up shops on side roads could be converted into residential property as part of efforts to rejuvenate the UK's ailing high streets. The latest review of the Portas Pilots \u2013 a scheme led by retail guru and '\"Queen of Shops\" Mary Portas, to revive struggling retail centres \u2013 says there will be a consultation over the next six months on further relaxing planning regulations, to allow the conversion of retail space on minor thoroughfares running off high streets into residential property. Eighteen months ago, Portas completed her review into the future of the nation's high streets, aiming to tackle soaring shop vacancy rates and boost the number of small and independent retailers in town centres. The prime minister then asked the Department for Communities and Local Government to lead the response to her recommendations, including setting up 27 Portas Pilots. Last year, the government increased the permitted development for flats created above shops, allowing developers to create two flats instead of just one above shops without planning permission. The new report is exploring ways for businesses to find new premises more quickly, urging landlords to be more flexible in accommodating businesses and offering shorter leases, with the potential to increase housing on the high street. The report said: \"Together these reforms provide a substantial opportunity to bring more life into town centres and increase footfall.\" The government has also launched the Future High Streets Forum to build on the learning and experiences from the pilots. The Forum brings together leaders from retail, property, business, academics, third sector, civil society and government to better understand the competition town centres across the country face and to drive forward new ideas and policies to help the high street compete and adapt. It was also revealed that the Portas scheme to revitalise ailing high streets has failed to stop the rot \u2013 with 10 out of the 12 towns so far selected to share \u00a31.2m of taxpayers' cash seeing an increase in empty shopping outlets. The towns \u2013 Bedford, Croydon, Dartford, Liskeard, Market Rasen, Nelson, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Stockport, Stockton-on-Tees and Wolverhampton \u2013 together saw more than 95 units close. A DCLG spokeswoman said that conversions of shops into residential property \u2013 leading to more residents \u2013 could rejuvenate the high street. The report also says the government will continue to explore further ways of making the most of flats above shops. Local growth minister Mark Prisk added: \"Today's report sets out the wide range of measures we've taken to help communities breathe new life into their town centres. Since coming into government, we've lifted planning restrictions to bring empty properties back into use, cut business rates for thousands of small businesses and scrapped the unfair rules around parking charges.\" The homeless charity Shelter \u2013 which has a campaign for affordable homes \u2013 welcomed the move but stressed that any new accommodation should be a carefully planned, permanent solution, rather than a \"sticking plaster\" device to make use of redundant retail space.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a brief closing summary with links to the key points in the blog. \u2022 The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecasts, admitting that the world economy has not met its expectations since April. The IMF warned that emerging economies were hitting roadblocks, while the eurozone was being held back by its weak banks and record unemployment. See 2.30pm for details and press conference highlights. \u2022 The UK, though, was one of the few countries whose growth prospects were revised up. The Treasury said it showed Britain was healing, but critics said the recovery was too weak (see 2.36pm and 3.38pm onwards). \u2022 In the eurozone, there was relief that finance ministers had agreed to extend Greece most of its next bailout tranche last night.However, a think tank warned that the economy will shrink by more than expected this year (see 1.45pm) \u2022 Municipal workers, who face losing their jobs through Greece's bailout programme, held another strike today. Up to 3,000 employees held a protest rally in Athens (see 1.02pm onwards) \u2022 Shares rose across Europe's financial markets, fuelled by hopes for economic growth after Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer, posted decent results last night.See 5.09pm for closing prices. \u2022 In the UK, the latest economic data showed that manufacturing output fell last month. Economists said the survey raised the chances of the Bank of England announcing new stimulus measures in August (see 9.39am onwards for details and reaction) \u2022 Britain's trade gap also widened in May. But exports to non-EU states hit a new record high (see 12.10pm). I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight! Hark! I hear the sound of the European Central Bank scrambling to fix the damage caused by Jorg Asmussen's interview today. Apparently Asmussen just meant to confirm that rates would stay low for an 'extended period', and did not mean to suggest this would be more than a year. According to Reuters, though, Asmussen said: (ECB President) Mario Draghi said in his press conference it is not six months, it's not 12, it goes beyond. The perils of dabbling with forward guidance - especially in the vague way the ECB has done. The IMF's warnings of an emerging market slowdown and a deeper eurozone recession this year did not spook the financial markets. European stocks finished at their highest level in a month, as the upbeat mood that began this morning survived the day's ups and downs. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 63 points at 6513m +1% \u2022 German DAX: up 93 points at 8062, +1.2% \u2022 French CAC: up 22 points at 3846, +0.58% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 2 points at 8014, -0.03% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 9 points at 15790, - 0.06% In the bond markets,UK and German sovereign debt strengthened, but the yields on Spanisn and Italian bonds rose [prices up means yields, or borrowing costs, are down] 10-year bond yields tonight (not closing prices) \u2022 US: flat at 2.63% \u2022 UK: 2.44%, down 4 basis points (or 0.04%) \u2022 Germany: 1.65%, down 4bp \u2022 Spain: 4.71%, + 6bp \u2022 Italy: 4.42%, +4bp \u2022 Greece: 11.1%, + 15bp Here's BBC News's piece on the International Monetary Fund's new forecasts, including highlights from Olivier Blanchard's press conference, and comment from World First's Jeremy Cook: Meanwhile, the pound continues to be pummelled on the foreign exchanges, hitting a three-year low of $1.4812. This morning's weak manufacturing data (see 9.39am onwards) is being blamed, with economists expecting yet more quantitative easing from the Bank of England in August. And the euro has also fallen against the dollar, after the European Central Bank's Jorg Asmussen revealed that last week's guidance of low rates for an 'extended period' meant more than 12 months (Mario Draghi had been rather more vague). Here's Asmussen's full interview, which sent the euro as low as $1.278. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls argues that the UK government should still bring forward structural spending, as the IMF argued after its official healthcheck of the UK economy: These forecasts confirm that, after three years of flatlining, the IMF believes Britain's economic recovery will remain weak. While this year's figure has been revised up, it is disappointing that this is still a lower forecast than the IMF was making at the start of this year. And the IMF's advice to George Osborne remains unchanged. As they said just a few weeks ago, Britain is a long way from a strong and sustained recovery and so the government should bring forward infrastructure investment right now to create jobs and growth. George Osborne did pledge \u00a3100bn of infrastructure projects in last month's spending review (details)... Here's the official reaction to the IMF's new forecasts from the TUC's general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady: The IMF upgrade is welcome, if unsurprising. But raising growth forecasts from rubbish to not quite so rubbish hardly constitutes a strong recovery. The UK is still on course for the slowest recovery in over a century, and growth this year will still be well below the OBR\u2019s initial forecast of 2.9 per cent. UK economic growth is slow and limited to a few industries and areas of the country. And with wages continuing to fall in real terms, most ordinary workers are not feeling any sort of recovery at all. The case for a plan B \u2013 replacing austerity with investment in infrastructure and proper employment schemes for young people \u2013 is just as strong. No surprise that the the UK Treasury has welcomed the IMF's upgrade - three months after being furious at Olivier Blanchard for suggesting George Osborne should change course. A Treasury spokesperson said: The IMF has confirmed that the UK economy is moving from rescue to recovery, revising up its growth forecast for this year. But the IMF again warns of the continued risks to the global economy, showing that the recovery cannot be taken for granted. Bang on queue - the NIESR think tank has predicted that the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of 2013. If accurate, that would mean that growth picked up nicely after the 0.3% expansion in the January-March period. No wonder the IMF's raised its forecast... Asked about the decision to revise UK growth predictions up (2.30pm onwards), defying the general mood, the IMF argued that we shouldn't get carried away. Thomas Helbling, division chief of the World Economic Studies division, said that the change (from +0.6% to +0.9%) was pretty normal. It reflected the fact that growth in the first quarter was stronger than expected (+0.3%), and positive signs from the last three months. Heibling said: It doesn't change the big picture in the UK, that the recovery is weak... and added that policymakers should be alert to the need to do more to secure the recovery. No mention of the UK 'playing with fire', as Olivier Blanchard famously warned in April.... The IMF warned that the eurozone has struggled more than it expected three months ago, as it warned that the recession will be deeper than previously feared. It now expects GDP to fall by 0.6% across the eurozone this year, down from 0.4% before. It is particularly worried about Italy, predicting a 1.8% contraction this year (down from 1.5%). And the recovery in 2014 will be a ilttle feebler, it says, with GDP rising by just 0.9%, not 1%. The IMF said the eurozone suffered from: low demand, depressed confidence, and weak balance sheets [which] interacted to exacerbate the effects on growth and the impact of tight fiscal and financial conditions. The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook is online here. Japan, along with the UK (see 2.36pm), is one of the few countries to be upgraded by the IMF this afternoon -- growth of 2% is now expected this year, up from 1.5%. Olivier Blanchard said there had been a clear increase in confidence since the launch of the Abenomics stimulus package earlier this year. But the IMF remains cautious, citing several dangers to Japan. They include the risk that bond investors will worry about debt sustainability (Japan's ability to repay its debts). If they demand higher rates, that would put Abenomics in trouble, he added. The iMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, has warned that emerging markets face cyclical and structural problems. Speaking at a press conference now (live here), Blanchard said that the IMF saw slightly slower growth across most economies, compared to April. This is particularly clear in the BRIC economics (Brazil, Russia, India and China), he warned: After years of strong growth, the Brics are beginning to run into speedbumps. For example, the IMF expects China to grow by 7.75% this year and next year, which is 0.25% (for 2013) and 0.5% (2014) less than before. However, the IMF has raised its forecast for UK growth. It now expects GDP to increase by 0.9% this year, up from 0.6% back in April (when it actually cut the forecast from 0.9%). My colleague Phillip Inman explains: Britain will grow faster this year than previously expected according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in the first major upgrade of the UK\u2019s economic outlook for almost three years. The economy will expand by 0.9% compared with the previous forecast of 0.6%, the IMF said in its quarterly global financial health check. But a lacklustre performance by developing countries, a prolonged eurozone recession and US spending cuts will hamper plans to increase exports and restrict Britain\u2019s GDP growth in 2014 to 1.5%, it added. George Osborne will be cheered by the more upbeat outlook after suffering two years of brickbats from the IMF, which has lectured the government on taking a more expansionary stance and delaying public spending cuts. Yet growth of 1.5% next year could still be too weak to improve employment or spark a revival in manufacturing investment, which the chancellor believes is necessary for a more sustainable recovery. Here's Phillip's full story. Breaking: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global economic growth this year. In its World Economic Outlook Update, the IMF predicted growth of around 3.1% this year, down from 3.3% back in April. it also cut next year's growth forecast to 3.8%, down from 4%. It said the downgrade was largely due to: appreciably weaker domestic demand and slower growth in several key emerging market economies, as well as by a more protracted recession in the euro area. More details and reaction to follow.... Nearly time for the IMF: One for history lovers: Bryan, who ran for the US presidency several times without sucess, was a leading critic of the Gold Standard back in the day when most of the world's currencies were pegged to each other. He argued that it was wrong that credit availability and interest rate levels were influenced by the amount of gold in the system - and wanted the system expanded to include silver. In the famous speech of 9th July 1896, Bryan declared: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold. Despite the support of America's farming community (heavily dependent on loans to keep running), Bryan never succeeded in changing the monetary system of the day. He looked rather prescient forty years later (as Lords of Finance explains) A reminder that the International Monetary Fund will release its updated World Economic Outlook at 2.30pm BST. There'll be a press conference, which should be streamed live here. A Greek thinktank has punctured any euphoria over last night's loan deal, by warning that the country's economy will shrink by even more than expected this year. The Athens-based IOBE think tank predicted that Greece's GDP could shrink by as much as 5%, from a previous forecast of around 4.6%. That's a rather deeper forecast than Greece's lenders expect (officially, anyway): Reuters has more details: \"The projection on growth must be adjusted downwards - the recession this year will be around 5.0 percent,\" IOBE said in its quarterly report. It said it would range between a decline of 4.8 and 5 percent, compared with its previous forecast of a 4.6 percent slump. The EU and IMF expect the economy to shrink by 4.2 percent in 2013; the Bank of Greece projects a contraction of 4.6 percent. The economy shrank 6.4 percent last year. \"Fiscal consolidation and improved competitiveness have not been coupled with successful implementation of the structural reforms programme,\" the locally influential think tank said. IOBE projected the country's unemployment rate will rise to 27.8 percent this year, raising its previous 27.3 percent projection. Unemployment was 26.8 percent at the last count. \"As long as the recession persists, the economy isn't only burning fat but also productive tissue,\" said Nikos Vettas, the new head of IOBE. Just in - new photos from Athens of the protest rally held today by up to 3,000 municipal employees who oppose plans to lay off thousands of workers as part of the Greek bailout (see also 1.02pm): Up to 3,000 striking municipal workers have marched through the streets of central Athens to voice their anger over the planned cuts in civil service numbers, according to Associated Press reporters. As explained at 9.00am, their union has called a two-day strike which began yesterday. They oppose being added to the \u201cmobility and reallocation scheme\u201d, from where they can be sacked if they don't accept a new job. The Greek Administration and E-Governance Ministry has said that 4,200 civil servants will be added to the pool this month, rising to 12,500 by the end of September. More than 8,000 municipal police will also be included. The Athens government is committed to dismissing 15,000 civil servante by the end of 2014, including 4,000 this year, so entering the pool could easily lead to the sack. My colleague Katie Allen has analysed today's UK trade data (9.39am onwards), and found some positive news for UK business secretary Vince Cable and the business groups that have been pushing sales to new markets for fear of being too dependent on a troubled eurozone. ONS data shows goods exports to non-EU countries have hit a record high. In the three months to May, exports of goods to non-EU countries rose \u00a31.7bn (4.6%) to \u00a339.0 billion. That outstripped growth in goods exports to the EU, which were up by \u00a30.3bn (0.8%) to \u00a337.4bn. The ONS adds more details: Outside the EU, the level of exports to China continues to grow. In the latest three months the value of exports was 17% higher than the average 2012 quarterly level. Import values from China were little changed, so the trade deficit with China, which had averaged \u00a35.2 billion a quarter in 2012 shrank to \u00a34.8 billion in the latest three months. Historically, the UK runs a trade in goods surplus with the United States. That rose in the latest three months. The value of exports was 5% higher than its average 2012 level, while imports fell by 8%. And here's Katie's full story on today's trade figures and industrial output data: UK manufacturing suffers surprise output fall after string of upbeat survey Latvia has finally been given full approval to join the eurozone. EU finance ministers gave their agreement at today's ECOFIN meeting, stating: Euro notes and coins will be issued in Latvia on 1 January 2014. Riga will join at a rate of 0.702804 lats to the euro. Over in Portugal, the head of the junior coalition partner has declared that the country is ready to return to political stabilty - a week after his resignation destabilised the government. After a meeting with the country's president, CDS-PP party leader Paulo Portas told reporters that: We think the conditions for stability are in place and that political stability is important not only for the government but also for the conclusion of the aid package. Portas was promoted to deputy prime minister last weekend, after resigning as foreign minister last Tuesday. That cabinet reshuffle has calmed the panic over Portugal's bailout -- although its sovereign debt is still changing hands at lower prices than before Portas quit. Portuguese 10-year bonds are trading at a yield of 6.9% this morning (Tradeweb data). The slump in Spain's housing market continues, according to data released today by the real estate firm Tinsa. Tinsa reported that prices fell by 10.6% year-on-year in June, which means the average property has lost around 40% of its value since the financial crisis began. As this graph shows, property prices were rising by around 15% per year during the boom days, but have been shrinking ever since. Marks &amp; Spencer is the worst performer on the FTSE 100, falling almost 2% this morning after reporting another quarter of falling clothes sales. That won't protect CEO Marc Bolland from criticism from the hordes of small shareholders at today's annual general meeting. Here's the full story: M&amp;S clothing and non-food sales fall for eighth consecutive quarter. The word from Wembley Stadium is that the small investors are not in particularly good spirits: The other key corporate story of the day was the appointment of Ben van Beurden as new chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell. That's not caused any ructions, with Shell's shares up 1% - in line with the market. And here's a comment on the markets from Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG: The warm weather may be helping to energise equity markets, with the FTSE 100 powering through the 6500 level led by its key components, miners and banks. With US aluminium producer Alcoa providing a strong start to the US earnings season by beating forecasts, and the misfortunes of Greece seemingly appeased, risk appetite is back with a vengeance. UK manufacturing production continues to be something of a fly in the ointment for the overall economic outlook, falling by 0.8% in May against the 0.3% increase expected. While most UK economic data has been fairly good of late, this adds up to an annualised fall of 2.9% in total and thus may give credence to the recent forward guidance from the Bank of England in respect of the perpetuation of a loose monetary policy. Greece's debt agency just rolled over \u20ac1.625bn of six-month bonds, showing that it still has access to the short-term money markets. The T-bills were sold at average yield of 4.2%, with the agency receiving bids for 1.7 times as much debt as was on offer. That's an identical result to a similar auction in June. City analysts say this morning's disappointing UK economic data (9.39am onwards) suggest that growth may not have been as strong last quarter as hoped. This could increase the chances of the Bank of England increasing its bond-buying programme next month. Here's some instant reaction (partly culled from the Reuters terminal) Philip Shaw of Investec: Trade figures are as expected, no great surprises. The tone of the data suggests to us that we are still likely to get more QE from the Monetary Policy Committee next month. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank: On trade ... I think it broadly confirms the continuing picture for the UK, which is that this is not an export-led recovery we are starting to see. This is a monetary policy, low rate, rising consumption, rising house prices-driven recovery, so I don't expect the trade balance to improve very much. Tom Vosa of National Australia Bank: The mix seems to be that disappointingly, we're not seeing the rebalancing of the economy that we would like... But the trade data still points to a relatively robust Q2, although perhaps not as high as 0.6% on the quarter which the survey data had been pointing to. Sterling took a small tumble when this morning's weak UK economic data hit the wires a few minutes ago. The pound is down over half a cent against the US dollar, at $1.489. Against the euro, it's close to a four-month low at \u20ac1.155. ..and this graph shows how Britain has made little, if any, impact on its trade gap over the last year, leading to today's deficit of \u00a32.435bn. Britain's industrial output stalled in May, dashing hopes of a 0.2% rise, as the sector appeared to stumble. The Office for National Statistics reported that manufacturing output was down by 0.8% in May, or 2.9% lower on a year-on-year basis. That left output across the wider industrial sector unchanged month-on-month, or down 2.3% on an annual basis. In another downbeat news, Britain's trade gap widened in May to its biggest deficit in six months. The Office for National Statistics reported that Britain's defict in goods rose to \u00a38.491bn, up from \u00a38.43bn in April. Even when services was added, the overall trade gap was \u00a32.435bn, up from \u00a32.073bn in April. German chancellor Angela Merkel should be pleased that the mini-saga of Greek bailout loan tranche was concluded last night, ahead of Germany's general elections this autumn. A raft of opinion polls have shown that Merkel's CDU/CSU party holds a healthy lead, with around 42% of the vote. With her junior partners, the right-wing Free Democrats, close to the 5% threshold for winning seats, there's a decent chance that the existing coalition will retain power. As the Wall Street Journal explains: Ms. Merkel's CDU/CSU group appears to be strengthening. The FDP is just short of 5% in some surveys. But its results in recent regional elections have been better than opinion polls predicted. \"The FDP has few core supporters and many of its voters decide late,\" says Manfred G\u00fcllner, head of Berlin polling institute Forsa. A center-right win would please German business, which fears a stronger left-wing influence in government could lead to higher taxes. But it would disappoint many other countries in the euro zone, including France, where some officials hope a grand coalition with the SPD might push Ms. Merkel toward slightly more generous and growth-friendly policies on the European debt crisis. More here: Merkel Gains Ground as Election Nears Greek municipal employees are continuing a two-day strike, in protest at the plans to lay off thousands of public sector workers. The walkout will hit municipal offices and operations across the country, although social welfare services should continue (according to the informative Living in Greece) Even though the Athens government has agreed to cut the state workforce, unions representing municipal staff have organised a march starting anytime now (11am local time, or 9am BST) In a statement (here in Greek) the POE-OTA says that 'mass, unified' protests are the only way to prevent ordinary workers being impoverished through the bailout programme. As crisis-watcher Yiannis Mouzakis points out, municipal workers are often at the lower end of the pay scale: Back to Greece, where the Kathimerini newspaper flags up that legislation will soon be tabled on the Athens parliament to push through the 'corrective actions' demanded by the Troika. A vote on the measures (which sparked angry protests yesterday) is expected next week. Kathimerini writes: A multi-bill bundling together all the prior actions that Athens must honor in order to receive the pledged funding \u2013 including an overhaul of the tax system and cutbacks in the civil service \u2013 is expected to be tabled in Parliament on Tuesday or Wednesday. The bill will be put to a debate with a vote expected next week. The most controversial aspect of the legislation is a pledge by Greece to put 12,500 civil servants into a so-called mobility scheme in the coming weeks, where they would receive lower wages ahead of a status review, as well as 15,000 layoffs by the end of next year. In last night's statement (online here) the Eurogroup insisted last night that these 'prior actions' are taken swiftly in return for Greece receiving its aid loans. Optimism abounds in the stock markets this morning, with shares up across Europe after Greece secured its aid tranche last night. Traders are also cheered by upbeat forecasts from alumunium producer Alcoa (details). By sticking to its demand forecast, Alcoa calmed fears that China's economy is caught in a rapid slowdown. And in the UK, economic surveys released overnight have shown that retail sales rose in June, while house-buying inquiries also picked up. Further signs that the British economy may be returning to health. \u2022 FTSE: up 60 points at 6510, + 0.9% \u2022 German DAX: up 57 points at 8026, +0.7% \u2022 French CAC: up 19 points at 3843, + 0.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 61 points at 8081, +0.8% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 112 points at 15912, + 0.7% Here's what's coming up: \u2022 EU finance ministers meet at ECOFIN: all day \u2022 UK industrial production for May: 9.30am BST \u2022 UK trade balance for May: 9.30am BST \u2022 IMF: World Economic Outlook update: 2.30pm BST Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets, and the global economy. So, after all the talks and tension, Greece will receive its next bailout loans - in return for making further cuts to its public sector workforce. Eurozone ministers last night agreed to extend \u20ac2.5bn of loans to Athens this month, with a further \u20ac500m arriving in October if various corrective actions (ie: civil service layoffs) are taken. As our Europe editor Ian Traynor wrote last night from Brussels: Under Monday's agreement, Athens has to get to grips with a painful programme of public sector job losses mainly affecting education. Some 6,500 teachers or education ministry staff are either to be fired or put on a \"reserve\" and sacked at the end of next year if no alternative work has been found. This makes up more than half of the 12,500 public sector jobs on the line, which also include 3,500 police posts. Police officers anxious for their jobs staged protests in Athens at the weekend With the International Monetary Fund expected to provide a further \u20ac1.8bn of loans, last night's decision removes a nagging worry as Europe's politicians prepare to wind down for the summer break. The move should please the financial markets, and give European finance ministers a sprint in their step as they gather for an ECOFIN meeting today. But their problems are not over, as the IMF has been swift to warn in its new annual assessment of the euro area. Pointing to the eurozone's weak growth and record unemployment, the IMF urged \"concerted policy actions\" to end the malaise. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde warned bluntly that the economic crisis in Europe had not been resolved, saying: Over the past year, substantial actions at both the national and euro-wide levels have been taken to combat the crisis,\" But despite this progress, the economic recovery remains elusive, unemployment is rising, and uncertainty is high. Additional policy measures are required to fully restore confidence, revive growth, and create jobs. The IMF said growth was beng hampered by \"centrifugal forces across the euro area\" - including weak banks, record jobless, and limited credit in part of the region. Here's the full report. The IMF's four-point plan for the eurozone contained familiar themes: \u2022 a 'credible' assessment of how much capital needs to be pumped into Europe's struggling banks (and then action to fix the problems) \u2022 completing banking union (including introducing a single resolution mechanism for failed banks) \u2022 new measures to stimulare economic demand (with a nod of approval to Mario Draghi for last week's promise to keep interest rates low). \u2022 and finally structural reforms (always an IMF favourite). But with Europe soon to wind down until September, it's not clear that the warning will be heeded soon. The IMF will be in the news this afternoon too, when it releases its latest World Economic Outlook report (at 2.30pm BST). That will include its latest economic forecasts for countries across the world, and the global economy. I'll be tracking the IMF report, reaction to last night's eurogroup meeting, and other news in the eurozone and beyond through the day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Energy firm E.ON has been ordered to pay a \u00a33m financial settlement, including a payment of \u00a32.5m to households hit by fuel poverty, after energy efficient lightbulbs that were supposed to have been given away free in the UK under a government initiative were found for sale in Ireland. Industry regulator Ofgem said the punishment, which includes a fine of \u00a3500,000, allowed hard-pressed consumers to benefit rather than see the full \u00a33m penalty disappearing into Treasury coffers. Industry regulator Ofgem said the package reflected the \"serious\" nature of the offence, which was a breach of the company's reporting obligations under the government's carbon emissions reduction target (Cert) programme. Under Cert legislation the big six energy companies had to introduce measures to reduce carbon emissions in British homes. As part of this, suppliers were able to distribute free energy saving light bulbs to British households. But an Ofgem investigation found that German-owned E.ON had not properly distributed 3.4m of the 25m light bulbs it had handed out over a five-year period. The figure included some light bulbs that went on sale in stores in the Republic of Ireland rather than being distributed for free in Britain, as well as others for which E.ON could not provide appropriate evidence that they had been distributed. The total amount reported inaccurately was equivalent to 1% of E.ON's Cert obligations. E.ON must pay \u00a32.5m to 18,500 customers in, or at risk of, fuel poverty to help with their 2013/14 winter bills, equivalent to \u00a3135 a household. The remaining \u00a3500,000 will be paid as a fine, which would have been much higher had the company not co-operated fully, Ofgem said. In May Ofgem announced an investigation into six energy firms that missed their targets after failing to deliver enough energy efficiency measures to UK households. Energy companies achieved 99% of government energy efficiency targets by the December 2012 deadline, with EDF energy, Eggborough power, E.ON and RWE npower achieving all of their energy efficiency targets. Despite achieving its overall target, E.ON faced the sanction for its reporting failure. Sarah Harrison, Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement, said: \"This case leaves companies in no doubt that Ofgem takes reporting failures seriously. Accurate company reporting is essential to Ofgem's effective administration of the government's environmental schemes.\" E.ON's error was due to its failure to have in place adequate management systems to ensure accurate reporting of the distributed light bulbs. It took action to ensure it met its overall Cert obligations by installing extra energy-saving measures to make up for the carbon savings shortfall associated with the light bulbs it wrongly claimed to have distributed. Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON UK, said: \"We are sorry that these mistakes were made in 2010 and Ofgem has received a board-level assurance that the necessary changes have been made. \"Our controls should have been stronger and our processes more robust. It was important to us that, as part of putting this right, customers in fuel poverty or groups at risk of fuel poverty should receive a portion of the penalty in the form of the additional payments we are making.\" He added: \"No consumers were misled because of this mistake but this does not take away from the fact it was an error that should not have been made.\"",
