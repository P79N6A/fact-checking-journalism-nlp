      "bodyText": "Barclays is braced for a stormy annual shareholder meeting on Thursday with protesters pledging to question its role in tax havens, funding of coal mines and the \u00a39bn of bonuses paid out to its investment bankers since the financial crisis. Amid warnings from the business secretary, Vince Cable, that major companies need to do more to improve their public image over pay deals, Barclays is expected to face scrutiny from shareholders over its decision to increase bonuses by 10% to \u00a32.4bn in 2013 even though its profits fell by 32%. Figures compiled by the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which wants a tax on financial institutions, showed that Barclays had paid out \u00a39bn in bonuses to investment bankers since 2009. David Hillman, spokesman for the campaign, said: \"It is stomach-churning to think that in the five scandal-ridden years since the crisis Barclays has doled out such grotesque levels of pay to their privileged few.\" Tom Fyans, head of campaigns for ActionAid, said: \"The winners at this year's AGM are likely to be Barclays' hugely expensive fleet of investment bankers who plan to award themselves millions of pounds in bonuses. But the losers will be people in some of the world's poorest countries.\" Barclays is disputing ActionAid's assertions that it promotes the use of tax havens. The bank faces three votes on pay: one on its remuneration report which covers last year's \u00a32.4bn payments, one on its pay policies for the coming three years, and a third to comply with the EU's cap on bonuses \u2013 which forces banks to get shareholder approval to pay a bonus worth more than a single multiple of salary. With approval the bonus can be double. Barclays is the first UK bank to test investors' appetite for such payouts at its annual meeting, but it will be followed by all its rivals, including Royal Bank of Scotland which is expected to set out how it will tackle the bonus cap. Last year just 6% of investors failed to back the remuneration report at Barclays after the new top team that was brought in after the Libor-rigging scandal pledged to cut back on bonuses. This year the vote on the remuneration report is thought to be the most contentious. Sir David Walker, the chairman, who is expected to leave next year, had pledged to crack down on pay. But for 2013 he and the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, have been criticised for increasing bonuses again, a move Jenkins claimed was necessary to avoid a \"death spiral\" that would be caused by its bankers defecting to rivals. Barclays has already announced that the board director who chairs the remuneration committee, Sir John Sutherland, is being replaced by City veteran Crawford Gillies from next month. Some investors had threatened to protest against Sutherland continuing in the role. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum questioned why he was leading the search for a successor to Walker, who was parachuted in as chairman in the wake of the Libor scandal. Cable singled out Barclays when he told the BBC this week that trust in companies had been lost because of high pay deals. \"This is an opportunity for these companies to make peace with the public,\" said Cable, who has written to the chairs of remuneration committees to urge them to rein in pay. His calls came as the body that oversees corporate governance codes began consulting on ways to encourage remuneration committees to put more emphasis on linking pay to performance. The Financial Reporting Council also asked for views on companies being able to recover or withhold bonuses from top directors and to explain when publishing the votes at annual meetings how they intend to head off any rebellions in the future. Stephen Haddrill, head of the FRC, said: \"These proposals, which reflect the views of investors and others on earlier consultations, are intended to encourage boards to focus on the longer term, and increase their accountability to shareholders.\"",

    "webTitle": "Optimism in Britain's factories at four-decade high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The mood in Britain's factories is at its most upbeat in more than 40 years, a survey by the CBI shows, in what could prove to be an important pre-election boost for the government. A combination of strong growth in orders both at home and abroad is driving a rapid rise in confidence among manufacturers, according to the business lobby group. The CBI said 41% of manufacturers surveyed were more optimistic about business than three months ago, with just 8% less optimistic. That gave a balance of +33 points \u2013 the highest since April 1973. Rising optimism in the sector, which accounts for about 10% of the economy, is feeding through to plans for increased investment over the next 12 months, boosting hopes that the recovery will become more balanced, with a lesser reliance on consumer spending. The chancellor welcomed the good news and said it was a reason why the government needed to \"go on working through our economic plan\". Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said momentum in the sector was building. \"Confidence is rapidly rising among British manufacturers, with a real sense of business optimism,\" she said. \"Our industrial base is seizing a bigger role in the UK's economic recovery, with output, orders and hiring all on the up. Manufacturers plan to significantly ramp up investment in the year ahead.\" Strength in the sector was highlighted by the latest car manufacturing figures, which showed that UK production jumped 12% in March compared with a year earlier, to 142,158 vehicles. The car industry has been held up by the government as a poster child for British manufacturing and exports, amid hopes that the economy can be weaned off its heavy reliance on debt-fuelled consumer spending and the financial services industry for growth. Almost 80% of the cars made in Britain in March were built for export, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which produced the figures. The trade body said the rise in car manufacturing in March was helped by new models rolling off the production line at Nissan's factory in Sunderland and at the Mini plant in Oxford, among others. Britain's economy grew consistently throughout 2013 and first quarter growth in 2014 is expected to exceed the 0.7% increase in GDP achieved in the final three months of last year. The first official estimate will be published by the Office for National Statistics next week. Minutes of the April meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, published on Wednesday, showed members believe the economy grew by about 1% between January and March. The MPC said the UK's recovery was building momentum and becoming more balanced, with positive signs on investment. As the economy recovers, households should finally be able to look forward to a prolonged period of real wage rises, members concluded. Pay including bonuses rose by 1.7% over the three months to February, just ahead of the March inflation rate of 1.6%.\"Nominal wage growth had picked up a little in recent months and it was possible that a sustainable rise in real wages and incomes, consistent with a durable recovery in demand and output, was in prospect.\" The MPC voted unanimously to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5% and quantitative easing unchanged at \u00a3375bn, having stressed in recent months that it is in no rush to raise rates. There was further good news from the retail world, with the number of \"full-time equivalent\" jobs created in the sector up 1.8% over the first quarter, compared with a year earlier. The rise, reported by the British Retail Consortium, echoes improvements in the wider jobs market over recent months. A separate report by accountants EY and commissioned by the UK Onshore Operators Group estimated that the development of shale gas in the UK could create a \u00a333bn investment opportunity for British businesses, with the potential for the creation of more than 64,000 jobs. The strengthening recovery was also reflected in the latest government borrowing figures, which showed the chancellor defied expectations by meeting his 2013-14 target as a result of rising tax receipts. Borrowing fell \u00a37.5bn to \u00a3107.7bn, just below an official target of \u00a3107.8bn outlined in last month's budget by the Office for Budget Responsibility. George Osborne was helped by a surge in stamp duty receipts, reflecting the recent strength of the UK housing market, as well as rises in income tax and VAT receipts. The figures added further weight to the chancellor's long-held argument that cutting the deficit is central to building a long-term sustainable economic future for Britain. A spokesman for the Treasury said the figures were \"evidence that the government's long term economic plan is working, delivering economic security for hard-working people\". Full-year borrowing as a percentage of gross domestic product fell from 7.4% in 2012-13 to 6.6%, which was the lowest since 2007-08 according to the figures from the ONS. But Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, stressed that Osborne had missed his original targets. \"A deficit this year of \u00a3107.7bn compared to the chancellor's claim in 2010 that it would be just \u00a360bn is the cost of the three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Mail privatisation will be the subject of fresh scrutiny by MPs next week when bankers from Goldman Sachs and UBS \u2013 which handled the sell-off of the 500-year-old institution \u2013 are summoned to give evidence to a high-profile parliamentary committee. The public accounts committee, chaired by Margaret Hodge, who has previously conducted tough evidence sessions on corporate tax, will also hear from top City regulators and senior executives at Royal Mail at sessions next week. Her committee, which convened the Royal Mail hearings in the wake of the National Audit Office's damning verdict on the privatisation, is expected to scrutinise how 16 City firms were allowed priority access to the shares. The shares were sold at 330p on 11 October, when they jumped 38% immediately, sparking a furore about whether a prime state-owned asset had been sold off on the cheap. The shares closed last night at 532p, still well above the initial offering price but off highs of more than 600p. On Monday 28 April, Martin Wheatley, the boss of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 which is under fire for the way it announced a review of the savings industry last month \u2013 and his senior official William Amos, who is responsible for the fund management industry, are to face questioning. On 30 April, James Robertson from UBS and Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs, the two firms involved in conducting the sell-off, will give evidence alongside representatives from Lazard, the investment bank which acted as adviser to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and was paid \u00a31.5m for doing so. William Rucker, the chief executive of Lazard in the UK, will appear alongside one of the firm's fund managers, Alan Custis. Martin Donnelly, the most senior civil servant in BIS, is scheduled to give evidence the same day, as will Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Shareholder Executive, which looks after government stakes in businesses. The public accounts committee will hold its sessions in addition to those being held by the business committee which has recalled Vince Cable, the business secretary, and his minister Michael Fallon. Their appearances are scheduled for Tuesday. When he recalled Cable this month, Adrian Bailey, the Labour MP who chairs the business committee, called for the business secretary to resign after the publication of the National Audit Office report. The report found that the government had cost taxpayers \u00a3750m in a single day by undervaluing the postal service, which previous governments had slated for privatisation but did not carry out. Cable has defended the sell-off, insisting that fund managers would not pay more for the stock while Hodge has previously said that his department made a mistake \"by incentivising its private advisers to sell the shares on time at the expense of price\". The audit office found that Lazard was paid on the basis of completing the sell-off, not on achieving the highest price possible. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 April 2014.

    "webTitle": "Greece and Portugal boost eurozone", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's recovery from its debt crisis took two significant steps forward on Wednesday as Greece posted a primary budget surplus and Portugal made a successful return to the bond markets for the first time in three years. The European commission paved the way for Greece to begin debt relief talks with its creditors by announcing that the country had been left with a surplus of about \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) last year, or 0.8% of national output,once its hefty debt payments and the cost of recapitalising its banks had been stripped out. The EU's executive arm said Greece's finances were ahead of the targets agreed with its lenders, describing it as a \"reflection of the remarkable progress that Greece has made in repairing its public finances since 2010\". The commission, a member of the troika that bailed out Greece, alongside the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, with packages worth more than \u20ac200bn, said it believed the country's debts were sustainable. Greek ministers said the long years of sacrifices since accepting a bailout in 2010 were paying off. \"After these years that were very tough on households and businesses, the country and its economy are in a definitely better position,\" said the deputy finance minister, Christos Staikouras. The primary surplus means that, technically, Greek government revenues now exceed expenditure. However, it was only reached by ignoring the interest payments on Greece's borrowings, the cost of recapitalising its banks, and other one-off measures. Greece's total national debt actually rose to 175% of national output in 2013, up from 157% of GDP the previous year. Much is held by other eurozone governments, which must decide whether to help Athens by cutting the interest rates on its bonds or extending the maturities on those debts. Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said Greece would start pushing hard for debt relief, which could be tied to a future financial programme once the current bailout expires at the end of 2014. \"As long as the new reform programme comes with tough conditions, some minimal debt relief will likely be forthcoming,\" he predicted. Portugal's hopes of avoiding a second bailout were bolstered when investors showed solid interest in its first debt sale since 2011. It sold \u20ac750m of 10-year bonds at an interest rate of 3.5752%, the lowest in eight years, in an auction that was more than three times oversubscribed. The sale boosted hopes that Lisbon can follow Ireland and make a clean return to the financial markets when its \u20ac78bn bailout ends this year. The Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, added to optimism in the eurozone by predicting that Spain's economy would grow faster than forecast. He forecast GDP would rise by around 1.5% in 2014, up from a previous estimate of 1%, with higher tax revenues meaning Spain would need to borrow less this year. But France's government raised its own borrowing forecasts, predicting a deficit of 3.8% of GDP this year, up from the previous forecast of 3.6%. This is expected to fall to 3% in 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 2.8%, barely hitting the deficit reduction targets agreed with Brussels. The latest survey of Europe's manufacturing sector, from Markit, showed that France's private companies continued to lag behind their German rivals. Activity in the French service sector has barely increased this month, while factory managers also reported a slowdown. Firms continued to cut jobs, and appear jittery over France's recovery. \"Until we see a decisive shift in confidence, the business climate looks set to remain frail,\" warned Markit's Jack Kennedy. Activity in Germany's private sector has risen this month, though, with output, new business growth and employment levels all up as firms respond to stronger domestic and overseas demand.",

      "body": "<p>Europe's recovery from its debt crisis took two significant steps forward on Wednesday as Greece posted a primary budget surplus and Portugal made a successful return to the bond markets for the first time in three years.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/apr/23/chinese-factory-output-pmi-public-finances-greece-live\" title=\"\">The European commission paved the way for Greece to begin debt relief talks with its creditors</a> by announcing that the country had been left with a surplus of about \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) last year, or 0.8% of national output,once its hefty debt payments and the cost of recapitalising its banks had been stripped out.</p> <p>The EU's executive arm said Greece's finances were ahead of the targets agreed with its lenders, describing it as a \"reflection of the remarkable progress that Greece has made in repairing its public finances since 2010\".</p> <p>The commission, a member of the troika that bailed out Greece, alongside the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, with packages worth more than \u20ac200bn, said it believed the country's debts were sustainable.</p> <p>Greek ministers said the long years of sacrifices since accepting a bailout in 2010 were paying off. \"After these years that were very tough on households and businesses, the country and its economy are in a definitely better position,\" said the deputy finance minister, Christos Staikouras.</p> <p>The primary surplus means that, technically, Greek government revenues now exceed expenditure. However, it was only reached by ignoring the interest payments on Greece's borrowings, the cost of recapitalising its banks, and other one-off measures.</p> <p>Greece's total national debt actually rose to 175% of national output in 2013, up from 157% of GDP the previous year. Much is held by other eurozone governments, which must decide whether to help Athens by cutting the interest rates on its bonds or extending the maturities on those debts.</p> <p>Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said Greece would start pushing hard for debt relief, which could be tied to a future financial programme once the current bailout expires at the end of 2014.</p> <p>\"As long as the new reform programme comes with tough conditions, some minimal debt relief will likely be forthcoming,\" he predicted.</p> <p>Portugal's hopes of avoiding a second bailout were bolstered when investors showed solid interest in its first debt sale since 2011. It sold \u20ac750m of 10-year bonds at an interest rate of 3.5752%, the lowest in eight years, in an auction that was more than three times oversubscribed.</p> <p>The sale boosted hopes that Lisbon can follow Ireland and make a clean return to the financial markets when its \u20ac78bn bailout ends this year.</p> <p>The Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, added to optimism in the eurozone by <a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/world/a/22882383/spain-forecasts-stronger-economic-outlook-in-2014-15/\" title=\"\">predicting that Spain's economy would grow faster than forecast</a>.

      "bodyText": "Primark, the fashion store that brought the \u00a33 jumper dress to the British shopper, is to open in the US as it attempts to become a global chain. The budget retailer, owned by Associated British Foods, will open its first store in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2015 and said it was in negotiations to open up to eight further stores in north-east America, with warehousing to support them. America has proved to be a leap too far for most UK retailers: Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith, Sainsbury's and, most recently, Tesco have all seen their stateside ventures founder. However, fashion chains Topshop and Ted Baker have found favour with US shoppers. Primark said it had decided to take its concept to the US after extensive research. Primark has defied the recession to become one of the fastest-growing retail businesses in western Europe. It has more than 270 stores in nine countries, including Spain, Portugal, Germany and the Netherlands. In the past year it has opened over 1m sq ft of new retail space as it took its brand of cut-price fashion to France with stores in Marseille and Dijon. \"We think we have as differentiated and attractive a proposition in the US as we have in continental Europe and the British Isles. We think we have something special to offer,\" said George Weston, ABF chief executive. The 70,000sq ft Boston store \u2013 as big as an out-of-town UK superstore \u2013 will open at the end of next year. In the year ahead, Weston said, Primark expected to open about another 1m sq ft of space across Europe and the UK. It wants to open stores in York, Milton Keynes, Bath and Canterbury and also plans a big expansion of its Birmingham outlet. Weston said Primark had been encouraged to go to the US by its experience in different markets in Europe, and heading over the Atlantic looked more attractive than the Far East or eastern Europe. \"It seemed a better option than anywhere else,\" he said. The US venture is an ambitious new chapter for the retailer, which began life in 1969 as a single shop in Dublin under the name Penneys \u2013 the name it still trades under in Ireland. Primark's latest results show no sign of growth slipping: profits jumped by more than a quarter to \u00a3298m in the six months to the start of March, while the company rang through sales worth \u00a32.3bn \u2013 up 14% up on last year. But Primark's success in feeding shoppers' appetite for throwaway fashion has come under increasing scrutiny since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, which claimed the lives of 1,133 garment workers and left more than 2,500 injured. The Primark label was among 28 western brands found in the rubble, as well as the UK's Bonmarch\u00e9, Canada's Loblaw and Spain's Mango. Primark has paid more than any other retailer into a UN-backed compensation scheme, but on the first anniversary of the disaster this week the fund has raised only $15m (\u00a39m), well short of its $40m target. Anna McMullen of the Labour Behind the Label campaign said Primark had been engaged in the compensation process, but needed to rethink its business model. \"They are driving a fast fashion agenda that has a negative effect on workers' rights around the world. The way that they and a lot of their main competitors are driving down prices to seek ever cheaper places and ever lower wages \u2026 to make the price of their product cheaper has had a really negative effect on the whole industry.\" \"Now they are entering the US market I can imagine that is only going to exacerbate the problem. It is all well and good to be involved in clearing up the mess, but it is as important to be a retailer that tries to drive change as well through normal business practice.\" Weston said Primark had now carried out structural surveys on factories it used in Bangladesh and had a team in the country to monitor conditions for workers producing its clothes. He said: \"Fire risk remains an issue everywhere, so does the payment of overtime and bullying of staff,\" however, he said: \"We have learned plenty of lessons after Rana Plaza, I hope the rest of the industry has too.\" Shares in ABF were up almost 9% to \u00a329.63 on Wednesday as investors eyed up entry into the huge US market, as well as the profits bonanza. Maureen Hinton, retail analyst at Conlumino, said Primark was highly likely to succeed in America. \"Young fashion is global now. The US tended to be quite conservative in fashion. I think that has changed because of the global access in fashion and entertainment.\" \"The main point about Primark is its price positioning. It is not going in as just another young fashion brand. It is going in as a young fashion brand with a very defined price edge on competitors that sets it apart. But it has all the trappings of the big stores and the feel of a more expensive fashion brand. I am sure that the likes of [US rival] Forever 21 are a bit worried.\" She also pointed out that Primark had not exhuasted its prospects for expansion in Europe. \"Primark has got potential to become a global fashion brand. It is at the early stages, if you compare it to the likes of Inditex and H&amp;M, but there is potential.\" It is also likely that Primark harbours ambitions beyond the US: \"I am sure China is probably on their list,\" Hinton said. Stateside struggles Tesco The UK's biggest supermarket opened on the west coast with great fanfare in 2007. It was forced to beat a retreat five years later after running up more than \u00a31.5bn in losses and investment costs. M&amp;S Offloaded US grocer King's in 2006 to focus on its ailing British business. That was the second retreat for M&amp;S, which lost two-thirds of its investment when it sold the Brooks Brothers clothing chain in 2001. HMV Sold its last US outlet in 2004. It had been overambitious and never made a profit from its expensive stores. Sainsbury's Sold its US chain Shaw's as it struggled to expand and compete. WH Smith built up a portfolio of stores in airports and hotels but sold them after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. Laura Ashley Sold its entire US chain for $1 in 1999 after a string of profit warnings caused by over-ambitious expansion.",

    "webTitle": "The Rochdale Pioneers to Paul Flowers: how the Co-operative dream died", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In February 2009, the Co-operative Group announced that Bob Dylan had allowed it to use one of his most treasured songs in a UK TV advert. The work of London agency McCann Erickson, the commercial in question was soundtracked by his 1962 classic Blowin' in the Wind, and was a self-consciously epic affair: two-and-half minutes long, voiced over by the Scottish actor John Hannah, and first shown on ITV at 7.40pm on a Monday night, mid-way through Coronation Street. It began with a boy launching dandelion seeds into the breeze, which then floated over windfarms, arctic glaciers, Fairtrade coffee plantations, and other symbols of the Co-op Group's supposedly towering ethical standards. \"From community projects to a share of the profits, renewable energy to Fairtrade products, the Co-operative believe that when the benefits are passed around it's good for everyone,\" went the simpering script. The use of the Dylan song \u2013 reportedly approved by the man himself \u2013 was said to have brought the Co-op Bank 120,000 new customers and the advert was hyped up as a token of the Co-op's new ambition. \"We felt the sentiments expressed in Dylan's masterpiece summed up the optimism we have for the Co-operative,\" said Patrick Allen, the group's executive head of marketing. He missed the song's prevailing air of troubled bewilderment, but people like him often do. Back then, the financial crash was in full effect, and over-excited journalists were wondering whether western capitalism was in crisis. By contrast, buoyed by its ambitious managers and the sense that being owned by its own customers set it apart, the Co-op seemed to be brimming with confidence. In the summer of 2008, its banking wing had begun talks about a merger with the Britannia Building Society, which would double the size of its balance sheet and create a \"super mutual\", offering an alternative to the financial institutions that had caused the crash. By 2012, thanks to a sell-off scheme known as Project Verde, the new bank would be moving towards the acquisition of 632 branches of Lloyd's Bank, which would guarantee a hefty new presence on the high street. And in March 2009, the wider Co-op group had completed its buy-out of Somerfield supermarkets. Its then chief executive, Peter Marks, said the acquisition provided \"rocket fuel\" for the group's expansion plans, allowing it to finally compete with the UK's big supermarkets. Now all this looks like monumental hubris. With close inspection of the deal to take over those Lloyd's branches having revealed huge holes in its balance sheet, the Co-op bank is seen as an incurable case, and the Co-op group has been forced to sell 70% of it to the very interests \u2013 among them, hedge funds and private equity outfits \u2013 that it once seemed to set itself against. The big numbers tend to dance in front of your eyes: though it has already received a capital injection of \u00a31.5bn, the bank somehow needs to raise another \u00a3400m, despite its total value being put at a mere \u00a3735m. And then there are the telling details \u2013 such as the fact that the bank's IT systems have long been miscalculating the number of days in a year. To give things a darkly comic twist, its travails are symbolised by the Rev Paul Flowers, the so-called \"crystal Methodist\" and former chair of the bank, who once told a Commons select committee that its assets totalled \u00a33bn, when the true figure was well over 10 times that amount. The allegations against him read like an end-of-the-pier version of Breaking Bad: he now faces three separate drugs charges, relating to possession of cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine. The entire Co-operative Group \u2013 which spans supermarkets, funeral services, insurance, travel agencies, pharmacies, farms and more \u2013 is in a similarly grim position. The Somerfield buy-out eventually led to \u00a3226m of Somerfield's value being written off, and 60% of what the Co-op acquired will soon be sold off. The Group recently announced losses for 2013-14 of \u00a32.5bn. Its debts total \u00a31.4bn. Of its shops, 645 are either empty, or being rented out to other companies. Even its acting chief executive says that 2013 \"was a disastrous year for the Co-operative Group, the worst in our 150-year history\". John Mann is a high-profile Labour MP who sits on the House of Commons' Treasury select committee. His ancestors include one of the Co-op's original founders, and his father worked as a Co-op butcher in his native Leeds. When the former Co-op chief executive Peter Marks appeared before his committee in October last year, Mann did not exactly mince his words: the group's management, he seethed, had overseen a \"catastrophe\"; they had \"reached for the sky ... [and] got nowhere near it\", and then left \"someone else to inherit the mess\". Eight months on, Mann sounds just as fired-up. \"The Co-op got too big for its boots,\" he says. \"Instead of being a membership organisation, it decided to start speculating \u2013 first with Somerfield, and then the Britannia. And it didn't have the expertise or the structures to cope.\" When the Co-op expanded in the past, he says, its growth was always based on new co-operative organisations growing out of the existing business \u2013 not quickfire buy-outs. But, as he sees it, the Co-op's sense of its innate goodness meant that the people at the top eventually thought anything they did would turn out to be similarly virtuous. \"They were playing with the Co-op, and its history and traditions,\" he says. \"And what they did was contrary to all the principles the Co-op had in the past.\" What we now know as the Co-op was born on 21 December 1844 when a group known as the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers opened a shop on a road called Toad Lane. As well as selling a small selection of very basic foodstuffs (and candles), they came up with the so-called Rochdale Principles, which emphasised the new organisation's democratic structure, as well as a belief in distributing profits among the membership. Within a decade, there were more than 1,000 such co-operatives spread across the UK. What we now know as the Co-op bank was founded in 1872. In 1917, the increasingly huge Co-operative movement spawned a political party, which 10 years later affiliated to the Labour party, and began running joint candidates. Modern \"Labour and Co-operative\" MPs include Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy and shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Over the past decade, the Co-op has loaned the Labour party around \u00a318m on low-interest terms; in 2012, it gave Balls' office a \u00a350,000 donation. A review of the Co-op Bank's crisis commissioned by the Co-op group will be published next week: already there have been suggestions \u2013 plainly politically motivated \u2013 that it may somehow highlight Balls' ties to the Co-op, and his supposed role in the passing of legislation that, in retrospect, opened the way to the merger with the Britannia (though just to balance things up, there have also been suggestions that Tory Treasury ministers assisted the Co-op's attempted acquisition of all those Lloyd's bank branches). To say that the 170-year history of the Co-op Group is complicated would be a howling understatement. The modern group is essentially the result of a 2002 merger between the huge national Co-operative Wholesale Society and Co-operative Retail Services, and the group is also an umbrella for an array of local and regional organisations, based in such diverse places as Chelmsford and Penrith. In the Co-op's old industrial heartlands, you occasionally see shopping parades so dominated by their outlets that they seem to provide for people, as socialist folkore would have it, from cradle to grave. The governing structure that sits behind the Co-op's activities looks rather like the pyramid-shaped model that operated in the Soviet Union. At the base are around 48 area committees, each with 10 to 12 elected members who put in three-year terms. These people, in turn, elect seven regional boards \u2013 which duly elect 15 of the 21 members of the national group's board of directors. Of the remaining six, five come from big regional Co-ops, and there is also an independent director. The board currently includes a plasterer, a tax official, a farmer, a telecoms engineer, a gardener and a nurse \u2013 which, according to your view of things, may either suggest a shining example of economic democracy, or a group of people in grave danger of being in over their heads. As many of the Co-op's critics see it, such people also highlight an inbuilt danger of the group's bureaucratic structure: the fact that it favours those who are prepared to devote endless hours to rising up the pyramid, rather than the best people to be overseeing such a large organisation. \"If you're super-active, you can get to the top, like Paul Flowers did,\" says Mann. \"But we're talking about a tiny activist base. Minute.\" Much the same view of things is held by Paul Myners, the non-aligned member of the House of Lords and former City minister in Gordon Brown's government, who was appointed to the Co-op's board in 2013, and charged with putting together a review of what had gone wrong. As he saw it, the Co-op's machinery had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\". And much good it did him: in the face of loud opposition within the Co-op to such proposals as a more professionalised board overseen by a 100-strong \"national membership council\", he handed in his resignation in April. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Myners said that though he had observed \"bad governance\" at British banks, what had happened at the Co-op was \"on an altogether worse level\". His thoughts were phrased slightly more colourfully in a piece for the Daily Mirror. \"Former managers were allowed to run amok like kids in a sweet shop,\" he said. \"They bought up businesses willy-nilly \u2013 from Britannia Building Society to Somerfield supermarkets, and made catastrophically inept decisions over and over again. In the process they crippled the group with huge debt. It was growth for growth's sake. You wouldn't run your household budget like that, but that's how they were running a business with sales of more than \u00a310bn a year \u2026 The board couldn't control them. It wasn't just Paul Flowers at the Co-op Bank. The governance system across the group was not fit for purpose. It was that simple and it can never happen again.\" On the face of it, Myners' take on the Co-op's problems and the best way out of them might seem reasonable enough. But long-standing believers in Co-operative ideals think his proposals are tantamount to wanting to turn the Co-op into a standard-issue PLC, and have been rattled by the sceptical noises he has made about the group's treasured social goals and political aspects. The same plotline defined the recent story of Euan Sutherland: the chief executive who joined the Co-op in May 2013, and then resigned just 10 months later, in a blizzard of controversy over a \u00a36.6m pay deal covering 2013 and 2014 and his alleged lack of understanding of the Co-op's traditions, claiming the organisation was simply \"ungovernable\". One of the loudest voices in the current debate about the Co-op's future belongs to Jo Bird, a Manchester-based advocate of Co-operative businesses who has been involved in them for over 20 years standing, and is campaigning for drastic changes. She puts much of the ongoing disaster down to what she calls \"a severe case of management capture\", the puny powers possessed by the Co-op's members to hold anyone at the top to account, and its hopelessly complicated structure. \"There's no real democracy in the Co-operative Group at the moment,\" she says. The dire state of things, she says, is symbolised by the fact that anyone can join the Co-op by paying \u00a31 for life membership. \"That's meaningless,\" she says. What Myners has proposed, she says, is simply \"the PLC model, which has been roundly rejected\". Her vision is of some of the Co-op's board resigning to make way for \"new blood\", direct elections to its board, activist groups based around local Co-op stores, and the belated embrace of member involvement via the internet. That wouldn't necessarily get over the problem of people at the top being out of their depth, I suggest. \"That's true,\" she says. She then talks about a \"comprehensive programme of member education and training, to equip directors with the skills and understanding they need to fulfil their role\". That may sound rather idealistic, in the context of a failing organisation haemorrhaging billions of pounds. \"Show me a capitalist organisation that has a better solution,\" she says. And then things slightly take on the tone of the aforementioned TV commercial, so much that I can imagine John Hannah voicing what she says next. \"Co-operatives by their very nature put people first, and put the community before the motives of private companies. If you organise a business on those principles, it's going to be a better business than one organised solely for profit.\" Bird reckons that from an ethical perspective, the Co-op Bank is effectively a write-off: \"It is no longer a co-operative bank, and shouldn't be called that,\" she says. But she thinks the wider group will survive. \"The last few months have shown lots of goodwill and support towards the Co-operative group and co-operation in general,\" she says. \"And there's less of a question about any kind of existential threat.\" Mann's view of things is much more complicated. He says he's comfortable with what Myners has proposed \"as an interim measure\", but also thinks the group needs to be decisively returned to its members, and get used to once again thinking locally, rather than in terms of huge business ambitions. The bank, he reckons, can only be saved with the help of the government, which could recreate what it used to be. \"It could, but I don't think it will,\" he says. \"So I think the Co-op bank will disappear.\" The supermarket wing, he says, is \"now in tremendous danger\", as is the Co-op's travel business. But with sufficiently drastic remedies, some of the Group will live on. \"If the Co-op is torn apart at the top it will survive,\" he says. \"But if that doesn't happen, the Co-op will simply implode.\" The Co-op group's AGM will take place on 17 May in Manchester, where those present will vote on a resolution (\"motherhood and apple-pie stuff,\" according to one Co-op insider) broadly in line with the kind of democratic overhaul plenty of people would like, though there is continuing unease about the possibility of a last-ditch lurch towards the structure of an ordinary company. At least some of Myners' proposals are then expected to be put to the entire membership of the Co-operative group. Meanwhile, the Co-op is in the process of selling off 18,000 acres of farmland in England and Scotland, and its pharmacy chain is also set to be put up for sale. Behind all this lurks an array of absolutely fundamental questions. Given that things went so horribly wrong, how will the Co-op ensure nothing similar ever happens again? Can its ideals survive in the midst of such a huge crisis? And if they don't, what would that mean not just for shops, supermarkets and bank branches, but Britain's politics and public life? As someone said all those years ago, the answers are blowing in the wind.",

The work of London agency McCann Erickson, the commercial in question was soundtracked by his 1962 classic Blowin' in the Wind, and was a self-consciously epic affair: two-and-half minutes long, voiced over by the Scottish actor John Hannah, and first shown on ITV at 7.40pm on a Monday night, mid-way through Coronation&#xa0;Street.</p> <p>It began with a boy launching dandelion seeds into the breeze, which then floated over windfarms, arctic glaciers, Fairtrade coffee plantations, and other symbols of the Co-op Group's supposedly towering ethical standards. \"From community projects to a share of the profits, renewable energy to Fairtrade products, the Co-operative believe that when the benefits are passed around it's good for everyone,\" went the simpering script.</p> <p>The use of the Dylan song \u2013 reportedly approved by the man himself \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/bob-dylan-advert-helps-bring-417968\" title=\"\">was said to have brought the Co-op Bank 120,000 new customers</a> and the advert was hyped up as a token of the Co-op's new ambition. \"We felt the sentiments expressed in Dylan's masterpiece summed up the optimism we have for the Co-operative,\" <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/bob-dylan/42368\" title=\"\">said Patrick Allen, the group's executive head of marketing</a>.

By contrast, buoyed by its ambitious managers and the sense that being owned by its own customers set it apart, the Co-op seemed to be brimming with confidence.</p> <p>In the summer of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/3180640/Co-op-in-talks-with-Britannia-building-society.html\" title=\"\">its banking wing had begun talks about a merger with the Britannia Building Society</a>, which would double the size of its balance sheet and create a \"super mutual\", offering an alternative to the financial institutions that had caused the crash.

And in March 2009, the wider Co-op group had <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7918963.stm\" title=\"\">completed its buy-out of Somerfield supermarkets</a>. Its then chief executive, Peter Marks, said the acquisition provided \"rocket fuel\" for the group's expansion plans, allowing it to finally compete with the UK's big&#xa0;supermarkets.</p> <p>Now all this looks like monumental hubris. With close inspection of the deal to take over those Lloyd's branches having revealed huge holes in its balance sheet, the Co-op bank is seen as an incurable case, and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f6d1fdb0-460d-11e3-b495-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2zhy8edfi\" title=\"\">the Co-op group has been forced to sell 70%</a> of it to the very interests \u2013 among them, hedge funds and private equity outfits \u2013 that it once seemed to set itself against. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/17/co-op-board-amateurs-professionals\" title=\"\">The big numbers tend to dance in front of your eyes</a>: though it has already received a capital injection of \u00a31.5bn, the bank somehow needs to raise another \u00a3400m, despite its total value being put at a mere \u00a3735m. And then there are the telling details \u2013 such as the fact that the bank's IT systems have long been miscalculating the number of days in a year.</p> <p>To give things a darkly comic twist, its travails are symbolised by the Rev Paul Flowers, the so-called \"crystal Methodist\" and former chair of the bank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2013/nov/18/questions-cooperative-bank-paul-flowers\" title=\"\">who once told a Commons select committee that its assets totalled \u00a33bn</a>, when the true figure was well over 10 times that amount.

But, as he sees it, the Co-op's sense of its innate goodness meant that the people at the top eventually thought anything they did would turn out to be similarly virtuous. \"They were playing with the Co-op, and its history and traditions,\" he says. \"And what they did was contrary to all the principles the Co-op had in the past.\"</p> <p>What we now know as the Co-op was born on 21 December 1844 when a group known as <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/2012/men-of-rochdale/could-you-be-an-extra1/\" title=\"\">the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers</a> opened a shop on a road called Toad Lane.

And then things slightly take on the tone of the aforementioned TV commercial, so much that I can imagine John Hannah voicing what she says next. \"Co-operatives by their very nature put people first, and put the community before the motives of private companies. If you organise a business on those principles, it's going to be a better business than one organised solely for profit.\"</p> <p>Bird reckons that from an ethical perspective, the Co-op Bank is effectively a write-off: \"It is no longer a co-operative bank, and shouldn't be called that,\" she says. But she thinks the wider group will survive. \"The last few months have shown lots of goodwill and support towards the Co-operative group and co-operation in general,\" she says. \"And there's less of a question about any kind of existential threat.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-441471349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398268271213/Co-op-hearses-011.jpg\" alt=\"Co-op hearses\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-op hearses gathered together at a funeral trade fair in Glasgow.

He says he's comfortable with what Myners has proposed \"as an interim measure\", but also thinks the group needs to be decisively returned to its members, and get used to once again thinking locally, rather than in terms of huge business ambitions. The bank, he reckons, can only be saved with the help of the government, which could recreate what it used to be. \"It could, but I don't think it will,\" he says. \"So I think the Co-op bank will disappear.\" The supermarket wing, he says, is \"now in tremendous danger\", as is the Co-op's travel business. But with sufficiently drastic remedies, some of the Group will live on. \"If the Co-op is torn apart at the top it will survive,\" he says. \"But if that doesn't happen, the Co-op will simply implode.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thenews.coop/84532/news/democracy/co-operative-group-annual-meeting-vote-governance-overhaul/#.U1eqT-ZdWoc\" title=\"\">Co-op group's AGM will take place on 17 May</a> in Manchester, where those present will vote on a resolution (\"motherhood and apple-pie stuff,\" according to one Co-op insider) broadly in line with the kind of democratic overhaul plenty of people would like, though there is continuing unease about the possibility of a last-ditch lurch towards the structure of an ordinary company. At least some of Myners' proposals are then expected to be put to the entire membership of the Co-operative group.

Given that things went so horribly wrong, how will the Co-op ensure nothing similar ever happens again? Can its ideals survive in the midst of such a huge crisis?

      "bodyText": "Mixed factory data from France, Germany and China, combined with disappointing US housing sales, helped push markets lower today, writes Nick Fletcher, despite the positive news that Greece had hit its primary budget surplus. After Tuesday's pharmaceutical-fuelled rise, investors paused for breath, and the closing scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 7.02 points down at 6674.74 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.58% to 9544.19 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.74% lower at 4451.08 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.18% down at 21,675.75 \u2022 Spain's Ibex closed 0.13% lower at 10,424.4 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points or 0.14%. On that note, we'll close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. And more from the ECB, this time comments from council member Ewald Nowotny, president of the National Bank of Austria: The European Central Bank is ready to take action if inflation falls too far below its forecast, one of its governing council members said today. The comments by Ardo Hansson, the governor of Estonia's central bank, to the Wall Street Journal reiterate the bank's recent stance. Analysts have taken this to mean anything from negative deposit rates to a bond buying programme. The full story is here.(\u00a3) On the other hand (from Credit Suisse) : Two pieces of disappointing economic news from America just gave the markets a little jolt. Growth in America's factory sector has slowed slightly in April, according to Markit's monthly survey. The US manufacturing PMI, measuring activity across the sector, dropped to 55.4, down from 55.5 in March; analysts had expected a rise to 56.0. And the number of new homes sold across America in March was much lower than expected, dropping 14.5% to an annual rate of 384,000 properties; well shy of Wall Street forecasts of a 2% rise to 450,000 rate. That has knocked shares lower in Europe, where the FTSEurofirst 300 is now down 0.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 30 points in earlyish trading, -0.2% at 16491. As Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy points out, these results dash hopes that home sales would pick up as America emerged from the blizzardy winter: Adverse weather conditions have had a negative impact on housing activity over the winter months and today\u2019s March failed to benefit from an upward technical correction. The WSJ has a neat explanation of how Brussels stretched the definition of a primary surplus especially for Greece, to turn a double-digit deficit into a primary surplus. Ignoring interest payments on its debt cut the total by 4 percentage points, but that was only the start.... The EC explained: Second, we exclude several specific items, mainly to better reflect the underlying structural fiscal position. In 2013, these adjustments amounted to 9.5% of GDP, mainly reflecting the one-off cost of the support to the banking sector, which amounted to 10.8% of GDP according to the programme definition, and the transfers from Member States to Greece corresponding to profits on Greek Bonds held by the Eurosystem Central Banks, which amounted to 1.5% of GDP. More, and a table, here: More Greek Statistics? Troika Confirms Primary Surplus As flagged up early this morning, France's government has announced new, higher, deficit forecasts, which (if achieved) would see it hit the EC's demands by a whisker. The Paris government now expects to run a deficit of 3.8% of GDP this year, dropping to 3% in 2015. That's the top end of the targets set by Brussels, who have already given France two more years to comply. It has also raised its growth forecast, a little, to 1.0% this year from 0.9% previously. It also expects stronger growth in 2016 and 2017. Here are the new forecasts, followed by the previous ones which were contained in the 2014 Budget: Today's wave of eurozone optimism has also reached Spain, where economy minister Luis de Guindos has suggested Spain this year's borrowing requirements could be reduced. De Guindos told an audience in Madrid that Spain's debt issuance target for 2014 would be \"substantially and significantly\" cut, thanks to the prospect of higher tax revenues as Spain's economy recovers. Reuters has more details: Strong recent economic data could prompt the government to raise its 2014 economic growth forecast of 1 percent, which is already higher than the initial estimate of 0.7 percent. The Bank of Spain expects gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 1.2 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2015. De Guindos said he expected average GDP growth of 1.5 percent in 2014 and 2015 after two years of economic contraction. \"The important thing here is not the exact decimal point ... but that with two years of average growth of 1.5 percent, our outlook is going to be different,\" de Guindos said. Mujtaba Rahman, practice head at Eurasia Group, reckons Greece now has a good chance of receiving some debt relief, now that Brussels has rubber-stamped its primary budget surplus (see here onwards). He writes: The confirmation of Greece's primary's surplus alongside its recent successful return to capital markets will bolster Prime Minister Samaras's claim that no third bailout is necessary. The government's tough stance is being motivated by difficult upcoming local and European elections, where New Democracy remains tied with Syriza and junior coalition partner PASOK looks set to do badly. In this context, the government will now also start pushing for debt relief, given the Eurogroup's commitment to reduce Greece's debt once its primary surplus was achieved. Panos Tsakloglou, Greece's member of Eurogroup Working Group (EWG) is expected to put this issue on the table at tomorrow's EWG and a more formal discussion will likely follow in June in the context of the fifth Troika review. Despite the government's narrative, the Eurogroup will maintain some involvement in Greece once the current program expires. As long as the new reform program comes with tough conditions, some minimal debt relief will likely be forthcoming. The fundamental problem with Greece's primary budget surplus is it ignores so much of the 'bad stuff' (debt repayments, putting billions of euros into its banks, etc) . The WSJ's Charles Forelle compares it to the less rigorous way some companies report their profits: That's earnings before interest, tax, the cost of asset depreciation and the 'amoritisation' of various costs -- popular in the dot-com boom (especially those who didn't survive the crash...) Here's Associated Press's early take on Greece hitting its primary budget surplus: Greece reaches milestone, opens way for assistance The European Union says Greece has reached a major financial milestone that was required if it were to be granted more debt relief. European Commission spokesman Simon O'Connor said Wednesday that Greece's government revenues last year exceeded expenditure when interest payment and other items were excluded. He says Greece's so-called primary budget surplus of 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion), or 0.8 percent of its annual gross domestic product, is \"well ahead of the 2013 target.\" Greece's international creditors have said a primary surplus will entitle Greece to further debt relief. Discussions are set to be concluded in the second half of the year. Most analysts expect the eurozone to lower the interest rates Greece pays on its loans or be granted another extension on when they have to be repaid. It's official.... the European Commission has agreed that Greece has achieved a primary budget surplus, if you strip out enough costs. As expected, EC spokesman Simon O'Connor told reporters in Brussels that Greece had eliminated its deficit last year, if you ignore the (sizeable) cost of interest payments, recapitalising its banks, and other \"one-off\" costs. In a show of support for Athens, O'Connor said Greece had achieved \"remarkable progress\": But with such a huge debt mountain (175% of GDP!), are Greece's borrowings really sustainable, the press pack asked? O'Connor said they are, but also flagged up that the primary surplus will pave the way for talks on debt relief for Greece from its eurozone allies. And over in Athens, Greece's deputy finance minister has just told parliament that \"the sacrifices of the Greek people are beginning to pay off.\" (Helena tells me) A few more highlights from today's CBI survey of UK manufacturing, underlining that firms are very confident about future prospects (despite factory orders dropping a little this month) \u00b7 36% of manufacturers expect total new orders to increase and 10% expect them to fall, giving a balance of +26%, the highest since October 1996 (+27%) . A balance of +26% expect new domestic orders to rise (34% expect an increase and 8% a fall), the highest since April 1977 (+29%) and +22% expect new export orders to go up (33% expecting an increase and 11% a fall) \u00b7 41% of firms anticipate a rise in output volumes and 10% a fall, giving a rounded balance of +32%. 27% expect employment to increase and 11% expect it to decline, giving a balance of +16% Crumbs. Business optimism among UK manufacturers has jumped at its fastest rate in 41 years, according to the CBI's industrial trends survey. The CBI reports that 41% of businesses said they were more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago and 8% less, giving a balance of +33%. That's the highest level since April 1973 -- the year in which Britain joined the EEC, and England failed to qualify for the World Cup. Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, reckons confidence is rapidly rising among British manufacturers: \u201cOur industrial base is seizing a bigger role in the UK\u2019s economic recovery, with output, orders and hiring all on the up. \"There are still bumps in the road ahead, with only a tepid recovery likely in the Eurozone, the pound creeping higher and a rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine. However, expectations for growth in the coming three months are positive and manufacturers plan to significantly ramp up investment in the year ahead.\" One reason to be cautious, though -- UK factory orders did drop in April, with slightly more firms reporting fewer orders than more. But a strong majority expect orders to rise over the next three months. Portugal has achieved a landmark moment -- its first successful bond sale since its bailout. The Lisbon treasury sold \u20ac750m of 10-year debt at an average interest rate, or yield, of just 3.5752%. That's an eight year low -- and a significant show of support from the financial markets for Portugal after years of austerity. The auction was also oversubscribed, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.47 -- meaning many bidders were disappointed. Another sign that investors are much more confident about buying eurozone debt, two years after the debt crisis was at its height. Helena adds that the total number of Greeks applying for the \"social dividend\" (an allowance promised once the primary surplus had been achieved), has shot up to 312,000, according to finance ministry officials in Athens. That's up from 225,000 yesterday. Greece's primary budget surplus will (probably) be announced in a few minutes by Simon O'Connor, spokesman for EU economics and finance Commissioner Oli Rehn. O'Connor told my colleague Helena Smith he will announce it at the beginning of his daily midday press conference \" so it should be out by 12:-05 or somewhere around then.... The primary surplus required further calculation by the economic and financial affairs directorate,\" he said. When pressed as to what it might be he added: I don't think you should find it a huge surprise.\" The Athens' government has already declared that it believes it achieved a surplus (ignoring its debt burden), although there are question marks over the accounting methods... The eurozone's total government deficit fell to 3.0% in the year to March 2014, Eurostat has reported, down from 3.7% a year earlier. This has pushed the total government debt to a new record high of 92.6% of GDP, up from 90.7% a year ago. Luxembourg was the only EU member to post an actual surplus (+0.1% of GDP), although Germany came close with a balanced budget. The lowest government deficits in percentage of GDP were recorded in: Estonia (-0.2%), Denmark (-0.8%), Latvia (-1.0%) and Sweden (-1.1%). Ten Member States had deficits higher than 3% of GDP, based on Eurostat's methodology. They are: Slovenia (-14.7%), Greece (-12.7%), Ireland (-7.2%), Spain (-7.1%), the United Kingdom (-5.8%), Cyprus (-5.4%), Croatia and Portugal (both -4.9%), France and Poland (both -4.3%). Eurostat also reported that Greece's total national debt has now hit 175% of GDP -- no word yet, though, on whether it achieved a primary surplus. Here's more detail: At the end of 2013, the lowest ratios of government debt to GDP were recorded in Estonia (10.0%), Bulgaria (18.9%), Luxembourg (23.1%), Latvia (38.1%), Romania (38.4%), Lithuania (39.4%) and Sweden (40.6%). Sixteen Member States had government debt ratios higher than 60% of GDP, with the highest registered in Greece (175.1%), Italy (132.6%), Portugal (129.0 %), Ireland (123.7%), Cyprus (111.7%) and Belgium (101.5%). Here's all the details (as a pdf). The full text of the Bank of England minutes is online here, by the way. Meanwhile, the minutes of the Bank of England's last meeting show that its policy makers have a \"range of views\" over how much spare capacity is lurking in the UK economy. The Monetary Policy Committee also reckons the UK economy is growing at a fair lick, around 1% quarter-on-quarter in the first half of this year. On the spare capacity issue, the MPC is pondering whether the amount of slack in the labour market was understated by the official unemployment rate, if many of Britain's growing army of self-employed workers were actually underemployed and searching for work as employees. As the minutes puts it: There was some evidence against this. First, part of the rise in self-employment appeared to be a continuation of a longer-term secular trend, rather than a cyclical response to a lack of other employment opportunities. Consistent with that, higher self-employment did not appear to have been associated with inflows of people recently made redundant. Second, survey evidence suggested that the self-employed were only slightly more likely to be looking for another job than were employees. For some, self-employment might have been chosen as an alternative to retirement, rather than as an alternative to employment. Nevertheless, it was possible that some of the self-employed were underemployed and would be more productive as employees were more jobs to become available. The MPC was also in several minds over how UK inflation will change in 2014 and 2015. As Jeremy Cook of World First puts it: \u201cThe MPC was said to have a \u201crange of opinions\u201d on the path for inflation over the medium term \u2013 a very macroeconomic way of saying \u201cyour guess is as good as mine, old chap\u201d. Today's UK public finance figures also show that revenues from stamp duty jumped 37% in the last financial year, to \u00a312.8bn. In March alone, the government raked in \u00a31.1 billion from stamp duty, 44% higher than in March 2013. In contrast, VAT income increased by \u00a30.6 billion, or 5.8% compared to the same month last year. Income tax reported in March 2014 increased by \u00a31.0 billion, or 7.8% compared to the same month last year. The full report is here (pdf). The UK hits its deficit target for 2013-14 because March's public finances were much better than expected. Britain borrowed just \u00a36.69bn, down from \u00a311.424bn a year earlier -- which is why the borrowing total came in just below the \u00a3107.8bn target. Breaking: The UK government has hit its target for deficit reduction for the last financial year, as the British deficit fell to its lowest level since the financial crisis. The Office for National Statistics reports that public sector net borrowing in 2013-14 came in at \u00a3107.7bn, or 6.6% of GDP. That is \u00a37.5bn lower than the same period in 2012/13, when it was \u00a3115.1bn. And crucially for George Osborne, it is within the target of \u00a3107.8bn predicted by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. This means the UK's total national debt, excluding the effects of Britain's financial interventions, is now \u00a31,268.7 billion, equivalent to 75.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). France's stock market is the worst performer of the major European indices in this morning, down 0.3% after this morning's disappointing PMI survey. The German DAX is down 0.1% despite its firms' strong performance, while the FTSE 100 is flat, In the City, Associated British Foods has surged 9% to the top of the FTSE 100 risers this morning after it posted strong earnings growth (up to 10%) thanks to its Primark clothing division. ABF also announced it is launching Primark in America, and plans to open its first store in Boston, Massachusetts next year. Can it succeed where so many rivals have failed, by cracking the US retail market? As my colleague Jennifer Rankin writes: America has proved to be a graveyard for many foreign retail giants, including Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith, Sainsbury's and Tesco. But Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, said it had decided to take its concept to consumers in the US after \"extensive research.\" More here: Primark to enter US market with Boston store Australia's stock market rally has continued today, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index hitting its highest level since 2008. A post-GFC high, as this chart shows: The news that Australia's inflation rate had risen less than expected in March, at 2.9% annually, pushed up shares and drove down the Aussie dollar. Here's the full story. Germany's strong private sector performance has driven the overall Eurozone composite output index to its highest level in almost three years: This morning's French and German economic data has underlined the patchy nature of the eurozone's two-speed recovery. Here's some instant reaction: It's also notable that the geopolitical crisis over Ukraine has not caused any obvious disruption in Germany, despite its close business links with Russia. Chris Williamson of Markit told Reuters: \"The Ukraine crisis is not dampening business spirits. There may be some concerns among German firms about energy supply but it is not a destabilising force,\" Germany's private sector recovery has accelerated -- with manufacturing and services companies have reported that activity strengthened this month. Markit's \"flash\" German services activity index jumped to 55.0, from 53.0 in March, showing healthier growth. Ditto for manufacturing, which rose to 54.2 from 53.7 in March. A much brighter picture than in France. German firms reported a strong increase in their output -- which rose at the second highest rate in three years. New business growth also accelerated thanks to demand from domestic customers and from overseas, with Asia, Europe and the US all cited as sources of growth. Companies also took on more staff, with job creation rates close to February\u2019s 25-month high. It all adds up to a strong month for Europe's largest economy, as Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, explains: A combination of increased activity, rising new orders and further employment growth across both the manufacturing and service sectors suggest companies will remain in expansion mode during the coming months. And in a worrying signal for eurozone inflation, manufacturers reported that input costs fell as firms haggled prices down, and raw material prices dropped. \uf0a7 This morning's disappointing French economic data comes just hours before its government explains how its annual borrowings will be brought down to 3% of national output by 2015. Prime Minister Manuel Valls will give France's finance committee the details of a \u20ac50bn package of welfare cuts and savings designed to bring the French deficit into line with EU targets [within the two year extension granted by Brussels]. But as Reuters reports, France has also tweaked its growth forecasts higher, giving no margin for error if they prove too rosy. France's government is to set out its roadmap to deficit reduction on Wednesday using optimistic growth forecasts considered risky by its own fiscal watchdog to show how it will meet European budget standards by the end of next year. More here: France treads fine line on EU deficit-cutting targets Just in: growth in France's private sector has stumbled, according to the monthly survey of the sector from data firm Markit. Markit warned that the French recovery has \"lost momentum\" as new business \"stagnated\", with bosses still cutting jobs and showing little confidence. It reports that France's manufacturing PMI (based on interviews with purchasing managers across the country) fell to 50.9, from 52.1 in March. That's much weaker than the 51.9 expected by analysts, and shows a sharp slowdown in growth. The flash Service sector PMI also missed forecasts, dropping to just 50.3 from 51.5 in March. That's worryingly close to the 50 point mark that separates expansion from contraction. As Markit put it: Services activity rose only fractionally, while manufacturers indicated a modest increase in production. Employment in the French private sector fell for the sixth month running in April, reinforcing fears that the eurozone's second largest economy is struggling to achieve solid growth. Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, warned: \u201cThe nascent recovery in French private sector output lost momentum in April. A weaker rise in activity reflected stalling new business, while staffing levels were cut at a sharper rate. A general hesitancy among clients was reported \u2013 until we see a decisive shift in confidence, the business climate looks set to remain frail.\u201d Zhou Hao, China economist at ANZ in Shanghai, is encouraged that the Chinese factory PMI rose slightly this month from 48.0 to 48.3, (although that's not high enough to signal growth), saying: \"It's generally in line (with expectations), reflecting that growth momentum is stabilising.\" Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, agrees: Investors look to be focused on the slight improvement in April and remain content with the fact that any slowing is not getting any worse than already feared. But analysts at Nomura are more downbeat, and reckon the Chinese central bank will soon cut borrowing costs in an attempt to stimulate the economy. They told clients: \"We do not believe that this uptick in the HSBC PMI signals any sort of turning point for the economy and continue to believe that growth momentum is on a downtrend.\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone and business. A busy day for economic and political news has begun with the news that China's factory sector output has shrunk for a fourth month running, although there are signs that Beijing's stimulus efforts are starting to pay off. HSBC's monthly PMI survey (which takes the temperature of private sector and state manufacturing firms) came in at 48.3 for April. That's a small improvement on March's 48.0, but still signals that the sector contracted again [anything below 50 = a decline] HSBC reported that output, new export orders and employment all contracted this month, as these charts shows: Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, said there are still clear downside risks to China's growth prospects, adding: The State Council released new measures to support growth and employment after the release of Q1 GDP. Whilst initial impact will likely be limited, they signalled readiness to do more if necessary. We think more measures may be unveiled in the coming months and the PBoC [China's central bank] will keep sufficient liquidity. The Chinese yuan fell to a 16-month low after the survey was released, hitting 6.2465 to the US dollar. Shares also fell in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today.... Is Europe's manufacturing sector faring better this month? We'll get an indication shortly when 'flash' PMI data for France and Germany is released. In the UK, public finance figures for March are released at 9.30am BST. They'll show whether the British government hit its targets for the 2013-2014 financial year..... ....and the minutes from the Bank of England's latest MPC meeting, also due at 9.30am BST, will show if the committee is moving closer to raising interest rates. Over in Brussels, the eurozone\u2019s official data agency Eurostat,will release issues its official debt-and-deficit data for 2013. It may confirm that Greece has achieved its goal of a primary budget surplus. While in Paris, the French government will lay out its plan to bring its deficit into line with the EC's targets by 2015 (just two year's behind schedule...)",

The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Morrison published its annual report last week. We would highlight the relaxed depreciation policies (which reduces earnings quality) and the big reduction in labour intensity, in line with trends seen at Sainsbury and Tesco in recent years (which limits the scope for future cost cutting).

Its shares jumped 7.4p to 104p after it reported a 16% rise in first quarter revenues, helped by a rush of business from China as the country rolled out its 4G networks. But Roger Phillips at Investec remained cautious, saying:</p> <blockquote> An in-line statement for a stock that has seen relentless downgrades for a year will be taken positively, albeit the results are not as good as they appear on the surface...The shares look fairly priced for some chance of a 2015 bounce-back but we think Spirent's 2013 travails are partially structural. We stay at hold with an unchanged multiple-based target price of 105p. <br> 2014 guidance for around 10% underlying revenue growth looks supported by the first quarter performance, which is much stronger in growth terms due to an easy comparison. However, the results look better on the headline level than they really are, with networks and applications slipping into loss and wireless and service experience earnings before interest, tax and amortisation down around 60% year on year, both partly due to previously announced operating expenditure investment. A large contract in service assurance that slipped from the fourth quarter of 2013 into the first quarter of 2014 both distorts the book-to-bill and saves the operating profit line, but this is a one-off so we see little momentum behind 2014 estimates. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Iofina</strong> slumped 33p to 22.75p after the iodine specialist warned production this year would be significantly below market expectations. The company extracts iodine from the waste brine produced by oil and gas companies, but some of its US suppliers are switching to fracking, leaving it short of brine. As a result it unveiled a cost cutting programme including reducing staff numbers in order to conserve cash.</p> <p>Analyst Sanjeev Bahl at house broker Numis said:</p> <blockquote> Our recommendation and forecasts are under review this morning as a consequence of this...production update. The primary operator in Oklahoma who supplies Iofina with produced brine water has been aggressively fracking in the first quarter, but this now looks to continue at similar levels through to the end of 2014. This will impact the supply of brine at four of Iofina's six operational plants (with number 6 close to completion), only leaving number 1 (Texas) and number 2 unscathed. Brine availability has always been a risk to our valuation, where our base case factored in an operational uptime that included a buffer for unexpected disruptions in brine supply and plant shut-ins, however, today's announcement suggests far lower plant availability than estimated. <br> ...This will have a significant effect on our projected iodine production for 2014 and as a consequence there is a significant risk to Iofina's profitability for 2014...We do not expect Iofina to generate a significant profit in 2014 and our discounted cash flow derived valuation is under review. We expect our valuation to come back significantly as we scale back additional plant-roll out and near term production. </blockquote>",

After Tuesday's excitement in the pharmaceutical sector, AstraZeneca added another 82.5p to 4042.5p on continued hopes of a bid from Pfizer, while another potential takeover target, Shire, rose 43p to \u00a331.89. GlaxoSmithkline, which unveiled a complex asset swap and joint venture with Novartis, ended 2.5p better at 1642.5p. A number of other companies were quoted without the right to the latest dividends, including British Gas owner Centrica, down 14.3p at 330.6p, and Old Mutual, 8p lower at 196p. Elsewhere Morrisons lost 7.4p to 196.7p as JP Morgan cut its price target from 175p to 150p with an underweight rating. The bank said: Morrison published its annual report last week. We would highlight the relaxed depreciation policies (which reduces earnings quality) and the big reduction in labour intensity, in line with trends seen at Sainsbury and Tesco in recent years (which limits the scope for future cost cutting). We cut earnings per share by 18% for 2015/16 and, thus, our target price from 175p to 150p. But Associated British Foods was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up 240p to \u00a329.62 after a 1% rise in first half profits, as a strong performance from its Primark discount fashion chain outweighed a fall in its sugar business. Wolseley added 56p to \u00a334.17 after Credit Suisse raised its rating on the building materials group from neutral to buy with a \u00a340 target price, based on the prospects for cash returns to shareholders. Leading the mid-cap risers was telecoms testing equipment group Spirent Communications. Its shares jumped 7.4p to 104p after it reported a 16% rise in first quarter revenues, helped by a rush of business from China as the country rolled out its 4G networks. But Roger Phillips at Investec remained cautious, saying: An in-line statement for a stock that has seen relentless downgrades for a year will be taken positively, albeit the results are not as good as they appear on the surface...The shares look fairly priced for some chance of a 2015 bounce-back but we think Spirent's 2013 travails are partially structural. We stay at hold with an unchanged multiple-based target price of 105p. 2014 guidance for around 10% underlying revenue growth looks supported by the first quarter performance, which is much stronger in growth terms due to an easy comparison. However, the results look better on the headline level than they really are, with networks and applications slipping into loss and wireless and service experience earnings before interest, tax and amortisation down around 60% year on year, both partly due to previously announced operating expenditure investment. A large contract in service assurance that slipped from the fourth quarter of 2013 into the first quarter of 2014 both distorts the book-to-bill and saves the operating profit line, but this is a one-off so we see little momentum behind 2014 estimates. Finally Iofina slumped 33p to 22.75p after the iodine specialist warned production this year would be significantly below market expectations. The company extracts iodine from the waste brine produced by oil and gas companies, but some of its US suppliers are switching to fracking, leaving it short of brine. As a result it unveiled a cost cutting programme including reducing staff numbers in order to conserve cash. Analyst Sanjeev Bahl at house broker Numis said: Our recommendation and forecasts are under review this morning as a consequence of this...production update. The primary operator in Oklahoma who supplies Iofina with produced brine water has been aggressively fracking in the first quarter, but this now looks to continue at similar levels through to the end of 2014. This will impact the supply of brine at four of Iofina's six operational plants (with number 6 close to completion), only leaving number 1 (Texas) and number 2 unscathed. Brine availability has always been a risk to our valuation, where our base case factored in an operational uptime that included a buffer for unexpected disruptions in brine supply and plant shut-ins, however, today's announcement suggests far lower plant availability than estimated. ...This will have a significant effect on our projected iodine production for 2014 and as a consequence there is a significant risk to Iofina's profitability for 2014...We do not expect Iofina to generate a significant profit in 2014 and our discounted cash flow derived valuation is under review. We expect our valuation to come back significantly as we scale back additional plant-roll out and near term production.",

Pull the other one. Forsey and his chairman, Keith Hellawell, have been banging on for so long about Ashley's supposed need for a megabucks incentive award that it would be no surprise if fund managers offered a sympathetic word or two just to get the duo to shut up. Political campaigners knocking on doors before an election could tell them that a doorstep pledge of support is not the same as a real vote. Sports Direct's board misread the mood. Tough. \"This outcome is likely to lead to further uncertainty in the future,\" continues Forsey. Why? Uncertainty will only arise if Forsey, Hellawell and Ashley choose to manufacture some. They have no grounds for doing so. Outside investors have twice rejected Sports Direct's proposals, judging (one assumes) that Ashley owns 58% of the company, a holding worth \u00a32.75bn, and thus doesn't need extra motivation to work hard.

Sunderland brought off one of the great FA Cup shocks by beating Leeds at Wembley. Britain joined the European Economic Community; Ted Heath was prime minister; the miners went on strike; the charts were full of songs by Sweet, Slade and Donny Osmond. According to the CBI, you have to canter this far down memory lane to find a time when those running Britain's factories were as upbeat about life as they are today. Of those firms questioned by the employers' organisation, 41% said they were more optimistic than they were three months ago, while 8% said they were feeling gloomier. The balance of +33 points was the highest since 1973. Other findings in the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey suggest this is more than froth. Orders and output are running at their highest levels since the mid-1990s, despite the still feeble recovery in the eurozone, the rise in the value of the pound and the tension in Ukraine. Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, says the report should be taken as a sign not just of rising confidence but of a better balanced economic recovery in which manufacturing plays a more prominent role. That will be music to George Osborne's ears. The upbeat tone of the industrial trends survey sits a little oddly with the minutes from the latest meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Sky-high levels of confidence among manufacturers are normally only seen at the very end of long periods of strong growth: 1973, the Lawson boom of 1988, the pre-crash high of 2006. The economy expanded by more than 5% in 1973, the single biggest rise of the postwar era and the culmination of a quarter of a century of almost uninterrupted growth in the global economy. Threadneedle Street is much less bullish. It thinks the UK is still in the early stages of a recovery, and the MPC points to downside risks such as the 5.5% current account deficit, the slowdown in China, and the possibility that wage growth will remain weak. The nine members of the committee were unanimous in voting for interest rates to stay put at 0.5%. Whether they will remain of one voice for much longer remains to be seen. Unemployment is now below the Bank's 7% threshold and the details of the CBI report are extremely strong. Investment intentions are at their highest in 17 years, the expectations for domestic orders and output are also at levels not seen since the 1970s. And although the economy is in many ways a completely different beast from that of four decades ago, there is one striking similarity. The boom of 1973 was built on expansionary policies \u2013 cuts in interest rates, easy credit, and big budget deficits. It was the year that rising inflation did for the reckless Barber boom. Inflation is currently falling not rising and the City view of the MPC minutes is that the Bank intends to keep official interest rates at 0.5% for another year. But with both business and consumer confidence high, the housing market humming, and next week's first-quarter GDP figures likely to show growth of close to 1%, any signs of the economy overheating may force the Bank's hand well before that.",

However, the three outcomes that we indicated for the second conversion still remain, ie the question is not whether the unit conversion occurs, but what subsidy regime it operates under...The potential ramifications go beyond just Drax, as it once again casts some doubt on the UK regulatory regime (cf the potential political interference that has been seen in energy supply).  The government's decision seems to hinge on the 'mobilisation of capital', we believe, in the supply chain, but how and why is not at all clear. The Department of Energy and Climate Change [DECC] has indicated to Drax that the government still sees biomass burn as very key to UK energy policy.  DECC and Drax do not have great concerns about EU state aid issues. </blockquote>",

However, we believe that there are three outcomes, for the second unit, none of which are disastrous: it wins its legal challenge and progresses, once again under the early [contract for difference] regime; it loses its legal challenge progresses under the enduring CfD mechanism; or it loses its legal challenge and progresses under the slightly less lucrative [direct subsidy scheme]. Drax's management admit to be somewhat fazed by today's decision from the government, and it has undoubtedly created some greater uncertainty. However, the three outcomes that we indicated for the second conversion still remain, ie the question is not whether the unit conversion occurs, but what subsidy regime it operates under...The potential ramifications go beyond just Drax, as it once again casts some doubt on the UK regulatory regime (cf the potential political interference that has been seen in energy supply). The government's decision seems to hinge on the 'mobilisation of capital', we believe, in the supply chain, but how and why is not at all clear. The Department of Energy and Climate Change [DECC] has indicated to Drax that the government still sees biomass burn as very key to UK energy policy. DECC and Drax do not have great concerns about EU state aid issues.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne just met his full-year borrowing target in 2013-14, with the UK deficit falling to the lowest level since the beginning of the financial crisis as economic recovery boosted tax receipts. Government borrowing fell to \u00a3107.7bn in the fiscal year to the end of March 2014 from \u00a3115.1bn a year earlier, scraping in just below the \u00a3107.8bn target outlined by the Treasury's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in last month's budget. The chancellor was able to meet his target thanks to an unexpectedly sharp fall in borrowing in March to \u00a36.7bn, from \u00a311.4bn a year earlier. City economists had expected Osborne to miss it, forecasting a full-year deficit of \u00a3110bn. Full-year borrowing as a percentage of GDP fell from 7.4% in 2012-13 to 6.6%, which was the lowest since 2007-08 according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The public purse was helped by a 3.7% increase in tax receipts against a backdrop of economic growth and falling unemployment. There was a 37.2% jump in stamp duty receipts to \u00a312.6bn reflecting the strength of Britain's housing market, while income tax and VAT receipts were also higher. Central government current spending grew at a slower rate, by 1.4% over the year, with slower growh in benefits payments as welfacre cuts started to feed through. The data was a further boost for the chancellor, who has long argued that cutting the deficit is central to building a long-term sustainable economic future for Britain. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said: \"Government borrowing is high, but it is falling as the economic upturn boosts taxes and cuts the jobless numbers, while austerity keeps spending growth weak. \"Austerity still has a long way to run, but with the economy growing rapidly now and wage growth beginning to perk up there is every chance that government borrowing will fall faster than the chancellor is planning on.\" The OBR has forecast a declining deficit in every year of its forecast horizon, with borrowing falling to \u00a395.5bn in 2014-15 before achieving a surplus of \u00a34.8bn in 2018-19. Osborne will be hoping to fight the 2015 general election campaign on the grounds that the economy is safe only in the hands of the Conservatives, helped by a backdrop of growth and as wage growth begins to outpace inflation, easing the burden on household budgets. Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that despite the fall in borrowing in 2013-14, Osborne had missed his original targets. \"A deficit this year of \u00a3107.7bn compared to the chancellor's claim in 2010 that it would be just \u00a360bn is the cost of the three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election,\" he said. Minutes of the April meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee showed members thought it was \"possible\" that a sustainable recovery and real wage rises were on the way. All nine members voted in favour of leaving interest rates on hold at 0.5% and quantitative easing unchanged at \u00a3375bn.",
