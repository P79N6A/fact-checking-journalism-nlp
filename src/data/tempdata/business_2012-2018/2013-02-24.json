      "bodyText": "Two former Conservative chancellors have issued grave warnings about the British economy as the government braced itself for the pound to slide following the loss of the UK's coveted AAA credit rating. Sterling is expected to fall against other major currencies as the financial markets respond to Moody's decision on Friday evening to cut the national credit rating, repeatedly used by the chancellor, George Osborne, to validate his tough economic measures, by one notch to AA1. While clearly supportive of the coalition's austerity programme of deep public spending cuts, the two senior Tories, Kenneth Clarke and Lord Lawson, both cautioned that the UK was vulnerable. Clarke, now minister without portfolio in the cabinet, defended Osborne's previous claims that the government's economic policy could be judged on its credit rating, arguing that problems with the global economy and particularly in the eurozone had pushed recovery \"several years\" beyond what had been expected at the general election in 2010. \"It seemed perfectly sensible to me at the time,\" Clarke told the Sky News Murnaghan programme. \"It would now if it were not for the fact that it is quite clear that the global economic and financial crisis is persisting, it's worse than we thought, several more years are required.\" Speaking on the same programme, Lawson said it was vital that ministers and the Bank of England made no suggestions they would like to see a further weakening of the value of the pound \u2013 which could help boost exports by making British goods cheaper for foreign customers \u2013 in case it prompted \"a run on sterling\". \"That would not be clever, that would not be sensible, that would not be helpful,\" said Lawson. \"But I don't think that George Osborne wants that.\" The pound has already come under severe pressure this year as investors questioned the UK's reputation as a safe haven from the economic woes in the eurozone, falling 7% during 2013 to close at $1.516 against the US dollar on Friday evening. Sebastien Galy, senior currency strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, predicted it would slide to $1.50 within the next couple of days, and as low as $1.46 in the longer term. Galy, though, did not see a full-blown sterling crisis. \"It's not a run on the pound in a deeply negative sense,\" he explained. Moody's downgrade seems set to dominate when parliament resumes after its half-term break on Monday, with Labour expected to raise the issue at the weekly prime minister's questions on Wednesday, and suggestions there could be a formal statement from Osborne before that. The chancellor is expected to face calls at a hearing of the banking commission, where he is due to appear on Monday, for him to take a tighter grip on the banks to boost lending and growth as part of a wider plan B. Significantly for the coalition, however, Moody's also said that following months in which the UK had been under the threat of such a downgrade, the outlook was now \"stable\" \u2013 citing the government's commitment to its austerity spending cuts as a chief reason for that judgment. Gemma Godfrey, head of investment strategy at Brooks Macdonald, which manages over \u00a34.6bn of assets, said investors wanted to see Osborne announce new infrastructure spending in next month's budget. \"The markets are more focused on growth than on deficit reduction \u2026 As an investor in a low-growth environment, you're looking for any areas that can give you growth,\" Godfrey said. \"The emphasis should be to kickstart growth, because without growth our debt levels will be very hard to manage.\" Godfrey pointed out that infrastructure spend is classified as \"capital\" not \"current\" spending, giving Osborne the opportunity to announce fresh spending plans. \"The risk is that too great a focus on deficit reduction could further squeeze the economy and domestic corporate revenues,\" she added. Economists also fear a weaker pound will drive up the cost of living in the UK. \"The danger is that the pound falls too far and becomes a serious inflation concern. Also, a sharp fall in the pound would not be good for confidence,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. The Liberal Democrat business secretary, Vince Cable, told BBC1's Andrew Marr programme the rating change was \"largely symbolic\", adding: \"In terms of the real economy, there is no reason why the downgrade should have any impact.\" Despite the attempt to rally around the chancellor, however, some Tory MPs suggested there was growing dissent in the party. Adam Afriyie, the Windsor MP who has been the subject of reports that he is building up a leadership challenge bid if the party loses the 2015 general election, wrote in the Mail on Sunday that the coalition was \"in the last chance saloon\" and warned that the budget on 20 March was \"a final opportunity to devlier deliver real growth before 2015\", before setting out a series of policy suggestions including widespread tax cuts. Peterborough Tory MP Stewart Jackson took to the social networking site Twitter to say: \"Adam Afriyie is writing what many Tory MPs are thinking. Over to you George \u2026\" Other colleagues in the House of Commons disputed the challenge, however. Nadhim Zahawi, the founder of polling company YouGov and a leading rebel over House of Lords reform, predicted the downgrade would not hit the interest rates for UK government debt, which was the key importance of the credit rating. \"We are still borrowing \u00a3426m a day,\" added Zahawi. \"To abandon fiscal constraint now would be deeply wrong.\"",

      "bodyText": "ICIS, the price reporting agency at the centre of the wholesale gas market rigging allegations, has opened a formal consultation with the energy industry about how to improve its operations. The move comes as the Financial Services Authority (FSA) investigates possible manipulation of trading, with findings not expected to emerge for months. The ICIS consultation follows concerns raised by one of its now sacked reporters, Seth Freedman, about price gyrations on 30 September in the unregulated over-the-counter \"day ahead\" market, which raised fears that Britain's \u00a3300bn wholesale gas market was being manipulated. Freedman also flagged up worries about the methodology used by his employer to set prices. The consultation comes days after the leading brokers in the gas trading field, ICAP, Marex Spectron and Tullett Prebon, unveiled plans to produce their own price indices, in effect bypassing the products of ICIS and other price reporting agencies whose methodologies have also been questioned by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. The issue of domestic gas prices will surface again on Wednesday when Centrica, the owner of British Gas, reports full year financial results expected to show post-tax profits from residential energy supply up 10% at nearly \u00a3600m. Among the questions asked in the consultation documents put out by ICIS, a subsidiary of publisher Reed International, is one about whether the industry believes the in-house methodology seeks to provide a reliable measure of physical market value. \"How well do you think the ICIS methodology achieves this aim?\" It goes on to ask whether there are alternative methodologies ICIS should consider. \"If so, please describe these methodologies and their strengths and weaknesses as mechanisms for measuring physical market value.

Since then the regulator Ofgem and the FSA have been reviewing the material provided by ICIS and Freedman. Many energy executives have said privately that they are confident the investigation will uncover no wrongdoing and that conviction has grown as the weeks have passed without visits from the regulators. But well-placed sources say the FSA is \"in full flow\" on the issue and warn it is \"definitely not true\" that the investigation is winding down or drawing early conclusions that the market has been working well. The investigation comes as an increasing number of long gas contracts are linked to indices provided by ICIS, Platts or others and amid worries that prices could be manipulated either by poor reporting or deliberate action by traders. The concerns about the lightly regulated commodity markets increased last autumn when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the US announced it was seeking a record penalty of $435m (\u00a3288m) and trying to claw back $35m in profits from Barclays for allegedly manipulating the electricity market between November 2006 and December 2008.

He said: \"Price reporting agencies are getting their information from brokers, so it makes sense that the brokers, who do thousands of trades a day, come up with a composite price over the entire day. These prices from the PRAs are OK, but they're all over the place and what are they really based on?\"",

    "webTitle": "Quantitative easing: the markets are struggling with a serious drug habit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial markets have become stimulus junkies. They crave their next fix of quantitative easing and when they don't get it they turn ugly. The rush they get from the drug wears off after a while, and then they become needy and whiny. Witness last week's sell-off on Wall Street following the hint from the Federal Reserve that it was about to cut off the drug supply. A similar dependency exists in the UK, where stock market traders expectantly await an injection of QE, courtesy of the Bank of England, after deterioration in the UK's economic outlook. Governor Sir Mervyn King voted for another \u00a325bn of cheap money and his colleagues should endorse his view in the coming months. The loss of the UK's much coveted AAA status, thanks to the credit ratings agency Moody's on Friday night, is likely to make the markets salivate even more. The prospect of US policymakers taking the opposite view, and raising interest rates, prompted a bit of soul-searching. The markets have rallied strongly since the middle of 2012, but appeared acutely vulnerable to the suggestion that monetary conditions might at some point return to something like normal. For those who don't have long enough memories to remember what normal is, that would be a world with official interest rates between 3% and 5% and where the electronic printing presses are mothballed. The situation today is the closest the world has been to a depression since the 1930s. Then, Keynes said a depression was a \"chronic condition of subnormal activity for a considerable period without any marked tendency towards recovery or towards complete collapse\". The global economy has exhibited all these traits since the deep slump of 2008-09. Growth has been sub-par for a long period. There is no real sign that output is about to slump as it did four years ago, but the sort of strong recovery expected after previous post-war recessions has proved elusive. It's a depression all right. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say we are on the brink of the third wave of global monetary easing. Phase one came in the winter of 2008-09 when interest rates were slashed virtually to zero and quantitative easing was introduced as a \"temporary\" measure. The drying up of credit meant the money supply was contracting and there was a fear of being sucked back to the 1930s. The hard economic data at the time suggested this was a genuine prospect. So money was made cheap and plentiful, just as Keynes would have suggested. But by late 2011, the global economy needed another fix of the monetary stimulus drug. In part, this was because the drugs had side-effects \u2013 QE led to asset-price speculation which pushed up commodity prices, which in turn raised business costs and cut the real incomes of consumers. In part, it was because certain finance ministers \u2013 no names, no pack drill \u2013 tried a course of cold turkey too soon. In part, it was because the eurozone crises hit the rest of the world. Now we are entering the third phase of monetary easing. The Bank of Japan will push inflation up to 2%, using a combination of monetary easing and fiscal stimulus. Mario Draghi has been talking tough at the European Central Bank but is contemplating cutting borrowing costs in response to a eurozone economy that failed to grow in every quarter of 2012 and is still heading south. The Bank of England has decided to adopt a \"flexible approach\" to the government's 2% inflation target and looks likely to increase its QE programme to \u00a3400bn within the next couple of months. And so it goes on. With its housing bubble about to pop, the Bank of Canada has cooled off the idea of tightening policy, while the central banks in Sweden and Australia left interest rates unchanged in February but maintained their bias towards easing. As for the Fed, anybody who thinks the US central bank is about to toughen its stance hasn't been paying attention. The US is obsessed by the Great Depression. It is the single biggest economic event of American history and is embedded in the national psyche. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his mark by studying the policy errors of the 1930s and is determined not to repeat one of them: an over-tight monetary policy. America's recovery has been modest by historical standards. Unemployment has remained much higher than the Fed would like, and it wants to see the jobless rate below 6.5% before it even thinks about tightening policy. Even that might not prompt action, according to the Fed's vice-chairman Janet Yellen. David Brown, of New View economics, says: \"We are back to bubble economics and the super-accelerant added by the central banks is the propellant that will take this rally back above the upper hemisphere in the coming years.\" He adds: \"The Fed is going to be the last agent that will want to upset the applecart on the risk-on revival to date. It has plied the markets with more liquidity than anyone else. It wants risk-on. It wants irrational exuberance. It wants four dimensional easing \u2013 easy money, easy rates, easy currency and easy fiscal policy. It wants stronger growth and the lower cost of capital to markets is all part of that plan. Strong equity markets and stronger financial wealth perceptions are central to this. If consumers feel wealthier because their stocks go up and house prices start to stabilize, then that is part of the game-plan too.\" This all may sound eerily reminiscent of the world before the meltdown. That's because it is. The repair job on the US economy is more advanced than that in Europe, and there is a real chance of an industrial renaissance in the years to come. Energy is cheap, China has lost some of its labour-cost advantage, higher oil prices are making it far less advantageous to outsource. Manufacturing jobs are coming home. That said, the repair job is incomplete. Three factors should be of concern to US policymakers: the high levels of debt to income even after the de-leveraging of recent years; the pressure on real incomes from low wages; and the risk that political gridlock in Washington over raising the debt ceiling will lead to an inappropriate tightening of fiscal policy that will lead to a recession in the first half of 2013. A fiscal impasse between Democrats and Republicans is a far bigger short-term threat to the US economy than a slower pace of quantitative easing or the withdrawal of monetary stimulus at some point in the future. The danger is that a failure to reach agreement will trigger across the board spending cuts under the sequestration agreement reached between the White House and Capitol Hill in the summer of 2011. The combination of spending cuts and the higher payroll taxes that came in at the start of the year will lead to lower demand and higher unemployment. Financial markets will freak out, and the response from the Fed will be \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 further monetary stimulus. Wall Street is convinced it could stop taking the drugs any time it likes. But don't all junkies say that? The fact is that nobody knows for sure how this will all play out.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Why has the UK been stripped of its AAA rating? Moody's said the main reason was the evidence that Britain's economic growth would remain sluggish for a few years. The slower-than-expected recovery has made it hard for George Osborne to meet his own deficit reduction targets. A debilitating debt pile meant the UK was less able to deal with potential economic or financial shocks. On a more positive note, the agency said a combination of political will and underlying economic strengths would, in time, allow the government to reduce the debt burden. Why has the downgrade happened now? The timing was a surprise: most economists were expecting the rating agencies to wait for the budget on 21 March before showing their hand. But Moody's decided to move because of the UK's \"high and rising debt burden\", as made clear by the public finances data published last week. Are the other agencies likely to follow? Moody's has placed the UK's rating on a \"stable footing\" but Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's have it under review for a potential downgrade. Fitch is expected to jump first: economists predict a UK downgrade within two weeks of the budget. Standard &amp; Poor's might wait longer, being the last to put the rating under review last December. Some economists think it may not act until next year. What will it mean for the budget? The chancellor said the downgrade had redoubled his resolve to deliver his recovery plan, but the news will add to tensions in the coalition . The Liberal Democrats have so far remained publicly united behind Osborne, but some have spoken privately about concerns that Plan A is not working. Growing evidence to that effect will pile on the pressure for the chancellor to ease off on austerity measures and loosen the purse strings to invest in growth. Does it matter? Yes and no. It matters enormously to Osborne, who pinned his credibility on keeping the AAA rating. But the financial markets have been expecting this, so traders have already factored in much of the impact. The news will put pressure on the pound, which has been falling against the dollar all year, and that will drive petrol prices higher, as oil is traded in dollars. Economists predict a 2-3% rise over the next few months. What will mean for interest rates? The government's borrowing costs have been rising since the third quarter of last year, but that is largely due to rising inflation and an improving outlook in the eurozone, which diminishes the appeal of the UK as a safe haven. Economists do not expect borrowing costs to move much as a result of the downgrade, because investors tend to take their own view on a country's ability to pay its debts, rather than rely on the rating agencies. What's more, there are so few economies left with an AAA rating from all three agencies, investors have very little choice of \"safe havens\". What countries are still rated triple-A by all three agencies? The only countries left with a gold-plated rating from all three agencies are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. But the UK is in good company with this downgrade, which puts it on a level with France and the US. Josephine Moulds",

      "body": "<p><strong>Why has the UK been stripped of its AAA rating?</strong></p> <p>Moody's said the main reason was the evidence that Britain's economic growth would remain sluggish for a few years. The slower-than-expected recovery has made it hard for George Osborne to meet his own deficit reduction targets. A debilitating debt pile meant the UK was less able to deal with potential economic or financial shocks. On a more positive note, the agency said a combination of political will and underlying economic strengths would, in time, allow the government to reduce the debt burden.</p> <p><strong>Why has the downgrade happened now?</strong></p> <p>The timing was a surprise: most economists were expecting the rating agencies to wait for the budget on 21 March before showing their hand. But Moody's decided to move because of the UK's \"high and rising debt burden\", as made clear by the public finances data published last week.</p> <p><strong>Are the other agencies likely to follow?</strong></p> <p>Moody's has placed the UK's rating on a \"stable footing\" but Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's have it under review for a potential downgrade. Fitch is expected to jump first: economists predict a UK downgrade within two weeks of the budget. Standard &amp; Poor's might wait longer, being the last to put the rating under review last December. Some economists think it may not act until next year.</p> <p><strong>What will it mean for the budget?</strong></p> <p>The chancellor said the downgrade had redoubled his resolve to deliver his recovery plan, but the news will add to tensions in the coalition . The Liberal Democrats have so far remained publicly united behind Osborne, but some have spoken privately about concerns that Plan A is not working. Growing evidence to that effect will pile on the pressure for the chancellor to ease off on austerity measures and loosen the purse strings to invest in growth.</p> <p><strong>Does it matter?</strong></p> <p>Yes and no. It matters enormously to Osborne, who pinned his credibility on keeping the AAA rating. But the financial markets have been expecting this, so traders have already factored in much of the impact. The news will put pressure on the pound, which has been falling against the dollar all year, and that will drive petrol prices higher, as oil is traded in dollars. Economists predict a 2-3% rise over the next few months.</p> <p><strong>What will mean for interest rates? </strong></p> <p>The government's borrowing costs have been rising since the third quarter of last year, but that is largely due to rising inflation and an improving outlook in the eurozone, which diminishes the appeal of the UK as a safe haven. Economists do not expect borrowing costs to move much as a result of the downgrade, because investors tend to take their own view on a country's ability to pay its debts, rather than rely on the rating agencies. What's more, there are so few economies left with an AAA rating from all three agencies, investors have very little choice of \"safe havens\".</p> <p><strong>What countries are still rated triple-A by all three agencies?</strong></p> <p>The only countries left with a gold-plated rating from all three agencies are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. But the UK is in good company with this downgrade, which puts it on a level with France and the US.</p> <p><strong>Josephine Moulds</strong></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Several of the world's leading food companies are breaching an industry code limiting the promotion of breast milk substitutes to mothers with babies under six months old, according to a new report by a leading aid charity. A survey for Save the Children found that care professionals in Pakistan were being targeted by breast milk substitute companies. The charity said it had also found evidence of \"questionable marketing practices\" in China. Research firm Gallup interviewed 2,400 mothers and 1,200 health workers across Pakistan and found that a third of all available information relating to infant feeding was sponsored by commercial companies, in violation of the Interagency Group on Breastfeeding Monitoring code. The code was agreed in 1981 following widespread concern about the promotion of baby milk formula in the developing world. Gallup reported: \"Many items were giving misleading information and were promoting bottle-feeding in some ways. The findings suggest that the code is being violated in significant ways by companies in Pakistan, which try to influence mothers through interpersonal communication, advertisements and endorsement by health professionals.\" Save The Children has amassed a powerful coalition of celebrities to back its breastfeeding campaign. Actress Isla Fisher, musician and model Myleene Klass and newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky have all helped publicise the report. Last week Victoria Beckham pledged support in a tweet to her 5.4 million Twitter followers. Gallup found almost a fifth of health professionals in Pakistan had received a free gift from a breast milk substitute manufacturer. A further 10% reported being given free samples not just for the substitute but for follow-on formula milk, baby food and bottles and teats. Most of the gifts were stationery such as pens and prescription pads, sometimes branded, items which help health professionals reduce their own costs. There are also anecdotal claims that some midwives were given trips to Mecca, though it is not clear which firms are involved. Two subsidiaries of Swiss giant Nestl\u00e9 and French producer Danone, both named in the report, are the subject of an online petition calling on them to \"stop any conduct that undermines breastfeeding\". The petition has had almost 8,000 signatures. Save The Children said it would be raising the issue at the firms' annual meetings in the coming weeks. Food companies see Asia as a major market for breast milk substitute, an industry already worth \u00a316bn worldwide, and set to grow by 31% in the next three years. In east Asia and the Pacific, the number of breastfeeding mothers has fallen from 45% in 2006 to 29% in 2012. This is due in part, says Save the Children, to inappropriate marketing practices by some breast milk substitute companies. The charity also blames the decline on traditional practices that eschew the use of breast milk, and a severe shortage of midwives and health workers in the developing world. \"Any marketing practices that break the international code could, we believe, undermine breastfeeding and therefore risk children's health,\" said Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save the Children. \"We must act to ensure that these companies always stick to the code. In addition we are asking all manufacturers to change the prominence of the labelling on their products telling people that breastfeeding is the most effective way of protecting the health of their child. We would like to see this cover a third of the packaging.\" The decline in breastfeeding is a major concern for aid agencies. They say that the use of breast milk substitutes brings heightened risks of contamination from unsterilised water. In a new report, Superfood for Babies, the charity claims that if babies receive colostrum, the mother's first milk, within an hour of birth, it kickstarts infants' immune systems, making them three times more likely to survive. It also claims that, if the mother continues breastfeeding for six months, a child growing up in the developing world is up to 15 times less likely to die from killer diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea. A spokesman for Danone said: \"Infant formula is the only safe, legal alternative to breastfeeding and we believe an increase in the size of the warning label is counterproductive, in that it would send mixed messages to parents and potentially confuse them about which milks can be used safely for babies. Our products are safe and popular because they meet a real need for mums who choose to bottle feed. All of our infant formulas carry warning labels and meet strict legislative rules, and our customer communications reinforce the benefits of breastfeeding. Our priority is to standby mums and support them in their choices.\" Nestl\u00e9 said: \"While we agree there is still work to be done to improve infant feeding practices and promote breastfeeding around the world, we believe Nestl\u00e9 already has in place the main elements recommended in the report for improving breast milk substitute industry practices.\"",

      "bodyText": "Faustian pacts are not a good idea. On assuming office in 2010 the coalition entered into a pact with the Bank of England and the financial markets which ranks as one of the most ill-conceived ventures in economic policy by any British government since the second world war. It was to be deficit reduction \u2013 indeed the elimination of the so-called \"structural\" deficit \u2013 by 2015, in return for supportive monetary (including exchange rate) policy from the Bank of England and the enthusiastic backing of the financial markets. The sine qua non as the criterion for success of this policy and pact was to be a marked improvement in the pace of economic recovery. The chancellor, George Osborne, made a bad start by raising VAT \u2013 a \u00a312bn blow to consumer spending, with additional multiplier effects. The economy the incoming government inherited was recovering, albeit slowly. But the combination of the perverse increase in taxation (knocking almost 1% off gross domestic product per annum), and the impact of the austerity programme was sufficient to stop the recovery in its tracks. This added to the deflationary impact of higher import prices arising from the massive \u2013 but necessary \u2013 devaluation of the pound in which the Treasury and the Bank of England had acquiesced. Then there have been all the other depressing influences on real incomes of which the governor, Sir Mervyn King, recently complained. I should emphasise that paradoxically, an increase in energy prices can be inflationary in that it affects the general price level and deflationary in that, via the impact on real incomes, it has a depressing effect on spending power and therefore economic activity. Thus the monetary policy committee can be criticised by purists for not hitting the official inflation target of 2%, yet praised for not taking its brief too literally, and aggravating the depression. For depression it is: in common with the redoubtable Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Affairs I have regarded the term depression appropriate to a situation where output continues to remain well below its previous peak, let alone the 15% or so by which it is below what the historical trend would indicate. In a paper which I recommend to all (\"How to Restore Growth and Cut the Deficit, The Policy Consequences of Revived Keynesianism, Lombard Street Research\") the economist Christopher Smallwood reminds us of Keynes's definition of depression: \"a chronic condition of subnormal activity without any marked tendency either towards recovery or towards complete collapse\". Although things are pretty bad, we have certainly avoided complete collapse \u2013 so far! The role of Gordon Brown and others in \"saving the world\" in 2008-09 was vital in preventing disaster then. Central bankers since had either read or heard about Liaquat Ahamed's book Lords of Finance about how their predecessors got it so wrong in the 1920s and 1930s. Through quantitative easing \u2013 open market operations to offset a private sector credit crunch by easing monetary conditions \u2013 the central banks have stopped the rot. Quantitative easing was urged way back by Keynes in order to lower interest rates. But it was when monetary policy was ineffective \u2013 like \"pushing on a string\" \u2013 that Keynes advocated what have come to be known as \"Keynesian\" policies \u2013 the use of fiscal policy (government spending) \u2013 to revive activity. Unfortunately, under the Faustian pact we have witnessed a double whammy: fiscal policy being used to reduce government spending when the economy is already depressed. And a monetary policy that has been pushing on a string. As Smallwood points out, the Treasury and Bank drew the wrong conclusion from the apparent success of the combination of fiscal contraction and monetary expansion in the 1980s and 1990s. \"In both cases, the contractionary impact of tax rises and spending cuts was counterbalanced by substantial falls in interest rates, and of the sterling exchange rate at a time when our export markets were growing,\" he writes. Exports and investment took up the slack left by budgetary cuts. This time there was not much further for interest rates to fall. Indeed, banks were widening their margins and many borrowers did not feel the intended effects. For some, interest rates actually rose. Moreover, despite the more competitive pound, the sluggishness of our main markets prevented an export boom. George Osborne cannot bear to admit he has been wrong, blames the Bank, and produces a Canadian ex machina in the shape of Mark Carney. And so far from pleasing the financial markets with this austerity programme, he finds they are more concerned about lack of growth, or continuing depression. Indeed the markets showed signs of incipient panic when they learned last week that King himself wanted more quantitative easing at the last meeting of the MPC. Now, following recent work on the operation of \"fiscal multipliers\" in the US, Smallwood argues that a switch to a policy of fiscal expansion is the only way out. The multiplier was a discovery of the economist Richard Kahn's, which Keynes adopted. Normally economists think of additional public spending or tax cuts having \"multiplier\" effects, as the person or institution in receipt of extra funds spends them in a way that boosts the incomes and spending of others. Similarly, higher investment produces what economists call \"accelerator effects\". But at present we have very damaging negative multiplier effects, in which budget cuts lead to obvious hardship, to further reductions in people's ready cash and consequent social problems. Smallwood argues convincingly that fiscal policy needs, selectively, to be put into reverse. \"A properly designed fiscal stimulus could restore growth, at the same time generating powerful tax flow-backs from (a) national income (multiplier effects); (b) higher private investment (accelerator effects); and (c) improved long-term growth potential as a result of increased investment.\" There is a huge range of potential infrastructure projects out there. They can pay for themselves. The only way out of this mess is a complete reversal of fiscal policy. It would be seriously ironic if the financial markets ended up punishing this country for the unintended consequences of a Faustian pact that was meant to please them. The ratings agencies have already started.",
