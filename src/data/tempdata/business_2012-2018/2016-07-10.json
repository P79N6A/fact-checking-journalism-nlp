      "bodyText": "The chancellor, George Osborne, will urge US investors not to turn their backs on Britain as he begins a world tour aimed at building new trade ties outside the European Union. Osborne will meet senior figures from Wall Street in New York on Monday during the first of several missions to major economies to discuss the ramifications of Brexit on trade links. \u201cBritain and the US have been at the forefront of open trade in the last 200 years and pursuing a stronger relationship with our biggest trading partners is now a top priority,\u201d the chancellor said. Osborne hopes to use the New York visit to present the referendum vote as a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d for US investors to forge an even stronger relationship with Britain, the Treasury said in a statement. The US is already the largest single destination for British goods, making up 17% of exports at a value of \u00a388bn in 2014. \u201cWhile Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU clearly presents economic challenges, we now have to do everything we can to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to do business,\u201d said Osborne. The chancellor has already pledged to cut the corporation tax rate to 15% or lower in a bid to boost the country\u2019s attractiveness to foreign firms. He said his \u201cmessage to the world is that Britain may be leaving the EU but we are not quitting the world\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to be a beacon for free trade, democracy and security, more open to the world than ever.\u201d Osborne\u2019s New York trip begins a gruelling schedule of trade missions, with the chancellor set to lead one to Singapore and China next week. He will also welcome the US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, to London this week, meet the heads of Britain\u2019s biggest banks, and travel to Brussels for discussions with other EU finance ministers. Last week the chancellor met Chinese officials in London, including ambassador Liu Xiaoming, for talks about future trade relations ahead of the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Chengdu later this month. He also spoke to Paul Ryan, speaker of the US House of Representatives, twice last week, according to the Treasury. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, is also making overtures to major economies about potential trade deals, travelling to India last week for preliminary talks with government officials. The discussions kicked off a schedule of trips to the US, China, Japan and South Korea over the next few months. The government has said it plans to hire up to 300 staff in a bid to address a shortage of trade negotiators capable of forging closer economic ties with dozens of other countries.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of workers on the national living wage are set for smaller than expected pay rises by the end of the decade after the EU referendum, according to a thinktank. The \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced by the chancellor, George Osborne, is set to rise more slowly because it is linked to average worker earnings, which are now expected to come under pressure following the referendum. The real-terms value of the wage by 2020 could be up to 40p an hour lower than the \u00a38.31 predicted before the EU vote, according to the report by the Resolution Foundation. The minimum pay rate of \u00a37.20 an hour for over-25s was introduced by Osborne in April after he said: \u201cBritain deserves a pay rise.\u201d The rate is designed to gradually increase over the next four years and initial estimates had suggested it could reach \u00a39 an hour by 2020. But the thinktank found there is increasing uncertainty about the outlook for earnings. This will have a major knock-on effect on the national living wage, it says. The national living wage aims to reach 60% of a typical (over-25) worker\u2019s hourly wage by 2020. The Resolution Foundation expects 4.5 million employees to benefit from the national living wage in 2016, rising to 6 million \u2013 or 23% of all employees \u2013 in 2020. However, wage growth has stalled recently, with analysts citing a number of reasons. These include a lack of job-to-job moves and employer reluctance to increase pay while inflation is so low and the economic outlook is unclear. Conor D\u2019Arcy, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBrexit is likely to reshape the landscape in which many low-paying sectors operate.\u201d According to an Ipsos Mori poll carried out for the thinktank, one in seven firms have already cut jobs, reduced staff hours or slowed recruitment after the national living wage\u2019s introduction in April. About 35% of the 500 businesses polled said their wage bill had increased as a result of the wage. Of those businesses affected, 36% responded by increasing prices and 29% by taking lower profits. The Resolution Foundation said such short-term responses would have to be replaced by changes in behaviour over the medium-to-long term. One in seven firms have already invested more in training and 12% have spent more on technology to improve productivity. The Resolution Foundation said such approaches are important in making the national living wage a success and tackling the UK\u2019s wider productivity problems. But the survey also found 14% of firms had used fewer workers, offered fewer hours to staff or slowed recruitment. In addition, 8% had reduced other aspects of their staff reward package, such as paid breaks, overtime or bank holiday pay. The survey results counter evidence that high-profile companies, including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and B&amp;Q, clawed back staff benefits after the introduction of the national living wage. D\u2019Arcy said: \u201cEncouragingly, evidence of workers seeing their hours cut or even losing their jobs has so far been relatively limited. The challenge now is for firms to continue to respond positively to the national living wage, particularly by raising productivity.\u201d",

Spending on transport and communication, which includes flight bookings and cars, slid 4.2% year on year in June after a 5.5% decline in May. This contributed to a weak rise in consumer spending of 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016, according to data from credit card company Visa. Sales growth at hotels, restaurants and bars rose by 3.3% in June, less than half the pace of the near-7% rise in May, as more cautious consumers chose to watch the Euro 2016 football tournament from the sofa instead of the pub. Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa, said: \u201cWith the [referendum] result coming late in the month, this report doesn\u2019t give the full picture but there\u2019s a clear trend over recent months showing a slowdown in overall growth. The index shows that discretionary spending has been the worst affected area.\u201d He said industry reports of new car sales falling in June provided further evidence that people are holding back on big-ticket purchases in the face of economic and political uncertainty around the EU vote. Visa\u2019s figures come after market researcher GfK recorded the biggest fall in consumer confidence for 21 years, in a one-off poll after the referendum on 23 June. Earlier this week, the group, which has been monitoring UK consumer confidence since the 1970s, said measures of confidence about the economic outlook, people\u2019s personal finances and big purchases, had all fallen. The accountants BDO also published a report last week suggesting there was an immediate drop-off in sales after the leave vote. It also revealed that last month marked the weakest June performance for the high street in more than a decade. Marks &amp; Spencer reported its biggest fall in clothing sales in more than a decade on Thursday as its new chief executive, Steve Rowe, said confidence had weakened in the run-up to the EU referendum. That same day, retailer Sports Direct said it had seen a drop-off in sales since the referendum and profits would come under pressure from the lower value of the pound. Visa noted that growth among clothing and footwear sales slumped to just 0.1% year on year in June compared with a 4.3% rise in May.",

      "bodyText": "The UK food and drink industry is calling for the sugar tax to be mothballed as manufacturers face a shortage of workers, cost inflation and weak consumer confidence since the Brexit vote. \u201cThe whole thing should be paused,\u201d said Ian Wright, the director general of industry lobby group the Food and Drink Federation (FDF), whose members include the makers of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Tango. \u201cConfidence in the consumer goods market is very fragile and the government has promised not to impose any new burden on industry.\u201d The food and drink sector, which accounts for 16% of UK manufacturing by turnover, has been rocked by the Brexit vote as the collapse in the value of the pound increases the cost of imported ingredients and a question mark hangs over the status of its large migrant workforce. Of the 400,000 people employed in UK food and drink manufacturing, one in four are from other EU countries. Wright said the industry needed \u201ccast-iron assurances\u201d from the government that its access to a \u201cflexible workforce, with a wide range of skills and capabilities, as well as a strong work ethic\u201d would continue. Due to the sector\u2019s ageing workforce, it needs to recruit 130,000 new skilled workers by 2024. \u201cThe government must develop a new migration policy that ensures manufacturers have continued access to the workers we need to address a looming skills gap \u2013 and the drive for future innovation to support the UK\u2019s competitive advantage,\u201d Wright told FDF members at its conference last week. The sugar tax was greeted with hostility by the industry and Wright argues that the levy, introduced by the chancellor in the budget, will be undermined by flawed analysis of its impact. \u201cAll the work that has been done is from the assumption that we are part of the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very least, the consultation has to restart.\u201d There is also a risk that once the UK leaves the EU it could be flooded with imports that would undermine the tax\u2019s efficacy, says Wright. \u201cIt will be very worthwhile to smuggle Coca-Cola into the UK because there will be a market for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a bad policy and will not have the impact it is intended to have.\u201d The FDF also wants the apprenticeships levy put on hold. \u201cWe have raised serious questions about both policies,\u201d said Wright. \u201cBoth would add unwelcome additional burdens on hard-pressed industry at a moment of crisis.\u201d The two-tier sugar levy, which is due to take effect in April 2018, will force companies that produce or import soft drinks with significant added sugar to pay one rate for drinks containing at least 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher rate for those with more than 8g per 100ml. Jon Woods, the boss of Coca-Cola\u2019s UK business, also reiterated his view that the sugar tax should be dropped, arguing it would force up prices and become a distraction. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s bad for business at a time when we should be freeing our businesses from red tape and bureaucracy,\u201d he said. Coca-Cola argues getting Britons to drink lower or no-calorie drinks is the way forward. Last week it used singer Rita Ora to front the launch of a \u00a310m advertising push for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The links between sugar and sugary drinks in particular and Britain\u2019s obesity crisis are well documented. They account for 29% of 11 to 18-year-olds\u2019 daily sugar intake. Kawther Hashem, a nutritionist at the charity Action on Sugar, believes the tax will have an impact. \u201cThese drinks are contributing a lot of sugar and calories to young people\u2019s diets,\u201d said Hashem. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if manufacturers will be able to swallow the cost or will pass it on to consumers. Generally people are responsive to price \u2013 that is why so much food is sold on promotion.\u201d Health campaigners are eagerly awaiting the publication of outgoing prime minister David Cameron\u2019s delayed childhood obesity strategy. It was supposed to be published last year and is expected imminently. \u201cWe are concerned about the whole obesity strategy because there is so much uncertainty about all government policies at the moment,\u201d added Hashem. The soft drinks industry levy was confirmed in the Queen\u2019s speech, with the formal consultation expected to start soon. \u201cThe soft drinks industry levy is a major step forward in our efforts to tackle childhood obesity; treating obesity and its consequences costs the taxpayer \u00a35.1bn every year,\u201d said a spokesman for the Treasury. \u201cThe levy will be charged on soft drinks because they are the main source of added sugar in children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 diets, many with no intrinsic nutritional value.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Helge Lund, the former chief executive of BG, was paid \u00a35.5m for his 12-month tenure at the oil exploration and production company, which was taken over by Shell earlier this year. The figure for the short period he worked for BG in 2015 does not include \u00a39.7m of shares he received in February 2016, when the takeover took place after being approved by shareholders \u2013 triggering the share payout from the BG scheme. The \u00a35.5m figure is contained in BG\u2019s annual report filed at Companies House last week, which showed that the Norwegian \u2013 who joined BG in March 2015 just weeks before Shell tabled its \u00a347bn bid \u2013 had his \u00a31.4m salary topped up with other payments for 2015. The BG annual report shows that he received a relocation allowance of \u00a3906,000 \u2013 almost double the \u00a3480,000 previously announced by the company. He also received a \u00a32.5m annual bonus and a \u00a3402,000 contribution to his pension. Lund was hired from Norway\u2019s Statoil to overhaul the underperforming company but his tenure at BG was dominated by his pay. The company cut his signing-on deal to \u00a310.6m rather than \u00a312m, even before the Shell deal had been announced, to head off a row with shareholders. The row intensified when BG agreed to be bought by Shell only weeks after he joined. Sir John Hood, the non-executive director who chaired the remuneration committee, said in the annual report that when pay deals were considered for 2015, the committee had taken into account the \u201cunusually long period\u201d between the Shell deal being announced and it being completed. Hood wrote: \u201c2015 was Helge Lund\u2019s first year as chief executive, and during a period of prolonged uncertainty for BG and its employees, Mr Lund continued to lead high standards of safety, project delivery and operational performance, while also maintaining staff morale. Despite the very challenging external environment, BG delivered strongly in all these areas.\u201d During the period when the deal was announced, the price of oil fell from $65 a barrel to $36. It led to questions about the terms of the deal, which was based on 383p cash plus 0.4454 of a Shell \u201cB\u201d share for every BG share. \u201cUnder Mr Lund\u2019s leadership, BG grew production by 16% on 2014,\u201d Hood said, saying the committee had also reviewed the pay deals against this backdrop. Lund received 951,138 BG shares, worth \u00a39.7m, when the deal completed in February, Shell said. This includes three tranches: 733,954 shares of a \u00a31.1m share award he received in May 2015, some 168,208 from a 756,938 award of shares he also received in May and 48,976 he received to buy him out of shares from his previous employer. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2016 to correct the length of Helge Lund\u2019s tenure at BG.",

The pound could come under more pressure this week when the Bank of England has the first opportunity since the referendum <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/10/bank-of-england-considers-interest-rate-cut-to-tackle-brexit-crisis\">to cut interest rates</a>.</p> <p>The movement has influenced the way shares have traded in the past two weeks. The FTSE 100 index is trading higher than it was before the referendum; the FTSE 250 index, made up of the next tier of companies, has been as much as 10% lower. </p> <p>Eoin Murray, head of investments at the fund managers Hermes, said: \u201cIn the FTSE 100, 60 or 70% of the revenues of the companies come from outside the UK.

      "bodyText": "While people jetting off for their summer holidays are worrying about a reduction in their spending power as a result of the weaker pound in the wake of the Brexit vote, the plunge in sterling is also posing questions for business executives. Company results published last week illustrate the diverse impact that the fall in the pound to a 31-year low is having. Shares in the pest controller Rentokil rocketed to a 12-year high after the company, which generates 90% of its revenue overseas, said the slide in sterling would boost its profits. But retailers such as Sports Direct and Marks &amp; Spencer said they faced challenges because they needed to buy dollars, which now cost more, to purchase clothing abroad. Sterling\u2019s value has become the key barometer for the economic impact of the result of the 23 June referendum: it raced to $1.50 when the polls closed amid expectations of a vote for remain, and quickly sank to about $1.30 when those expectations were not met. The pound could come under more pressure this week when the Bank of England has the first opportunity since the referendum to cut interest rates. The movement has influenced the way shares have traded in the past two weeks. The FTSE 100 index is trading higher than it was before the referendum; the FTSE 250 index, made up of the next tier of companies, has been as much as 10% lower. Eoin Murray, head of investments at the fund managers Hermes, said: \u201cIn the FTSE 100, 60 or 70% of the revenues of the companies come from outside the UK. The FTSE 250 has been tracking the fall in sterling \u2013 that is a much better gauge [of the UK economy] to my mind.\u201d Associated British Food (ABF), which owns Primark and has a sugar trading arm, said in its results last week that overseas profits in the final quarter would be better than expected once translated into sterling, because of the impact of sterling\u2019s fall against the euro.

Sports Direct said it too would take a knock from the fall in sterling as it had not taken any steps to protect itself from volatility in the currency \u2013 known as hedging \u2013 for the 2017 financial year. The currency effect is one of the reasons HSBC has defied the drastic drop in share prices that have been inflicted on other banks since the Brexit vote. Its shares are higher since the referendum not only because it is not entirely focused on the UK but also because it reports results in dollars.

      "bodyText": "A plane with seats wide enough to accommodate the larger girth of modern flyers is set to be one of the stars of this year\u2019s Farnborough airshow. Bombardier\u2019s C-Series CS100 will make a demonstration flight at the annual aviation festival, which takes place this week. The aircraft, which has wings designed and developed in Belfast with help from a \u00a3180m investment from the UK government, features larger seats than most commercial passenger jets. The window and aisle seats are 18.5in (47cm) wide, while the middle seat is 19in wide, an upgrade on older competitor aircraft such as the Airbus A319 (18 in) or the Boeing 737 (17.3in). The larger seats will help airlines who buy the aircraft deal with an increase in the average size of passengers over the past few decades. The C-Series also features bigger windows, an extra-wide aisle and larger hand luggage bins. Ross Mitchell, Bombardier\u2019s vice-president of commercial operations said airlines had requested a plane with wider seats to offer more comfort for today\u2019s flyers. \u201cWe went to airlines and asked them what the appropriate sizes were. They said 18-19 inches because it gives people more room in the seat. Airlines were looking to have an option with more comfort,\u201d said Mitchell. He added that Bombardier believes airlines will order around 7000 aircraft in the C-Series size category over 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do quite well,\u201d he said. Aviation expert John Strickland of JLS Consulting said that while the C-Series offers wider seats, not all airlines would choose to take up that option. \u201dIf they believe that offering better comfort will help them to attract customers who are willing to pay for the privilege of more comfort they\u2018ll do that.\u201d \u201cIf they think they\u2019ll have price pressure and have to pack in more seats, they\u2019ll make that judgment.\u201d Bombardier, based in Canada, delivered the first of the new 125-seat aircraft to Swiss International Air Lines last week and a C-Series decked out in the airline\u2019s livery is due to fly at Farnborough next Sunday. Airshows such as Farnborough are seen as opportunities to show off new designs and secure billion-dollar orders from airlines. Airlines have ordered 370 of the C-Series aircraft so far but there have been concerns in the aviation industry that uncertainty after the EU referendum will limit the number of deals signed this year. But Mitchell said Bombardier was not reliant on sealing deals at Farnborough. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on the show, it\u2019s not the place where we roll out orders,\u201d he said. The first CS100 aircraft is scheduled to enter service with Swiss on 15 July, making its maiden commercial flight from Zurich to Paris-Charles de Gaulle. Bombardier says the plane can save airlines up to $13m (\u00a310m) an aircraft thanks to up-to-the-minute aerodynamics and lightweight materials, which it says make it up to five tonnes lighter than competitors. It also boasts reduced emissions and noise, thanks to engines designed by Pratt &amp; Whitney specifically for the aircraft. The aircraft\u2019s development has proved problematic, running behind schedule and coming in over budget with an overall cost of $5.4bn. The huge expense is among the factors responsible for 7,000 job cuts revealed by Bombardier earlier this year, including more than 1,000 in Belfast, as the company seeks to stem losses. Strickland said the plane\u2019s first year in service would be critical in determining whether the it becomes a commercial success in the long term. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long hard haul for them. It\u2019s several years late and they\u2019ve had all sorts of setbacks with it. \u201cUntil recently orders were lighter than they would have wished, although they\u2019ve just secured a large order from [US carrier] Delta, which is an important win for them. \u201cThey\u2019ll be out to prove the aircraft can deliver what it says on the tin when it goes into service this year.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England considers interest rate cut to tackle Brexit crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will consider the first interest rate cut for more than seven years this week, as it seeks to contain the economic fallout from the Brexit vote. Some City economists predict that with consumer confidence battered and businesses nervous about spending and hiring, the Bank will want to shore up sentiment by reducing interest rates further from a record low of 0.5%. The Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney has dropped heavy hints of a summer rate cut but he and fellow rate setters may want to see more evidence of the Brexit vote\u2019s impact before acting. The nine-member monetary policy committee will announce its decision on Thursday at midday and experts say it has a range of options - including doing nothing for now. Forecasts for what policymakers will vote to do in the wake of the referendum vary from keeping rates on hold to slashing them by 50 basis points to zero. Some say the committee will go for a smaller 25 basis point cut, leaving itself the option to cut again in August when it also publishes new economic forecasts and will have a better sense of how the EU referendum result has affected the UK. Carney laid the groundwork for a rate cut in a carefully orchestrated market intervention a week after the Brexit vote wrongfooted investors. Speaking as the pound was plumbing 31-year lows and shares in banks and housebuilders tumbled, Carney said his personal view was that \u201csome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d. That marked a complete turnaround from the pre-referendum pattern of Bank policymakers seeking to guide markets on when rates might rise again, after more than seven years at 0.5%. Official borrowing costs were last cut in March 2009 when the UK was in recession and they have been on hold ever since. Philip Shaw, an economist at City bank Investec, said: \u201cThis state of policy inaction is about to change. The question ... has become not if the MPC will ease but what, how much and when.\u201d The Bank has also taken steps to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of lending to households and businesses by relaxing regulatory requirements on the banking sector. But with interest rates already at record lows and following a money-printing exercise, known as quantitative easing, questions remain over how much ammunition the Bank has left to help the economy. Economists at investment bank JP Morgan said: \u201cA difficult issue lies in the background. Can an independent central bank like the BoE/MPC state publicly that it does not believe it has the tools to deliver on its mandate?\u201d A poll of economists by Reuters last week suggested the Bank would choose to wait until August to cut interest rates or use other monetary policy tools such as quantitative easing, where the Bank pumps money into the financial system by acquiring bonds from financial institutions in the hope that they will put the proceeds back into the UK economy. Nearly two-thirds of 52 economists polled said interest rates would be held steady on Thursday. Seventeen predicted a cut to 0.25% and another two said rates would be slashed to zero. In his speech debating imminent rate cuts, Carney said that the economy was already showing signs of strain. He also highlighted the legacy of previous shocks that meant businesses and households were suffering from \u201ceconomic post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d. Business and consumer surveys suggest that confidence has dropped in the wake of the referendum. A closely watched consumer confidence index from market researchers GfK last week recorded the biggest drop in sentiment for 21 years, following the Brexit vote.",

      "bodyText": "Quitting has been all the rage ever since the Britain voted to leave the EU. In the space of a fortnight, there have been farewells from prime minister David Cameron, Ukip leader Nigel Farage and thwarted Tory leadership hopeful Boris Johnson. The resignation craze has by no means been confined to politics. England manager Roy Hodgson walked after his team\u2019s humiliating defeat by Minnows Iceland and Chris Evans announced he was stepping down from presenting Top Gear after just one series. Knowing when to go brings a welcome dose of humility to the brash worlds of top-flight politics, sport and TV. Evans, for example, said: \u201cGave it my best shot but sometimes that\u2019s not enough.\u201d Cameron went for the more poetic image of a ship, saying: \u201cI do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\u201d Whether you view the slew of resignations as nobly falling on swords or turning backs on chaos, in each case what unites these quitters is their wealth, and particularly their wealth of opportunity. It\u2019s easy to leap when you have a well-feathered nest to land in. Their luxury of choice is in stark contrast to large parts of the UK population, who are trapped in low-paying, low-satisfaction work and would probably love nothing more than the chance to throw in the towel and try something else. But even when it comes to the opportunity to quit we are a nation of haves and have-nots. There is every chance that Brexit will exacerbate this inequality of choice. In the uncertain times that lie ahead, when the economy will doubtless slow and firms will freeze hiring or even cut jobs, it\u2019s not the rich we should be worried out. The rich will always be OK. Furthermore, by exercising their freedom of choice, it is likely that the rich will further narrow the opportunities available to those less well-off. Take the City. If the big investment banks carry out their threats to desert London now their access to EU markets is at risk, their senior staff will go with them and so will their tax payments, which is a significant chunk of government income. Underscoring how dependent the country has become on the capital\u2019s wealth, a report last week highlighted that London still accounts for the lion\u2019s share of UK tax revenues. The capital generated almost as much tax as the next 37 largest cities combined, according the Centre for Cities thinktank. If London loses its international standing on financial markets, the hit to public coffers will be substantial and that risks serious ramifications for households on lower incomes. An analysis before the referendum that struggled for publicity amid the mud slinging came from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr). Assessing the potential impact on government revenues and welfare spending, the thinktank warned that low-income households were likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the Brexit costs. If Niesr is right, that will mean a further squeeze on living standards after years of austerity and lacklustre wage growth. Underemployment \u2013 people working fewer hours than they would like \u2013 also remains high and millions of people are in insecure work where they do not have regular hours or predictable shifts. Paris-based thinktank the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) summed up the post-crisis experience of many workers across advanced economies last week as \u201cBack at work, but out of pocket\u201d. But it\u2019s not just wages the OECD is worried about for the UK, because employment is under threat too. It warned that Brexit risked the UK economy\u2019s ability to continue creating jobs. Chiming with these findings, business surveys since the referendum have already signalled that some firms are holding off hiring permanent staff and that others are considering cutting their workforces. None of that will bring hope to anyone thinking of jumping ship. Long before the referendum, job-to-job moves were on a downward trajectory in the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has been looking into low job mobility, warning that the drop in the rate at which people move between jobs since the financial crisis in 2008 was stymying the careers and pay progression of young people in particular. Unsurprisingly, this dearth of opportunity in the jobs market has gone hand in hand with people\u2019s skills being mismatched to their roles, That appears to be hitting job satisfaction. Key measures of national happiness stagnated in the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics last week, among them people\u2019s sense that what they do in life is worthwhile. It was the first time since data was first gathered in 2011 that there was no year-on-year improvement in that measure, although there was an uptick in overall life satisfaction. Of course, advocates for a self-starting approach to this lack of opportunity will tell the disenchanted to set up their own business. No doubt they would cite the startup success stories from downturns past, such as Microsoft being founded in the 1970s and cosmetics company Revlon, which was launched during the 1930s Great Depression. But it is one of the great myths of this post-crisis era that a surge in self-employment has solved people\u2019s problems of low pay and economic insecurity. Sure, a few will make their millions but for many, going it alone means forgoing employee benefits such as pension schemes and sick pay while working round the clock to make ends meet. In some cases, self-employment has led to outright exploitation of workers. Citizens Advice has warned that as many as 460,000 people could be \u201cbogusly self-employed\u201d because unscrupulous employers are compelling staff to be self-employed when they should in fact have employee status. So employers can avoid paying the minimum wage, employers\u2019 national insurance, sick pay, holiday pay and pension contributions but still get the workers they want. Those doing the \u201cself-employed\u201d work end up overly dependent on one paymaster without any of the security of employee status. So much for self-employment being a ticket to freedom. When Farage resigned last week, he said he wanted his life back. Millions of people in insecure work, dead-end jobs or a state of bogus self-employment probably feel the same way too. But quitting simply isn\u2019t an option. That remains the preserve of the few.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "You\u2019ve probably never heard of him, but incoming Asda boss Sean Clarke is said to be the man with his hand wavering over the red button, ready to trigger a supermarket price war to end all price wars. Last week respected HSBC retail analyst David McCarthy put the cat among the pigeons warning that Clarke, installed by his American paymasters Walmart, was gearing up for a summer price war that could \u201cwipe out\u201d rivals\u2019 profits. On publication the note, titled Defcon 1, managed to wipe \u00a31.6bn from the stock market value of listed rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons in a single day\u2019s trading. Clarke, who started his retail career at Asda in 1996, is an unknown quantity albeit with a global supermarket pedigree. He has worked for Walmart for 20 years, serving tours in Japan, Germany, Canada and latterly Walmart China and is being parachuted in to end a long period of underperformance at the retailer\u2019s UK business. His surprise appointment deposed another Clarke (Andy), who had been in charge since 2010 \u2013 a gruelling period characterised by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, unprecedented price deflation and changing shopping habits. While its publicly listed rivals have spent the last two years cutting prices (and profit margins) to win back shoppers, Asda has focused on defending its profitability rather than market share with an efficiency drive that has seen it fall behind rivals in both the quality and availability of its food. Customers have punished Asda for taking this stance, with the retailer nursing a fall in underlying sales that is approaching its second anniversary. It is now the UK\u2019s third-largest grocer after surrendering second place to Sainsbury\u2019s, a swap once considered inconceivable. The changing of the Clarkes, which officially takes place tomorrow, came soon after Walmart International chief David Cheesewright told the Walmart annual investor jamboree in Bentonville, Arkansas that it was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with Asda and it was time to change tack and switch from \u201cprotecting profit to protecting share\u201d. Does that mean a price war? In McCarthy\u2019s note he suggests: \u201cIf Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure.\u201d But why would he do that? It would hurt Asda too. Other experts point out that Asda offers the lowest prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains anyway. Bryan Roberts, analyst at TCC Global points out: \u201cAsda\u2019s been the cheapest for 15 years and it\u2019s obviously not working. Why would being even cheaper work more effectively? It\u2019s not about getting cheaper, it\u2019s about getting people to re-evaluate and revisit Asda.\u201d To win shoppers in China, Clarke (Sean) has had to do more than play the price card as their choice of supermarket is also influenced by concerns such as food quality and freshness. \u201cHe has experience of using messages other than price to drive sales,\u201d says Roberts. Talk of a more intense groceryprice war comes as food retailers gird themselves for the fallout from the Brexit vote. The collapse in the value of the pound is bad news for a country that imports 40% of its food and retailers will have to walk the tightrope of taking a hit on profits by absorbing price rises themselves, or passing cost increases on to price-sensitive shoppers. As if that were not enough for supermarket bosses to wring their hands over, another City broker waded in last week in to argue that Tesco\u2019s shares, currently at 163p, are only really worth 80p because there are too many UK grocery stores as Aldi and Lidl expand and the online crew, Ocado and Amazon Fresh, take share. Up to a third of supermarkets need to close to make the industry more profitable, is the message from analysts at Redburn. It\u2019s not just price that makes us shop where we shop and Asda needs to broaden its appeal beyond \u201cbusy mums on a budget\u201d. Two-thirds of shoppers now frequent the discounters, yet many Britons still turn their noses up at Asda. It has an image problem, not a price problem, it needs to address. For Clarke (Sean) to choose the nuclear price option looks like the road to mutually assured destruction. It\u2019s grim down south The unfortunate commuters of south London and Sussex can from tomorrow plan their lives on a surer basis, according to Southern. The solution, though, involves \u201cpre-cancelling\u201d 341 trains a day and consigning coastal residents to the bus. These are desperate times on Southern, a once unremarkable train service whose extraordinary decline has sent its passengers \u2013 many priced out of London into the suburbs and beyond \u2013 into despair. The management, its reputation shredded, has sought to lay the blame on the unions, which brought industrial action over the role of conductors on new trains. But accusing staff of playing sick does not, unsurprisingly, appear to have won over employees. And the chaos had already been plain to see for commuters, who know that the strikes and staff shortages have only exacerbated deep-rooted problems: problems that include the revelation to MPs last week that Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) only found out how few staff it had when it took over the franchise. Yet GTR has one supporter: the Department for Transport (DfT). The continuing defence by ministers, and refusal to countenance appeals to strip the company of its franchise, no matter how many performance measures it breaches, has fuelled union suspicion that GTR are simply doing the DfT\u2019s dirty work. Union opposition to driver-only operation of doors, a practice GTR is extending, is a stated safety concern, but underlined by the fear that job cuts will inevitably eventually follow. The government doubtless would like to cut staff costs, but the actual problem may run deeper than just money. The rail franchising system is creaking badly. Bidders have been far from plentiful in recent competitions. The totemic, lucrative East Coast franchise has not delivered the anticipated rewards back in private hands. Now, the newly combined Thameslink, Great Northern and Southern mega-franchise that Govia operates is starting to look just too big to manage. For rivals, taking it over might now look about as appealing as a daily commute to the capital from Brighton. Putting up the warning signs The commercial property market is an early-warning radar for the economy. If businesses start pulling out of rental deals to occupy office or shop space, that it is not a good sign for job creation. If property firms pull out of deals to buy buildings or scrap plans for new developments, those are not good signs either. Last week saw a wave of property funds announce that they will stop investors withdrawing their money, which is another warning sign. The funds stopped redemptions because so many investors were looking to get their cash after the European Union referendum. This risks creating a vicious circle. As investors pull their money out of investment funds, those funds are forced to sell assets to hand back the cash, suppressing prices in the market and causing further uncertainty.

      "body": "<p>You\u2019ve probably never heard of him, but incoming Asda boss Sean Clarke is said to be the man with his hand wavering over the red button, ready to trigger a supermarket price war to end all price wars.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/06/supermarket-shares-fall-asda-price-cut-warning\" title=\"\">Last week respected HSBC retail analyst David McCarthy put the cat among the pigeons</a> warning that Clarke, installed by his American paymasters Walmart, was gearing up for a summer price war that could \u201cwipe out\u201d rivals\u2019 profits. On publication the note, titled Defcon 1, managed to wipe \u00a31.6bn from the stock market value of listed rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons in a single day\u2019s trading.</p> <p>Clarke, who started his retail career at Asda in 1996, is an unknown quantity albeit with a global supermarket pedigree. He has worked for Walmart for 20 years, serving tours in Japan, Germany, Canada and latterly Walmart China and is being parachuted in to end a long period of underperformance at the retailer\u2019s UK business. His surprise appointment deposed another Clarke (Andy), who had been in charge since 2010 \u2013 a gruelling period characterised by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl, unprecedented price deflation and changing shopping habits.</p> <p>While its publicly listed rivals have spent the last two years cutting prices (and profit margins) to win back shoppers, Asda has focused on defending its profitability rather than market share with an efficiency drive that has seen it fall behind rivals in both the quality and availability of its food. Customers have punished Asda for taking this stance, with the retailer nursing a fall in underlying sales that is approaching its second anniversary. It is now the UK\u2019s third-largest grocer after surrendering second place to Sainsbury\u2019s, a swap once considered inconceivable.</p> <p>The changing of the Clarkes, which officially takes place tomorrow, came soon after Walmart International chief David Cheesewright told the Walmart annual investor jamboree in Bentonville, Arkansas that it was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with Asda and it was time to change tack and switch from \u201cprotecting profit to protecting share\u201d.</p> <p>Does that mean a price war? In McCarthy\u2019s note he suggests: \u201cIf Asda decided to invest half its margin into price, a competitor reaction could wipe out almost all industry profitability and would force an industry restructure.\u201d</p> <p>But why would he do that? It would hurt Asda too. Other experts point out that Asda offers the lowest prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket chains anyway. Bryan Roberts, analyst at TCC Global points out: \u201cAsda\u2019s been the cheapest for 15 years and it\u2019s obviously not working. Why would being even cheaper work more effectively? It\u2019s not about getting cheaper, it\u2019s about getting people to re-evaluate and revisit Asda.\u201d</p> <p>To win shoppers in China, Clarke (Sean) has had to do more than play the price card as their choice of supermarket is also influenced by concerns such as food quality and freshness. \u201cHe has experience of using messages other than price to drive sales,\u201d says Roberts.</p> <p>Talk of a more intense groceryprice war comes as food retailers gird themselves for the fallout from the Brexit vote. The collapse in the value of the pound is bad news for a country that imports 40% of its food and retailers will have to walk the tightrope of taking a hit on profits by absorbing price rises themselves, or passing cost increases on to price-sensitive shoppers.</p> <p>As if that were not enough for supermarket bosses to wring their hands over, another City broker waded in last week in to argue that Tesco\u2019s shares, currently at 163p, are only really worth 80p because there are too many UK grocery stores as Aldi and Lidl expand and the online crew, Ocado and Amazon Fresh, take share. Up to a third of supermarkets need to close to make the industry more profitable, is the message from analysts at Redburn.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just price that makes us shop where we shop and Asda needs to broaden its appeal beyond \u201cbusy mums on a budget\u201d. Two-thirds of shoppers now frequent the discounters, yet many Britons still turn their noses up at Asda. It has an image problem, not a price problem, it needs to address. For Clarke (Sean) to choose the nuclear price option looks like the road to mutually assured destruction.</p> <h2>It\u2019s grim down south</h2> <p>The unfortunate commuters of south London and Sussex can from tomorrow plan their lives on a surer basis, according to Southern. The solution, though, involves \u201cpre-cancelling\u201d 341 trains a day and consigning coastal residents to the bus.</p> <p>These are desperate times on Southern, a once unremarkable train service whose extraordinary decline has sent its passengers \u2013 many priced out of London into the suburbs and beyond \u2013 into despair. The management, its reputation shredded, has sought to lay the blame on the unions, which brought industrial action over the role of conductors on new trains.</p> <p>But accusing staff of playing sick does not, unsurprisingly, appear to have won over employees. And the chaos had already been plain to see for commuters, who know that the strikes and staff shortages have only exacerbated deep-rooted problems: problems that include the revelation to MPs last week that Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) only found out how few staff it had when it took over the franchise.</p> <p>Yet GTR has one supporter: the Department for Transport (DfT). The continuing defence by ministers, and refusal to countenance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/calls-strip-southern-rail-operator-franchise-govia-thameslink\" title=\"\">appeals to strip the company of its franchise</a>, no matter how many performance measures it breaches, has fuelled union suspicion that GTR are simply doing the DfT\u2019s dirty work. Union opposition to driver-only operation of doors, a practice GTR is extending, is a stated safety concern, but underlined by the fear that job cuts will inevitably eventually follow.</p> <p>The government doubtless would like to cut staff costs, but the actual problem may run deeper than just money. The rail franchising system is creaking badly. Bidders have been far from plentiful in recent competitions. The totemic, lucrative East Coast franchise has not delivered the anticipated rewards back in private hands.</p> <p>Now, the newly combined Thameslink, Great Northern and Southern mega-franchise that Govia operates is starting to look just too big to manage. For rivals, taking it over might now look about as appealing as a daily commute to the capital from Brighton.</p> <h2>Putting up the warning signs</h2> <p>The commercial property market is an early-warning radar for the economy. If businesses start pulling out of rental deals to occupy office or shop space, that it is not a good sign for job creation. If property firms pull out of deals to buy buildings or scrap plans for new developments, those are not good signs either.</p> <p>Last week saw a wave of property funds announce that they will stop investors withdrawing their money, which is another warning sign. The funds stopped redemptions because so many investors were looking to get their cash after the European Union referendum.</p> <p>This risks creating a vicious circle. As investors pull their money out of investment funds, those funds are forced to sell assets to hand back the cash, suppressing prices in the market and causing further uncertainty.</p> <p>The sharp fall in the value of sterling means that commercial property in the UK, particularly in London, is now cheaper for overseas investors. That could be the only thing that protects the sector \u2013 and maybe the economy \u2013 from a Brexit slump.</p>",
