Disappointed customers have been complaining on social media about delays to their orders which have been caused by problems at the retailer\u2019s distribution centre in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, which opened in May last year.

      "bodyText": "Putin gives a speech and the rouble falls. Europe\u2019s central bank boss gives a speech and the stock markets fall. Opec meets in Vienna and the oil price plummets. Japan\u2019s prime minister calls a snap election and the yen\u2019s slide against the dollar accelerates. All these things in the last six weeks of an already fractious year. There are suddenly multiple conflicts being played out in the global markets, conflicts the global game\u2019s usual rules are not built to handle. The first concerns a clear game of beggar thy neighbour between China and Japan. Since 2012 Japan has printed money hand over fist, with the aim of kickstarting economic growth. With growth stalling for a third time in the final quarter of 2014 its premier Shinzo Abe printed more. China perceives this as unfair competition, and with its own growth slowing, it responded in late November with a surprise interest-rate cut. Many see this as the outbreak of a classic currency war, along 1930s lines, where rival economic giants engage in a pointless game of devaluing their own currency \u2013 boosting exports but hitting the spending power of their people \u2013 to their mutual detriment. By hitting each other\u2019s capacity to export, they edge the region towards deglobalisation. The second new dynamic is the game of chicken being played over the oil price between America, Russia and Opec. Oil demand is falling because growth in the emerging markets \u2013 China, Brasil and the like \u2013 is slowing down. Yet supply has risen \u2013 by 11m barrels to 92m barrels per day since the global financial crisis began. America has become the world\u2019s biggest oil producer thanks to the rapid rollout of shale and deep sea oilfields. Since June 2014 the price of a barrel of Brent crude has fallen from $115 to $68 \u2013 and after Opec met in late November and rejected calls to cut production some analysts predicted the price could collapse to $40. Saudi Arabia and the other gulf monarchies were the key players in the decision to keep production high and prices falling \u2013 and few doubt there is politics behind the move. It hurts Russia, Venezuela and Iran. For Saudi Arabia there are scores to settle with both Russia and Iran over their role in crushing the Syrian revolution, and with Venezuela for being Russia\u2019s perpetual Bolivarian cheerleader. As a result, Vladimir Putin has had to admit to his people that a combination of western sanctions and Saudi oil strategy will push Russia into recession next year. At times like this economists resort to game theory, warning sparring countries that, in a game where everybody is trying to shrink something \u2013 whether it be prices or currencies \u2013 everybody loses out. So let\u2019s game it out \u2013 not in the austere language of theory but of the empire-building \u201cgod games\u201d popular on games consoles. Empire A is a rich, stagnant ageing country, paying itself high social benefits but running debts at 250% of its annual output. That is Japan. Empire B is a poor-ish and also ageing country, ruled by a dictatorship, which has achieved high rates of growth and modernisation but has now slowed down. That is China. Empire C is run by a lunatic. It has invaded a neighbouring country twice in 12 months, has its warplanes buzzing a historic foe \u2013 and has a bloated upper-middle class in a state of near panic as its currency tanks. It is more or less totally dependent on the price of oil and other global commodities. I don\u2019t need to name this country, but if you are unlucky enough to be anywhere near it in the computer game, it is making you very worried. Now let\u2019s look at Empire D. If you\u2019d been playing this side in a game set 800 years ago, when it was called the Holy Roman Empire, you\u2019d have been worried about its eternal fractiousness; its ethnic and religious strife \u2013 and the fragility of its governance systems. And if you\u2019ve any sense, you still are: half of its economies are stagnant. This is Europe, and it is the only one of our global players that is not supporting itself by printing money. Finally, Empire E. After marauding across the globe for a century in search of oil it has suddenly become self-sufficient. It has a paralysed governance system and a fractious civil society, but nothing the flickering spectacles on its plasma screens cannot pacify, together with a few tasers. That is America. As long as the game is collaborative, four out of five players can pursue their aims to mutual benefit. Japan can enjoy happy stagnation, China brutalist growth; the EU can stagger from crisis to crisis; America can shoot its own citizens and drone-strike its enemies. Only Russia is in trouble. The real problem comes if the game atmosphere turns overtly competitive. That is, if the players perceive themselves to be fighting over shrinking resources, shrinking growth \u2013 and to be in a game where pure selfishness is the optimum strategy. Think of this this way and the real story of 2014 becomes clear. In 2014 Russia\u2019s perception of its \u201cgame\u201d with both Europe and America has became purely combative. Reluctantly, these other two players recalibrated their stance, while trying to maintain the global rules as collaborative. But in the last quarter of the year, the game has also changed between China and Japan. Europe wants competition with nobody, and its central authorities are paralysed where it matters most: monetary policy. It is an entity modelled on the old, collaborative game rules and unable to conceive of operating without them. If this was a game played in annual turns, the umpire would probably call some kind of time out at Christmas. And in that pause it would be sensible to say: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there are clear signs that the rules of this game are about to invert. Are you completely sure you want to go on to the 2015 turn with the same strategy?\u201d Paul Mason is economics editor at Channel 4 News. Follow him @paulmasonnews",

    "webTitle": "Does the aid bill really show the UK\u2019s commitment to development?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s autumn statement overshadowed two other significant political events. One was the announcement by Gordon Brown that he was stepping down as an MP. The other was the passage of a private member\u2019s bill through the House of Commons enshrining in law the commitment of the UK to spend 0.7% of its annual income on aid. Given the difficulty George Osborne is having making his sums add up, the aid pledge seems extraordinary. The police, the courts, the army, and local government face eye-watering cuts during the next parliament but the budget for overseas development will rise in line with the growth of the economy. There is one final hurdle for the aid bill: it has to pass through the House of Lords before the election. But if peers do give their support the bill would bind any future government unless they decided to repeal it. The all-party consensus on aid is one of Brown\u2019s most important legacies. There was much talk last week of how he would be remembered for keeping Britain out of the euro, for his handling of the global financial crisis and for his last-ditch intervention to keep Scotland as part of the UK. But he should also be remembered as the politician who forced the fight against poverty onto the political agenda \u2013 and kept it there. How long the legacy will last is another matter. Half way through a decade of austerity, aid is becoming politically toxic. The Department for International Development is the most hated in Whitehall. A decade ago it was the left that bossed the aid agenda. Today it is the right making the political weather. Last week\u2019s aid bill passed through the Commons but only a few Cabinet ministers turned up to vote for the aid bill last week: David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg were all absent. The consensus on aid is weak. The energy that drove the agenda forward has dissipated. DfID, once an intellectual powerhouse, is a pale shadow of its former self. NGOs have become complacent and defensive. As a result, it is easy to imagine a future Conservative government saying that there can be no economic development without military security as it hives part of DfID\u2019s budget off to the Ministry of Defence. It is conceivable that cost saving could see DfID abolished altogether, with its functions subsumed into the Foreign Office. And there are circumstances in which it is entirely plausible that a future parliament would rescind the aid bill. Imagine, for example, that the budget deficit remains stubbornly high but the pressures on the NHS intensify. Ministers say there is a choice: the public can pay to see their GP or there can be cuts elsewhere, including in the aid budget. You do not need to be a genius to see that international development would be as friendless as it was in the 1980s, a decade when Britain cut its budget, and undermined attempts, such as the Brandt report, to forge international co-operation on aid, trade and development. The UK\u2019s aid budget when Labour came to power in 1997 was 0.27% of national income. There was an international attempt to provide debt relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Country initiative (HIPC) but it was going nowhere fast. Brown, together with Tony Blair, turned things around. Labour set up DfID as an independent department under Clare Short, ensuring that development would have a strong voice in Cabinet. They banged heads together over debt relief, tapping in to the verve of the Jubilee 2000 campaign to force often unwilling global leaders to act. Debt relief worked. The International Monetary Fund says that HIPC has helped 36 of the world\u2019s poorest countries and delivered $74bn (\u00a347.5bn) of help. \u201cBefore the HIPC Initiative, eligible countries were, on average, spending slightly more on debt service than on health and education combined\u201d, the IMF said. \u201cNow, they have increased markedly their expenditures on health, education, and other social services. On average, such spending is about five times the amount of debt-service payments.\u201d Brown and Blair strongly backed the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria; they championed the cause of universal health coverage and education; they put Africa on the G8 agenda. Brown had a new initiative at every one of the half-yearly meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, and while not all of them came to anything it was clear that the UK government was prepared to spend time and political capital pushing the development agenda. There were a number of features to this push: a commitment to multi-lateralism; a focus on poverty reduction; a determination to win the intellectual argument for debt relief and aid; and the use of DfID as a laboratory for new ideas. Nearly all this momentum has now been lost. The financial crisis and Great Recession have sapped support for multi-lateralism; DfID disburses its growing budget without any sense of strategic purpose apart from to encourage the role of the private sector; and while the Conservatives have bought into the 0.7% aid pledge, the commitment is only skin deep. Cameron has shown an interest in development, and sought to crack down on the tax evasion that costs poor countries so dearly. But he doesn\u2019t really carry his party with him. Indeed, it is far from certain he even carries his chancellor with him. The contrast with Brown and Osborne at meetings of the IMF and World Bank is a stark one: international development simply does not float the current chancellor\u2019s boat. So, here\u2019s how things stand. Britain has a large aid budget but doesn\u2019t really know what to spend it on. There is a leadership vacuum and an intellectual vacuum. NGOs are pulling their punches either because they don\u2019t want to fuel growing anti-aid sentiment or because they are dependent on DfID for chunks of their funding. Sadly, the stories of bureaucracy and waste are not without foundation. There is now a choice. Those who support aid can make the case that it is needed to meet the big development challenges: to provide universal health care and education; to combat child labour and forced marriage; to deliver global public goods such as helping poor countries cope with climate change or eradicating infectious diseases. They can argue that DfID\u2019s budget be married to a strategic purpose, and that in an inter-connected world social justice and self-interest are indistinguishable. They can make the point that the Ebola epidemic in West African countries with only the most rudimentary of health systems shows what needs to be done. Put simply, the NGOs and the new generation of political leaders have to show there is a rationale for aid. As of now, they are failing to do so, which is why the passing of the 0.7% bill is a classic case of a battle being won while a war is being lost.",

      "body": "<p>Last week\u2019s autumn statement overshadowed two other significant political events. One was the announcement by Gordon Brown that he was stepping down as an MP. The other was the passage of a private member\u2019s bill through the House of Commons enshrining in law the commitment of the UK to spend 0.7% of its annual income on aid.</p> <p>Given the difficulty George Osborne is having making his sums add up, the aid pledge seems extraordinary. The police, the courts, the army, and local government face eye-watering cuts during the next parliament but the budget for overseas development will rise in line with the growth of the economy.</p> <p>There is one final hurdle for the aid bill: it has to pass through the House of Lords before the election. But if peers do give their support the bill would bind any future government unless they decided to repeal it.</p> <p>The all-party consensus on aid is one of Brown\u2019s most important legacies. There was much talk last week of how he would be remembered for keeping Britain out of the euro, for his handling of the global financial crisis and for his last-ditch intervention to keep Scotland as part of the UK. But he should also be remembered as the politician who forced the fight against poverty onto the political agenda \u2013 and kept it there.</p> <p>How long the legacy will last is another matter. Half way through a decade of austerity, aid is becoming politically toxic. The Department for International Development is the most hated in Whitehall. A decade ago it was the left that bossed the aid agenda. Today it is the right making the political weather. Last week\u2019s aid bill passed through the Commons but only a few Cabinet ministers turned up to vote for the aid bill last week: David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg were all absent.</p> <p>The consensus on aid is weak. The energy that drove the agenda forward has dissipated. DfID, once an intellectual powerhouse, is a pale shadow of its former self. NGOs have become complacent and defensive.</p> <p>As a result, it is easy to imagine a future Conservative government saying that there can be no economic development without military security as it hives part of DfID\u2019s budget off to the Ministry of Defence. It is conceivable that cost saving could see DfID abolished altogether, with its functions subsumed into the Foreign Office. And there are circumstances in which it is entirely plausible that a future parliament would rescind the aid bill. Imagine, for example, that the budget deficit remains stubbornly high but the pressures on the NHS intensify. Ministers say there is a choice: the public can pay to see their GP or there can be cuts elsewhere, including in the aid budget. You do not need to be a genius to see that international development would be as friendless as it was in the 1980s, a decade when Britain cut its budget, and undermined attempts, such as the Brandt report, to forge international co-operation on aid, trade and development. The UK\u2019s aid budget when Labour came to power in 1997 was 0.27% of national income. There was an international attempt to provide debt relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Country initiative (HIPC) but it was going nowhere fast.</p> <p>Brown, together with Tony Blair, turned things around. Labour set up DfID as an independent department under Clare Short, ensuring that development would have a strong voice in Cabinet. They banged heads together over debt relief, tapping in to the verve of the Jubilee 2000 campaign to force often unwilling global leaders to act.</p> <p>Debt relief worked. The International Monetary Fund says that HIPC has helped 36 of the world\u2019s poorest countries and delivered $74bn (\u00a347.5bn) of help. \u201cBefore the HIPC Initiative, eligible countries were, on average, spending slightly more on debt service than on health and education combined\u201d, the IMF said. \u201cNow, they have increased markedly their expenditures on health, education, and other social services.

    "webTitle": "How GPS and smart card data is used to reduce city transport congestion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With 5.6 million people living in an area of 270 sq miles (700 sq km), the authorities in Singapore have invested heavily in public transport in an effort to reduce the numbers on the roads. But, like other metropolitan hubs, they faced the inevitable problem of heavy congestion at peak time between 8am and 8.45am. Part of the solution has come in the form of an incentive for passengers: if they registered their smart travel cards and commuted in the hour after these peak times, they would earn points which can be used in a raffle to win cash. The scheme was the result of work by California-based Urban Engines, which uses data from travel cards, like the Oyster card in London, along with GPS data from trains and buses to draw up a detailed model of how the residents of a city move through their transport system. The results in turn show where problems lay. Drawing up this living profile in Singapore and the subsequent incentives resulted in a drop of peak hour travel of between 7% and 13%, according to the company. \u201cAll these things are piecemeal and siloed at this point but it is really a jigsaw puzzle. If you actually put together the information that is coming from smart cards and from GPSs, then you can start figuring out what are the true traffic patterns in a city,\u201d said Shiva Shivakumar, a co-founder and chief executive of the company. \u201cEvery single bus, every single train, every single road segment, every single time. You can start seeing the patterns emerge from that. What happens when there is a big event going on? What happens if it rains? What happens when there is fog?\u201d added Shivakumar, who spent 10 years at Google working on Gmail and Google Maps among other projects. Another of the company\u2019s founders, Balaji Prabhakar, specialises in keeping internet sites running when they are getting heavy traffic. When he was stuck in heavy car traffic in Bangalore in 2007, he pondered whether the two problems could be solved in a similar way. Separately, Shivakumar was questioning whether his work in Google in making the email system faster could also be put to use in urban traffic situations. The pair came together in Stanford, California, to work on the problem and apply large amounts of data to make cities move more fluidly. \u201cHow do we use some of the ideas that we had on the web \u2026 in terms of the real world and make the mobility experience a lot faster and better?\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cThere is a fundamental growing problem around the world.\u201d Transport authorities give Urban Engines the commuter fare card information and GPS details of train and bus systems. Fare card information from when commuters tap in and out allows the company to gauge the commuting pattern \u2013 how long people are waiting, the number of trains which passed which were too full to get on \u2013 and concludes how a system is working at any one time. \u201cWe take all that information with our data sets which have information about the entire city \u2013 all the roads, all the buses, all the trains. We take all that with the online city information which is open. There is a lot of open data \u2013 for example for roads, where are the bus stops? Where are the train stations, how long does it take to get from one train station to the next bus stop? We have processed that already, very similar to Google maps or Apple maps. We take all of that information and build up an analytical platform for all of that information,\u201d said Shivakumar. In practice, the information which is fed back to the transport authority is shown on a screen with a copy of the grid of the railway or bus system. It shows each individual train or bus snaking around their route with meters above them showing how full each one is. Figures illustrate how many commuters are in each station and the waiting times. By analysing this information, it can be decided where more trains and buses are needed or, if that is not possible, how commuters can be incentivised to travel outside of peak times in order to lessen the loads, as in Singapore, or else encourage commuters to move to an underused station as opposed to one which is over capacity. The pilot study for the system was conducted in Bangalore where incentives such as lottery tickets were used to switch an estimated 17% of commuters from their regular pattern. Another study took place in Stanford. The system is now being used in Sao Paulo in Brazil to help manage the 17,000-strong bus fleet while it is in its early stages in Washington DC. \u201cThey [transport authorities] have had average data until now which has been working well for them for a while but now the commuter patterns are changing quite a bit more,\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cIn the US they have a 45mph speed limit on certain roads. That is an optimal speed that you want to go, and the reason that came about is because there was a research study a few years back where they looked at what is happening on average. \u201cAnd so a lot of the decisions have been made from average data as opposed to, in some cases, you want to go at a much higher speed or a much lower speed depending on the weather conditions. That is what is now possible because of the data. You can make much more nuanced decisions about how to optimise your networks.\u201d Attempting to tackle congestion, which is estimated to cost economies multiple billions every year, has attracted the attention of some heavyweight investors to Urban Engines. So far, Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, and Google Ventures are among those who have put money into the early-stage company, although how much or a valuation for the firm has not yet been released. Traditional methods If transport managers want to understand and locate congestion hotspots, conventional methods have been to send human surveyors to watch and analyse their results, or else use video cameras to assess the information across a range of different stations, according to Shivakumar. Another method is to use weighing scales for trains and work out the number on board by dividing by the average weight. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have weighing scales for platforms for example if you want to know how many people are waiting at each station,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>With 5.6 million people living in an area of 270 sq miles (700 sq km), the authorities in Singapore have invested heavily in public transport in an effort to reduce the numbers on the roads. But, like other metropolitan hubs, they faced the inevitable problem of heavy congestion at peak time between 8am and 8.45am.</p> <p>Part of the solution has come in the form of an incentive for passengers: if they registered their smart travel cards and commuted in the hour after these peak times, they would earn points which can be used in a raffle to win cash.</p> <p>The scheme was the result of work by California-based Urban Engines, which uses data from travel cards, like the Oyster card in London, along with GPS data from trains and buses to draw up a detailed model of how the residents of a city move through their transport system. The results in turn show where problems lay. Drawing up this living profile in Singapore and the subsequent incentives resulted in a drop of peak hour travel of between 7% and 13%, according to the company.</p> <p>\u201cAll these things are piecemeal and siloed at this point but it is really a jigsaw puzzle. If you actually put together the information that is coming from smart cards and from GPSs, then you can start figuring out what are the true traffic patterns in a city,\u201d said Shiva Shivakumar, a co-founder and chief executive of the company. \u201cEvery single bus, every single train, every single road segment, every single time. You can start seeing the patterns emerge from that. What happens when there is a big event going on? What happens if it rains? What happens when there is fog?\u201d added Shivakumar, who spent 10 years at Google working on Gmail and Google Maps among other projects.</p> <p>Another of the company\u2019s founders, Balaji Prabhakar, specialises in keeping internet sites running when they are getting heavy traffic. When he was stuck in heavy car traffic in Bangalore in 2007, he pondered whether the two problems could be solved in a similar way. Separately, Shivakumar was questioning whether his work in Google in making the email system faster could also be put to use in urban traffic situations. The pair came together in Stanford, California, to work on the problem and apply large amounts of data to make cities move more fluidly.</p> <p>\u201cHow do we use some of the ideas that we had on the web \u2026 in terms of the real world and make the mobility experience a lot faster and better?\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cThere is a fundamental growing problem around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Transport authorities give Urban Engines the commuter fare card information and GPS details of train and bus systems. Fare card information from when commuters tap in and out allows the company to gauge the commuting pattern \u2013 how long people are waiting, the number of trains which passed which were too full to get on \u2013 and concludes how a system is working at any one time.</p> <p>\u201cWe take all that information with our data sets which have information about the entire city \u2013 all the roads, all the buses, all the trains. We take all that with the online city information which is open. There is a lot of open data \u2013 for example for roads, where are the bus stops? Where are the train stations, how long does it take to get from one train station to the next bus stop? We have processed that already, very similar to Google maps or Apple maps. We take all of that information and build up an analytical platform for all of that information,\u201d said Shivakumar.</p> <p>In practice, the information which is fed back to the transport authority is shown on a screen with a copy of the grid of the railway or bus system. It shows each individual train or bus snaking around their route with meters above them showing how full each one is. Figures illustrate how many commuters are in each station and the waiting times.</p> <p>By analysing this information, it can be decided where more trains and buses are needed or, if that is not possible, how commuters can be incentivised to travel outside of peak times in order to lessen the loads, as in Singapore, or else encourage commuters to move to an underused station as opposed to one which is over capacity.</p> <p>The pilot study for the system was conducted in Bangalore where incentives such as lottery tickets were used to switch an estimated 17% of commuters from their regular pattern. Another study took place in Stanford. The system is now being used in Sao Paulo in Brazil to help manage the 17,000-strong bus fleet while it is in its early stages in Washington DC.</p> <p>\u201cThey [transport authorities] have had average data until now which has been working well for them for a while but now the commuter patterns are changing quite a bit more,\u201d said Shivakumar.</p> <p>\u201cIn the US they have a 45mph speed limit on certain roads. That is an optimal speed that you want to go, and the reason that came about is because there was a research study a few years back where they looked at what is happening on average.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so a lot of the decisions have been made from average data as opposed to, in some cases, you want to go at a much higher speed or a much lower speed depending on the weather conditions. That is what is now possible because of the data. You can make much more nuanced decisions about how to optimise your networks.\u201d</p> <p>Attempting to tackle congestion, which is estimated to cost economies multiple billions every year, has attracted the attention of some heavyweight investors to Urban Engines. So far, Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, and Google Ventures are among those who have put money into the early-stage company, although how much or a valuation for the firm has not yet been released.</p> <h2>Traditional methods</h2> <p>If transport managers want to understand and locate congestion hotspots, conventional methods have been to send human surveyors to watch and analyse their results, or else use video cameras to assess the information across a range of different stations, according to Shivakumar. Another method is to use weighing scales for trains and work out the number on board by dividing by the average weight. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have weighing scales for platforms for example if you want to know how many people are waiting at each station,\u201d he said.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A website that was going viral on Russian social networks last week shows the rouble-dollar exchange rate, the rouble-euro exchange rate and the price of Brent crude changing in real time against a backdrop of slowly breaking waves, as soothing music plays in the background. \u201cRussian zen: meaningless and merciless\u201d, reads the bottom of the page Zenrus.ru. It is a play on a famous quote that Russian revolt is \u201cmeaningless and merciless.\u201d A zen-like calm is probably hard to come by for those watching the exchange rate and the price of oil: the rouble fell to new all-time lows of more than 54 to the dollar last week after the Opec oil producers\u2019 group decided not to reduce production, which would have bolstered sinking oil prices. Russia is especially vulnerable to those prices, since energy exports make up half of its budget, and on Monday its currency recorded its largest single-day decline since the Russian financial crisis of 1998. In all, the rouble has sunk by more than 40% this year as Russia has been buffeted by sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis and steep falls in the oil price. By the end of the week Brent was hovering below $70 a barrel, down from more than $105 at the start of the year. The picture of Russia\u2019s economic future is grim, despite the rosy outlook President Vladimir Putin tried to put on it in his annual address to the federal assembly on Thursday. Inflation has been rising, and recession next year is all but certain. On Tuesday, the economic development ministry reduced its GDP growth forecast for 2015 from 1.2% to \u20130.8%. State-owned banks have sought help from the government after the Ukraine sanctions cut them off from the western financial industry and its cheaper credit. According to Vladimir Tikhomirov, an economist at Russian bank BKF, the two main factors responsible for Russia\u2019s economic woes \u2013 sanctions and a low oil price \u2013 probably won\u2019t change any time soon. \u201cOil has a stronger effect on the economy than sanctions, and the oil price and sanctions are speeding up macroeconomic processes that were already there,\u201d Tikhomirov says. \u201cThe economy was slowing down due to structural difficulties even when oil prices were high. I think that next year there won\u2019t be new sanctions but the current sanctions will remain; I think next year the oil price will be around $80 a barrel; and I think that the economy will shrink.\u201d But although such worrying numbers have led many to wonder if Putin\u2019s standoff with the west might weaken his grip on power, analysts caution that the banking system is still functional and unemployment remains low. While concern over the economic situation is growing, the population\u2019s \u201ccup of endurance,\u201d as the Russian phrase goes, is nowhere near to overflowing. \u201cI think a situation with the stagnation of manufacturing, the reduction of people\u2019s real incomes and the rise in inflation \u2013 it will lead to Putin leaving power, but it could be in five years or in 10 years. There probably won\u2019t be any positive changes before that,\u201d says Konstantin Sonin, vice-rector and professor of economics at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cPeople\u2019s reserves of endurance are very large.\u201d Yelena Tsereteli, an employee of state-owned Rosselkhozbank in the regional city of Kurgan, says that although her employer has reduced the amount of cash on hand for customer withdrawal, a run on the bank seems unlikely. But she has noticed customers taking out money to make investments in property, home renovations or cars. \u201cIn terms of exchanging roubles for dollars, this isn\u2019t really happening, but people have started to withdraw their savings and put it into something else. They buy a car or something, because they worry that the money will devalue,\u201d Tsereteli says. \u201cOtherwise they open accounts with higher interest rates, so that inflation doesn\u2019t eat their money.\u201d A survey by the independent pollster Levada-Center found that 80% of Russians were worried about the country\u2019s economic problems, especially rising prices and falling quality of life. Rising inflation \u2013 which went from 8.3% in October to 9.1% in November \u2013 has pushed up prices, since many consumer goods, especially food, are imported. A ban on food imports from the European Union, the US, Australia, Canada and Norway ordered by Putin in response to western sanctions, while popular among the more patriotically minded, has worsened the situation. According to Russia\u2019s state statistics service, prices for fruits and vegetables went up by 8.7% in November. Although the Kremlin has announced an import substitution programme and promised that domestic production will step up to fill the gap, reforming Russia\u2019s declining agricultural industry will be a difficult and time-consuming task. In the meantime, analysts say, banned importers are generally being replaced by suppliers located further away, with the result that transport costs are driving up prices. The government has begun taking steps to check rising inflation by burning some of its reported \u00a3269bn in foreign currency reserves, a good-sized pillow to cushion the economy\u2019s fall. After Putin promised in his speech on Thursday that the government would take action against \u201cspeculators\u201d who were fuelling the rouble\u2019s fall, the central bank made its third large intervention of the week to defend the currency, allowing the rouble to rise to 52.4 against the dollar as trading opened on Friday. The central bank spent an estimated \u00a31.6bn last week propping the currency up. According to Tikhomirov, attempts to rein in inflation will not be effective so long as the currency hasn\u2019t stabilised and structural inefficiencies haven\u2019t been addressed, especially in sectors such as utilities, where prices have been rising steadily for years. Nonetheless, Putin has argued that the devaluation of the rouble represents a \u201cstimulus\u201d for the economy, making Russian products more competitive on the world market. Indeed, large exporters outside the oil and gas industry, such as steel producer MMK, diamond miner Alrosa and fertiliser giants Acron Group and Uralkali, are seeing greater profits, according to independent analyst Timur Nigmatullin. He says that Putin is right \u2013 to an extent. If the rouble falls by 30% in a year, it can make Russia\u2019s exports more competitive, but if it falls by 40% to 50%, it could lead to economic instability. The currency is currently poised between these two outcomes. \u201cHere the key role is played by balance. If the rouble remains where it is, it could be good. If the rouble continues to fall, it could be bad,\u201d Nigmatullin says. \u201cIf it falls, it will lead to negative factors, higher cost of credit, problems with buying equipment from abroad \u2026 and the instability of the financial system. Investors will see more risk.\u201d At the same time, Nigmatullin argues that the financial situation of the majority of the population is not critical and several economic indicators are in fact positive. According to the state statistics service, real wages grew by 2.2% between January and October, GDP grew by 0.8% and the manufacturing index grew by 1.7%. The most salient number for political instability is unemployment, which remains low at about 5% and is not likely to increase, Nigmatullin says. But while Sonin agrees low unemployment will have a calming effect, he argues that this level of manufacturing growth \u201cis essentially stagnation for a big country like Russia\u201d. Real incomes will begin falling, he says. The question is how long people will put up with it. The answer appears to be a long time yet, according to Tikhomirov. \u201cIn the last few years, the income of the population grew a lot, wages and pensions grew very strongly compared to 10 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they start to fall, there will be some time that the population will be prepared to grin and bear it: because of political reasons \u2013 but also because they have got a significant increase in income in recent years.\u201d",

After Putin promised in his speech on Thursday that the government would take action against \u201cspeculators\u201d who were fuelling the rouble\u2019s fall, the central bank made its third large intervention of the week to defend the currency, allowing the rouble to rise to 52.4 against the dollar as trading opened on Friday. The central bank spent an estimated \u00a31.6bn last week propping the currency up.</p> <p>According to Tikhomirov, attempts to rein in inflation will not be effective so long as the currency hasn\u2019t stabilised and structural inefficiencies haven\u2019t been addressed, especially in sectors such as utilities, where prices have been rising steadily for years.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Putin has argued that the devaluation of the rouble represents a \u201cstimulus\u201d for the economy, making Russian products more competitive on the world market. Indeed, large exporters outside the oil and gas industry, such as steel producer MMK, diamond miner Alrosa and fertiliser giants Acron Group and Uralkali, are seeing greater profits, according to independent analyst Timur Nigmatullin. He says that Putin is right \u2013 to an extent. If the rouble falls by 30% in a year, it can make Russia\u2019s exports more competitive, but if it falls by 40% to 50%, it could lead to economic instability. The currency is currently poised between these two outcomes.</p> <p>\u201cHere the key role is played by balance. If the rouble remains where it is, it could be good. If the rouble continues to fall, it could be bad,\u201d Nigmatullin says. \u201cIf it falls, it will lead to negative factors, higher cost of credit, problems with buying equipment from abroad \u2026 and the instability of the financial system. Investors will see more risk.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Nigmatullin argues that the financial situation of the majority of the population is not critical and several economic indicators are in fact positive. According to the state statistics service, real wages grew by 2.2% between January and October, GDP grew by 0.8% and the manufacturing index grew by 1.7%. The most salient number for political instability is unemployment, which remains low at about 5% and is not likely to increase, Nigmatullin says.</p> <p>But while Sonin agrees low unemployment will have a calming effect, he argues that this level of manufacturing growth \u201cis essentially stagnation for a big country like Russia\u201d. Real incomes will begin falling, he says. The question is how long people will put up with it.</p> <p>The answer appears to be a long time yet, according to Tikhomirov. \u201cIn the last few years, the income of the population grew a lot, wages and pensions grew very strongly compared to 10 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen they start to fall, there will be some time that the population will be prepared to grin and bear it: because of political reasons \u2013 but also because they have got a significant increase in income in recent years.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Oil prices were back near five-year lows \u2013 below $70 per barrel \u2013 at the end of last week as commodity traders, analysts and governments struggled to come up with new forecasts for 2015. The benchmark, Brent blend, had recovered from a major drop in the aftermath of last month\u2019s meeting of the oil producers\u2019 cartel, Opec. However, it was back down at $69.17 on Friday as the market bet on a prolonged low in prices. Igor Sechin, Russia\u2019s most senior oil official, warned that Opec\u2019s unwillingness to cut production could push oil down to $60, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange reported a huge increase in the number of investors hedging on crude hitting $40. Forecasting the future price of oil has always been fraught. There were few warnings in the first half of the year that prices were set to plunge by 40% from a June high of $115. Analysts at Citi are now expecting Brent to average $80 over the next 12 months, while their counterparts at Natixis believe it could fall as low as $74 \u2013 and that the US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, will slump below $70. Standard Chartered described Opec\u2019s decision to keep the production target unchanged as \u201cextremely negative for oil prices for 2015\u201d and has cut next year\u2019s Brent price forecast by $16 a barrel to $85. The reasons for the cuts are faltering growth in demand as the global economy continues to stutter, plus soaring production from the shale fields of Texas and Pennsylvania. Lower prices have also been supported by a relatively benign geopolitical environment, because energy supplies have not been endangered by the Russian stand-off with the west over Ukraine or Islamic State\u2019s advances in Syria. A divided Opec is now hoping that falling prices will be devastating for higher-cost US frackers, forcing them to shut down output and gradually bring balance to the wider oil markets. But according to Paul Stevens, oil expert at Chatham House, a similar strategy in the late 1980s did not encourage North Sea and other producers to halt production and the price continued to slide downwards. However, it triggered numerous project cancellations and lead to a major fall in exploratory drilling, which led to longer-term supply shortages and eventually forced prices back up. Certainly there are few predicting an early bounceback in prices this time around, and already cost-cutting plans are being unveiled by companies working in the oil and gas sector. Last week Santos, the Australian producer, said it was cancelling plans for a $500m (\u00a3320m) debt raising and promised to \u201csignificantly reduce capital and operating expenditure\u201d for the next 12 months. Schlumberger, the world\u2019s biggest oil-field services group, said it would take an $800m writedown in the fourth quarter and would be drastically cutting back its marine seismic fleet. Sir Ian Wood, an UK oil industry veteran who has just completed a review of the sector for the British government, said the latest downturn in prices would have a \u201chorrible\u201d effect on the North Sea industry. Even before the downturn, Shell, Chevron and other companies said they were laying off workers in Aberdeen, and this process is expected to accelerate despite measures unveiled by coalition ministers in the autumn statement. The low oil prices and frenzied atmosphere of change even led BP\u2019s share price to jump briefly last week \u2013 on the back of merger speculation with Shell. If 2015 is a year of low Brent prices, it could trigger change across the industry.",
