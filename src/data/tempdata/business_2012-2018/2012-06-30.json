Small firms alarmed by QE threat Britain's small businesses are normally at the front of the queue in demanding more action from the Bank of England to cushion the blow of the economic downturn. So it is significant that with the Bank's monetary policy committee highly likely to vote for a renewed bout of quantitative easing on Thursday \u2013 four out of nine members backed it last month \u2013 the British Chambers of Commerce are not cheering them on as they crank up the printing presses, but urging them to hold fire.

      "bodyText": "There was a famous moment when the Queen asked, within the sacred portals of the London School of Economics, why no one had warned her about the financial crisis. In fact, there were many expressions of uneasiness in the runup to 2007-08, but I know of nobody who thought it would be quite as bad as this. After all, my generation of economists and politicians was brought up in the belief that nothing like the economic catastrophes of the 1920s and 30s would ever be allowed to happen again. One institution that repeatedly sounded warnings about the dangers of the credit boom and asset price speculation in the middle of the last decade was the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), based in Basle, Switzerland \u2013 or Basel, if you prefer the German version. The BIS has a historical memory of crises. And it certainly ought to. After all, it was founded between the wars to handle German reparations. The fact that it is still with us is a tribute to the staying power of institutions that outlive their original purpose \u2013 although the way things are going, who knows what it might be called upon to handle in years to come? At all events, the BIS is known as \"the central bankers' bank\". The central bankers of the world meet there most months, and the BIS has been heavily involved in the various efforts to improve the rules for the regulation of banks and other errant financial institutions. One of the high spots of the BIS's year is the publication of its annual report, which is always a model of clarity and comprehensible analysis. It was in this report that the BIS issued warnings to which, frankly, its member central banks, obsessed with the prevailing fashion of inflation-targeting, paid too little attention during the boom. There were even rumours that BIS staff were leant on to tone down their alarmist conclusions. And so we come to this year's report, published last week, on the eve of Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King's warning to the Commons Treasury select committee that he thought we were not yet halfway through the financial crisis. Enter the BIS, with the bald statement that \"the world is now five years on from the outbreak of the financial crisis, yet the global economy is still unbalanced and seemingly becoming more so as interacting weaknesses continue to amplify each other\". The BIS, which is in a better position than other institutions or individuals to know, concludes: \"Despite the progress on recapitalisation, many banks remain highly leveraged, including those that appear well capitalised but in fact have outsize derivatives positions.\" It appears that the banks, like the Bourbons, have \"learned nothing and forgotten nothing\". \"Big banks continue to have an interest in driving up their leverage without enough regard for the consequences of failure: because of their systemic weight, they expect the public sector to cover the downside.\" Writing within weeks of the news of the enormous \"trading\" (or betting) losses at JP Morgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon was leader of the Wall Street pack in opposing sensible regulatory reforms, the BIS notes: \"Another worrying sign is that trading, after a brief crisis-induced squeeze, has again become a major source of income for large banks.\" Not to put too fine a point on it, the financial sector is moving \"towards the same high-risk profile it had before the crisis\". This, then, is the financial background to all those attempts to patch up the eurozone and get the world's advanced economies moving again. Another crisis while this one is not even halfway through? As the Australian comedian Bill Kerr used to say: \"I don't want to worry you, but \u2026\" However, great though my respect is for the BIS's analysis of the financial scene, its recipe for broader macroeconomic policy is all too reminiscent of the kind of policy mistakes that were made when it was first set up all those years ago. Noting the simultaneous deleveraging taking place in the private and public sectors, it is nevertheless so concerned about levels of public sector debt \u2013 and prospective further strains from spending on pensions and healthcare \u2013 that it backs the current fashion for cutting back the public sector when basic Keynesian economics teach us that the public sector should be counterbalancing the depressing impact of private sector retrenchment. As Paul Krugman of Princeton and Richard Layard of the LSE reminded us in the Financial Times last week: \"Today's government deficits are a consequence of the crisis, not a cause\" (my italics). Unfortunately George Osborne's obsession with deficits rather than output and employment is shared by centre-right governments around Europe, and not exactly helping efforts to resolve the eurozone crisis. My fear is the onset of a deflationary spiral.",

      "bodyText": "A proposed mega-merger of two London-listed commodity and mining groups, Glencore and Xstrata, was meant to be a neat way of putting almost \u00a330m apiece into the pockets of their respective bosses, including Tory party donor Mick Davis. But the architects of the cosy tie-up had not counted on a shareholder whose riches make Xstrata boss Davis and Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg look like paupers. Qatar Holding, which looks after some of the gulf state's $100bn of investments, brought the planned $65bn metals partnership to a grinding halt last week when it very publicly demanded a higher price for independent investors. In a stand-off this weekend, both sides are reiterating their determination to hold out, and the world of money waits. A similar situation arose in 2008 when Xstrata tried to buy Brazil's Vale, but on that occasion it was Glasenberg and Glencore (as Xstrata's biggest shareholder) who sank the deal rather than accept softer terms. What will happen this time? \"Glasenberg is used to being the man with the deepest pockets and the most patience. But he has met his match,\" says one City insider. \"Qatar not only has far deeper pockets than Glasenberg, it also has a multi-generational time horizon.\" Glencore already has a 34% stake in Xstrata and had agreed to give investors 2.8 shares for each Xstrata share to formally merge the businesses. Not enough, said Ahmad Mohamed al-Sayed, head of Qatar Holding, which has 11% of Xstrata. Middle East sovereign wealth funds, pumped up with revenues from selling petrol to the west, generally like to keep a low profile when they are investors. The very public punch-up with Glasenberg, more reminiscent of so-called \"active investors\" from New York and London, is seen by the City as a potential turning point, particularly given that the most brash piece of architecture to hit the British capital, the Shard, will be formally opened on Thursday (5 July) by Qatari prime minister, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani. Qatar is also a shareholder in Barclays (which is creating the odd wave) but its interest in Xstrata is not about prestige but money. This is a mining business in a world where, despite currently low commodity prices, the future looks good, with China, India and others poised to hoover up minerals for fast-track industrialisation programmes. The deal was meant to be quietly sewn up with a minimum of fuss. It was back in February that Xstrata and Glencore finally announced plans for a \"merger of equals\", confirming the worst-kept secret in the world of mining. The proposed terms caused a few eyebrows to arch in the City, with many mining experts speculating that the offer would have to rise. For its part, Glencore always insisted that the terms were the terms, valuing Xstrata at \u00a340bn, which was then a 28% premium to its average price for the three months prior to the bid approach. To sweeten the deal, the new Glencore Xstrata International was to be led by Xstrata chief executive Davis, while Glasenberg, who has been friends with Davis since their student days in South Africa and is Glencore's largest shareholder, was pencilled in as deputy CEO and president. Similarly, Xstrata's chairman, Sir John Bond, and its finance director, Trevor Reid, were to bag those roles respectively in the new company. But Xstrata shareholders always suspected that the real power lay elsewhere. Despite purporting to accept lesser executive roles, the top 12 Glencore executives currently control almost a third of their company and would hold similarly dominant positions in the new creation. Meanwhile, as Glasenberg spoke charmingly in public about how he was glad to cede control to his old pal Davis, nobody believed him. Both men are known to possess large egos, and Glasenberg's larger holding in the company and greater wealth were always going to be undermining to his new boss. The two companies have long had ties.

Glencore's own flotation prospectus boasts that it is \"the world's largest participant in the supply of seaborne steam coal, including \u2026 exclusive advisory and agency agreements with, amongst others, its associate company Xstrata\". And when Xstrata completed a $5.9bn rights issue in 2009, Glencore subscribed by selling it its Colombian Coal Group for $2bn in cash, taking out an option to buy it back 12 months later for $2.25bn.

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has urged shareholders in UK banks to rise up and purge their companies of corrupt executives, who he says have allowed \"systemic abuse\" to take root in the banking system. The business secretary, writing in the Observer, says it is now clear that no one at Barclays Capital, the investment bank that triggered the market-rigging scandal, is prepared to take responsibility for endemic corruption, so the ultimate owners of banks must take matters into their own hands. Describing the problems in UK banking as \"a moral quagmire of almost biblical proportions\", Cable says the government is taking urgent action, including creating a clearer separation between \"casino-style investment banking\" and retail banking on the high street. Ministers will this week begin a review into the Libor system under which banks lend to each other and Cable hints that US-style criminal sanctions, such as the threat of prison terms, could be considered against those who abuse it. But he says shareholder power will be crucial. \"Regulators are a backstop: they don't own banks,\" he writes. \"The governance at the top of our leading banks has been shown to be lamentably weak. No one at the top of Barclays will take responsibility for systemic abuse. \"Shareholders, the owners, have a major responsibility here. I am bringing in legislation to strengthen their control over pay and bonuses, through binding votes, but shareholders have to get a stronger grip on weak boards and out-of-control executives.\" Shareholders have already opposed the pay package of Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, while Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey and Aviva's chief executive Andrew Moss quit following opposition from investors. Cable says he is determined to encourage \"cultural change\" throughout the system. He cites the takeover by the not-for-profit Co-operative Bank of a large chunk of the Lloyds bank network as a model for a future system. It was announced on Saturday that the Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, who has faced calls from Labour to quit, will be summoned for questioning in front of the Commons Treasury select committee on Wednesday to explain the \u00a3290m fine imposed by US and UK regulators on Barclays Capital for rigging a key interbank lending rate. Non-executives, including chairman Marcus Agius, will appear on Thursday. \"The Libor interest rate benchmark \u2013 crucial to transactions right across the economy and affecting millions of people \u2013 was systematically rigged over a period of years,\" said the committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie. \"This is the most damaging scam I can recall. The reputation of Britain's financial services industry has been severely tarnished, albeit unfairly for the overwhelming majority unconnected with the scam. The public's trust in banks has been even further eroded. Restoring the reputational damage must begin immediately.\" There are signs that Agius could be replaced to address demands for the bank to demonstrate accountability at the top. But it is far from clear that the idea has the support of the bank's board. If such a plan were implemented, one option might be for Agius to be replaced temporarily by the former top accountant Sir Michael Rake, who holds a key role as the \"senior independent director\". Barclays issued a statement on Saturday saying it was \"categorically wrong\" to suggest Agius had plans to step down. Ed Miliband \u2013 in a speech to the Fabian Society on Saturday \u2013 attacked the government's failure to launch a public inquiry. \"I have news for David Cameron: the people want a moment of reckoning for our banks,\" he said. \"The British people will not tolerate the establishment closing ranks, saying we don't need an inquiry. They want a light shone into every dark corner of our banking system. They want bankers held to account.\" Meanwhile, legal action being brought across the Atlantic suggests the scandal is spreading. A lawsuit filed by the US stockbroking firm Charles Schwab alleges that Barclays was one of 16 banks whose manipulation of interbank lending rates \"artificially depressed the value of tens of billions of dollars\" in funds held by investors. It alleges the defendants, which include Lloyds, HSBC and RBS, \"knowingly colluded\" to keep the rates low and \"engaged in a media strategy\" to deflect attention from their actions. The banks are contesting the allegations. An affidavit filed by the Canadian Competition Bureau last year reveals that investigators are examining allegations that traders at a number of banks, including the Canadian arms of RBS and HSBC, colluded to set interest rates. The claims are denied by the banks. With investigations in the EU, the US, Switzerland, Singapore and Japan, the scandal is threatening to go global. Sources suggested hedge funds and brokers could be drawn into the affair. Cable's call for US-style penalties could see those found guilty of white-collar fraud serve long stints in jail. Bernie Ebbers, the boss of the collapsed US telecom giant WorldCom, was sentenced to a minimum 25 years in prison for his part in defrauding investors. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2012 to remove a reference to Tesco.",

He cites the takeover by the not-for-profit Co-operative Bank of a large chunk of the Lloyds bank network as a model for a future system.</p> <p>It was announced on Saturday that the Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, who has faced calls from Labour to quit, will be summoned for questioning in front of the Commons Treasury select committee on Wednesday to explain the \u00a3290m fine imposed by US and UK regulators on Barclays Capital for rigging a key interbank lending rate.</p> <p>Non-executives, including chairman Marcus Agius, will appear on Thursday. \"The Libor interest rate benchmark \u2013 crucial to transactions right across the economy and affecting millions of people \u2013 was systematically rigged over a period of years,\" said the committee's chairman, Andrew Tyrie. \"This is the most damaging scam I can recall. The reputation of Britain's financial services industry has been severely tarnished, albeit unfairly for the overwhelming majority unconnected with the scam. The public's trust in banks has been even further eroded. Restoring the reputational damage must begin immediately.\"</p> <p>There are signs that Agius could be replaced to address demands for the bank to demonstrate accountability at the top. But it is far from clear that the idea has the support of the bank's board. If such a plan were implemented, one option might be for Agius to be replaced temporarily by the former top accountant Sir Michael Rake, who holds a key role as the \"senior independent director\". Barclays issued a statement on Saturday saying it was \"categorically wrong\" to suggest Agius had plans to step down.</p> <p>Ed Miliband \u2013 in a speech to the Fabian Society on Saturday \u2013 attacked the government's failure to launch a public inquiry. \"I have news for David Cameron: the people want a moment of reckoning for our banks,\" he said. \"The British people will not tolerate the establishment closing ranks, saying we don't need an inquiry. They want a light shone into every dark corner of our banking system. They want bankers held to account.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, legal action being brought across the Atlantic suggests the scandal is spreading. A lawsuit filed by the US stockbroking firm Charles Schwab alleges that Barclays was one of 16 banks whose manipulation of interbank lending rates \"artificially depressed the value of tens of billions of dollars\" in funds held by investors. It alleges the defendants, which include Lloyds, HSBC and RBS, \"knowingly colluded\" to keep the rates low and \"engaged in a media strategy\" to deflect attention from their actions. The banks are contesting the allegations.</p> <p>An affidavit filed by the Canadian Competition Bureau last year reveals that investigators are examining allegations that traders at a number of banks, including the Canadian arms of RBS and HSBC, colluded to set interest rates. The claims are denied by the banks.</p> <p>With investigations in the EU, the US, Switzerland, Singapore and Japan, the scandal is threatening to go global. Sources suggested hedge funds and brokers could be drawn into the affair.</p> <p>Cable's call for US-style penalties could see those found guilty of white-collar fraud serve long stints in jail. Bernie Ebbers, the boss of the collapsed US telecom giant WorldCom, was sentenced to a minimum 25 years in prison for his part in defrauding investors.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2012 to remove a reference to Tesco.</p>",

They should have their share options reviewed. The FSA has let Barclays off lightly \u2013 with a fine equivalent to no more than a few days' profit and a press release that named no names. It has not revoked any of Barclays' permissions to operate. It failed to find a smoking gun. Shareholders will not be so forgiving. Nor will those who believe they have been cheated by Barclays and will now seek their compensation in court. The Treasury is also going to have to think hard about whether it wishes to persist with policies like quantitative easing and \"funding for lending\", which passes millions of pounds into the profits of banks and the bonuses of bankers in the name of trying to make life better for the rest of us. At the very minimum, the Treasury needs to establish an independent and transparent oversight mechanism to monitor and report on the impact of these initiatives, including the consequences for bank profits and bonuses. The Bank of England's monitoring of Project Merlin fell lamentably short of providing any meaningful clarity or analysis. In the meantime, the bank manger I met in Cornwall 50 years ago will be wondering what has happened to a bank once synonymous with trust, integrity and its Quaker foundations. Agius has some explaining to do.",

      "bodyText": "Bob Diamond strode into the offices of Morgan Stanley on Thursday in defiant mood. The boss of Barclays \u2013 facing calls for his resignation following the bank's record-breaking \u00a3290m fine for attempting to rig interest rates \u2013 was determined to tell the analysts who recommend buying or selling Barclays' shares that he had no intention of walking away from a 15-year career at the bank. The atmosphere was \"tense,\" as one insider put it, and the pressure was on. Barclays' shares were on the slide. By the end of the week, more than \u00a34bn had been wiped off their value \u2013 over 15% \u2013 in the 72 hours since the fine was revealed by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, unleashing a wave of condemnation about the culture inside the bank. Diamond, a US-born former lecturer who has been speaking recently about his desire to make the bank a better corporate citizen, was reportedly unequivocal. \"The CEO says he has no intention of standing down,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts said in their account of the meeting. \"Further, the CEO was appointed 18 months ago with the full approval of the [Financial Services Authority] in knowledge of this investigation.\" After more than a decade running Barclays' testosterone-charged investment banking arm, Barclays Capital \u2013 which even City rivals joke is staffed by alpha males \u2013 Diamond was made chief executive of the whole organisation in January 2011. From the start, the appointment was controversial in political circles: naming an investment banker as the boss of a high street lender was regarded as a snub to a government that had pledged to separate the two arms of banking. Diamond marked the start of his tenure by telling the Commons Treasury select committee that \"there was a period of remorse and apology for banks and I think that period needs to be over\". His remarks provoked a storm of public criticism at the time. Last week, he was forced to eat his words. Fining Barclays \u00a3290m, regulators said that traders, managers and others outside the bank had attempted to manipulate the price of Libor, the London interbank offered rate, and its European equivalent Euribor \u2013 two rates that set a benchmark for borrowing costs across significant parts of the economy. The fallout is only just beginning. As many as 20 institutions are said to be facing investigations, but for now the focus is on Barclays in what looks to be one of the most damaging chapters yet in the troubled history of British banking. Until the Big Bang in 1986, when Margaret Thatcher's government unleashed a wave of deregulation, banking was a staid affair. The big high street clearers, of which Barclays was one, were conservative beasts, and if anything Barclays was the most conservative of the lot. Founded by Quakers and with strong traditional links to East Anglia, it had a long history of lending money to farmers and fishermen. For many decades, the bank was run almost as a family dynasty, dominated by the Bevan family. A few eyebrows were raised when in 1987 an outsider, John Quinton, was appointed chairman at a time when mounting domestic competition meant Barclays had lost its status as the UK's number one bank to NatWest. Even then, at the height of the yuppie boom, it would have been unthinkable to the bank's board that Barclays would depend on investment banking for the bulk of its profits and end up being fined a record sum for deceitful behaviour. That is not to say that Barclays was risk averse, nor that it did not have its problems in the decades when retail bankers and investment bankers were two separate tribes. It ventured into areas where others followed: Barclays was the first UK bank to use a computer in its branch accounting and the first to offer customers a cash machine. In the 1980s, however, most of its problems stemmed from its links with the apartheid regime in South Africa, which led to a student boycott that was both costly and damaging to the bank's reputation. A Conservative MP, Jesse Norman \u2013 a former Barclays banker who sits on the Treasury select committee \u2013 said in a recent pamphlet: \"Lest we forget, two of the 'big four', Lloyds and Barclays, were founded and built up by Quaker families. For many years they were run on Quaker principles, which emphasised social justice, integrity, simplicity, plain dealing and thrift: 'my yea is my yea and my nay is my nay.' \"That ethos persisted for a long time within both institutions, through numerous takeovers of failing competitors. A key reason why both banks were so successful was that their Quaker ethos and sober lending principles preserved their capital while other institutions lost their heads in speculation.\" The bank's first foray into investment banking was hardly an unqualified success: as part of the Big Bang, it bought De Zoete &amp; Bevan and Wedd Durlacher to form BZW. The business struggled. Diamond was the banker charged with sorting out the troubled business when it imploded in the mid-1990s. The BZW equity business was sold to Credit Suisse, but the bank kept the debt business, which Diamond turned into a powerhouse, helping companies to raise billions to finance their business. Buoyed by that success, Barclays became formidably ambitious. In 2007, it agreed to take over Dutch bank ABN Amro \u2013 only for another of banking's alpha males, Fred Goodwin of RBS, to pay \u00a349bn for it, a decision that proved fatal to the Edinburgh-based bank. As the credit crunch raged around it, Barclays tried to buy the collapsing Lehman Brothers in late 2008, but the deal fell apart under the scrutiny of the then chancellor, Alistair Darling, who feared the consequences for the exchequer if the ailing US giant became British. Undeterred, Barclays eventually pulled off the deal it really wanted \u2013 buying just the Wall Street operations of Lehman in the days after it went bust in September 2008. In the mayhem that followed, Gordon Brown's government pressed Barclays to join RBS and Lloyds in accepting financial help from the state, but Diamond, together with the then chief executive John Varley, were determined to remain independent and found cash support from the Middle East. One factor behind the decision was that they wanted to pay top dollar for the best talent the City had to offer \u2013 including Diamond himself \u2013 without the scrutiny that taxpayer backing would bring. But if Diamond and the Barclays board thought that side-stepping a bailout would avoid any of the furore that has engulfed UK banks ever since, they were mistaken. Analysts at Credit Suisse \u2013 who act as Barclays' brokers \u2013 admit it is not clear why Barclays opted to settle with the regulators over the Libor probe and become the first bank to have its dirty linen aired in public. But, they add, \"reading the statement by the authorities we expect to get settlements by others in the course of time which could be more punitive\". The Morgan Stanley analysts who hosted Diamond on Thursday also point to a largely overlooked paragraph in the regulatory notices. The US department of justice said: \"To the bank's credit Barclays also took a significant step toward accepting the conduct by being the first institution to provide extensive and meaningful co-operation to the government. Its efforts have substantially assisted the criminal division in our ongoing investigation of individuals and other financial institutions in this matter.\" But if Diamond thought this would earn him credit with the public and politicians, it has spectacularly backfired. His appearance before MPs on the Treasury select committee this week will be a very public fight not only for his reputation but that of the entire banking industry.",

      "bodyText": "With almost 1,000 branches in prime high street sites up and down the country, the Co-operative Bank is poised to become a major competitor to the big four high street banks. Or so hope the UK's largest mutual and the coalition government \u2013 which is keen to promote competition in retail banking \u2013 after Lloyds Banking Group last week edged closer to agreeing terms on a long-awaited transaction to sell 632 of its branches to the Co-op. Lloyds has been forced to sell the branches under EU state aid rules, because of the \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds it received during the banking crisis. The deal is least three months behind the timetable set by Lloyds when it parcelled up the branches for sale under the codename \"Project Verde\", and a crucial \"heads of agreement\" needed to push the final buttons will still not be secured for a few more weeks. But at last a deal is in sight that could transform the group that started as a grocery wholesaler in Rochdale into a formidable force in banking. The sale would see the number of Co-op branches bank triple and the enlarged group account for 7% of the all-important current account market. The big four \u2013 Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 have a 75% market share in that area that has proved impossible to crack for decades. The Co-op's audacious expansion plans, laid over many months, could now look exquisitely well-timed. The scandal over interest rate fixing, the NatWest computer crisis \u2013 which left millions of customers unable to use their accounts \u2013 and the mis-selling of interest rate swap products to small businesses have left a growing number of customers wondering whether they can trust conventional banks. The Move Your Money campaign, a grassroots organisation urging customers to desert the mainstream lenders and bank with mutuals, has seen a fivefold increase in hits on its website over the past fortnight. \"This has been incredibly powerful,\" says spokesman Louis Brooke. \"It shows a deep cultural rot, and it's a real wake-up call.\" He argues that mutually owned institutions tend to pay lower bonuses and behave more cautiously: \"They're not trying to generate maximum shareholder returns, so their bonuses tend to be tied to customer satisfaction.\" Even so, Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec, thinks the Co-op may \"still not be of a big enough scale to compete with the big four\". Others say bolting on the Lloyds branches \u2013 which bring a 4.5% share of the current account market \u2013 to an existing, albeit tiny, player should help. The independent commission on banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, had been concerned that on their own the Verde branches would be \"on the borderline of sub-scale banks that failed to grow significantly in the past\". Ed Mayo, secretary-general of Co-operatives UK, the umbrella organisation for mutuals from local bakeries to the John Lewis Partnership, says: \"We've had a drip, drip, drip of scandals, characterised by a herd mentality. That's why there's such an interest in a co-operative, mutual model.\" He adds that mutuals are less likely to follow the herd, or the short-term return: \"They behave in different ways, not because they've got 'co-operative' over the door, but because they work to different incentives. If you're owned by your customers, you're not going to fleece them in the same way.\" He pointed out that the UK, where a swath of building societies demutualised in the late 1980s, has an unusually small co-operative banking sector. In the Netherlands, for example, half the population banks with a mutual. Many politicians, too, would welcome a successful alternative to the standard high street financial institutions: but it remains to be seen whether the Co-op can retain its distinctive culture and make a success of its radical expansion.",

      "bodyText": "Walmart has suspended a seafood supplier following complaints from workers at the plant that they were forced to work 24 hours at a time and had threats of violence directed at their families. In a statement, Walmart said a preliminary investigation uncovered \"violations\" at CJ's Seafood in Louisiana, where eight Mexican employees had complained of being mistreated by their bosses. It follows an independent report which described conditions at Louisiana food processing plant as \"rivalling any sweatshop in China or Bangladesh\". It also comes as activists in New York were due to stage a 24-hour fast to protest against unsatisfactory labour conditions at some Walmart suppliers. On Friday, the National Guestworker Alliance cited 12 other factories in the Walmart supply chain for allegedly violating working conditions. Over the weekend, members of the pressure group are to join striking employees of CJ's Seafood at a 24-hour fast outside the Manhattan apartment of Walmart board member Michelle Burns. The workers say they were locked inside the crawfish processing plant during periods of peak demand for sometimes 24 hours at a time. Their families in Mexico were threatened, according to one worker, while they were warned they faced deportation if they did not acquiesce to their employer's demands. Ana Diaz, who had travelled from her home in north-east Mexico to work at the Louisiana seafood plant, told the Guardian earlier this month: \"On two occasions they locked the doors so we couldn't take breaks because they wanted us to produce the crawfish in a shorter time.\" One supervisor told her that if workers took breaks, he would lose a lot of money. \"We were afraid because he knows where many of us live. He knows where our family members live; he has our addresses and information. That's when we felt the most locked in and the most abused,\" Diaz said. CJ's Seafood did not respond to requests for comment. Diaz is one of eight employees currently striking over conditions at CJ's. The group, with the support of National Guestworker Alliance, has lodged a complaint with the wage and hour division of the US department of labour, claiming that the company violated the fair labour standards act by failing to pay overtime and failed to keep accurate records as required by the act and by employers of workers on H2-B visas. Separately, the workers have filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission \u2013 the first step in the process of bringing a discrimination lawsuit against an employer. The complaint alleges that the eight were discriminated against on the basis of race, colour, national origin and retaliation, stating that Latino workers \"are forced to work longer and less desirable hours\" than other people of colour, and alleging that the workers were not paid \"according to the terms of their contract\". Walmart said it acted as soon as it heard of the allegations against its suppliers. Lorenzo Lopez, a spokesman for the retail giant, said officials were on site within a week to conduct a preliminary investigation. \"While we were unable to complete a full investigation at that time, we did uncover violations of some supplier standards.\" Lopez added: \"We have suspended CJ's Seafood as a supplier, pending the outcome of the investigation.\" But Walmart's actions do not go far enough, according to Stephen Boykewich of the National Guestworkers Alliance. \"We do not need another investigation by Walmart. They need to end the contract with CJ's and meet with its workers,\" he said.",
