      "bodyText": "When controversial ticket reselling website Viagogo failed to show up for a select committee hearing this week, furious MPs were left wondering where to find the elusive company. The answer is in a nondescript office in a business park on the outskirts of the Irish city of Limerick. This is Viagogo\u2019s European operations centre, where more than 100 staff work at the hub of its multi-billion pound ticket resale empire. Executives here are just as wary of the limelight as they were of parliamentary scrutiny. When the Guardian asked the company to respond to questions, we were politely asked to leave. Later, an employee was speaking to our reporter outside the office when a manager appeared, stopped the conversation, and ushered him inside. Minutes later the staff member, who was actually very positive about working for the company, was whisked away from the building in the back of a taxi. Viagogo\u2019s shyness comes as no surprise given its refusal to face the music in parliament. In its absence, MPs on the department for culture, media and sport select committee accused the company \u2013 which takes a cut of up to 25% from reselling tickets, often provided by supertouts, and often before ordinary fans even have a chance to buy \u2013 of \u201cnaked mis-selling and fraud\u201d, \u201clying to the public\u201d and \u201ccontempt for parliament\u201d. If Viagogo was embarrassed by the accusations, it didn\u2019t show. Within 24 hours the company was up to its old tricks again. Some 11,000 miles away in Auckland, New Zealand, Maiz Marshall-Amai was learning all about Viagogo\u2019s business model. She had bought tickets to see British popstar Adele, picking seats in a wheelchair-accessible section near the stage. Instead, the tickets were up in the gallery, completely inaccessible to wheelchair users. In a poignant tribute to Adele, Marshall-Amai\u2019s friend Letitia Butler released a video riffing on one of the star\u2019s biggest hits. \u201cHello from the outside,\u201d she sang. \u201cYour biggest fans can\u2019t get inside.\u201d The Auckland episode extends a string of disturbing revelations about a company, whose founder Eric Baker has sought to portray himself as a consumer champion, protecting fans from touts and ticket fraud. Critics of the site suggest Viagogo is anything but a friend of the consumer. The site has been accused of \u201cmoral repugnance\u201d for seeking to profit from events in aid of cancer charities by popstar Ed Sheeran and comedian Peter Kay. It has been criticised for providing a conduit for touts to sell tickets at huge mark-ups to fans despite knowing that they might be denied entry. It was also faced allegations of breaching consumer rights laws and withholding refunds from overcharged customers. On the face of it, Viagogo should be more than capable of addressing the allegations levelled against it. Indeed, the company claims that none of the criticisms are valid because it does not even sell tickets \u2013 it just provides the platform. This multi-million dollar enterprise is technically based in Geneva, Switzerland, but also has a UK subsidiary called VGL Services with company\u2019s address listed as Cannon Street in London\u2019s financial district. When the Guardian visited this office last year, Viagogo\u2019s presence was disguised, a false name listed on hoardings in the foyer displaying the building\u2019s tenants. A second visit this week revealed that the company has packed up and left. People who work in the building say the company moved out in January, leaving no forwarding address. Viagogo\u2019s abrupt departure came just a month after the Competition and Markets Authority launched a probe into whether secondary ticketing companies are complying with consumer law. The company\u2019s exit will be a bitter blow for members of the Facebook Victim of Viagogo group. Claire Turnham, who gave evidence at the select committee, set up the group after she was overcharged by hundreds of pounds for an Ed Sheeran gig. She told MPs of group members who had been left physically sick with worry or struggling to make ends meet after buying tickets through Viagogo. Some of those who made the most noise on social media received refunds. Others were invited to relist their tickets on Viagogo instead, meaning the company would take a cut of the sale price.Still more victims were unable to elicit any response from the company at all. One group member, Rachael Ravenhill, did find a way of contacting Viagogo though. She started an online petition calling on the firm to reimburse victims. She swiftly received a call from the company, threatening her with legal action for using their logo in the petition. Many of the group have sent \u201cletters before action\u201d, a prelude to a suit in the small claims court, to the Cannon Street office. Where those letters are now is anybody\u2019s guess. The Viagogo empire is owned by founder Eric Baker\u2019s private company, Pugnacious Endeavors, located in Delaware, the US state famed for corporate secrecy and tax haven status. It seems unlikely that any correspondence sent to Viagogo will be sent on to Delaware. If MPs really want to speak to Viagogo\u2019s bosses, they could send their invitation to Limerick. Any executives based in the city could easily make their way to London via a \u00a335 Ryanair flight from nearby Shannon airport. But the company\u2019s record of failing to answer questions from disappointed customers, politicians and the media, suggests it is unlikely to take the opportunity. Viagogo declined a request for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 March 2017. An earlier version used the phrase \u201cwheelchair-bound\u201d, contravening our style guide.

      "bodyText": "The total pay of John Fallon, the chief executive of Pearson, increased by 20% last year, despite the FTSE 100 company reporting the biggest loss in its history and the prime minister, Theresa May, criticising boardroom excess. The world\u2019s largest educational publisher reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.6bn for 2016, but awarded Fallon \u00a31.5m including a \u00a3343,000 bonus. \u201cShareholders will be worried that despite the prime minister\u2019s call rethinking rewards for failure that the board has recommended this award,\u201d said Sarah Wilson, chief executive of investor advisory service Manifest. \u201cMany shareholders are automatically voting against any increased awards and so this will just ratchet up tension.\u201d In January almost \u00a32bn was wiped from Pearson\u2019s stock market value after it issued fifth profit warning in two years. The company said Fallon had received a cash bonus for hitting lower-end targets relating to operating profits. Fallon hit the operating profit target that triggered his bonus because Pearson had fared so poorly that it paid \u00a355m less than expected in overall management bonus payments. Fallon, who has pledged to use the bonus to buy shares in Pearson as a display of faith in the company, received 44% of his target bonus and just under a quarter of his maximum potential bonus. His total remuneration was up 20% on 2015\u2019s \u00a31.2m, a year when no bonus payouts were made to senior management because they failed to hit targets. Elizabeth Corley, chairman of Pearson\u2019s remuneration committee, said that, in light of the company\u2019s struggling performance, Fallon\u2019s \u00a3780,000 salary would be frozen for the second year running. In addition, the committee has substantially reduced the number of shares it will award to Fallon this year under its long-term incentive plan (LTIP), which will pay out in three years. \u201cIn acknowledgement of the value erosion in the Pearson share price, the remuneration committee intends to reduce the volume of 2017 LTIP awards to the executive directors such that their value is materially lower than prior practice,\u201d said Corley. \u201cIf current share price conditions were to continue, the committee might judge that the economic value of the 2017 LTIP grant would be reduced by in the region of 20-25%.\u201d Pearson\u2019s operating profit target was \u00a3630m-\u00a3670m including the positive boost from the drop in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote \u2013 its struggling North American higher education business accounts for about 45% of profits \u2013 with Fallon achieving \u00a3635m. This was 21% down year-on-year. \u201cThe Pearson board has decided John Fallon will receive a limited bonus, in line with the company\u2019s broader bonus policy, and reflecting Pearson achieving its 2016 profit and earnings per share guidance, delivering strong operating cash flow, and delivering a major restructuring successfully,\u201d said a spokesman. Fallon also cut 4,000 jobs, 10% of Pearson\u2019s global workforce, making more than \u00a3350m in cost savings. He has pocketed \u00a36.37m and delivered five profit warnings since taking over as chief executive from Marjorie Scardino in 2013, including \u00a31.8m in bonuses and incentive payments.. He was previously head of Pearson\u2019s international division. Alan MacDougall, managing director of investor advisory PIRC, said: \u201cWith Pearson\u2019s poor 10-year, five-year and one-year performance, the Pearson remuneration underscores PIRC\u2019s consistent position that remuneration policy is not working.\u201d In January the company slashed its profit forecast for this year by \u00a3180m to \u00a3570m-\u00a3630m, and scrapped its target of \u00a3800m for next year. It also said it was \u201crebasing\u201d its dividend policy. The company enjoyed a 24-year run of dividend increases between 1991 and 2015. Freezing the 2016 dividend and the cut to future payouts is a major blow to Fallon and senior management. The company is also selling its 47% stake in the world\u2019s largest book publisher, Penguin Random House, to strengthen its balance sheet. Fallon\u2019s pay increase came as the total pay of Mike Wells, chief executive of Prudential, dropped 30% to \u00a36.9m last year. The insurance group said the fall, which included a \u00a31.8m drop in payment to Wells under its LTIP, was due to a lower level of vesting of shares that date back to 2014 business performance. Anthony Nightingale, chairman of Prudential\u2019s remuneration committee, said the drop in pay came despite a \u201cstrong business performance\u201d and Wells\u2019s \u201cexceptional leadership and personal performance\u201d. Prudential\u2019s operating profit, its primary measure of performance, rose 7% to \u00a34.25bn, with double-digit growth in Asia.",

      "bodyText": "Get the cheese sauce on. Supermarkets are slashing the price of cauliflower because a relatively warm start to the year has produced a glut of florets. Farmers say they have been producing 50% to 100% more crop than usual in recent weeks. A new harvest of produce from Lincolnshire is about to come on the market, adding to stocks already coming from Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Suffolk. Morrisons is to cut cauliflower prices to 75p early next week, after Tesco cut its prices from \u00a31 to 79p this week. Asda cut its price to 70p on Thursday, compared with the 95p it was charging in late February. The glut comes after shortages of courgettes, spinach, lettuce and other leafy vegetables earlier this year when snow and wet weather in southern Spain held up harvests. Iceberg lettuces soared in price by nearly 70% as some supermarkets shipped them in from the US. Sources said supermarkets were struggling to clear cauliflower stocks despite a 12% rise in the number sold in the three months to the end of February compared with the same period the previous year, according to the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. The extra sales have been driven by cheaper prices and by a trend to serve cauliflower as a low-carb alternative. The fashion for clean eating has sparked demand for cauli rice and cauli couscous \u2013 basically cauliflower blasted in a food processor \u2013 and for cauliflowers to be roasted whole or cut into \u201csteaks\u201d. The warm spring has also put British-grown asparagus on shelves earlier than usual. The first spears of the season have already gone on sale at Marks &amp; Spencer. British asparagus is usually not in season until late April or early May but good weather combined with new early varieties and growing methods have helped produce an early crop. Richard Mowbray, commercial director of the vegetable grower TH Clements and vice-chairman of the Brassica Growers Association, said the cauliflower glut had been building up since November. Colder weather then delayed crops that should have been harvested earlier but have become ready to cut at the same time as later plantings. The weather has a big impact on the growth of cauliflower, which must be harvested within a short time frame \u2013 as little as a week \u2013 making it tricky to control stocks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a glut for three or four weeks now. The colder weather this week should slow it down, but we\u2019ve got maybe another week or so,\u201d Mowbray said. Tesco said it was buying 220,000 more cauliflowers from its producers this month \u2013 on top of the 400,000 it usually stocks \u2013 to help tackle the cauliflower mountain. Greville Richards, managing director of Southern England Farms based in Cornwall, said he had ploughed 40 to 50 acres of the 2,000 acres of cauliflowers he grows back into fields as supply had outstripped demand. But he has also been exporting cauliflower to northern Europe, including Denmark, and had sold more cauliflower than usual in the UK in January as crops expected to be supplied from Spain had been held back by poor weather there. Richards said it had been tricky dealing with the overstocks but he was \u201cfinancially pleased\u201d with his growing season. \u201cWe did win business when Spain was out of action and the lower exchange rates have helped exports,\u201d he said. Mowbray said he had also ploughed in some of his cauliflower crop and had frozen some but had been able to export nearly a fifth of his recent crop to Europe, mainly Scandinavia, as the fall in the value of the pound had made British produce more attractive.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, let\u2019s take a look at the markets. Wall Street is holding on to earlier gains while Europe is more of a mixed picture. Dow Jones: +0.3% at 20,715 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,353 FTSE 100: +0.02% at 7,342 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 12,062 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,018 STOXX 600: -0.3% at 376 Thank you for all your comments, and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM Data published earlier showed a bigger-than-expected rise in durable goods orders in February. Orders rose 1.7%, better than the 1.2% increase forecast by economists but a slowdown compared with January, when they were up 2.3%. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics: The 1.7% monthly rise in headline durable goods orders in February was helped by another strong rise in commercial aircraft orders, but the improvement in underlying orders provides further evidence that business equipment investment has continued to recover in the first quarter. ...despite the apparent weakness of real consumption, we still think that first-quarter GDP growth was probably close to 2% annualised. US firms reported the weakest rate of output growth in six months in March according to Markit\u2019s flash PMI index covering manufacturing and services. The headline index slipped to 53.2 from 54.12 in February, following a slowdown in growth in both services and manufacturing. Anything above 50 signals growth. Staff hiring eased and new business growth slowed. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the latest survey suggested US growth would slow in the first quarter: The US economy shifted down a gear in March. A slowing in the pace of growth signalled by the PMI surveys for a second straight month suggests that the economy is struggling to sustain momentum. The survey readings are consistent with annualised GDP growth of 1.7% in the first quarter, down from 1.9% in the final quarter of last year. Trading is underway and markets are slightly up ahead of the crucial vote on Trump\u2019s controversial healthcare bill. Dow Jones: +0.2% at 20,698 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,350 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 5,840 President Trump gives his closing sales pitch: As final preparations are underway for the EU\u2019s 60th birthday party in Rome on Saturday, it\u2019s not just Brexit that threatens to overshadow celebrations. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, has signalled that Athens intends to support the Rome Declaration - after previously threatening not to - but he has called for clearer support for Greece. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith reports: The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who arrived in Rome last night, reiterated that the anniversary could only be truly \u201ccelebrated\u201d in the knowledge that European achievements applied to all. In a letter to Jean-Claude Junker, the European Commission president, and EU council president Donald Tusk, Tsipras wrote: For the past seven years Greece has been in economic adjustment programs in the name of which exceptions have been imposed from a whole list of achievements in our common European project \u2026. we should know openly, officially and clearly if we also have the right to have access to these gains. In a speech last night the leftist leader stepped up his criticism telling an audience at La Sapienza university in Rome that Europe was embroiled in existential crisis because it had surrendered its accomplishments to the International Monetary Fund. We are at a critical moment because these days Greece is on the front line of a battle that concerns all of Europe. We are fighting to restore collective work agreements in our country, to end the exemption status now and for once and for all in the future. The troubled Co-operative Bank says it has received a number of serious approaches from potential buyers after putting itself up for sale in February in a bid to raise cash. In a bid to reassure its 4 million customers and creditors, the bank issued a statement earlier today: A number of credible strategic and financial parties have expressed interest in the sale process and are currently evaluating information on the bank. Read the full story here: The pound could fall by another 15% against the dollar and the euro this year according to Deutsche Bank. Currency analysts at the German bank said sterling could fall as low as $1.06 - from a current level of $1.2492 - as the Brexit process weighs on growth. Meanwhile it could fall towards parity with the euro. Commenting in a special report on Brexit, they wrote: We do not see sterling (currently) fully pricing a hard Brexit outcome. Combined with limited adjustment in the UK\u2019s current account deficit and slowing growth, we see further downside, and forecast $1.06 in by year-end. The Guardian\u2019s latest monthly analysis shows that the squeeze in UK living standards is on. The Brexit vote\u2019s blow to the pound is stoking inflation while pay packets are shrinking in real terms. My colleague Katie Allen explains: As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50 next week, kicking off the formal process of the UK leaving the EU, the economy continues to defy the doomsayers who predicted a sudden downturn after the referendum. But signs of a slowdown are now emerging as higher prices put pressure on companies and consumers alike. Nine months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows inflation is at its highest level for more than three years, retail sales have lost momentum and pay growth has slowed significantly despite the lowest unemployment rate for more than a decade. At 2.3% last month, inflation was the highest since September 2013 and above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. It is expected to rise further this year thanks to higher crude oil prices and because the weaker pound is making imports such as food ingredients and fuel more expensive. The latest official snapshot of living costs showed fuel cost 19% more this February than a year ago. Consumers also had to pay more for many groceries as a long period of food price deflation came to an end. The pound effect on imported food was compounded for some groceries by shortages after bad weather in southern Europe hit crops. The price of an iceberg lettuce, for example, jumped to an average 93p in February \u2013 from 54p in January \u2013 as supermarkets imposed restrictions on the number of lettuces per customer. Read the full story here: Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said the BBA report reflected the weaker backdrop facing consumers. There are signs of an underlying slowdown in unsecured consumer borrowing from the peak levels seen around last October, which ties in with the impression that consumers are becoming more cautious as their purchasing power is increasingly diluted by rising inflation. It looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will progressively weaken over the coming months with inflation rising markedly due to the weakened pound and companies likely increasingly looking to hold down pay to limit their total costs. Britain\u2019s high street banks approved 42,613 mortgages for house purchase (excluding remortgages) in February, which was a three-month low. The British Bankers\u2019 Association said the figure was 3.5% lower than January, and 4.6% lower than February 2016. Remortgaging numbers were also down. The annual growth in consumer credit slowed slightly to 6.6% in February from 6.7%, while growth in business borrowing slowed considerably to 0.9% from 2.1% in January. Eric Leenders, BBA Managing Director for Retail Banking said: \u201cElevated approval volumes for house purchases and re-mortgaging experienced during the winter months fell back in February, to average levels seen throughout most of last year. Consumers\u2019 use of credit cards and personal loans reflect last month\u2019s increased spending figures. \u201cBusinesses continue to exercise a cautious approach to borrowing, using cash reserves and alternative lending sources to finance their operations.\u201d The latest comments from a Bank of England policymaker are helping to drive the pound lower this morning. Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, has said that rising inflation does not automatically mean rates will rise. In an interview with the Times(\u00a3), he said inflationary pressure is being driven by the fall in the value of the pound, and he expects inflation to peak at about 3% by the end of the year before starting to fall. If it turns out the pass through of exchange rate to inflation is faster than our baseline estimate, that would mean inflation might go higher to 3 or even 3.5%. But it would also mean it would come down faster afterwards. It is not at all obvious what the impact for monetary policy would be and it might not have one. If that is the reason why inflation is higher than expected, it does not necessarily have an impact unless it also feeds in to inflation expectations. If inflation is higher than expected because we think there is a general pick-up, then it is not just the exchange rate doing the work. That is absolutely something we need to respond to and I will be joining the response to that. He said he would need to see evidence of strong wage growth before he would consider voting for a rate rise. And as we know, strong wage growth is not a feature of the economy at the current time: The pound has not managed to hold on to gains made yesterday, when it was boosted by a stronger-than-expected jump in February retail sales. Against the dollar, the pound is down 0.2% at $1.249 Sterling is down 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.1561 Reaction to the stronger-than-expected eurozone data is coming in. Bert Colijn, a senior eurozone economist at ING: While political uncertainty in the eurozone itself and among its larger trade partners continues to be high, sentiment among eurozone businesses about activity in the coming year continues to improve. There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic though, as businesses indicate continued increases in new orders, the strongest output growth in near six years and employment is growing at a pace not seen for almost a decade. The acceleration of job growth will underpin improvements in domestic demand in the months ahead, which is in line with this month\u2019s strong consumer confidence figures. Stephen Brown, European economist at Capital Economics, says the PMI suggests that the economy might have had its best quarter in two years: After a strong rise in March the euro-zone Composite PMI suggests that the economy might have had its strongest quarter in two years in Q1. In all then, some encouraging news for the region. But while the output prices index increased further, there is still slack in the labour market and wage growth is set to remain subdued. As such, policymakers at the European Central Bank are unlikely to be convinced that recent signs of a pick-up in activity will translate into sustained upward pressure on inflation. The eurozone economy grew at the fastest rate in almost six years in March according to a survey of firms across the whole region. The flash PMI index measuring services and manufacturing output rose to 56.7 from 56 in February, taking it to the highest level since April 2011. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a small dip in the index, to 55.8 (where anything above 50 signals growth). As demand in the sectors picked up, firms hired workers at the fastest rate since July 2007. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the survey suggested the eurozone was on course for a decent start to the second quarter of 2017: The acceleration in growth towards the end of the quarter, as well as improving trends in new business and an increased appetite to hire, suggest that strong growth momentum will be sustained into the second quarter. Here are the specific numbers for those stronger-than-expected German and French PMIs. (Anything above 50 indicates growth.) Germany\u2019s flash composite* PMI rose to 57 in March from 56 .1 in February. In France, the composite PMI rose to 57.6 in March from 55.9 in February. Both signalled the fastest rate of growth since May 2011. *composite combines the services and manufacturing sector. The broad picture appears to that Europe\u2019s two largest economies performed well in March, providing a boost to the overall performance in the third quarter. Closely-watched surveys from Germany and France suggest Europe\u2019s two largest economies enjoyed a strong March. Growth accelerated in the manufacturing and services sectors in both countries compared with February according to the Markit PMI surveys, beating economists\u2019 expectations. Taking the two sectors together, the PMIs suggested the private sectors in both Germany and France grew at the fastest rate in almost six years. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, said the surveys suggested Germany\u2019s economy would grow at a faster rate in the first quarter than it did in the final quarter of 2016 (0.4%). The March flash PMI results rounded off a strong first quarter for the Germany economy, which enters the spring growing at the fastest rate in nearly six years. The PMI data strongly suggest that economic growth will accelerate in the first quarter. Commenting on the French data, Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit said: These numbers paint a rosy picture of the French private sector, as we start to see the effect of various governmental reforms enacted over the last few years. Meanwhile, a high level of business optimism continues to have a positive influence on firms hiring decisions, and can be attributed to a widespread expectation of pro-business policies after May\u2019s presidential elections. Caution on Wall Street last night has carried through to Europe this morning as a subdued trading session gets underway. Here are the early scores: FTSE 100: -0.02% at 7,339 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,034 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,017 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 20,113 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 10,291 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 377 Investors are in wait and see mode as Trump engages in a major standoff with his fellow Republicans over the controversial healthcare bill to replace Obamacare. Here\u2019s our full story on Trump\u2019s ultimatum: Wall Street closed down last down but it could have been a lot worse after Trump had to admit defeat (for the time being at least) on the US healthcare bill, which seeks to replace Obamacare. Trump took gamble on Thursday by issuing an ultimatum: pass the bill in its current form or we\u2019re sticking with Obamacare. The Dow Jones was pretty much flat at the close, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.1% and the Nasdaq closed down 0.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Another day, another wait to see if Donald Trump\u2019s healthcare bill will pass muster after delays on Thursday. Markets are nervous that a failure could dent Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans, which have been boosting share values ever since the election. But it may not be that simple. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: A validation would ... grant Trump the credibility on his ability to pass through his fiscal policies, including tax reforms and large infrastructure spending. An eventual failure could let down investors, yet it is worth noting that the major market focus is still on the US\u2019 fiscal plans and the Trump administration could carry on with its expansive fiscal plans regardless of a disappointment on the health-care bill. Meanwhile the eurozone is back in focus, or at least France and Germany. Initial readings for the manufacturing and service sectors for the two countries in March are due shortly. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: We get to see whether the recent economic recovery in France and Germany has maintained its traction from January and February, with the latest flash PMI\u2019s for March in the manufacturing and services sectors. France in particular saw a strong performance in the services sector in February, and this looks like it could well be sustained in March with only a slight slowdown expected to 56.2 from 56.4. Manufacturing remains a slight laggard, but is still expected to come in at 52.4. German activity is expected to show similarly steady numbers of 56.6 for manufacturing and 54.5 for services. Later come US durable goods orders. Meanwhile here are the opening calls for European markets, courtesy of IG:",

Markets are nervous that a failure could dent Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans, which have been boosting share values ever since the election. But it may not be that simple. Ipek Ozkardeskaya,<strong> s</strong>enior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A validation would ... grant Trump the credibility on his ability to pass through his fiscal policies, including tax reforms and large infrastructure spending. An eventual failure could let down investors, yet it is worth noting that the major market focus is still on the US\u2019 fiscal plans and the Trump administration could carry on with its expansive fiscal plans regardless of a disappointment on the health-care bill.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile the eurozone is back in focus, or at least France and Germany. Initial readings for the manufacturing and service sectors for the two countries in March are due shortly. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We get to see whether the recent economic recovery in France and Germany has maintained its traction from January and February, with the latest flash PMI\u2019s for March in the manufacturing and services sectors. </p> <p>France in particular saw a strong performance in the services sector in February, and this looks like it could well be sustained in March with only a slight slowdown expected to 56.2 from 56.4.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cadbury has said it may have to raise prices or shrink the size of its products after Brexit, but has committed to staying in the UK. Glenn Caton, who is in charge of Cadbury in Britain, told the Guardian the company would change and adapt to the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and that the country would still be the \u201chome of chocolate manufacturing\u201d. Caton said the first focus would be on boosting productivity, but that the company may eventually have to pass on higher costs to customers by raising prices or shrinkflation - selling smaller products for the same price. He said the brand would have to make these changes to protect the quality and taste of its chocolate. Cadbury would always \u201cput the consumer at the heart and never compromise on quality and taste,\u201d he added. Caton is the president of the northern Europe division of Mondel\u0113z International, the US owner of Cadbury. The firm fell into American hands when it was controversially bought by Kraft for \u00a312bn in 2010. Kraft then split into two companies. One business retained the Kraft name and focuses on US groceries, including its famous cheese products, while the other was renamed Mondel\u0113z and owns confectionery and snacks brands including Cadbury, Toblerone and Oreo. As part of Mondel\u0113z, Cadbury has experienced a number of public relations gaffes, from changing the Creme Egg recipe to putting round corners on Dairy Milk bars and allegedly paying little tax. In recent months it has come under fire for changing the shape of Toblerone and increasing the space between the chocolate triangles so that there is less chocolate in a bar. It has also increased the price of Freddo chocolate bars by 20%. Caton, however, insists Mondel\u0113z is good for Cadbury and that the US company has invested more than \u00a3200m in the business, including \u00a375m on modernising manufacturing at Bournville in Birmingham, the home of the brand. \u201cI passionately believe we are fantastic guardians of the legacy of Cadbury and all of our other brands, and we are great owners of this business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe investment that we have put in it in the last five years proves it. Our commitment to quality is absolute. I think this is really modern British manufacturing at its best.\u201d Caton also defended the tax Mondel\u0113z pays. The company paid no corporation tax in the UK in 2015 and 2014, the last years for which figures are available. He said: \u201cThe simple thing on tax is we pay all of the taxes in an absolutely above-board legal way according to the regulations of parts of the world that we operate in. We do pay, as a company, billions of dollars in tax on a global basis.\u201d Cadbury was founded in 1824. Caton, who joined Mondel\u0113z in July 2013 from Direct Wines, said investing in Cadbury had paid off: \u201cWe have significantly improved productivity and competitiveness. If you go back five to 10 years ago it was costing roughly three times as much to make chocolate in the UK as it was in Germany. It required investment in order to make sure that we increased productivity and were competitive globally, and we are now.\u201d As well as being a factory, Bournville is also Mondel\u0113z\u2019s global centre for chocolate research and development, with the team growing from 25 to 250 over the last five years. There is also a factory in Sheffield that makes Jelly Babies, Trebor mints and Ritz crackers, and a global food science facility in Reading. According to Caton, none of that will change when the UK leaves the EU. He said: \u201cIt [the UK] is still going to be a huge market. It is still going to be the home of chocolate manufacturing, it is still going to be the home of global research and development. We are still going to have Reading as the centre of science. None of that changes. \u201cThere are obviously challenges and there are three things that we really care about in the context of the Brexit negotiations. First of all is making sure we have a stable and thriving UK economy. If the economy is growing all businesses benefit from that. The second is ensuring that there is no new, more complex regulation and that there is free movement of goods and minimal barriers to trade. Regulation impacts complexity, complexity impacts costs, as do trade barriers and tariffs. \u201cThe third area is skills. We have 50-odd different nationalities in our research and development centre in Bournville and we do want security for those people. So we want EU nationals who are working here and living here to have the security that they can continue to do so.\u201d If the Brexit deal does not deliver those three things, Caton says the company will have to adapt. \u201cAll we can do is to move to the times that we face. I am confident though because a \u00a3200m investment in the last five years is not something we are going to walk away from. I can\u2019t guarantee anything forever but am I confident that we are still going to have world-class manufacturing and research sites in the UK for the long term? I do feel confident of that.\u201d The UK\u2019s incredible shrinking chocolate A Cadbury Freddo bar is basically just one big mouthful, but its price has recently jumped 20%. This month the recommended retail price of the chocolate frogs, which weigh 18g (0.6oz), leapt from 25p to 30p. Mondel\u0113z caused a furore when it revealed a new-look Toblerone with wider gaps between its distinctive triangular chunks. The ruse reduced 400g bars to 360g and 170g bars to 150g. The price did not change. Cadbury sparked an Easter egg hunt when a pack of six Creme Eggs was whittled down to five with only a slight decrease in the recommended retail price from \u00a33.05 to \u00a32.85. Mr Kipling has also become less generous this year, serving up eight rather than nine Angel Slices in a pack. Made by Premier Foods, the smaller packs have a recommended price of \u00a32.25, down from \u00a32.39. Zoe Wood",

      "body": "<p>Cadbury has said it may have to raise prices or shrink the size of its products after Brexit, but has committed to staying in the UK.</p> <p>Glenn Caton, who is in charge of Cadbury in Britain, told the Guardian the company would change and adapt to the terms of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Britain\u2019s exit from the EU</a> and that the country would still be the \u201chome of chocolate manufacturing\u201d. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/24/brexit-economy-uk-living-standards-prices-real-pay\">Brexit economy: UK faces squeeze on living standards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Caton said the first focus would be on boosting productivity, but that the company may eventually have to pass on higher costs to customers by raising prices or shrinkflation - selling smaller products for the same price. </p> <p>He said the brand would have to make these changes to protect the quality and taste of its chocolate. Cadbury would always \u201cput the consumer at the heart and never compromise on quality and taste,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Caton is the president of the northern Europe division of Mondel\u0113z International, the US owner of Cadbury. The firm fell into American hands when it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/19/cadbury-board-agrees-kraft-sale\">controversially bought by Kraft for \u00a312bn in 2010</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/04/kraft-to-split-in-two\">Kraft then split into two companies</a>. One business retained the Kraft name and focuses on US groceries, including its famous cheese products, while the other was renamed Mondel\u0113z and owns confectionery and snacks brands including Cadbury, Toblerone and Oreo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2017/mar/24/how-has-the-brexit-vote-affected-the-uk-economy-march-verdict\">How has the Brexit vote affected the UK economy? March verdict</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of Mondel\u0113z, Cadbury has experienced a number of public relations gaffes, from changing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/12/shellshock-cadbury-comes-clean-on-creme-egg-chocolate-change\">Creme Egg recipe</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/oct/01/cadbury-dairy-milk-rounded-chunks-chocolate-sweeter\">putting round corners on Dairy Milk</a> bars and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/06/cadburys-owner-paid-no-uk-tax-last-year\">allegedly paying little tax</a>. In recent months it has come under fire for changing the shape of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gets-more-gappy-but-its-fans-are-not-happy\">Toblerone and increasing the space between the chocolate triangles</a> so that there is less chocolate in a bar. It has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/toblerone-maker-mondolez-hike-price-cadbury-bars-freddo\">increased the price of Freddo chocolate bars by 20%.</a></p> <p>Caton, however, insists Mondel\u0113z is good for Cadbury and that the US company has invested more than \u00a3200m in the business, including \u00a375m on modernising manufacturing at Bournville in Birmingham, the home of the brand.</p> <p>\u201cI passionately believe we are fantastic guardians of the legacy of Cadbury and all of our other brands, and we are great owners of this business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe investment that we have put in it in the last five years proves it. Our commitment to quality is absolute. I think this is really modern British manufacturing at its best.\u201d</p> <p>Caton also defended the tax Mondel\u0113z pays. The company paid no corporation tax in the UK in 2015 and 2014, the last years for which figures are available. He said: \u201cThe simple thing on tax is we pay all of the taxes in an absolutely above-board legal way according to the regulations of parts of the world that we operate in. We do pay, as a company, billions of dollars in tax on a global basis.\u201d</p> <p>Cadbury was founded in 1824. Caton, who joined Mondel\u0113z in July 2013 from Direct Wines, said investing in Cadbury had paid off: \u201cWe have significantly improved productivity and competitiveness. If you go back five to 10 years ago it was costing roughly three times as much to make chocolate in the UK as it was in Germany. It required investment in order to make sure that we increased productivity and were competitive globally, and we are now.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/24/brexit-vote-experts-data-bank-of-england\">'The Brexit vote is starting to have major negative consequences' \u2013 experts debate the data</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as being a factory, Bournville is also Mondel\u0113z\u2019s global centre for chocolate research and development, with the team growing from 25 to 250 over the last five years. There is also a factory in Sheffield that makes Jelly Babies, Trebor mints and Ritz crackers, and a global food science facility in Reading. </p> <p>According to Caton, none of that will change when the UK leaves the EU. He said: \u201cIt [the UK] is still going to be a huge market. It is still going to be the home of chocolate manufacturing, it is still going to be the home of global research and development. We are still going to have Reading as the centre of science. None of that changes.</p> <p>\u201cThere are obviously challenges and there are three things that we really care about in the context of the Brexit negotiations. First of all is making sure we have a stable and thriving UK economy. If the economy is growing all businesses benefit from that. The second is ensuring that there is no new, more complex regulation and that there is free movement of goods and minimal barriers to trade. Regulation impacts complexity, complexity impacts costs, as do trade barriers and tariffs. </p> <p>\u201cThe third area is skills. We have 50-odd different nationalities in our research and development centre in Bournville and we do want security for those people. So we want EU nationals who are working here and living here to have the security that they can continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>If the Brexit deal does not deliver those three things, Caton says the company will have to adapt. \u201cAll we can do is to move to the times that we face. I am confident though because a \u00a3200m investment in the last five years is not something we are going to walk away from. I can\u2019t guarantee anything forever but am I confident that we are still going to have world-class manufacturing and research sites in the UK for the long term? I do feel confident of that.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The UK\u2019s incredible shrinking chocolate</strong></p> <p>A Cadbury Freddo bar is basically just one big mouthful, but <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2017/jan/12/toblerone-maker-mondolez-hike-price-cadbury-bars-freddo\">its price has recently jumped 20%</a>. This month the recommended retail price of the chocolate frogs, which weigh 18g (0.6oz), leapt from 25p to 30p.</p> <p></p> <p>Mondel\u0113z <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gets-more-gappy-but-its-fans-are-not-happy\">caused a furore</a> when it revealed a new-look Toblerone with wider gaps between its distinctive triangular chunks. The ruse reduced 400g bars to 360g and 170g bars to 150g. The price did not change.</p> <p>Cadbury sparked an Easter egg hunt when <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jan/12/-sp-the-cadburys-creme-egg-scandal-how-to-stage-a-chocolate-revolution\">a pack of six Creme Eggs </a>was whittled down to five with only a slight decrease in the recommended retail price from \u00a33.05 to \u00a32.85.</p> <p>Mr Kipling has also become less generous this year, serving up eight rather than nine Angel Slices in a pack. <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/nov/15/cost-of-cake-set-to-rise-says-mr-kipling-maker\">Made by Premier Foods</a>, the smaller packs have a recommended price of \u00a32.25, down from \u00a32.39.</p> <p><strong>Zoe Wood</strong></p> <ul> <br> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "A second cycle courier has won the right to paid holidays and minimum pay in a ruling that could cause major upheaval in the gig economy. The central London employment tribunal ruled that Excel, a courier company which is now part of CitySprint, had unlawfully failed to award Andrew Boxer holiday pay and wrongly classed him as an independent contractor. The company was ordered to pay him a week\u2019s holiday pay or \u00a3321.16. Judge Joanna Wade said the contract Boxer had signed \u201cdid not reflect the reality of the situation\u201d and he had signed it because he had no choice. \u201cThe inequality of bargaining power at this point was very notable,\u201d she said in a two-page ruling. Wade said that she had found Boxer was classed as a worker and not an independent contractor because he was required to work five days a week under the Excel controller, he was paid a non-negotiable fixed rate for his work and played no part in calculating that pay. Boxer could not take time off without notice, was expected to wait between jobs and not take a break when he was needed. Workers employed under a contract in which they must always turn up for work even if they don\u2019t want to, are entitled to employment rights including the national living wage, holiday pay and protection against discrimination. They are not, however, guaranteed other benefits including sick pay and maternity leave that employees are entitled to. A self-employed independent contractor receives no entitlement to employment rights beyond a basic health and safety and anti-discrimination framework. The Boxer case, which Excel did not contest \u2013 the firm is in liquidation and was taken over by CitySprint last year \u2013 adds to pressure on courier companies to change their way of working. Boxer\u2019s case is the latest in a string of tribunals against gig economy employers including the taxi hailing service Uber, and the second of four relating to couriers\u2019 employment status backed by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB). The next case, against eCourier, is due to be heard in May. The fourth is against Addison Lee. Wade is overseeing all four IWGB cases. She ruled in January ruled that CitySprint had wrongly classed the courier Mags Dewhurst as a self-employed freelancer. CitySprint is planning to appeal. Jason Moyer-Lee, the head of the IWGB, said he planned to write to eCourier and Addison Lee asking them to concede. \u201cThese courier companies all operate in the same way and I can\u2019t see how they can convince the same judge that they are an exception,\u201d he said. \u201cThis judgment is yet further evidence of what we have known to be true all along. Courier companies are unlawfully depriving their workers of rights.\u201d The widespread use of self-employed workers is the subject of an inquiry by MPs. The prime minister has also commissioned Tony Blair\u2019s former policy officer Matthew Taylor to look into the matter. Moyer-Lee said: \u201cWe are calling on the government to step up enforcement of workers\u2019 employment rights. Companies like Excel can unlawfully deprive workers of their rights for years and the only financial cost is \u00a3321.16. For a company like this that is not a deterrent.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank has confirmed that a number of \u201ccredible\u201d potential buyers have expressed an interest in the troubled bank, as fears grow that it will be broken up rather than sold as an ongoing entity. Co-op Bank, which is controlled by US hedge funds, put itself up for sale in February in a bid to raise more capital and give greater stability to its 4 million customers. In a statement, it said: \u201cA number of credible strategic and financial parties have expressed interest in the sale process and are currently evaluating information on the bank.\u201d According to sources close to the bank, the sales process is currently for a 100% purchase of the bank only, and no parties are being invited to bid for parcels of the bank\u2019s business. In its statement, Co-op said: \u201cThe bank plans to proceed to a second phase of the sale process where selected parties will be provided with additional information in order to continue their due diligence with a view to making an offer for all of the issued ordinary share capital of the bank.\u201d But Co-op added that despite expressions of interest, there was no certainty that an offer would be forthcoming. The bank said that it was also talking with existing capital providers and new investors on raising more capital. It has set a deadline of the first half of April for bidders to submit preliminary expressions of interest. But many of the banks cited as potential buyers of the bank in its entirety have faded away. There was initial speculation of a bid from TSB\u2019s parent company, Spanish lender Sabadell, but a move has since been ruled out. Attention is now turning to investment firms and vulture funds which are keen to buy up parts but not all of the business. One City source told Reuters that \u201ca break-up of the bank is inevitable,\u201d citing private equity outfits Cerberus and Apollo as potential buyers. But other sources close to the Co-op said the reports of a break-up are being driven by funds with an agenda to grab the bank\u2019s assets on the cheap. Breaking up the bank, into a \u201cgood bank\u201d and a \u201cbad bank\u201d holding most of the bad debts, would enable bidders from specialist banks to purchase parcels of loans and customers. But it would create intense uncertainty among the bank\u2019s customers and its remaining workforce of 3,895, down by half since the bank\u2019s near collapse in 2013. Trading in the bank\u2019s bonds, which are seen as an indicator of the bank\u2019s survival prospects, suggests that hopes for a full takeover deal are fading. The value of the bank\u2019s bonds fell to fresh lows on Friday, suggesting that investors have taken little reassurance from the bank\u2019s official statement in the morning. It has emerged that the Bank of England has placed Co-op Bank under \u201cintensive supervision\u201d with contingency plans to ensure an \u201corderly failure\u201d if a sale or fresh capital raising is not agreed. A failure to agree a deal will mean that Co-op is put into \u201cresolution\u201d by the Bank of England. This process, based on a blueprint drawn up in the wake of the financial crisis, would involve transferring some of the bank\u2019s business to a third party or forcing bondholders to recapitalise the firm with a \u201cbail-in\u201d. The firm is then restructured and stabilised. However, customers would remain protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees deposits up to the value of \u00a385,000. The 150-year old, ethically-minded bank failed a Bank of England stress test in 2014, and recently reported a \u00a3477m full-year loss. Problems at the Co-op Bank emerged in 2013, four years after its disastrous takeover of the Britannia building society. It was discovered that the bank, then 100% owned by the Co-operative Group of supermarkets and funeral homes, needed \u00a31.5bn. Paul Flowers, its former chairman, was later fined for possessing cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and was dismissed as a minister by the Methodist church earlier this year. The troubles at the bank left a cloud over the co-operative sector and put the Co-op Group under huge financial pressure. It now owns just 20% of the lender and said in February that it was \u201csupportive of the plan to find the bank a new home\u201d. The mutual has 2 million members who are bank customers. When it put itself up for sale in February, it said: \u201cOur goal is to ensure the continued provision of the type of co-operative banking products our members want.\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Broadband and landline customers who suffer poor service could get millions of pounds of money back automatically under a scheme proposed by Ofcom. The telecom watchdog has published proposals to make providers pay for slow repairs and missed deadlines and appointments. It estimates that as many as 2.6 million customers could receive up to a total of \u00a3185m in compensation payments each year under the scheme. \u201cWhen a customer\u2019s landline or broadband goes wrong, that is frustrating enough, without having to fight tooth and nail to get fair compensation from the provider,\u201d said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom\u2019s consumer group director. \u201cWe\u2019re proposing new rules to force providers to pay money back to customers automatically, whenever repairs or installations don\u2019t happen on time, or when people wait in for an engineer who doesn\u2019t turn up. \u201cThis would mean customers are properly compensated, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service.\u201d Ofcom has launched a consultation on its proposals, which would see customers receive automatic compensation in the form of a cash payment or credit to their bill for failings in three specific areas: If a customer\u2019s landline or broadband is not fixed quickly enough. If new services are not up and running on the day promised. If an engineer fails to arrive for a scheduled appointment. Ofcom said it would set payments \u201cdesigned to reflect the degree of harm suffered by consumers\u201d, and gave a number of examples. If a broadband connection or landline is not fully fixed after two working days the provider would have to pay \u00a310 a day until it is repaired. If an engineer does not turn up for an appointment or cancels with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice, the payment would be \u00a330. If a provider fails to start a service on the agreed date, it would have to pay \u00a36 for each day of delay, including the missed start date. Richard Neudegg, the head of regulation at the price comparison service uSwitch, said: \u201cWe welcome Ofcom\u2019s proposals as this will firmly place the impetus on providers to keep to their word. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pretend the level of compensation proposed \u2013 \u00a330 per missed appointment for example \u2013 will be enough to make up for missing a day\u2019s work. But, even at a modest level of compensation per user, the collective financial burden on providers will increase the pressure to improve service.\u201d BT, Sky and Virgin Media have jointly put forward a draft proposal to introduce automatic compensation through a voluntary industry code of practice, but Ofcom said \u201cat this stage, we do not consider that this proposal sufficiently meets our concerns when quality of service falls short\u201d. The industry scheme offered to pay a minimum of \u00a33 a day for missed service activation, half what Ofcom is proposing. And \u00a33 a day for delays to repairs starting three days after any loss of service is reported, less than a third of Ofcom\u2019s proposed \u00a36 a day starting from two working days after a loss of service is reported. A missed engineering appointment would carry a charge of \u00a320, compared to Ofcom\u2019s \u00a330. Other broadband and landline providers including TalkTalk and Vodafone did not sign up to the industry proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s important that customers are treated fairly when services can\u2019t be delivered, but this is best achieved through a robust industry-led approach,\u201d said a spokesman for Virgin Media. \u201cThe industry is working together on ambitious reforms that would incentivise communications providers to compete to provide customers with a better service, while also setting minimum standards that providers would have to meet.\u201d Ofcom based its potential estimate of \u00a3185m in annual compensation payments on figures showing that there are currently 7.2m instances a year in which customers suffer delayed repairs, missed appointments or late installations. Only 1.1m were compensated, with a total payout of \u00a316.3m. \u201cCompensation payments are currently given ad-hoc to only a minority of those suffering problems [in up to 15% of cases], and can fail to adequately reflect the harm caused,\u201d Ofcom said. The minister of state for digital and culture, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cToo many people are suffering from poor customer service when things go wrong with their broadband and phone lines. These changes will help make sure people are not cut off from friends, family and work for days on end, and are properly compensated if problems aren\u2019t fixed quickly enough.\u201d Ofcom\u2019s research also shows that 5.7 million consumers experience a loss of landline or broadband service each year. Engineers fail to turn up to around 250,000 appointments a year and about 1.3 million people are affected by late installations. Ofcom said its proposed compensation scheme does not apply to mobile services as they \u201calready make significant compensation payments to customers\u201d and its research showd that less than 1% of customers lose service for more than 24 hours. \u201cBroadband has become a modern-day essential, so it is only right that consumers should get compensation when their provider fails to deliver,\u201d said Alex Neill, the managing director of home services at Which? \u201cOfcom now needs to swiftly push ahead with these proposals and ensure that this and other measures help to significantly improve the service that broadband customers receive.\u201d The move comes in the same week that Ofcom fined BT-owned Plusnet \u00a3880,000 for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers more than \u00a3500,000 even though they had cancelled their accounts. In February, Ofcom sharply criticised providers for offering landline-only customers poor value for money, and unveiled plans to force BT, the dominant provider, to cut bills by at least \u00a35 a month, benefiting about 2.3 million people.",
