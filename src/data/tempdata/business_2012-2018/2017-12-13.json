      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, moved to raise interest rates again on Wednesday in her final major act as head of the US central bank. After a two-day meeting, the Fed cited the \u201cstrong\u201d jobs market and growth in household and business spending in its decision to raise rates a quarter point to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. In news that will be cheered by the Trump administration, the Fed also predicted stronger economic growth over the next three years. The Fed revised its forecast for growth in 2018 to 2.5%, well above its previous forecast of 2.1% published in September. The Trump administration is pushing through an ambitious $1.5tn tax package that it claims will be paid for by economic growth. At her final press conference, Yellen said the Fed\u2019s committee had discussed the Republican plan but that their revised growth estimates included other factors and \u201cshould not be viewed as an estimate of the impact of the tax package\u201d. Trump has said his tax package will increase growth to 4%, a figure Yellen described as \u201cchallenging\u201d. The decision was not unanimous. Two Fed board members, Charles Evans and Neel Kashkari, voted to leave rates unchanged. But Yellen\u2019s replacement, Jerome Powell, signed up to the hike, continuing an unbroken record of voting with the Fed chair. The rise is the fifth increase since the Fed cut rates to close to zero in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Yellen has overseen the Fed\u2019s strategy of slowly returning to more normal interest rate levels and Powell is expected to oversee further rises in 2018. The low rate policy was introduced in order to encourage investment after the financial crisis plunged the world into recession. The official unemployment rate is now 4.1%, a 17-year low, and the Fed expects that rate to fall below 4% by the end of 2018. \u201cInformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further,\u201d the Fed statement said. \u201cConsequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong.\u201d Yellen was appointed by Barack Obama in 2013 and has served just one term as Fed chair. She is the first woman to have served as head of the central bank. Yellen was asked about the lack of diversity at the Fed and said the bank had struggled to broaden the background of its hires. \u201cFrom my own experience, I have found economics to be a terrific field,\u201d she said. Presidents have traditionally reappointed their predecessor\u2019s Fed pick, but in November Donald Trump moved to replace Yellen with Powell, a former investment banker for the Carlyle Group and the richest member of the Fed\u2019s board. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: \u201cIt\u2019s one final pull of the interest rate lever for Yellen as she departs from her position as chair. The move is a clear sign that the US economy is back on track to a full recovery. We are near full employment, domestic growth has been strong and the economy is benefitting from a synchronized global recovery.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The combination of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse was billed as \u201ca genuine merger of equals\u201d back in May 2014, in the sense that the two sets of shareholders each got 50% of the new company. In every other respect, however, the merger now looks completely lopsided. The Dixons electricals side has enjoyed a great run, defying predictions it would be overtaken by Amazon or even AO World. Like-for-like sales in the half-year to the end of October improved 7%. At Carphone, however, the formula looks broken. Sebastian James, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, didn\u2019t put it quite like that, but it was the implication of his vague promise \u201cto adapt our model in order to cement our place in a changing world\u201d. What\u2019s he actually going to do? Come back in 2018 to find out, but the problem plainly requires something more radical that simply shutting a few stores. In Carphone\u2019s glory days, customers were happy to sign two- or three-year deals where the cost of the handset was spread across the life of a contract that also included a data allowance. These days, more of us know exactly which handset we want, then we lease it and then we buy a separate data package. The net effect is that pricing has become more transparent, which spells bad news for the retailer in the middle. \u201cWe believe that we can, over time, reduce the complexity and capital intensity of our mobile business model, and increase the simplicity and profitability of what we do,\u201d said James. Well, maybe, but the other problem is that people are upgrading their phones less often because the top models cost almost \u00a31,000. That factor is outside Carphone\u2019s control. For the time being, the promise to reform Carphone satisfied the City. Group half-year profits plunged to \u00a361m but the prediction of \u00a3360m-\u00a3400m for the full year was no worse than signalled in August\u2019s warning. Shares rose 8%. Take a step back, though, and they have fallen 45% since the all-share merger. Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone who owns 11.6% of the combined beast, obviously won\u2019t be happy, but he should be grateful for small mercies. If he hadn\u2019t diluted his Carphone exposure with a helping of Dixons\u2019 business, his position would be worse. Ofwat\u2019s transparent problem Water regulator Ofwat always describes its five-yearly price reviews as \u201ctough\u201d on the privatised utilities \u2013 it would be a laughing stock if it said it was being soft \u2013 but this time it has a tangible boast. It has used an average cost of capital for the companies of 2.4%, which it says would be a record low for regulated utilities. As a result, customers\u2019 bills should fall by \u00a315-\u00a325 a year from 2020 to 2025. Jolly good, but you\u2019ll struggle to find hard evidence in the dense document that Ofwat is delivering on its other promise to get tough on opaque financing structures that baffle customers. Ofwat chairman Jonson Cox clearly understands the importance of the issue. \u201cIn using financial engineering to increase debt and pay high returns to investors, a small handful of companies have led the public to question whether these structures are fit for public service assets,\u201d he wrote in the Times this week. But where\u2019s the bite? Ofwat\u2019s approach is mostly to prod and cajole, and seek \u201cassurances\u201d about transparency. It has had some success, it might be said, since Thames Water and Yorkshire Water have pledged to dismantle their Cayman Islands subsidiaries. But those corporate rejigs surely owe more to Labour\u2019s nationalisation drum beat. Why is it so hard for Ofwat to define exactly what counts as useful disclosure and to set out the penalties for non-compliance? Bank of England goes all PC Here\u2019s news to upset the usual suspects: the Bank of England is going more PC than the bleedin\u2019 Guardian in its removal of gendered language. Threadneedle Street will amend titles in its rulebook that refer to the \u201cchairman\u201d and use \u201cchair\u201d instead. By contrast, \u201cchair\u201d is merely deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d in place of chairman or chairwoman in this paper\u2019s style guide. References to individuals\u2019 roles will become \u201chis/her\u201d at the Bank and \u201cgrandfathering\u201d rights \u2013 describing exclusions from new rules, for example \u2013 will become \u201cconversion\u201d rights. It all sounds sensible. Many public bodies made the switch years ago. The sky will not fall in. But before applauding too loudly, let\u2019s just check the makeup of the Bank\u2019s two most important committees. The financial policy committee comprises 12 men and no women. On the monetary policy committee, the score is 8-1, with no prizes for guessing the he/she arrangement.",

    "webTitle": "Fall in employment rate spells end of UK jobs boom", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s long jobs boom appears to have come to an end after official figures showed the number of people in work fell by 56,000 in the three months ending in October. The Office for National Statistics said an upswing that began in 2012, and persisted for a year after the vote to leave the EU, had petered out. While the solid economic growth in late 2016 meant a total of 325,000 net jobs had been created in the year to October, the latest three months saw a 56,000 drop in employment. The ONS said the employment rate, which has been at its highest level this year since modern records began in the early 1970s, had slipped by 0.2 percentage points in the latest quarter to 75.1%. Unemployment also decreased by 26,000 to 1.43 million, but only because of a rise in economic inactivity, a category that counts people who have ceased to look for work. The jobless rate remained at 4.3%, its lowest since 1975. The ONS also reported a slight pick-up in earnings growth, but the 2.3% annual increase in the three months to October was lower than the 2.6% recorded in the same period of 2016 and meant pay was lagging behind inflation for an eighth month. Earnings growth is being closely monitored by the Bank of England for signs that the reduction in unemployment might lead to the start of a wage-price spiral. Threadneedle Street raised interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November, the first increase in the official cost of borrowing in more than a decade and is expected by the City to raise it again during 2018 unless there is a marked softening of the labour market. Most City analysts view that prospect as unlikely given the 5,000 increase to 798,000 in the number of job vacancies in the three months to November \u2013 evidence that companies are facing a skills\u2019 shortages. ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cEmployment stayed close to its record high and, while up on a year ago, declined compared with the previous three months. Unemployment also fell, but there was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job. Meanwhile the number of vacancies continues to grow, reaching a new record high. \u201cThere has been a slight pick-up in pay growth in cash terms, which means that although earnings are still growing less than inflation, the gap has narrowed.\u201d The ONS measures earnings including and excluding bonuses but said real pay was falling whichever method was used once inflation was taken into account. Excluding bonuses real earnings were 0.4% down year on year while including bonuses they dropped by 0.2%. The ONS said there had been a drop of 35,000 over the past year in the number of employees from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004, but an 82,000 increase in the number of workers from Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the EU in 2007. John Philpott, director of employment consultancy Jobs Economist, said that while the ONS figures suggested the jobs boom of recent years was coming to an end, this was due to a lack of employable people rather than a fall in demand from employers. \u201cRedundancies are still on the decline and unfilled vacancies have risen to yet another record high; but the rapid growth in labour supply of recent years has seemingly gone into the reverse. The main reasons for this are a sudden surge in student numbers and a fall in the number of citizens of the central and eastern European countries (the A8) that joined the EU in 2004,\u201d Philpott said. \u201cIn principle, this drop in available labour should be good news for unemployed jobseekers. The steady unemployment rate may therefore indicate a lack of employability on the part of the remaining pool of unemployed. Assuming no overall weakening of demand for workers, or renewed growth in supply, the labour market is thus likely to show greater signs of tightening in the coming months which, fingers crossed, should mean somewhat better news on the pay front.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australian economy for the past four years has been dominated by two booms \u2013 the end of the mining investment and the housing price one. The latest GDP figures suggest that the transition from the end of the mining boom has now occurred, and the latest housing price figures released this week suggest we have also reached the end of the housing boom. Since the RBA began cutting interest rates, the housing boom has mostly been about Sydney and to a lesser extent, Melbourne. So it is significant that the latest residential housing price data released on Tuesday showed that the housing prices in Sydney fell 1.4% \u2013 the biggest fall since December 2015. Elsewhere, Melbourne residential prices slowed dramatically \u2013 up just 1.1% compared to 3% in the June quarter, and prices in Perth continued to fall \u2013 they are down nearly 10% on 2014 levels \u2013 while in Hobart prices were up a very solid 3.4%. It meant overall residential prices across the country were down 0.2% \u2013 the biggest fall since March last year: The quarterly growth figures can be a bit noisy, but the annual growth figures confirm that a sowing has occurred \u2013 even if in Sydney residential prices remain 9.4% above where they were a year ago \u2013 at least that is down on the 14.4% annual growth that was occurring in March: The slowing was not altogether surprising given what has been happening with housing finance. The latest data out last week showed the lowest annual growth of housing finance since September last year, as investors departed the market in droves: As I have previously noted, there is a good correlation between the growth of housing finance and house prices six months later. The continuing slowing of housing finance suggests that there will be little chance of a recovery in the growth of housing prices anytime soon, and if anything, housing prices seem to be slowing quicker than would be expected: And so the question turns to whether or not the end of the housing boom will come with a bang or a whimper. One interesting aspect is the difference between the growth of the prices of apartments and other \u201cattached\u201d dwellings, and that of stand-alone \u201cestablished\u201d houses. Generally the prices of the two move in sync, and that is what we are seeing in Sydney. In the September quarter the average price of apartments fell by 1.4% - the biggest quarterly fall for six years \u2013 while established house prices fell 1.3%. It means that both elements of the Sydney housing market are mostly moving together \u2013 with the annual growth of both being down on where it was six months ago: But this is not the case in Melbourne and Brisbane \u2013 the two cities which have caused the most concern for the Reserve Banks about the over-supply of apartments. Since 2015, while the price growth of established houses in Melbourne has generally increased from 5.8% to the current 15.5%, that of attached dwellings has mostly stayed around the 3.5%-4.5% range: In Brisbane, where the price of established houses has been growing steadily at a touch over 4% for the past two years, the price of attached dwellings has actually been falling for 12 months: One would suspect that would make those markets more susceptible to a harder fall \u2013 especially when you consider that since the Reserve Bank began cutting interest rates in November 2011, the price growth of established houses in Melbourne has far outstripped that of apartments \u2013 60% compared to 22%: One of the beneficiaries of the lower growth of apartment prices has been first-home buyers. Research by the Reserve Bank released last week found that measuring housing affordability for first-home buyers was complex as most first-home buyers \u201cbuy homes that are cheaper than the average\u201d and you need to consider the ability to repay a mortgage, the quality of the homes available, and the distance from the CBD. The Reserve Bank found that \u201cthe average number of bedrooms in affordable housing has declined over the past 20 years, most notably in Sydney\u201d \u2013 due mostly to apartments now being smaller. But it also found that while the average distance from the CBD of affordable houses has increased over the past 20 years \u2013 in Sydney from slightly over 40km to a touch less than 60km \u2013 the distance from the CBD of affordable apartments has remained relatively stable. The research also found that there has been a surge in the share of potentially affordable apartments for first-home buyers in Brisbane and Melbourne, but not so for established houses. It found that \u201chouses have become less affordable than apartments in all cities and regions recently.\u201d The RBA suggests this is \u201clikely to be due to an increase in the relative scarcity of houses given the large increase in the supply of apartments over the past few years.\u201d This increase and the boost in the first-home buyers grant in NSW and Victoria has seen the level of first-home buyers improve significantly in the past six months: Whether the slowing of the price growth of apartments will lead to a similar slowing of established houses so that their affordability improves, remains to be seen. But all signs at the moment suggest that the boom is over, and it is now all about how sudden will be its end, rather than how much higher can house prices go.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders have blocked a proposed \u00a311m payout to the brother of Mike Ashley, the company\u2019s founder and majority shareholder. Shareholders voted by more than 70% to reject the plan for a payout to John Ashley at a special general meeting on Wednesday morning. Sports Direct received heavy criticism from shareholders and corporate governance experts last year after it emerged the sportswear retailer was paying a company owned by John Ashley to deliver its online orders outside the UK. The arrangement with Barlin Delivery Ltd, which was unwound earlier this year, had not been disclosed in Sports Direct\u2019s annual report. In November, Sports Direct issued a statement saying it wanted to pay John Ashley \u00a311m because he had been underpaid for previous work. Mike Ashley, who owns about 61% of Sports Direct\u2019s stock, said he would not participate in the vote to give independent shareholders a say on the matter. Alongside the statement confirming that independent shareholders had firmly rejected the payout, Sports Direct\u2019s board issued a statement saying it \u201ctrusts that shareholders will welcome the steps taken to reassure them that John Ashley did not benefit inappropriately from being the brother of majority shareholder Mike Ashley\u201d. \u201cIn fact, John was actually disadvantaged by approximately \u00a311m after he forewent bonuses that he would have received if he were treated equally to other executives who helped to build the company,\u201d it said. The board said it \u201crespects the views of the company\u2019s independent shareholders, and considers all these matters to be closed. We now intend to move on.\u201d Speaking before the vote, at least one shareholder told the Guardian that they would not be supporting the payment because the company had not provided evidence or detail explaining why it believed \u00a311m was owed to John Ashley. Nearly 66% voted against a separate plan for a \u00a33-a-share minimum payout to executives Karen Byers and Sean Nevitt \u2013 the only remaining participants in the Sports Direct executive bonus share scheme \u2013 if they elected to exercise their shares before September 2018, or \u00a34 a share after that month.",

      "bodyText": "Right, time for a recap. Evidence that Britain\u2019s long jobs boom has come to an end has emerged after official figures showed the number of people in work fell by 56,000 in the three months ending in October. After an upswing stretching to 2012, the Office for National Statistics said the employment rate had fallen by 0.2 percentage points to 75.1%. Unemployment also decreased by 26,000 to 1.43 million, but only because of a rise in economic inactivity, a category that counts people who have ceased to look for work. The jobless rate remained at 4.3%, its lowest since 1975. The ONS also reported a slight pickup in earnings growth, but the 2.3% annual increase in the three months to October still meant pay was lagging behind inflation. ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cEmployment stayed close to its record high and while up on a year ago, declined compared with the previous three months. Unemployment also fell, but there was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job. Meanwhile the number of vacancies continues to grow, reaching a new record high. \u201cThere has been a slight pick-up in pay growth in cash terms, which means that although earnings are still growing less than inflation, the gap has narrowed.\u201d Experts have pointed out that Low-paid workers are suffering particularly badly More young people have dropped out of the labour market altogether Vacancies are at a record high, suggesting firms are struggling to find qualified workers Real wages have now fallen for eight months in a row. But economists also hope that the squeeze in real income may end early next year. Here\u2019s our news story on the data That may be all for today! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW In another worrying move, the number of young people who aren\u2019t in work or education has risen in the last quarter. Dr Carole Easton OBE, the chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, says many aren\u2019t receiving the support they need to get into work. \u201c26,000 more young people are now economically inactive and out of education \u2013 a dramatic increase on the last quarter. \u201cYoung women in particular are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by a lack of convenient childcare and support. While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, 346,000 young women who are not included in the numbers are being left jobless and forgotten. These charts show the situation: The opposition Labour party has dismissed the government\u2019s argument that the UK labour market is strong. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams says: \u201cToday\u2019s figures are further evidence of Tory economic failure, only a day after inflation rose to its highest level in over five-and-a-half years. \u201cBoth employment and real wages are falling, while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010. \u201cEight million people in working households live in poverty, and many will struggle this Christmas as a direct result of this Government\u2019s austerity policies.\u201d Ashwin Kumar, Chief Economist at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, has dug into today\u2019s data - and discovered that low-paid workers are suffering particularly badly from the weak pay growth. Kumar says: \u201cWages are yet again rising more slowly than prices. Combined with frozen benefits, 2017 has been a year of stress for family finances. But people working in retail and hospitality, who already face low wages, are being hit particularly hard. In real terms, earnings have fallen by 1.4% since last year in these sectors, compared to a 0.4% fall for the average worker. Today\u2019s report also shows that the unemployment rate for women has hit a record low, at just 4.1%. In contrast, 70.8% of women aged from 16 to 64 were in work, up from 69.8% for a year earlier. There has been an increase in women working full-time and part-time (unlike men, where the part-time cohort shrank in the last quarter). The Office for National Statistics says: The increase in the employment rate for women over the last few years has been partly due to ongoing changes to the State Pension age for women, resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. Ian Brinkley, acting chief economist at the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, also suspects that Britain\u2019s labour market is stalling. He says: \u201cThese figures suggest the UK\u2019s employment engine has begun to splutter. The fall in the total number of people in work, down 0.2%, is primarily driven by a fall in full-time self-employment. Coupled with a fall in unemployment, this appears to point towards constraints in the overall supply of labour rather than a decline in demand. There is a strong possibility that the continued expansion of the labour market has hit its ceiling. In response, employers would be wise to invest more in their existing workforce, especially in light of recent declines in the number of apprenticeships. Despite the drop in employment, the number of unfilled positions in the UK has hit a record high. There were 798,000 job vacancies in the September-to-November quarter, which is the most since comparable records began in 2001, as this chart shows: So why are firms struggling to fill these vacancies? Dr John Philpott, Director of The Jobs Economist, says the supply of skilled labour is tailing off. The rapid growth in labour supply of recent years has seemingly gone into the reverse. The main reasons for this are a sudden surge in student numbers and a fall in the number of citizens of the central and eastern European countries (the A8) that joined the EU in 2004. In principle, this drop in available labour should be good news for unemployed jobseekers. The steady unemployment rate may therefore indicate a lack of employability on the part of the remaining pool of unemployed. The CBI, which represents British bosses, confirms that UK companies are still trying to hire staff. Their head of employment, Matthew Percival, says: \u201cThe number of people in employment has fallen, but the unemployment rate remains low and there are still opportunities for job seekers with vacancies at a record high. Today\u2019s jobs reports shows that the number of public sector workers rose by 19,000 between June and September, to 5.49 milllion. The ONS says: The largest contributor to these quarterly and annual increases in public sector employment was the National Health Service. But, the number of private sector workers dropped by 75,000 between June and September, to 26.59 million. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze could end early next year, reckons Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: The pay squeeze continues for now, but with wages growing a little more strongly and inflation set to fall back in the new year, this looks like it\u2019ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady doesn\u2019t see any festive cheer in today\u2019s labour market report. She says: \u201c2017 has been a bleak year for living standards. \u201cReal wages have now fallen for the last eight months in a row. And working people will be worse off this Christmas than they were a decade ago. \u201cBoosting pay packets should be a priority for the government - not a side issue.\u201d The Minister for Employment, Damian Hinds, claims that the UK labour market is still strong - even though real wages are still falling. Hinds says: \u201cWe\u2019re ending the year on a strong note with figures showing the unemployment rate has fallen every month in 2017, and is now at the lowest it\u2019s been in over 40 years. \u201cEmployment is at a near-record high, and there are over 3 million more people in work now compared to 2010 \u2013 that\u2019s more than the population of Greater Manchester. Universal Credit is helping people get into work quicker, and ensuring they get more money in their pockets for every hour they work. \u201cUniversal Credit supports both the unemployed and the low paid, as people don\u2019t have to end their benefit claim when they find a job. This is especially important at this time of year, when many people take on temporary seasonal work.\u201d Geraint Johnes, Research Director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, says today\u2019s jobs report is packed with concerns: The latest labour force statistics provide further evidence that the labour market has peaked and is now starting to turn down. Employment fell by some 56000 over the quarter to October. While there was a small increase in the number of full-time employees, there was a large fall (some 65000) in the number of full-time self-employed workers. Unemployment, meanwhile, continued to fall, and now stands at 4.3%. The simultaneous fall in employment and unemployment is possible because there has been a large increase (115000 over the quarter) in the number of economically inactive. \u201cThere have been large falls in employment in the distribution sector (38000) and in information and communication (37000). Meanwhile numbers employed in professional, scientific and technical fields and in administration and support have increased. \u201cThe three-month average measure of total weekly pay has increased to 2.5% (from 2.3% at the time of the last release). This is encouraging, but should be viewed alongside two further observations. First, wage growth remains well below the rate of growth of prices, so real wages continue to fall. Secondly, the single-month figure, while less reliable, is more modest \u2013 it has fallen to 2.3% from 2.8% last time around. So the growth in the three-month measure is largely due to a spike in September that has not fed through into October. Low, and stagnant, wages remain a problem.\u201d Jeremy Cook of foreign exchange firm World First isn\u2019t impressed by today\u2019s jobs report Ed Conway of Sky News fears that the jobs market may be stalling... He also points out that real wages have now been falling since the spring Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group is disappointed that wages aren\u2019t rising faster, given Britain\u2019s unemployment rate is a 42-year low. This is not a great jobs report , despite the fall in unemployment: Worryingly, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits (the claimant count) has risen by 5,900 in November, to 818,000. October\u2019s figures have been revised higher too, to 6,500. British workers are still suffering falling real wages, despite a pick-up in pay in the last quarter. Today\u2019s jobs report shows that pay, including bonuses, rose by 2.5% in the last quarter, up from 2.2% last month. But basic pay (excluding bonuses), only rose by a more modest 2.3% in the August-to-October quarter. With inflation hitting 3% in September and October, and spiking to 3.1% in November, that means people are effectively experiencing a pay cut. Breaking! The number of people in employment across the UK has fallen, for the second month in a row. There were 56,000 fewer people in work in the July-October quarter, compared to the previous three months. That\u2019s the biggest drop since May 2015, taking the total number of people in work down to 32.08 million. But the number of people classed as unemployed has also dropped in the last quarter, by 26,000, to 1.43 million. That leaves the unemployment rate at a 42-year low of just 4.3%, the same as last month. Importantly, more people have simply dropped out of the labour force altogether, and are classed as \u2018economically inactive\u2019. Here are the key points from the Office for National Statistics: The UK unemployment rate fell marginally (by 0.1 percentage points) to 4.3% in the three months to October 2017, compared with the previous quarter, to a joint lowest unemployment rate since 1975. The UK employment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points to 75.1% in the three months to October 2017 compared with the previous quarter. The level of employment fell by 50,000 for men and by 6,000 for women. More to follow! The pound is creeping up this morning, on hopes that today\u2019s jobs report will show that pay growth (including bonuses) has jumped to 2.5% in the last quarter. Sterling has gained 0.2% against the US dollar to $1.334, and is a little higher against the euro too at \u20ac1.136. But Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, reckons the pound would suffer if today\u2019s figure are disappointing: Although Britain\u2019s unemployment rate remains encouraging, sentiment could easily take a hit if wage growth fails to meet market estimations. A situation where pay growth fails to pick up is likely to continue squeezing consumers, especially in view of inflation jumping to its highest level in almost six years at 3.1%. Economist Rupert Seggins has created some useful charts to explain today\u2019s labour market report (which is released in 45 minutes): In the City, shares in Dixons Carphone have jumped by 7.5% in early trading after it reported its best ever Black Friday trading. That makes amends for a 60% tumble in pre-tax profits over the six months to 28 October, when Dixons Carphone suffered from a slowdown in mobile phone sales. CEO Seb James tweets that earnings growth should pick up over the crucial Christmas period: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets is hoping for a cheering unemployment report today: UK Unemployment (9:30am) is expected to drop to a fresh 42-year low of 4.2%, while Average Earnings (incl. bonus) accelerate to a 2017 high of 2.5% (still shy of inflation, which hit a new multi-year high of 3.1% yesterday) and the ex-bonus print holds firm at 2.2%. Here are the City consensus forecasts for today\u2019s UK jobs report: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze intensified yesterday, as inflation spiked unexpectedly to a six-year high of 3.1%. Today, we discover if wages are catching up, with the publication of the latest UK labour market report. Economists suspect that higher bonuses may have pushed earnings growth up to 2.5% - slightly closing the gap with inflation. Basic pay is probably still lagging behind, though, at just 2.2% per annum in the last three months. That would leave many workers struggling to keep pace with rising prices. The City will also be looking to see whether Britain\u2019s economy created more jobs in the July-October quarter. A month ago, we saw the first drop in employment since the Brexit vote, triggering fears that the labour market is losing momentum. It\u2019s also possible that the unemployment rate could hit a new four-decade low of just 4.2%. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says traders will focus on the earnings figures. The important element here will be hourly wages, which could give an indication as the extent to which UK household purses are being squeezed. Average hourly wages are expected to be 2.5% in the three months to October, which is a respectable 0.3% increase from the three months to September. This would represent a rare closing in the gap since Brexit, between the cost of living and wage growth. The report is also expected to show resilience in other areas of the labour market, as well such as a further decline in the rate of unemployment. Yet while the UK jobs market may put on another showing of strength, the pound could struggle to react positively for the same Brexit jitter reasons that weighed on the pound following yesterday\u2019s inflation report. In the City, technology retail group Dixons Carphone and holiday group TUI are reporting results. After European traders have headed home, America\u2019s Federal Reserve will (probably) raise US interest rates. It will also be Janet Yellen\u2019s final press conference as Fed chair, following Donald Trump\u2019s decision not to reappoint her. Royal Bank of Canada expect little excitement though: Yellen\u2019s press conference should prove to be a non-event given her recent testimony in Congress and that she will soon be stepping down once Powell is confirmed. The bigger question therefore is whether the Fed will significantly alter its economic and rates projections. Our US colleagues\u2019 view is that they would prefer to wait until March to make significant upgrades when they are likely to be in a better position to model the impact of the looming tax plan.

Employment fell by some 56000 over the quarter to October. While there was a small increase in the number of full-time employees, there was a large fall (some 65000) in the number of full-time self-employed workers. Unemployment, meanwhile, continued to fall, and now stands at 4.3%. The simultaneous fall in employment and unemployment is possible because there has been a large increase (115000 over the quarter) in the number of economically inactive. </p> <p>\u201cThere have been large falls in employment in the distribution sector (38000) and in information and communication (37000). Meanwhile numbers employed in professional, scientific and technical fields and in administration and support have increased.</p> <p>\u201cThe three-month average measure of total weekly pay has increased to 2.5% (from 2.3% at the time of the last release). This is encouraging, but should be viewed alongside two further observations. First, wage growth remains well below the rate of growth of prices, so real wages continue to fall. Secondly, the single-month figure, while less reliable, is more modest \u2013 it has fallen to 2.3% from 2.8% last time around.</p> <p>So the growth in the three-month measure is largely due to a spike in September that has not fed through into October.

Economists suspect that higher bonuses may have pushed earnings growth up to 2.5% - slightly closing the gap with inflation. </p> <p>Basic pay is probably still lagging behind, though, at just 2.2% per annum in the last three months. That would leave many workers struggling to keep pace with rising prices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/12/uk-inflation-rises-uk-cost-of-living-squeeze\">Inflation rises to 3.1%, adding to UK cost of living squeeze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The City will also be looking to see whether Britain\u2019s economy created more jobs in the July-October quarter. A month ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/15/uk-employment-falls-brexit-vote-ons-unemployed\">we saw the first drop in employment since the Brexit vote</a>, triggering fears that the labour market is losing momentum.</p> <p>It\u2019s also possible that the unemployment rate could hit a new four-decade low of just 4.2%.</p> <p><strong>Jasper Lawler</strong> of <strong>London Capital Group</strong> says traders will focus on the earnings figures. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The important element here will be hourly wages, which could give an indication as the extent to which UK household purses are being squeezed. Average hourly wages are expected to be 2.5% in the three months to October, which is a respectable 0.3% increase from the three months to September.</p> <p>This would represent a rare closing in the gap since Brexit, between the cost of living and wage growth.</p> <p>The report is also expected to show resilience in other areas of the labour market, as well such as a further decline in the rate of unemployment. Yet while the UK jobs market may put on another showing of strength, the pound could struggle to react positively for the same Brexit jitter reasons that weighed on the pound following yesterday\u2019s inflation report.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In the City, technology retail group Dixons Carphone and holiday group TUI are reporting results. </strong></p> <p>After European traders have headed home, America\u2019s Federal Reserve will (probably) raise US interest rates. It will also be Janet Yellen\u2019s final press conference as Fed chair, following Donald Trump\u2019s decision not to reappoint her.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Canada</strong> expect little excitement though:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yellen\u2019s press conference should prove to be a non-event given her recent testimony in Congress and that she will soon be stepping down once Powell is confirmed. The bigger question therefore is whether the Fed will significantly alter its economic and rates projections.</p> <p>Our US colleagues\u2019 view is that they would prefer to wait until March to make significant upgrades when they are likely to be in a better position to model the impact of the looming tax plan.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li>9.30am GMT: UK unemployment statistics<br></li> <li>10am GMT: Eurozone industrial production data for October<br></li> <li>1.30pm GMT: US inflation data for November<br></li> <li>7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-12-13T08:05:32.668Z\">at 8.05am GMT</time></p>  </div>",
