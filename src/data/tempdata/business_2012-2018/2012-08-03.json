      "bodyText": "Tesco on Saturday drove its shopping trolley into the mortgage market with the launch of a range of home loans. It said the move, which comes nearly three years after it first outlined plans to launch a full-service retail bank, was a major milestone towards its goal. From Monday Tesco's banking arm will offer a range of fixed-rate and tracker mortgages, available to homebuyers and those remortgaging. The deals will not be offered in stores but online or by phone from Tesco Bank's UK-based customer service team. Deals will not initially be offered through mortgage brokers. Tesco first outlined plans to build a full-service bank in autumn 2009. The initial plan was to launch a chequebook account in 2010 and later add small business banking. It passed up the chance to buy the Northern Rock \"good bank\" as a quick way into the home loan market, saying it did not need the brand or branch network. Some brokers and commentators were disappointed that the launch lacked any market-leading products, particularly as the company's arrival in the market has coincided with a mortgage price war on the high street that has pushed some rates down to record low levels. Tesco's rates start at 3.19% for a two-year fixed rate where the maximum loan is 70% of the property's value, with a \u00a3995 fee. Its cheapest five-year fix is 3.89%. Other lenders have recently launched deals with lower headline rates: West Bromwich building society has a two-year fix at 2.95% for those borrowing up to 75% of the property's value. NatWest offers a five-year fix, also at 2.95%, for people borrowing up to 60% of their home's value. These low rates typically have high product fees \u2013 \u00a32,495 in the case of the NatWest deal. Sylvia Waycot, of financial data website Moneyfacts, said: \"It is disappointing that despite having successful cards and loans to its credit, Tesco Bank, on entering the mortgage sector, has not launched any market-leading deals. Its current proposition of fixed and tracker mortgages can be beaten by what is currently on the high street.\" First-time buyers are likely to be disappointed, too, as only those borrowers who can manage a deposit of at least 20% will be able to take out a Tesco home loan. Benny Higgins, Tesco Bank chief executive, denied suggestions the launch had been delayed, saying there had been no plans to issue mortgages until the bank had completed the systems work required \u2013 something it achieved in May. Current accounts \u2013 the badge of a full service bank \u2013 will not be introduced until the \"tail end of next year\", he said, once banks have made it easier to switch accounts, as recommended by the Independent Commission on Banking. ISAs could come later this year, while Tesco Bank will also seek its own credit rating to allow it to borrow directly on the financial markets to fuel its growth. Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, said customers wanted choice in banking \"from a brand they know and trust to deal with them fairly\".",

      "bodyText": "It is five years since Benny Higgins quit HBOS after his strategy for Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, led to its market share falling to 8%, its lowest point in seven years. His resignation, after only a year in the job, coincided with the start of the credit crunch that led to the run on Northern Rock a month later. Now, as the brains behind Tesco Bank's push into the home loans market, he is reluctant to dwell on his short period at a bank that had to be rescued a year later by Lloyds. Asked about this episode Higgins, whom some have since suggested was deliberately trying to slow down a business that had been growing too quickly, will not comment. But he does say that \"chasing market share targets is not the right way to run a business\". \"There are many examples of businesses that make market share their objective that then do things that are not in their interests,\" he said. Hence the 51-year-old Scot's insistence that there are no market share targets for Tesco Bank, which he joined after departing HBOS. His arrival at HBOS in 2006 stunned many because he defected from close rival Royal Bank of Scotland after almost 10 years, latterly as head of the retail bank. Not a banker by training, Higgins is an actuary who was a senior official at Edinburgh-based insurance company Standard Life until resigning suddenly in June 1997.

That number is derived from a separate survey, and economists said it tends to be volatile but the rise was immediately seized upon by Obama's opponents. The Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called the figures \"a hammer blow to struggling middle-class families\". The US labour department said that since January, employment growth had averaged 151,000 per month, about the same as the average monthly gain of 153,000 in 2011. The labour market has slowed sharply after strong gains of over 200,000 a month in the winter, spelling possible trouble for Obama before the election on 6 November.",

      "bodyText": "As London retailers ask the government to remind the public their shops are still open for business, it is not just the capital that has been hit by the Olympics. The numbers of shoppers on high streets outside London have fallen, although shopping centres have managed to draw in more customers thanks to giant screens showing the Olympics, poor weather and the suspension of Sunday trading laws, according to retailers. Diane Wehrle, research director at Springboard, which measures shopper numbers, said the decline in footfall last weekend outside London was more than 9% and warned that the numbers will continue to be down. She said: \"The Olympics has played a significant part, especially on the high street. The good weather ended, coinciding with the Olympics starting, which drove people back home to watch. \"Now that we have won a few medals, the excitement will only build and shoppers are expected to stay away from the high street throughout the Olympics.\" Some Olympic events are being held outside London \u2013 such as football, and sailing in Weymouth \u2013 but the message from local authorities is at odds with London's recommendations to avoid certain \"hotspots\". Garry Clark, from the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, said: \"People are viewing London as somewhere they don't want to be at the moment, but in Scotland the cities in particular are very busy. \"We've had football fixtures in Glasgow, so we've got a lot more visitors to the city.\" He said it remains to be seen whether or not the increase in footfall will lead to a rise in sales volume. \"Yes, there are people in the cities, but will that translate to sales? We're certainly hopeful that we'll see an increase.\" But while high streets across Britain might be mirroring the quiet scenes of London's West End, shopping centres have seen seen shoppers pouring in. At Manchester's Trafford Centre, general manager Tony Sheehan said since the Olympics there has been a increase in overseas visitors. He said: \"Footfall this week is currently 11% up on the same time last year and retailers are reporting strong sales. Our visitors have been keeping up to date with Team GB on our big screen, and this has attracted very excited crowds throughout. Our Olympic-themed sporting events have also been very busy, and our staff say it feels a little like Christmas week, but with better weather.\" In Stoke-on-Trent, the Potteries Shopping Centre saw footfall up 8.3% compared with last week, with Sunday particularly strong, up 6.6%, in part due to a suspension in Sunday trading laws during the Olympics and Paralympics. Big TV screens also appear to be drawing in shoppers. At Chapelfield in Norwich, a giant screen has been put up outside, with hundreds of chairs for people to watch the action, a trend across the country. But there are serious concerns that the high street could struggle, particularly during the lull between the end of the Olympics and the start of the Paralympics. Richard Dichinson, chief executive of the New West End Company, which represents key Londonretailers, said it is preparing an emergency advertising fund to try to entice shoppers. And on Wednesday, Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next said: \"The two weeks of the Games for retail won't be good. As with any sporting event, people tend to stay in and watch them on television rather than go out shopping.\"",

Overall the group is maintaining underlying guidance for the full year, but currencies will be a significant head wind. It may be too early to bank on it, but If the recovery at City Link does finally come through, then the shares should start to perform. Finally, potentially good news for US hay fever sufferers. Allergy Therapeutic said US regulators had given the go-ahead for development of the company's grass pollen allergy vaccine development programme. The US Food and Drug Administration had held back approval since 2007, but now the company can look for a partner to launch its Pollinex Quattro vaccine - already on sale in Europe - in the US market. The company's shares climbed 36% to 11.75p.",

      "bodyText": "International Airlines Group, the merged British Airways and Iberian airlines, revealed it is preparing for a Spanish exit from the eurozone as it announced that huge and \"unsustainable\" losses from Iberia have dragged the parent company into the red. Willlie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, said there were \"opportunities\" as well as risks in a possible Spanish exit. While the broader economic downsides would be immense, he believed the airline's preparation and \"prudent management\" would give it a competitive advantage. IAG has established a eurozone crisis management group that meets every two weeks to plan for shocks to the business. That now includes a \"Spain euro exit roadmap project\" that is drawing up contingency plans for the group, which is highly exposed to the crisis through Iberia's Madrid base. While Walsh said he did not believe a euro break-up was imminent, but a new devalued Spanish currency would have some advantage for IAG. \"The real risk is a global recession - it wouldn't be confined to Spain. But the expectation would be that it would have a currency that makes our cost base in Spain much more competitive and makes Spain much more attractive for tourists.\" IAG has pulled most of its euro deposits out of Spanish banks, a precaution it had already taken in Ireland and Italy. Walsh on Friday promised further restructuring of Iberia to cut its \"unsustainable\" losses, which wiped out a pre-tax profit of \u20ac13m (\u00a310m) at BA to plunge the parent group into an overall pre-tax loss of \u20ac253m in the first six months of 2012. In the first half of 2011 the group made profits of 88m euros. The IAG boss said he was engaged in \"a re-evaluation of all aspects of the business to deliver competitive costs\". He warned this would inevitably mean further job losses at Iberia. Redundancies would probably spark more industrial action at the Spanish airline, which has cancelled hundreds of flights already this year in a dispute with the pilots' union. But Walsh said: \"Everybody in Spain and Iberia recognises the challenge - we're being completely open. A strike is not going to do anything to improve the situation and certainly not to lower our determination. I'd like to think it will be avoided but it's not something that will in any way reduce the scale of the change, it may perversely increase the need for it. This is work that has got to be done - we can't sustain the losses we're seeing at Iberia.\" However IAG said synergies from the deal will still reap rewards by 2015, citing Iberia's move into Heathrow's Terminal 5 this year as one way in which operating costs were being cut. Walsh said the low-cost subsidiary he established in Spain, Iberia Express, had made a profit in June, its third full month of operation. Overall, IAG's revenue was up 11.5% for the first but the fuel bill rose 25.1% to \u20ac314m. For the last three months, losses narrowed to \u20ac4m, a figure that included \u20ac50m of losses from the recently acquired bmi airline that will be cut back or integrated into BA over the year. Meanwhile, BA's rival Virgin Atlantic reported a pre-tax group operating loss of \u00a380.2m for the 2011-12 year, despite increases in passenger numbers and revenues. It flew 5.4 million passengers and saw revenues edge up to \u00a32.74bn. Chief executive Steve Ridgway said: \"In an incredibly challenging market, we have managed to grow top line revenues and fly more customers than last year. However, with the prevailing uncertainty in the economy, sky high fuel prices and a 25% hike in our air passenger duty fees, converting this sales growth into profit has not been possible.\" He said the airline would make significant cost savings per passenger flown when six more fuel-efficient Airbus A330s are delivered later this year.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Airline now expects to make a full year operating loss in the wake of Spain's financial problems", 
      "body": "<p><strong>International Airlines Group </strong>- the owner of British Airways and Iberia - will be pushed into a full year loss thanks to Spain's growing economic problems.</p> <p>The group is planning a major restructuring of its Spanish business, describing Iberia's problems as \"deep and structural\". This will involve cutting back the network and job losses at a time when Spanish unemployment is soaring and it is in dispute with the airline's pilots. Chief executive Willie Walsh said:</p> <blockquote> There remains a stark difference in the performance of our subsidiaries. British Airways made an operating profit despite rising fuel prices while Iberia's losses deepened. <br> A number of factors have improved over the past three months. Underlying BA trading conditions remain firm and bmi integration is on track, but any benefit from an easing of fuel prices has been more than offset by the deterioration in Spanish economic conditions.  We were previously targeting a break-even operating result this year, after the impact of restructuring costs and the short term earnings drag from the bmi acquisition. However, in the light of the Spanish macro headwind, we now expect to make a small operating loss in 2012. </blockquote> <p>Overall the group made an operating loss of \u20ac253m for the first half including \u20ac50m of losses from its recent acquisition, bmi. There were also \u20ac38m of restructuring charges related to bmi.</p> <p>The company's shares have dropped 5.4p to 153.9p, making it the biggest faller in a rising FTSE 100. But analysts mostly remained positive. Douglas McNeill at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> IAG's second year continues to be a lot less good than its first, with a first-time inclusion of losses from newly-acquired bmi compounding the pain of a billion-euro hike in the fuel bill. Yields are increasing at much the rate we expected and non-fuel costs look to be under control, but our 2012 forecasts will have to move down a bit to reflect new guidance. However, this is unlikely to alter our positive view on the stock, which we think does not price in enough of the gains from the original merger and the bmi deal. </blockquote> <p>James Hollins at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We recently moved from hold to buy on IAG based on greater confidence in the group's ability to deliver on its consolidation synergies and improved jet fuel and premium traffic conditions. Despite continued Spanish macro issues, we take encouragement from IAG's 'on track' integration targets, while welcoming the group's first half forecasts beat, aggressive plan for restructuring Iberia and the initial performance of Iberia Express. <br> The three-month deterioration in Spanish macro conditions should come as no surprise, although it could be taken negatively by the markets. </blockquote> <p>One person who was negative was Gerald Khoo at Espirito Santo, who issued a sell note:</p> <blockquote> BA trading remains firm and bmi integration on track, but this has been offset by weak Spanish economic conditions hitting Iberia. Full year guidance has been cut [and] although this is not a huge disappointment, we see clear downside risk to consensus estimates.

      "bodyText": "International Airlines Group - the owner of British Airways and Iberia - will be pushed into a full year loss thanks to Spain's growing economic problems. The group is planning a major restructuring of its Spanish business, describing Iberia's problems as \"deep and structural\". This will involve cutting back the network and job losses at a time when Spanish unemployment is soaring and it is in dispute with the airline's pilots. Chief executive Willie Walsh said: There remains a stark difference in the performance of our subsidiaries. British Airways made an operating profit despite rising fuel prices while Iberia's losses deepened. A number of factors have improved over the past three months. Underlying BA trading conditions remain firm and bmi integration is on track, but any benefit from an easing of fuel prices has been more than offset by the deterioration in Spanish economic conditions. We were previously targeting a break-even operating result this year, after the impact of restructuring costs and the short term earnings drag from the bmi acquisition. However, in the light of the Spanish macro headwind, we now expect to make a small operating loss in 2012. Overall the group made an operating loss of \u20ac253m for the first half including \u20ac50m of losses from its recent acquisition, bmi. There were also \u20ac38m of restructuring charges related to bmi. The company's shares have dropped 5.4p to 153.9p, making it the biggest faller in a rising FTSE 100. But analysts mostly remained positive. Douglas McNeill at Charles Stanley said: IAG's second year continues to be a lot less good than its first, with a first-time inclusion of losses from newly-acquired bmi compounding the pain of a billion-euro hike in the fuel bill. Yields are increasing at much the rate we expected and non-fuel costs look to be under control, but our 2012 forecasts will have to move down a bit to reflect new guidance. However, this is unlikely to alter our positive view on the stock, which we think does not price in enough of the gains from the original merger and the bmi deal. James Hollins at Investec said: We recently moved from hold to buy on IAG based on greater confidence in the group's ability to deliver on its consolidation synergies and improved jet fuel and premium traffic conditions. Despite continued Spanish macro issues, we take encouragement from IAG's 'on track' integration targets, while welcoming the group's first half forecasts beat, aggressive plan for restructuring Iberia and the initial performance of Iberia Express. The three-month deterioration in Spanish macro conditions should come as no surprise, although it could be taken negatively by the markets. One person who was negative was Gerald Khoo at Espirito Santo, who issued a sell note: BA trading remains firm and bmi integration on track, but this has been offset by weak Spanish economic conditions hitting Iberia. Full year guidance has been cut [and] although this is not a huge disappointment, we see clear downside risk to consensus estimates. The July traffic statistics were not particularly encouraging either, with premium traffic up 1.5% versus non-premium up 5.6% (so potential downward pressure on yields from mix, albeit in a leisure-biased month) and a flat passenger load factor. On our current published estimates, IAG trades on a December PE of 6 times.. We consider this to be overly generous given the weak performance of Iberia and downside risks to estimates. Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 50.37 points to 5712.67, recovering after its falls in the wake of disappointment with the European Central Bank's failure to come up with sufficiently strong measures to ease eurozone worries. All eyes will be on the US non-farm payroll numbers this afternoon, given the US Federal Reserve's lack of concrete action earlier in the week. Financials have recovered, led by Royal Bank of Scotland, up 9.1p to 213.6p as its first half results gave some comfort to investors despite the litany of problems facing the bank.",
