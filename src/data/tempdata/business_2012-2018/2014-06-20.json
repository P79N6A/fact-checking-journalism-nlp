      "bodyText": "Shares in TSB, the offshoot of Lloyds Banking Group, jumped on their debut on Friday after the state-owned bank priced the 631 branches at \u00a31.3bn. The TSB shares were priced by Lloyds at 260p each but they surged to 300p before closing at 290p in the first opportunity for City investors to trade. The TSB branches have to be spun off because of the requirements imposed on Lloyds by the EU at the time of its \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout in 2008. They were supposed to have been sold by now but the botched attempt to sell them to the Co-operative Bank delayed the process. Lloyds floated a larger-than-expected tranche of shares \u2013 35% rather than 25% of its holding \u2013 on the stock market in what will be the first of many sell-offs as it prepares to meet the EU demand to dispose of the TSB unit entirely. The 60,000 retail investors who bought in during the flotation process will be able to trade for the first time next week. The shares were priced \"to go\" as Lloyds' internal valuation of TSB is \u00a31.6bn. For Lloyds, though, the sell-off is further evidence of a return to normality with expectations that the government can part with the rest of its 24% stake in the group \u2013 down from 43% \u2013 before the May 2015 general election. There were suggestions that Lloyds would sell off a larger than expected tranche of shares because of Mark Carney's warning that interest rates could rise earlier than expected. The remarks by the Bank of England governor are regarded as helpful for TSB as it could be more profitable in the future if rates rise off their 0.5% historic lows. Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, said retail investors made up 30% of buyers, whose appetite for bank shares is being tested before a promised sell-off of Lloyds to the public. \"It shows there is real appetite for a different kind of bank \u2013 a high street bank, not a Wall Street bank \u2013 which is focused on customer service,\" Pester said. The government will see the steps towards a standalone TSB as a way to improve competition on the high street \u2013 where Lloyds shares market dominance with Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. The current account market is the one which has traditionally been hardest to wrest from the \"big four\". TSB is offering an account with a 5% rate of interest while players such as Tesco Bank are also entering the current account market for the first time. TSB is valued at around \u00a31.6bn by Lloyds which has spent a similar amount creating the network. Paul Simmonds, from Warwick Business School, said: \"The government is keen to have more competition in high street banking but is there enough room for all the new banks?\" Lloyds said the offer for TSB shares had been 10 times oversubscribed. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown said Lloyds had scaled back applications from retail investors. \"Investors applying for up to \u00a32,000 of shares received their full amount, rounded down to the nearest whole share (769 shares corresponding to \u00a31,999.40). Applications for more than \u00a32,000 of shares will receive 769 shares plus 30% of the excess amount, rounded down to the nearest whole share,\" said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct is facing renewed opposition from City investors over plans to hand its founder Mike Ashley a multimillion pound award of shares in the latest twist in the sportswear company's troubled relationship with the City. After repeated clashes over potential handouts of shares to Ashley, who controls 58% of Sports Direct, fund management firms are considering voting against the proposal to allocate shares worth \u00a3200m to Ashley and an undisclosed number of employees. The vote is scheduled to take place on 2 July and is the fourth attempt by the company to pay its founder, who also owns Newcastle United football club, a share-based bonus. The Association of British Insurers (ABI), whose members control a fifth of the stock market, has issued its most serious warning \u2013 a \"red top\" \u2013 to alert shareholders to serious issues about corporate governance at the firm, which now has 600 sports stores in Europe. The National Association of British Insurers, which represents pension funds holding \u00a3900bn of investments, is calling for the vote on the bonus deal to be withdrawn. The ABI has been facilitating discussions for investors holding about 18% of the shares in Sports Direct not owned by Ashley. The shareholders have also met with chairman Keith Hellawell, the former policeman and one-time government \"drugs tsar\". Investors are thought to have been stunned by the latest proposal as it was announced shortly after they met Hellawell following the hiatus in April when a previous bonus scheme for Ashley, who is executive deputy chairman, had to be withdrawn. Investors regarded that as the third attempt to pay Ashley in shares after the first attempt failed to win the backing of investors in September 2012 and a failed second consultation, which was held a year later. The latest proposed deal for Ashley differs to those in the past because it has been linked into payouts for staff at Sports Direct, as the award of 25m shares is being made to the company's share scheme. But shareholders believe it is not clear how many of the 25m shares could be allotted to Ashley nor how many staff could be part of the arrangement. The company has about 3,000 full-time staff and an estimated 20,000 more on zero-hours contracts. Since a previous bonus scheme was withdrawn in April, annual profits targets have been added to the share awards and the timescale of the payouts lengthened from two years to four. The company declined to comment but Hellawell said when the deal was announced in April that the company had responded to shareholder feedback. \"Based on the stretching performance targets established, this scheme has the potential to create a further substantial increase in shareholder value,\" Hellawell said. Ashley does not take a salary from the business that he founded in 1982 with a single shop. Will Pomroy of the National Association of Pension Funds said members were backing the attempts by the ABI to facilitate discussions with Sports Direct. \"It remains unclear to our members why the board considers that this latest proposal is sufficiently more appropriate and, in the interests of minority shareholders, more appropriate than those proposed and withdrawn previously. As such, our members hope that the company withdraws this resolution,\" said Pomroy. Sports Direct was floated at 300p in February 2007 and immediately started to face questions from City investors about its attitude towards them. After the shares fell below the float price, Ashley said \"some of these City people act like a bunch of cry babies\". But after a shaky start on the stock market, the shares are now trading at 760p. In the past, Odey Asset Management, Sports Direct's biggest institutional investor, has backed the share awards for Ashley. But Pomroy said: \"Our members are concerned about the significant lack of detail being provided about the arrangements of this scheme and the absence of substantive consultation with shareholders is particularly frustrating. As a public company, it is imperative that the whole board begins to recognise the obligations it has and, in turn, endeavours to better engage with and listen to its investors.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Public sector finances showed little sign of improvement last month, despite a surge in GDP growth and bumper tax receipts from house sales that was expected to bring the deficit down at a faster pace. Government borrowing rose \u00a313.3bn in May, which was well above market expectations and \u00a34.6bn higher than a year ago. Stripping out exceptional items that boosted last year's figures, the underlying rise was only \u00a30.7bn higher than a year ago. But analysts warned that the coalition's deficit reduction strategy had stalled in a period when falling unemployment and higher tax receipts should be bringing the annual budget further into balance. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the figures \"contain tentative signs that the coalition may be beginning to struggle to bring down the deficit in line with the fiscal plans\". Tax receipts had \"continued to grow disappointingly weakly\", he added. \"So, while the economic recovery may now be fairly strong, it still appears to be struggling to have much of an impact on the borrowing numbers.\" Treasury coffers were partly boosted by surging stamp duty land tax revenues, which were 28% ahead of last year at \u00a31.2bn and underlined the sharp rise in the number of house sales over the past year. The Treasury also enjoyed a fall in debt repayment costs after the recent decline in inflation depressed the bill for financing index-linked government bonds. Corporation tax takings rose by 17.5% to \u00a31.5bn, but capital gains and income tax, the largest source of funds for the Treasury, fell a combined 1.4% to \u00a310.2bn. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury's independent economic forecaster, warned that the cut in the top rate of income tax last year to 45p had a distorting effect on tax receipts that made comparisons with 2013 difficult. A boost to receipts from a tax arrangement with the Swiss authorities and income related to the Bank of England's quantitative easing operations were also one-off benefits that were unlikely to be repeated. Central government receipts on an underlying basis, excluding the Swiss tax arrangement and QE, were ahead by \u00a31.4bn. The total public sector debt reached \u00a31.28tn, or 76.1% of gross domestic product, up from 75.7% in April. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"Even the underlying picture points to the public finances improving at a rate well short of the recovery in the economy. \"It could be that recent reforms to the tax system, including rises in the tax-free personal allowance and cuts in corporation tax, combined with structural shifts in the labour market towards lower-paid work are contributing towards economic growth that is simply less 'tax-rich' than in the past.\" Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"If true, achieving the OBR's borrowing target for the fiscal year as a whole may well prove to be a challenge. Borrowing is now expected to be almost \u00a3190bn more than planned under this government. This is the cost of three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election.\" A Treasury spokesman acknowledged that the government's debt reduction plan was not complete but added that the programme was on track. The spokesman said: \"Today's public sector net borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast, which predicts the deficit to have halved by the end of this year. But the job is not yet done, which is why we must continue to work through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\"",

      "bodyText": "Charlie Northfield was born and bred in Devon, studied mining in Cornwall but then had to pack his bags and travel the world to find work in his chosen profession. He has mined for diamonds in west Africa and gold in east Africa. His CV includes stints in south-east Asia, the Americas, and eastern Europe. Now finally, at the age of 54, Northfield is back on home soil working on what is claimed to be the first new metal mine in Britain in almost half a century: the Drakelands tungsten mine on the edge of Dartmoor a few miles inland from his Plymouth birthplace. \"It's good to be back,\" said Northfield, who will manage the mine's processing plant. \"I've been away a long time. When I came out of mining school my first job was in a tin mine in Cornwall. And then I was away. I'm happy to be back; it means I can take my 84-year-old mum to watch Plymouth Argyle. But it's also great for the area, good new jobs for local people.\" By this time next year, if all goes to plan, Drakelands will be producing 3,500 tonnes of tungsten concentrate annually \u2013 about 3.5% of the global forecast demand. Wolf Minerals, the Australian company building and running the mine, claims 200 jobs will be directly created and says the \u00a3130m project will plough millions of pounds into the Devon economy every year. There are a few naysayers upset that a large opencast mine is appearing day by day on their doorsteps, but most accept that this is a traditional mining area \u2013 tin and china clay have been exploited here for centuries. Tellingly, the local pub is called the Miners Arms, and during preliminary digging work, evidence of mining dating back to the bronze age was discovered. Most in the Miners Arms bar seem to welcome the boost to the economy at a time when other local job opportunities in the shipyards, fishing ports and farms are on the wane. \"I think most people are for it,\" said parish councillor Julian Taylor. \"People knew they couldn't stop it anyway and they've promised jobs for local people so that's positive. We'll be keeping a close eye on it to make sure they do what they say they are going to.\" Operations manager Jeff Harrison, who worked in the china clay business in Devon and Cornwall for 30 years before jumping ship in favour of tungsten, accepted some people were suspicious of a huge hole being dug in their neighbourhood. \"But I can honestly say that most people have been supportive. They want us to do it right, they want us to restore the site once mining is complete [the plan is to work here for at least 15 years] but most see that this will bring benefits to a community that needs it.\" It has long been known, at least by those in the industry, that this hillside is home to the world's biggest deposits of tungsten. Formerly known as Hemerdon Mine, the site was exploited in the first and second world wars when tungsten was needed for ammunition but fell into disuse and sporadic attempts to revive it have failed. But now because the majority of the world's tungsten is to be found in China \u2013 which isn't parting with it \u2013 the price has risen and it makes economic sense to reopen the mine. More than 100 people are working on the 600-acre site, moving thousands of tonnes of earth and rock as they build access roads, a tip for the waste, ponds and watercourses. The opencast mine will eventually be 850 metres long (2,800ft), 450 metres wide and 200 metres deep. A British company, Essex-based CA Blackwell, won the main mining contract and Australian-based GR Engineering Services will be in charge of building the processing plant. But contracts for infrastructure and equipment have gone to companies across Devon, Cornwall and Somerset. Nigel Jump, visiting professor in regional economic development at the University of Plymouth, said despite the area's proud mining industry investment in the sector had been sparse in the region recently. \"Wolf's investment is welcome news for supply chains and local employment, especially if it can be sustained and developed beyond the initial phase. It is always good to hear about an export-orientated, high value-added operation instigating new activity around Plymouth.\" It is relatively easy to get to the tungsten ore, which is to be found within quartz veins in chunks of granite, and is scooped up by huge diggers. The ore is crushed and the tungsten concentrate extracted. It is then shipped out to be further refined elsewhere \u2013 contracts are in place for an Austrian and a US company to take the bulk of it. Most of the workers involved in the initial stage of the project are old-timers like Charlie Northfield and Jeff Harrison. But there are also younger workers including Henry Chalcroft, a 32-year-old forester turned miner from Whiddon Down on the other side of Dartmoor. He has already worked in Hong Kong and Australia but is also content to be home. \"It's nice to think that a new generation of young miners will be able to work here. It's not great for jobs around here. I'm happy and proud to be working on a mine in Devon.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TSB stocks require faith and patience Good luck to those retail investors who piled into TSB's flotation. They made a sound judgment that a forced seller, in this case Lloyds under orders from Brussels, could not afford a flop. On day one, the punters have done nicely. They bought at 260p and the shares traded above 285p all day on Friday. But let's hope those planning to hang around for their 1-for-20 bonus shares in a year's time read the sale prospectus. If they did, they will have spotted at least four reasons why Lloyds had to price TSB at 17% below net asset value. First, there's no hope of paying a dividend until 2018. Second, TSB will continue to rely on Lloyds for its IT systems until it can build its own. The parent has gifted \u00a3450m for the task, but the process will not be easy. It never is at banks; and non-bank entrants such as Tesco are trying to reinvent retail banking. Third, TSB needs to grow its loan book by 50% just to make its financial ratios look normal. It has been deliberately over-capitalised to allow a lending blitz but an aim of expanding by 50% in five years carries the obvious risk of saying \"yes\" to too many loans where the answer should be \"no.\" Fourth, the current loan book, where interest rates on a large slug of mortgages are capped at 2% above base rates, is horribly low-margin in the current climate. Mark Carney is muttering about the first hike in rates, which would help TSB; on the other hand, the governor of the Bank of England is also saying increases will be \"gradual and limited,\" which would not be so good. TSB also has a few advantages, of course. It arrives with a shiny guarantee that Lloyds will pick up the bill for any \"legacy conduct issues\", as the euphemism has it. TSB's cost-to-income is currently so high that it can only fall in time. And maybe chief executive Paul Pester's welcome words about being \"a high street bank, not a Wall Street bank,\" will cut through consumers' inertia about switching accounts. But this is a stock that requires faith and patience. Normal form is to pay investors to wait in the form of a dividend. Lloyds' shares are pricier judged by book value, but dividends should start to flow next year. The parent, rather than the off-spring, looks the safer investment. What's Sainsbury's thinking with Netto? Sir Terry Leahy's parting gift to Tesco was US chain Fresh &amp; Easy, which turned out to be a disaster. Justin King's at Sainsbury's is a joint venture with Netto, the Danish discounter seeking a second run at the UK market after exiting in 2010. A better idea? It's certainly lower risk, which is a definite plus. Tesco ended up squandering \u00a31.6bn in US before it pulled the plug. Sainsbury's and Netto will each invest \u00a312.5m at launch and expect losses of only \u00a35m-\u00a310m in the first year. There will be 15 Netto-branded stores initially and expansion will only happen if the trading performance is strong. Fair enough, but Sainsbury's thinking is still odd. If discounters such as Aldi and Lidl represent a real competitive threat, why would you wish to give another entrant a leg-up? Sainsbury's argues it is seeking a slice of a growing part of the market; it cites forecasts of a doubling in sales at the discount end to \u00a320bn in the next five years. On this characterisation, Sainsbury's is merely placing chips across the food retailing table \u2013 traditional supermarkets, convenience stores, home delivery and now discounters. The trouble is, not all its bets are of equal size. If discounters prosper at the expense of traditional supermarkets, how does that help Sainsbury's? \"We find this move by Sainsbury's perplexing, and it will further highlight how expensive the supermarkets are relative to the discounters,\" argues HSBC's analyst, David McCarthy. His long-standing advice to mainstream supermarkets is to deal with the discounters by becoming more competitive on price. That has the virtue of simplicity. More to the point, he says it's actually shown to work in France. Hard decisions for GlaxoSmithKline in China As Premier Li Keqiang took tea with the Queen this week, government ministers encouraged UK businesses to trade more with China. Mark Reilly may not share the sentiment. He is GlaxoSmithKline's former country head who finds himself at the centre of allegations by Chinese police that the UK drugs firm operated a corrupt scheme to bribe doctors and hospitals and inflate drug prices. Reilly is not detained but he is not free to leave China. Chinese prosecutors will decide whether cases against Reilly and several others go to court. Given the high-profile nature of the affair in China \u2013 the police called a press conference last month to detail the allegations and the state-owned media has been vocal \u2013 it would be amazing if formal charges were not made. GSK has said it takes the allegations \"very seriously\" and that \"they are deeply concerning to us and contrary to the values of GSK.\" That is the diplomatic language one would expect at this stage and, eventually, the company will have to give a full account of events. But it is safe to assume that, whatever happened in GSK's Chinese operation, the company thinks Reilly himself is innocent. He has worked for GSK for 20 years, remains on the payroll and returned to China voluntarily to assist police inquiries. The wheels of Chinese legal system turn slowly and out of sight. This process has a long way to run and behind-the-scenes political lobbying may also play a role. Asked about the affair during Li's visit, the business secretary, Vince Cable, hinted at the extreme sensitivities. \"I raised that particular issue with my Chinese opposite numbers and the points were well taken, they're now in a Chinese legal process and that's understood and we have to respect that.\" Yes, Chinese officialdom always prefers to be respected. But if Reilly is eventually charged, convicted and imprisoned, and if GSK feels its long-serving employee has been made a scapegoat, there is a hard decision to be made. It would surely be impossible for GSK to send foreign staff to work in China, which might imply a complete pullout. We need to know Ashley's cut Weariness among fund managers may mean that, at the fourth attempt, Sports Direct will succeed in getting a bonus scheme for founder and 58% shareholder Mike Ashley. The ruse is to lump the boss in with its all-employee scheme but refuse to say how many shares would be allocated to him. Yet the Association of British Insurers is not giving up easily. But a disgruntled band wants the proposal to be withdrawn. Its campaign could yet gather momentum before the vote on 2 July. The easy solution is for Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell to cough up the information: how many of the 25m shares would be offered to Ashley? The figure has to be published in the end anyway. Announcing it now might persuade a few waverers to give Ashley what he craves. Being bloody-minded serves no obvious purpose.",

      "bodyText": "The biggest ever investigation into the UK energy market will be unveiled next week by the industry watchdog, Ofgem, amid public anger over high bills and bad service from gas and electricity providers. An 18-month inquiry into claims of tacit coordination and profiteering will be undertaken by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and could end in the big six firms having their businesses broken up and reduced in scale. Energy has risen up the public and political agenda over the past eight months since Ed Miliband promised that an incoming Labour government would freeze prices, scrap the regulator and force large companies to sell off assets. Ofgem is preparing to start the investigation but will not formally announce it until the end of next week. Caroline Flint, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, said she welcomed the additional resources and support the CMA could provide to establish why overcharging, mis-selling and poor customer service had been allowed to go on for so long. \"Just in the last week we've learnt that wholesale prices have fallen substantially this year and yet consumers have seen no reduction to their bills,\" she said. \"This investigation must address problems like this and stop them happening again in the future. \"However, it shouldn't paralyse politicians from taking action now to improve the lack of competition and weak regulation in the energy market, which has resulted in customers getting a poor deal.\" At the start of June gas prices for next-day delivery reached their lowest level since September 2010 and were 38% lower than the same time last year, Ofgem has noted.

The formal investigation could recommend that individual big six members separate their units that generate power from those units that sell it to households to try to make inroads into their 95% market share.

The periphery\u2019s catch-up process began with the labour reforms in Spain and Portugal in early 2012. Conversely, France\u2019s gap appeared when Francois Hollande was elected president in May 2012. Instead of unleashing France\u2019s huge economic potential with supply-side reforms, he made good on a leftist election campaign platform. Taxes for entrepreneurs were raised, and modest labour market reforms reversed.</p> <p><strong>A change of tack</strong>. Paris has since adopted a few positive mini reforms, and the focus of fiscal consolidation is shifting from tax hikes to spending cuts. But even Hollande\u2019s new reform-minded Prime Minister Valls is shirking the much-needed labour market shake-up. And the \u20ac50bn in spending cuts until 2017 are running into fierce political resistance from his own party.</p> <p> <strong>The rising economic tide lifts all the boats</strong>. During the crisis, the eurozone was in mild recession, while the periphery experienced a serious contraction. At the moment, the eurozone is growing modestly, while France is stagnating. With the recovery gradually firming, the eurozone should soon reach trend growth rates, while France will see modest growth.

      "bodyText": "And finally... HSBC retail analyst David McCarthy has described Sainsbury's partnership with discount food chain Netto as \"sleeping with the enemy\", prompting memories of Julia Roberts' starring role as a woman who fakes her own death to get away from her controlling husband who likes to keep his tins and towels straight. McCarthy says: The discounters and pound stores are succeeding because of what the supermarket players are not doing, not just because of what they are doing. Sainsbury has the attitude \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them join them\u201d, but to us this is a tacit admission its core model can\u2019t compete. On that note it's time to close up. Thank you for reading the blog today and for all your comments. Please join us again on Monday. European markets remain mixed after Wall Street's open. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,835.62 DAX: +0.19% at 10,023.35 CAC 40: +0.09% at 4,567.17 FTSE MIB: -0.74% at 22,053.21 IBEX 35: -0.24% at 11,161.40 As EU finance ministers debate the issues of the day in Luxembourg, economists at Berenberg bank argue that while former crisis economies in southern Europe make progress, France is at risk of getting left behind. They have written a note which says the gap between the French PMI survey level and that of the eurozone is nearly as large as the periphery\u2019s gap at the height of the euro crisis in 2011/12. French president Francois Hollande doesn't come out of it well. Holger Schmieding, Christian Schulz and Rob Wood write: Reforms pay off, inertia does not. The periphery\u2019s catch-up process began with the labour reforms in Spain and Portugal in early 2012. Conversely, France\u2019s gap appeared when Francois Hollande was elected president in May 2012. Instead of unleashing France\u2019s huge economic potential with supply-side reforms, he made good on a leftist election campaign platform. Taxes for entrepreneurs were raised, and modest labour market reforms reversed. A change of tack. Paris has since adopted a few positive mini reforms, and the focus of fiscal consolidation is shifting from tax hikes to spending cuts. But even Hollande\u2019s new reform-minded Prime Minister Valls is shirking the much-needed labour market shake-up. And the \u20ac50bn in spending cuts until 2017 are running into fierce political resistance from his own party. The rising economic tide lifts all the boats. During the crisis, the eurozone was in mild recession, while the periphery experienced a serious contraction. At the moment, the eurozone is growing modestly, while France is stagnating. With the recovery gradually firming, the eurozone should soon reach trend growth rates, while France will see modest growth. As a result, the government\u2019s sense of urgency could soon fade. A few more reforms are likely to come. 2014 is a window of opportunity, as the next presidential elections are three years away. Enough time to take some pain now and enjoy the benefits on election day in 2017. But for France to have a Schr\u00f6der moment, similar to the determined reform drive of Germany\u2019s erstwhile Chancellor in 2004, the pain in France is probably not bad enough. We expect only very modest reforms instead. US markets have opened up slightly: Dow Jones: +0.08% at 16,935.39 S&amp;P 500: 0% (0.06 points) at 1959.54 Nasdaq: +0.12% at 4,364.75 Oil is also heading for a second weekly gain on increased risks of supply disruptions as a result of the crisis in Iraq - the world's seventh largest producer of oil. At near $115 a barrel it is close to a nine-month high. Reuters reports that oilfields south of Baghdad are unaffected, but fighting in the north, and the decision by foreign oil firms to start pulling staff out, pose a risk to supplies. Barbara Lambrecht, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: The events unfolding in Iraq will continue to dicate the \ufeffdirection on the market and support the oil price for the time being at a high level. Brent crude has slipped slightly to $114.72 a barrel after reaching $115.71 on Thursday, which was the highest since September. Gold has fallen today but it is still on course for its biggest weekly rise in three months on the back of the crisis in Iraq and a weaker dollar. Spot gold prices dropped 0.5% to $1,312.80 an ounce but it has gained about 3% over the week. US gold futures for August delivery were down 0.1% at $1,313.40 an ounce. The dollar is up slightly but still on course for its biggest weekly loss since April after Janet Yellen signalled the Federal Reserve could keep interest rates low for a long time. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, has refused to speculate about any possible further measures the European Central Bank might consider to tackle the threat of deflation. Earlier this month the ECB cut interest rates to a record low, imposed negative rates on bank deposits, and announced \u20ac400bn (\u00a3319bn) of cheap funding. Speaking at the EU finance ministers' meeting, Schaeuble said: The ECB has taken its decision. That can have its effect now. Therefore we don't need a debate now that can be misunderstood to mean further measures are necessary. Whatever Schaeuble might wish for, it seems unlikely that talk about the prospect of quantitative easing is going to go anywhere soon. All eyes remain on eurozone inflation, which was just 0.5% in May. Benoit Coeure, a member of the European Central Bank executive board, has said that now is the time for those eurozone economies hit worst by the crisis to get on with urgent reforms. He told reporters at an EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg that there is a \"window of opportunity\" for highly indebted countries while borrowing costs are so low and the darkest days of the crisis are over. The window of opportunity is there. Market conditions are extraordinary\ufeff, this cannot be taken for granted so action on structural reform is urgent. Monetary conditions and financial conditions are very benign, very favourable. The ECB has indicated that rates will stay low for an extended period of time and this creates a window of opportunity to reform. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's chief economist and member of the Monetary Policy Committee, has given an interview to The Scarborough News on a recent trip to Yorkshire. Here is some of what the Leeds-born economist had to say: \ufeffBusinesses gives us a really important read on how the economy is performing. It\u2019s been pretty upbeat I would say. That can\u2019t be said of every business in every sector in every region ... but it\u2019s a pretty positive picture. We know the wider economy is growing at a fair click, maybe 3% year on year, which is pretty good going, I\u2019d say what we have heard [in Yorkshire] was consistent with that. I think you could make a case [for a north/south divide] and the numbers will tell you that things are a little bit hotter in parts of the south - you know rates of unemployment are a little bit lower there than they are up here - but none the less in terms of the kind of the pace of pick up it\u2019s not too dissimilar actually. If you look at some of the survey evidence, that suggests that consumers, households, have got a spring in their step and that\u2019s true the length and breadth of the country. And that\u2019s true on the business side also. I say what we have heard in Yorkshire is pretty much bang in line with that. For those of you wondering what a new store might look like when Netto returns to the UK, here you go. Competition between Britain's major supermarkets just got more intense after Sainsbury's announced a partnership with Netto, the Danish discount grocer. It is the latest attempt to stay on top and limit the UK rise of successful German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Netto will open 15 UK stores by the end of 2015 with the first planned for the north of England later this year. The idea seems to be that Sainsbury's will attempt to capitalise on Netto's low-cost focus, while Sainsbury's will offer up its knowledge of UK products and property. If the first branches trade successfully, Netto stores will open across the country. Netto has tried to expand in the UK before but gave up in 2010 by selling its stores to Asda. It said the new stores would be completely different from the old format, selling fresh food and Danish breads and pastries at in-house bakeries. Read our story here. A quick search of the archive has revealed one picture of Netto: Mike Coupe, who will succeed Justin King as Sainsbury's chief executive next month, said: \ufeffThis joint venture provides a great opportunity for us to gain exposure to the high growth discount market for the first time in partnership with [parent company] Dansk Supermarked, whose expertise and values are a strong complement to our own. If successful, this trial has the potential to open up a new long term growth opportunity for us complementing our fast expanding convenience, online and non-food businesses, as well as our existing supermarket estate. Labour has responded to the worse than expected UK borrowing numbers. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has taken it as another opportunity to remind us that the chancellor has broken his original pledge on the deficit. \ufeffNot only is George Osborne set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, but so far this year he is borrowing more than the same period last year. Borrowing is now expected to be almost \u00a3190bn more than planned under this government. This is the cost of three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election. Labour will balance the books and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament, but we will do so in a fairer way. And we will act to secure a strong and balanced recovery that delivers rising living standards for the many, not just a few at the top.\u201d Government borrowing was \u00a313.3bn in May, higher than May 2013 when it was \u00a312.6bn and higher than City forecasts. Just two months into the 2014/15 fiscal year, it is early days for the chancellor in terms of his full-year deficit reduction targets, but clearly he is not off to a great start. Tax receipts have been weaker than expected, with income tax take particularly disappointing. The Treasury has been quick to issue a statement: The government\u2019s long term economic plan is working, delivering economic security for hardworking people. Today\u2019s public sector net borrowing figures continue to be in line with the budget forecast which predicts the deficit to have halved by the end of this year. But the job is not yet done which is why we must continue to work through the plan that is building a resilient economy.\ufeff But Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics is more sceptical about the numbers: \ufeffMay\u2019s public borrowing figures contain tentative signs that the coalition may be beginning to struggle to bring down the deficit in line with the fiscal plans. Since the OBR expects borrowing to be about 11% lower this year than last, the fiscal consolidation appears to be slightly off track. The real concern lies not in the strength of government spending \u2013 indeed, current spending was just 0.3% higher than a year ago. Rather, tax receipts have continued to grow disappointingly weakly and were up just 1.1% year on year in May. So while the economic recovery may now be fairly strong, it still appears to be struggling to have much of an impact on the borrowing numbers. When the Office for Budget Responsibility (the Treasury's official and independent forecaster) published its updated forecasts at the time of the budget in March, it predicted full-year borrowing would fall from \u00a3107.8bn last year (2013/14) to \u00a395.5bn this year. The latest public finances figures from the Office for National Statistics did provide a smidgen of better news for George Osborne, in that borrowing for 2013/14 was revised down to \u00a3107bn - a bigger undershoot of the target than previously thought. The Fed effect on European shares has faded this morning. Janet Yellen's dovish comments drove markets higher on Thursday (and the S&amp;P to a record high) but investors are now feeling more cautious. FTSE 100: +0.27% at 6,826.44 DAX: +0.10% at 10,005 CAC 40: -0.08% at 4,559.31 FTSE MIB: -0.52% at 22,101.93 IBEX 35: -0.22% at 11,163.10 The International Monetary Fund last night published a statement on the eurozone. Here is a summary of the main points: Recovery is taking hold But it is a weak recovery Inflation is worryingly high Unemployment is unacceptably high Recent policy action from the ECB is encouraging But the ECB should introduce quantitative easing if inflation remains low So nothing surprising there, but a further signal of intent from the IMF that it intends to keep the pressure up on Mario Draghi and his ECB colleagues to do more to try and breathe some life into the currency bloc's ailing economy. The main UK corporate news this morning is the decision by Lloyds Banking Group to sell 35% of TSB when it floats and not 25% as previously expected, after strong demand for shares. TSB shares have been priced at 260p, valuing the high street banking offshoot at \u00a31.3bn. Shares are trading this morning at just above 290p. Read out full story from Jill Treanor here. The Lloyds chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio had this to say on the sale: The successful initial public offering of TSB is an important further step for Lloyds Banking Group as we act to meet our commitments to the European commission. The significant investor demand for shares in TSB, which reflects investors' confidence in the prospects for the business, has meant that we have been able to set the offer size at 35%. As the Guardian's Jill Treanor explains, there are suggestions that Mark Carney is behind the sale of a bigger than expected stake in TSB. The suggestion from the Bank of England's governor that interest rates could rise sooner than markets are predicting is regarded as helpful for TSB as higher rates could spell bigger profits for the bank. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. England fans might be feeling gloomy this morning after last night's World Cup defeat to Uruguay but global investors are not. MSCI's all-country world index, which includes around 85% of global equities, has passed its previous all-time high reached in November 2007. Investors accustomed to the ultra loose monetary policy stance adopted by central banks some six years ago have been cheered by signals from the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank that policy will stay loose for a long time to come. In the UK, the City awaits the latest snapshot of the public finances at 9.30am. Economists are forecasting borrowing of around \u00a312bn in May, which would be an increase on April.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury's is fighting back against the rise of discount stores, taking a half-share in a new Netto chain to challenge fast-growing Aldi and Lidl. In a radical move that underlines the scale of the challenge facing Britain's established big grocers, Sainsbury's has teamed up with Denmark's biggest retailer, Dansk Supermarked, to build the new Netto business, starting in the north of England. Fifteen stores are planned by the end of next year. For Netto, the Sainsbury's deal represents a return to the British high street. The business traded in the UK until 2010, when Dansk sold its 200 outlets to Asda, which used them to open small, in-town stores. Sainsbury's and Dansk Supermarked said the partnership would combine Netto's low-cost operations with Sainsbury's knowledge of UK products and property. If the first batch of branches trade well, the plan is to open stores across the country. They will sell fresh food, have in-store bakeries and weekly offers of home and seasonal products such as camping gear in the same way as Lidl and Aldi. They will not sell Sainsbury's own-label food. The partnership is a bold move to take on the German discounters, which are stealing customers from Britain's big four supermarkets, as out-of-town superstores lose out to more local, low-cost shops. Sainsbury's has said repeatedly that it will not join the supermarket price war threatened by price-cutting campaigns from Morrisons and Tesco, which have been particularly hard hit by the discount stores. Sainsbury's argues that its superior values, such as fair trade bananas, set it apart. But now Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's incoming chief executive, is trying to carve out his own slice of the discount market in the dramatic first sign of a change in tactics before he takes over from Justin King next month. Coupe said: \"We are not blind to the fact that the discount market is likely to double over the next five years and we want a share of that action. \"If successful, this trial has the potential to open up a new long-term growth opportunity for us, complementing our fast expanding convenience, online and non-food businesses, as well as our existing supermarket estate.\" Analysts, however, warned that Sainsbury's risked damaging the perception of its brand with shoppers, who might question why they should pay more in the company's supermarkets for similar or even the same fresh produce or branded goods on sale in its Netto stores. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said Sainsbury's was merely adding momentum to the discount sector's growth rather than fighting back. He argues that Sainsbury's should be investing more in cutting prices at its main stores rather than in a discount chain. \"Sainsbury's has the attitude 'if you can't beat them, join them', but to us this is a tacit admission its core model can't compete,\" he said in a note. But Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, welcomed Sainsbury's move: \"I think it's potentially an outstanding manoeuvre. This chain is totally complementary to their existing business and gives access to a greater market that their current brand doesn't give access to.\" After the longest recession since the second world war and years of falling living standards, British households are shopping around for value and buying more of their regular weekly shop from Aldi and Lidl. Discounters are expected to see their share of the grocery market to double to about 15% in the next five years as a result. King, who Coupe said was also involved in discussions with Dansk, has said the new shopping habits are entrenched and supermarkets needed to adapt to the new reality. Sainsbury's has survived the march of the discounters better than Tesco and Morrisons but recently announced its second consecutive quarter of falling sales after nine years of unbroken growth. Sainsbury's and Dansk will both put \u00a312.5m into the joint venture and they expect to incur losses of \u00a35m-\u00a310m each in the year to March 2015. Per Bank, a former Tesco executive who is now head of Dansk Supermarked, said the new stores would be completely different from the old format, selling 2,100 products compared with only 1,200 before. The stores will also be bigger, at about 1,000 sq metres (11,000 sq ft) compared with 750 sq m before. \"The UK discount sector is growing very rapidly and we believe now is the right time to be entering the UK market,\" he said. Sainsbury's shares lost 1.4% to close at 316p. Northern bases Yorkshire and Lincolnshire are set to benefit from new jobs as Netto UK sets up home in the north of England. The new joint venture between Sainsbury's and Denmark's biggest retailer Dansk Supermarked will have its own headquarters in Wakefield and a distribution centre in Scunthorpe, initially creating about 350 jobs, sources said. The base in Wakefield puts Netto right on the doorstep of two of Sainsbury's biggest rivals: Leeds-based Asda and Bradford-based Morrisons. The new chain's first stores, which will be based along the M62 corridor from Liverpool to near Hull, are also likely to hit those two northern-based chains hardest. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 June 2014. An earlier version said 15 Netto stores were due to open by the end of this year. They are expected to open by the end of 2015.",
