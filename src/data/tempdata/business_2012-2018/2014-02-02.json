    "webTitle": "Untold story of the downturn: the shift from paid jobs to self-employment", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There are some startling facts emerging as politicians battle over the living standards of British workers. There is the collapse in manufacturing jobs since the banking crash \u2013 down 325,000 \u2013 despite a recovery in the last 18 months led by the West Midlands car industry. Then there is the 457,000 rise in employment across the human health and social work industry. These are counted as private sector jobs because private contractors pay their salaries, but in essence are jobs, often low-skilled and part-time, that are outsourced and paid for by the public sector. It is easy to argue that based on these figures alone Britain has failed to rebalance towards high productivity employment sectors underpinned by industrial investment and exports. Yet the figures that really leap out reveal the rise in self-employment. In the years from the start of the recession in 2008 to 2013 the number of self-employed workers increased by 333,000 compared to a fall of 201,000 in the number of employees. In the last year more permanent in-house jobs have been created, but the shift to self-employment has continued unabated. Official figures for 2013 show 302,000 self-employed jobs were created in the UK economy compared to 337,000 permanent jobs. So while the overall jobs situation appeared to be holding up well in the face of a terrible recession, the composition of the workforce was changing dramatically, and not for the better. The TUC reckons that a conservative assessment shows that, after all the to-ing and fro-ing in the labour market, about 540,000 of the million or so jobs created since 2008 have been among the self-employed. It would be nice to think there are thousands more plumbers and electricians helping the economy zip along at a faster pace, but that's not the case. The new army of self-employed workers cannot be considered examples of a new entrepreneurial spirit when a closer examination of their incomes shows they have dropped 20% between 2006 and today. James Plunkett, director of policy at the Resolution Foundation, says the shift towards self-employment documented in his research \"has been one of the untold stories of the downturn\". Like the TUC's Duncan Weldon, Plunkett and his social policy thinktank have spent time digging around in the undergrowth of the employment data. Plunkett says: \"The numbers are up hugely at the same time as self-employed earnings have collapsed. The worry is that these aren't budding entrepreneurs, but people taking on insecure odd jobs to make ends meet.\" In traditional societies, the largest category of self-employment is in agriculture. Portugal, Spain and Italy counted large numbers of self-employed workers until very recently and most drove tractors or muddled along until it was time to pick grapes. In Britain, alongside agriculture, there has long been an army of construction workers who keep themselves off the PAYE books to stay flexible and out of the tax authority's clutches. Since 2000 there are 1.2 million more self-employed businesses, making a total of 3.7 million. Not many of them register mega-incomes. One characteristic of self-employed businesses is that most report incomes small enough to fall under the VAT radar (currently \u00a379,000). Only 100,000 of the businesses that have sprung up in the last 14 years are VAT registered. Consistent growth through the good times before the crash and also through the more difficult period since can be explained by tax incentives combined in many cases by a measure of desperation. Labour encouraged self-employment through an expansion of outsourcing and Gordon Brown was convinced that persuading the self-employed to acquire the status of a company was the first step to creating a more entrepreneurial economy. Many people grabbed the low tax rates on offer to make themselves into a little company, but this move can be seen as a traditional British tax dodge rather than a route to Silicon Valley-style innovation. Since the crash, evidence suggests self-employment has been a desperate act by people made redundant. According to David Blanchflower, the Dartmouth College economist who has tracked self-employment trends since the late 1980s, the self-employed claim they are happy and in control of their lives when they are really miserable and under high pressure. In a much quoted academic paper, the former Bank of England policymaker said self-employed workers report having control over their lives and being \"highly satisfied\" despite evidence to the contrary. \"The self-employed work under a lot of pressure, report that they find their work stressful and that they come home from work exhausted. Further, they report being constantly under strain, that they lose sleep over worry and place more weight on work than they do on leisure,\" he said. Many of the people Blanchflower is talking about are IT workers, people in the media and consultants in a wide-range of industries. But in the last 12 months they appear to be in the minority because one of the biggest growth areas is the property sector and estate agency work in particular. They might be earning above the average wage, but are estate agents raising Britain's productive capacity? It's a difficult argument to make. Last week the Office for National Statistics (ONS) made the point that its surveys show a switch in jobs from high paying financial services and skilled work to lower paid jobs in the services sector. It is another finding that fits with the rise of care industry jobs and other surveys showing the remainder are in the hotels and catering industries, notorious for their use of zero-hours contracts. It said depressed wages in these sectors helped make the last five years the longest period of falling real incomes in two generations. Plunkett says one result of these trends is that it's now much harder to judge what's happening in our labour market. \"The self-employed, for example, aren't even included in the government's official data on wages. The headline figures simply overlook some of the most important recent changes in our jobs market. \"The rise of self-employment is just part of a much wider move towards more casual, insecure working arrangements. Increasingly these aren't just a feature of the bottom end of our jobs market, but something much more widespread.\" It is only a couple of weeks since George Osborne's attempt to show that disposable incomes, after inflation is taken into account, are rising. At the time his figures met with several criticisms. There was the fact that they were almost a year out of date and pay rises have been falling since then. He failed to take into account cuts in tax credits and benefits like child benefit in his calculations. The ONS pay figures he used also excluded self-employed workers. Given what we know about the trend among the self-employed and the importance to the jobs figures since 2008, that is a huge omission and another factor undermining his grandiose claims.",

      "body": "<p>There are some startling facts emerging as politicians battle over the living standards of British workers.</p> <p>There is the collapse in manufacturing jobs since the banking crash \u2013 down 325,000 \u2013 despite a recovery in the last 18 months led by the West Midlands car industry.</p> <p>Then there is the 457,000 rise in employment across the human health and social work industry.</p> <p>These are counted as private sector jobs because private contractors pay their salaries, but in essence are jobs, often low-skilled and part-time, that are outsourced and paid for by the public sector.</p> <p>It is easy to argue that based on these figures alone Britain has failed to rebalance towards high productivity employment sectors underpinned by industrial investment and exports. Yet the figures that really leap out reveal the rise in self-employment.</p> <p>In the years from the start of the recession in 2008 to 2013 the number of self-employed workers increased by 333,000 compared to a fall of 201,000 in the number of employees. In the last year more permanent in-house jobs have been created, but the shift to self-employment has continued unabated.</p> <p>Official figures for 2013 show 302,000 self-employed jobs were created in the UK economy compared to 337,000 permanent jobs.</p> <p>So while the overall jobs situation appeared to be holding up well in the face of a terrible recession, the composition of the workforce was changing dramatically, and not for the better.</p> <p>The TUC reckons that a conservative assessment shows that, after all the to-ing and fro-ing in the labour market, about 540,000 of the million or so jobs created since 2008 have been among the self-employed.</p> <p>It would be nice to think there are thousands more plumbers and electricians helping the economy zip along at a faster pace, but that's not the case.</p> <p>The new army of self-employed workers cannot be considered examples of a new entrepreneurial spirit when a closer examination of their incomes shows they have dropped 20% between 2006 and today.</p> <p>James Plunkett, director of policy at the Resolution Foundation, says the shift towards self-employment documented in his research \"has been one of the untold stories of the downturn\".</p> <p>Like the TUC's Duncan Weldon, Plunkett and his social policy thinktank have spent time digging around in the undergrowth of the employment data.</p> <p>Plunkett says: \"The numbers are up hugely at the same time as self-employed earnings have collapsed. The worry is that these aren't budding entrepreneurs, but people taking on insecure odd jobs to make ends meet.\"</p> <p>In traditional societies, the largest category of self-employment is in agriculture. Portugal, Spain and Italy counted large numbers of self-employed workers until very recently and most drove tractors or muddled along until it was time to pick grapes.</p> <p>In Britain, alongside agriculture, there has long been an army of construction workers who keep themselves off the PAYE books to stay flexible and out of the tax authority's clutches.</p> <p>Since 2000 there are 1.2 million more self-employed businesses, making a total of 3.7 million. Not many of them register mega-incomes. One characteristic of self-employed businesses is that most report incomes small enough to fall under the VAT radar (currently \u00a379,000). Only 100,000 of the businesses that have sprung up in the last 14 years are VAT registered.</p> <p>Consistent growth through the good times before the crash and also through the more difficult period since can be explained by tax incentives combined in many cases by a measure of desperation.</p> <p>Labour encouraged self-employment through an expansion of outsourcing and Gordon Brown was convinced that persuading the self-employed to acquire the status of a company was the first step to creating a more entrepreneurial economy.</p> <p>Many people grabbed the low tax rates on offer to make themselves into a little company, but this move can be seen as a traditional British tax dodge rather than a route to Silicon Valley-style innovation. Since the crash, evidence suggests self-employment has been a desperate act by people made redundant.</p> <p>According to David Blanchflower, the Dartmouth College economist who has tracked self-employment trends since the late 1980s, the self-employed claim they are happy and in control of their lives when they are really miserable and under high pressure.</p> <p>In a much quoted academic paper, the former Bank of England policymaker said self-employed workers report having control over their lives and being \"highly satisfied\" despite evidence to the contrary.</p> <p>\"The self-employed work under a lot of pressure, report that they find their work stressful and that they come home from work exhausted. Further, they report being constantly under strain, that they lose sleep over worry and place more weight on work than they do on leisure,\" he said.</p> <p>Many of the people Blanchflower is talking about are IT workers, people in the media and consultants in a wide-range of industries. But in the last 12 months they appear to be in the minority because one of the biggest growth areas is the property sector and estate agency work in particular. They might be earning above the average wage, but are estate agents raising Britain's productive capacity? It's a difficult argument to make.</p> <p>Last week the Office for National Statistics (ONS) made the point that its surveys show a switch in jobs from high paying financial services and skilled work to lower paid jobs in the services sector. It is another finding that fits with the rise of care industry jobs and other surveys showing the remainder are in the hotels and catering industries, notorious for their use of zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>It said depressed wages in these sectors helped make the last five years the longest period of falling real incomes in two generations.</p> <p>Plunkett says one result of these trends is that it's now much harder to judge what's happening in our labour market.</p> <p>\"The self-employed, for example, aren't even included in the government's official data on wages. The headline figures simply overlook some of the most important recent changes in our jobs market.</p> <p>\"The rise of self-employment is just part of a much wider move towards more casual, insecure working arrangements. Increasingly these aren't just a feature of the bottom end of our jobs market, but something much more widespread.\"</p> <p>It is only a couple of weeks since George Osborne's attempt to show that disposable incomes, after inflation is taken into account, are rising.</p> <p>At the time his figures met with several criticisms. There was the fact that they were almost a year out of date and pay rises have been falling since then. He failed to take into account cuts in tax credits and benefits like child benefit in his calculations. The ONS pay figures he used also excluded self-employed workers.</p> <p>Given what we know about the trend among the self-employed and the importance to the jobs figures since 2008, that is a huge omission and another factor undermining his grandiose claims.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wealthy foreign buyers' desire for high-end London property is creating a real risk of a housing bubble in the capital, a highly-regarded group of economic forecasters has warned as it calls for measures to cool down the market. In a special report published on Monday into the impact of rising house prices, the EY Item Club said the influx of super wealthy buyers has created bubble-like conditions in London. The EY Item Club's senior economic adviser, Andrew Goodwin, said: \"House prices across most of the country remain well below their pre-crisis peaks and there seems little danger of a bubble developing. \"But London, which is suffering from a combination of strong demand and a lack of supply, is increasingly giving us cause for concern.\" The Item Club's warning is important because it is the only independent economic group to use the same forecasting model as the Treasury. Item stands for Independent Treasury Economic Model. Estate agents, politicians and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have all raised fears that the UK is risking a repeat of the 2008 property crash. The business secretary, Vince Cable, has repeatedly warned of the dangers of another housing bubble. Last week he said: \"We cannot risk another property-linked boom-bust cycle which has done so much damage before, notably in the financial crash in 2008.\" The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has played down fears of a bubble. He said that while prices are rising quickly the acceleration is \"from quite a low level\". The Item Club study shows average UK house prices are rising at a rate of 8.4% this year, and predicted them to rise by 7.3% next year and about 5.5% a year thereafter. Prices are growing even faster in London. Office for National Statistics data shows average prices in the capital increased by 11% in the year to November 2013. This increases dragged the national average up from 3.5% to 5.4%. The strongest growth is among the most luxurious homes, as rich foreigners take advantage of the fall in the value of sterling. The prices of prime London property \u2013 defined as homes that cost more than \u00a31,000 per sq ft \u2013 are now 27% above their 2007 peak, according to estate agent Savills. The Item Club study said soaring prices at the top end are trickling down throughout the market and predicted the average London home will cost more than \u00a3600,000 by 2018. That would be 3.5 times the average in Northern Ireland and 3.3 times the average in the north-east of England. The report said international interest in London property had been \"very high due to a combination of heightened risk elsewhere in the world, low returns on other assets such as bonds, equities and cash, and a weak pound, which has made London properties cheaper for foreigner buyers\". The report added: \"Arguably it would be more appropriate to treat it as an investment market, rather than a residential market.\" Ernst &amp; Young's head of real estate, Dean Hodcroft, said London is now so popular with the super-rich that it would be hard for policymakers to intervene and cool the market. He said: \"Bursting a bubble at the luxury end of the market, which continues to attract interest from international cash buyers with the seemingly irresistible global draw of London's X-factor, may prove tricky.\" The Item Club report said the Bank of England should consider intervening to block people from being able to borrow more than three times their income. \"If multiples began to approach this level we would regard this as a sign that borrowers and lenders were throwing caution to the wind and that the market was entering bubble territory.\" The average mortgage in London is already more than three times average salary. The housing minister, Kris Hopkins, said: \"The London housing market has received valuable support from foreign investment, unlocking development and leading to the building of homes that wouldn't otherwise happen.\"",

Abetz said he did not believe cabinet\u2019s decision would necessarily cost thousands of jobs in the Goulburn Valley, arguing SPC Ardmona had the potential to return to profit if it looked at its cost structures and \u201chelp themselves in clearly difficult circumstances\u201d. Abetz said the company was wrong to agree to \u201cover-generous\u201d conditions for the workers in early 2013, pointing to a \u201cshiny tin allowance\u201d for forklift drivers as an indication of excessive conditions in SPC Ardmona\u2019s enterprise agreement with workers. He referred to a provision in the enterprise agreement that says: \u201cEmployees who are forklift drivers and who are stacking pallets of bright cans shall be entitled to an allowance of 50 cents per hour.\u201d Abetz said the \u201cshiny tin allowance\u201d was removed in 1991 when SPC Ardmona was in financial strife. \u201cHere we are 20 years later, the company allegedly in a bit of strife, and guess what? The shiny tin allowance has crept back into the enterprise bargaining agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies need to learn from their own history that they cannot keep going down the same route time and time again and not learn the consequences of doing so. I believe the cabinet decision was the right decision. Do I feel for the people of Shepparton? Of course I do. The uncertainty isn\u2019t good. But at the end of the day that is the company\u2019s responsibility, the union\u2019s and the workers\u2019 responsibility to come together to make sure that this enterprise succeeds.\u201d Abbott, who indicated in December he would resist requests for \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d, said on Thursday the cabinet\u2019s decision was an important marker of the government\u2019s approach to questions of industry assistance. He argued governments should provide the overall conditions for companies to flourish but individual businesses had to lead their own restructures. Labor\u2019s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, said the government\u2019s decision was disappointing. She told Sky News on Sunday that the treasurer, Joe Hockey, was \u201crunning a hard line\u201d on industry assistance after he was \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d into rejecting the GrainCorp foreign investment proposal. She said Shepparton was not an area that had a lot of other employment opportunities. The Australian Council of Trade Unions argued the government\u2019s industry policy was \u201cachieving nothing other than massive job losses and the decimation of the local manufacturing industry\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was business as usual on Friday for Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's newly anointed chief executive, as he spent the day anonymously patrolling the aisles of rival supermarkets in the heartland of Morrisons: Bradford. The trip was a typically low-key move for the genial executive, who was thrust into the media spotlight on Wednesday when the supermarket confirmed that, come the summer, he will be filling Justin King's substantial shoes as chief executive. One of the UK's most famous businessmen, King is a hard act for Coupe to follow. On his watch, the supermarket racked up 36 quarters of like-for-like growth and trebled profits. Sainsbury's has also gained a new national profile as a business backed by ethical values, as King flamboyantly negotiated Question Time and took bold risks such as sponsoring the 2012 Paralympic Games. The two men \u2013 at 53, Coupe is a year older than King \u2013 have worked side by side for the past decade, taking many of the decisions that have fuelled Sainsbury's growth together. But King's abdication comes at a precarious time for the supermarket: headwinds in the industry suggest Coupe's first outing as boss could see him having to explain falling sales for the first time in more than three years. Only last month Sainsbury's warned it was scaling down sales expectations after recording its slowest growth for nine years. King admitted last Christmas was the toughest he'd seen in 30 years. It is suffering alongside all its mainstream competitors as shoppers switch to online and convenience stores, while the low prices of Lidl and Aldi tempt customers away. Bryan Roberts, director of retail insights at Kantar Retail, says: \"Coupe's taking charge at a time when the relentless good news might dry up. Shareholders are looking for some progress in terms of profitability but that's not easy when you are half the size of Tesco. Tesco learned that cutting costs can be a vicious circle as it affects stores and results in your customers deserting you.\" King may be leaving at an opportune moment, but there appears to be a real bond of friendship between him and Coupe. Despite their different personalities, they have worked alongside each other for 17 of the last 20 years at Asda and Sainsbury's. That mutual trust saw Coupe join Sainsbury's within months of King's appointment as chief executive and insiders say he has been instrumental in the business's success. \"Mike has been an architect of the recovery at Sainsbury in the same way as Justin. Justin got to accept the plaudits but, in terms of trading and strategy, Mike has led the way,\" says one senior retail figure who knows both men well. That close partnership means that there is likely to be a smooth transition, despite differing styles. \"Mike's style is much more down to earth and straightforward than Justin, who is more of a showman,\" says the senior retail figure. Insight into their differences comes from their preferred modes of transport. King showed his \"green\" credentials by swapping his \u00a380,000 Maserati Quattroporte saloon for a top of the range Lexus hybrid (\u00a388,000). Coupe shows his own green mettle by getting the train \u2013 that's how he got to Bradford \u2013 and occasionally borrowing his kids' Fiat 500. He also always eats fish and chips on a Friday. King is a natural leader. He never lapses into management-speak and has a confidence that comes across well on TV as well as in stores, where he inspires One Direction-style fan worship. Coupe is better known at head office, where he already heads key divisions such as food and clothing and leads the important weekly trading meetings. \"He has a different style to Justin but he understands the strategy and the business,\" says Archie Norman, the retail veteran who worked with both men at Asda. \"Mike is a pretty rounded guy. Very bright and calm and strategically smart. He has got a good eye for detail and managed in very different situations at Asda and briefly at Iceland. He is a top chief executive.\" Friends of Coupe's say his self-deprecating manner \u2013 his CV describes him as an \"average\" guitar player, yet friends say he is a talented musician \u2013 masks a backbone of steel. \"When he wants something to happen, he has a way of making it happen,\" says one insider. \"He also manages to do it without humiliating or browbeating people. Like Justin, he trusts people to get on with their job but still has a grasp of the detail.\" Bill Grimsey, the former boss of Iceland, agrees: \"Mike's key skill is in gathering people around him. He is a good communicator and leader. He has been in the business all his career and he's not just a functional retailer; he cares about the customer.\" The son of an entrepreneurial engineer who started his own medical supplies business, Coupe studied physics at Birmingham. Tall, thin \u2013 thanks to the many miles clocked up on his bike \u2013 and bespectacled, he cuts a more academic figure than the perma-tanned King. \"He's not geeky, though,\" insists the retail insider. \"He's very quick-witted, in all senses of the word. He's got a brain the size of a planet.\" Coupe has also clocked up vast amounts of industry experience, cutting his teeth at consumer giant Unilever, where he became assistant brand manager for Flora margarine. He moved on to Tesco, where he rose to become head of household products, before jumping ship to Asda, where he was once the boss of one Justin King. He also led Asda's Dales Discount chain and kickstarted the retailer's e-commerce business \u2013 experiences that will equip him well for his biggest challenges today. Coupe is much more digitally savvy than King, who has held back from some of the more ambitious online efforts of his rivals. He has also had to wrestle with some very tough business situations \u2013 not least at Iceland, where he briefly teamed up with Grimsey to try and revive the business. Grimsey says: \"Mike found the job at Iceland very tough. It was different to Sainsbury's because he went into a very difficult situation. He will have to get his hands on the tiller and steer strategically, whereas Iceland was a shipwreck.\" Having been instrumental in guiding the now well-maintained Sainsbury's ship into relatively calm waters over the past decade, Coupe is unlikely to make a strategic U-turn, although he has made clear that the business will adapt to the changing marketplace. As an e-commerce evangelist, Coupe is almost certain to ramp up Sainsbury's activity online and with in-store technology. The man credited with inventing Sainsbury's BrandMatch promotional scheme, and who led the supermarket's recent attack on rival Tesco over price comparisons and the value of ethical sourcing, is also likely to have new marketing ideas up his sleeve to take the fight to the discounters. In the face of those challenges, Coupe will be under pressure to build profits without the benefit of beginning his tenure with the kind of \"kitchen sink\" profits-hacking that his predecessor undertook. When King arrived at a distressed Sainsbury's in 2004, he slashed profits from \u00a3675m in 2004 to just \u00a3254m in 2005 as he lowered prices and invested more in staff and stores to help make the business more competitive. Norman says: \"It will be much more difficult to generate shareholder value than it was 10 years ago. Like all new CEOs, he will need to stamp his authority and style on the business.\"",

    "webTitle": "Fragile economies under pressure as recovery prompts capital flight", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The decision by the US Federal Reserve to further slow its programme of bond buying last week gave a clear signal of confidence in the world's largest economy. But the scaling down of monthly purchases, by a further $10bn to $65bn, put emerging market economies under renewed pressure: currency falls and a flight of foreign capital have already placed them on the \"at risk\" list. The spotlight is firmly on those emerging market countries that have large current account deficits, rely on overseas investment and have looming domestic elections. Investors pulled $9bn from emerging stock and bond funds last week alone, and so far this year $12bn has been taken out of emerging stock markets \u2013 close to the $15bn they lost during the whole of last year, according to figures from fund tracker EPFR Global. The \"fragile five\" \u2013 Turkey, Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Africa \u2013 are considered particularly vulnerable to an exodus of foreign capital as the prospect of higher interest rates diverts funds back to the US in search of higher returns. Over the past week governments and policymakers in some of these threatened economies have been fighting back, with emergency policy decisions designed to put them ahead in the race to attract and retain foreign money. The fate of the fragile five is important, not least because they account for more than 12% of global GDP, and have contributed almost one-fifth of world economic growth since 2009. Ben Bernanke, whose tenure as Fed chairman came to an end on Friday, has argued in the past that emerging markets will ultimately benefit from policies that are designed to create a stronger US economy. He, along with the world's policymakers, will be hoping that the waves in emerging markets created by his final act will prove to be a bump on the road to global recovery, and not the beginning of a fresh crisis. Here we look at the problems that some emerging markets are facing. ARGENTINA Argentina is not a \"fragile five\" economy: its problems have escalated to such an extent that \"fragile\" does not go far enough to describe the situation. Analysts have estimated that inflation in Argentina was more than 25% in 2013, although the official rate is 10.9%. And it is expected to accelerate following the government's sudden relaxation of currency controls in January, prompting the steepest fall in the Argentinian peso since 2002, the year the country defaulted on its debt. The controls were relaxed in order to protect the country's dwindling foreign currency reserves: they fell below $30bn last month, making interventions to prop up the peso look increasingly unsustainable. The decision to stop interventions and loosen controls on trading pesos for dollars sent the peso's value plunging by more than 15%, threatening spiralling inflation and capital flight. Runaway inflation, rising crime and corruption have blighted the country, and the government has been accused of lurching from one policy to another, with little continuity undermining confidence in the country's economy. Two weeks ago the government under President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner introduced new restrictions on online shopping, making it more difficult for Argentinians to spend their pesos on foreign goods. It said items bought on international website such as Amazon would be sent to a customs office, and not to home addresses. Each year, individuals would be allowed to buy items up to the value of $25 from abroad tax free, with a 50% tax imposed on each item thereafter. Just days later it announced that it was relaxing some of its controls on the dollar. TURKEY Turkey had been slow to react to high inflation, with policymakers fearful that raising interest rates would hurt growth prospects. But following the lira's 17% fall against the dollar last year as the reality of the unwinding stimulus in the US hit home, the central bank called an emergency meeting last week and more than doubled rates, to 10% from 4.5%. The prospect of higher returns in the US has certainly hurt the lira, but domestic problems with a bribery scandal at the heart of the government have also undermined the currency. Turkish prime minister Tayyip Erdogan has maintained that the corruption investigation \u2013 which led to the resignation of three government ministers last month \u2013 was being driven by opponents intent on destabilising the economy before elections later this year. By making such a bold move on rates, Turkey has sent a signal that it is ready to fight for overseas capital. This appeared to work at first, with the lira strengthening when the rate increase was first announced; but it slid again within 24 hours as jitters returned. Meanwhile inflation was running at 7.4% in December, higher than in November and well above the central bank's 5% target. BRAZIL Near neighbour of Argentina and a prime candidate for contagion fears, Brazil has been steadily increasing interest rates in a battle against inflation and a weakening real \u2013 the currency which has fallen by about 15% against the dollar over the past year. Rates have risen by 3.25 percentage points over the past nine months, and the central bank's latest move was to push them up a further half-point, to 10.5%, in January. Economists are expecting another rise this month. But growth prospects are deteriorating and the International Monetary Fund has revised its 2014 growth forecasts downwards. Some analysts had expected the tightening of monetary policy to stop after the economy shrank in the third quarter of 2013 \u2013 for the first time since 2009 \u2013 and as political pressures intensify before presidential elections later this year. But the increases have continued, underlining some of the unenviable choices faced by the country's policymakers. Meanwhile, Brazil's role as World Cup host nation later this year is adding to its domestic woes, with recent protests against the tournament on the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo. Protestors are angry at the vast sums of money being spent on the event, which they believe would be better invested in improving the country's public services and infrastructure. INDIA Like several of its emerging market peers, India raised interest rates last week, in its case by a quarter-point, to 8%, in an attempt to rein in consumer price rises and prop up the currency. It was a surprise move by Asia's third-largest economy, with analysts predicting no change before the decision was made. Inflation has been slowing, but consumer price inflation remains high: it was close to 10% in December. The Reserve Bank of India has proposed a target of 4% inflation by 2016. Last week the Indian rupee dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since November, as the Fed's decision to further slow its bond buying programme sounded renewed alarm bells about the flight of capital. Raghuram Rajan, head of India's central bank, spoke out in opposition to the way the Fed has handled its decision to take its foot off the stimulus pedal, arguing that there needs to be greater policy co-operation between developed and emerging markets. The former IMF chief economist said: \"We would like to live in a world where countries take into account the effect of their policies on other countries and do what is right, broadly, rather than what is just right given the circumstances of that country.\" SOUTH AFRICA A sharp fall in South Africa's rand to a five-year low against the dollar prompted a surprise 0.5-point increase in interest rates this week, to 5.5%. It was the first increase in five years, as Gill Marcus, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, acknowledged that a \"new phase\" of the global financial crisis was piling the pressure on emerging market economies. The extent of the challenge facing some was underlined when the rand actually weakened against the dollar following the rate rise, when usually such a move would be expected to prompt a rise. \"While the Fed action signals a recovery in the US, and the UK economic outlook is also improving, it does not mean that the global financial crisis is over,\" Marcus said. Her message echoed that of India's central bank governor: recovery in developed economies is all well and good, but the risks to global stability have shifted, not disappeared. Economists believe the rise in interest rates in South Africa will not be the last. The rand is also more vulnerable to slowing economic growth in China, because of the knock-on effects of falling commodities demand and prices. South Africa's problems are not all externally driven, and a week-long strike by thousands of platinum miners seeking a doubling of their wages has further eroded investor confidence. The platinum industry is important to South Africa as a source of foreign exchange, and the industrial action has raised political tension in the runup to elections, expected in about three months' time. INDONESIA Indonesia resisted increasing interest rates for a second month in January, against a backdrop of stable inflation, at 8.4% in December. The central bank said it was closely monitoring the impact of the Fed's tapering programme, after growth in south-east Asia's largest economy slowed to its weakest rate in four years last year, with a poor trade position and the outflow of foreign capital taking their toll. The rupiah was the worst-performing emerging market currency in 2013, down around a fifth against the dollar.

      "body": "<p>The decision by the US Federal Reserve to further slow its programme of bond buying last week gave a clear signal of confidence in the world's largest economy. But the scaling down of monthly purchases, by a further $10bn to $65bn, put emerging market economies under renewed pressure: currency falls and a flight of foreign capital have already placed them on the \"at risk\" list.</p> <p>The spotlight is firmly on those emerging market countries that have large current account deficits, rely on overseas investment and have looming domestic elections. Investors pulled $9bn from emerging stock and bond funds last week alone, and so far this year $12bn has been taken out of emerging stock markets \u2013 close to the $15bn they lost during the whole of last year, according to figures from fund tracker EPFR Global.</p> <p>The \"fragile five\" \u2013 Turkey, Brazil, India, Indonesia and South Africa \u2013 are considered particularly vulnerable to an exodus of foreign capital as the prospect of higher interest rates diverts funds back to the US in search of higher returns. Over the past week governments and policymakers in some of these threatened economies have been fighting back, with emergency policy decisions designed to put them ahead in the race to attract and retain foreign money. The fate of the fragile five is important, not least because they account for more than 12% of global GDP, and have contributed almost one-fifth of world economic growth since 2009.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, whose tenure as Fed chairman came to an end on Friday, has argued in the past that emerging markets will ultimately benefit from policies that are designed to create a stronger US economy. He, along with the world's policymakers, will be hoping that the waves in emerging markets created by his final act will prove to be a bump on the road to global recovery, and not the beginning of a fresh crisis. Here we look at the problems that some emerging markets are facing.</p> <h2><strong>ARGENTINA</strong></h2> <p>Argentina is not a \"fragile five\" economy: its problems have escalated to such an extent that \"fragile\" does not go far enough to describe the situation.</p> <p>Analysts have estimated that inflation in Argentina was more than 25% in 2013, although the official rate is 10.9%. And it is expected to accelerate following the government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/peso-collapse-argentina-economic-crisis-fernandez-de-kirchner\" title=\"\">sudden relaxation of currency controls </a>in January, prompting the steepest fall in the Argentinian peso since 2002, the year the country defaulted on its debt.</p> <p>The controls were relaxed in order to protect the country's dwindling foreign currency reserves: they fell below $30bn last month, making interventions to prop up the peso look increasingly unsustainable. The decision to stop interventions and loosen controls on trading pesos for dollars sent the peso's value plunging by more than 15%, threatening spiralling inflation and capital flight.</p> <p>Runaway inflation, rising crime and corruption have blighted the country, and the government has been accused of lurching from one policy to another, with little continuity undermining confidence in the country's economy.</p> <p>Two weeks ago the government under President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner introduced new restrictions on online shopping, making it more difficult for Argentinians to spend their pesos on foreign goods. It said items bought on international website such as Amazon would be sent to a customs office, and not to home addresses. Each year, individuals would be allowed to buy items up to the value of $25 from abroad tax free, with a 50% tax imposed on each item thereafter. Just days later it announced that it was relaxing some of its controls on the dollar.</p> <h2><strong>TURKEY</strong></h2> <p>Turkey had been slow to react to high inflation, with policymakers fearful that raising interest rates would hurt growth prospects. But following the lira's 17% fall against the dollar last year as the reality of the unwinding stimulus in the US hit home, the central bank called an emergency meeting last week and more than doubled rates, to 10% from 4.5%.</p> <p>The prospect of higher returns in the US has certainly hurt the lira, but domestic problems with a bribery scandal at the heart of the government have also undermined the currency. Turkish prime minister Tayyip Erdogan has maintained that the corruption investigation \u2013 which led to the resignation of three government ministers last month \u2013 was being driven by opponents intent on destabilising the economy before elections later this year.</p> <p>By making such a bold move on rates, Turkey has sent a signal that it is ready to fight for overseas capital. This appeared to work at first, with the lira strengthening when the rate increase was first announced; but it slid again within 24 hours as jitters returned.</p> <p>Meanwhile inflation was running at 7.4% in December, higher than in November and well above the central bank's 5% target.</p> <h2><strong>BRAZIL</strong></h2> <p>Near neighbour of Argentina and a prime candidate for contagion fears, Brazil has been steadily increasing interest rates in a battle against inflation and a weakening real \u2013 the currency which has fallen by about 15% against the dollar over the past year. Rates have risen by 3.25 percentage points over the past nine months, and the central bank's latest move was to push them up a further half-point, to 10.5%, in January. Economists are expecting another rise this month.</p> <p>But growth prospects are deteriorating and the International Monetary Fund has revised its 2014 growth forecasts downwards. Some analysts had expected the tightening of monetary policy to stop after the economy shrank in the third quarter of 2013 \u2013 for the first time since 2009 \u2013 and as political pressures intensify before presidential elections later this year. But the increases have continued, underlining some of the unenviable choices faced by the country's policymakers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brazil's role as World Cup host nation later this year is adding to its domestic woes, with recent protests against the tournament on the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo. Protestors are angry at the vast sums of money being spent on the event, which they believe would be better invested in improving the country's public services and infrastructure.</p> <h2><strong>INDIA</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Like several of its emerging market peers, India raised interest rates last week, in its case by a quarter-point, to 8%, in an attempt to rein in consumer price rises and prop up the currency.</p> <p>It was a surprise move by Asia's third-largest economy, with analysts predicting no change before the decision was made. Inflation has been slowing, but consumer price inflation remains high: it was close to 10% in December. The Reserve Bank of India has proposed a target of 4% inflation by 2016.</p> <p>Last week the Indian rupee dropped to its lowest level against the dollar since November, as the Fed's decision to further slow its bond buying programme sounded renewed alarm bells about the flight of capital.</p> <p>Raghuram Rajan, head of India's central bank, spoke out in opposition to the way the Fed has handled its decision to take its foot off the stimulus pedal, arguing that there needs to be greater policy co-operation between developed and emerging markets.</p> <p>The former IMF chief economist said: \"We would like to live in a world where countries take into account the effect of their policies on other countries and do what is right, broadly, rather than what is just right given the circumstances of that country.\"</p> <h2><strong>SOUTH AFRICA</strong><br></h2> <p>A sharp fall in South Africa's rand to a five-year low against the dollar prompted a surprise 0.5-point increase in interest rates this week, to 5.5%. It was the first increase in five years, as Gill Marcus, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, acknowledged that a \"new phase\" of the global financial crisis was piling the pressure on emerging market economies. The extent of the challenge facing some was underlined when the rand actually weakened against the dollar following the rate rise, when usually such a move would be expected to prompt a rise.</p> <p>\"While the Fed action signals a recovery in the US, and the UK economic outlook is also improving, it does not mean that the global financial crisis is over,\" Marcus said.</p> <p>Her message echoed that of India's central bank governor: recovery in developed economies is all well and good, but the risks to global stability have shifted, not disappeared.</p> <p>Economists believe the rise in interest rates in South Africa will not be the last. The rand is also more vulnerable to slowing economic growth in China, because of the knock-on effects of falling commodities demand and prices.</p> <p>South Africa's problems are not all externally driven, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/south-african-platinum-miners-strike\" title=\"\">a week-long strike</a> by thousands of platinum miners seeking a doubling of their wages has further eroded investor confidence. The platinum industry is important to South Africa as a source of foreign exchange, and the industrial action has raised political tension in the runup to elections, expected in about three months' time.</p> <h2><strong>INDONESIA</strong></h2> <p>Indonesia resisted increasing interest rates for a second month in January, against a backdrop of stable inflation, at 8.4% in December. The central bank said it was closely monitoring the impact of the Fed's tapering programme, after growth in south-east Asia's largest economy slowed to its weakest rate in four years last year, with a poor trade position and the outflow of foreign capital taking their toll. The rupiah was the worst-performing emerging market currency in 2013, down around a fifth against the dollar.</p> <p>Analysts at Capital Economics said a rate rise for Indonesia could be on the cards though, if market turmoil escalates. For the time being, policymakers are adopting a wait-and-see approach, having taken action last year to defend the rupiah with a 1.75-point increase in rates since June.</p> <p>The country has suffered from widespread social unrest recently, after a sharp cut in government fuel subsidies, the first since 2008. Protesters blocked roads and clashed with police in the capital, Jakarta, in June last year after petrol prices rose by 44%, and diesel by 22%.</p>",

Mixed prognosis for pharmaceuticals firms A big week for big pharma as we get full-year results from the UK's best-known groups. The drugs have been working reasonably well for GlaxoSmithKline, with its shares adding about 16% last year despite blips such as the bribery scandal in China. Analysts at Deutsche Bank reckon: \"2014 should see a number of regulatory decisions and Phase III results \u2026 as well as the rollout of recently approved drugs.\" If that seems like a company in tolerable health, then the prognosis for the patient in the next bed appears slightly less optimistic. Sales at AstraZeneca are expected to have fallen by around 6% when it announces results on Thursday, following the loss of patents that is expected to be a continuing theme in 2014. If that isn't concerning enough, AstraZeneca's search for cost savings is infuriating charities as it abandons its search for new medicines to tackle many of the world's deadliest diseases, arguing infectious conditions are \"not a priority\". This is the same AstraZeneca that lapped up the applause two years ago for its part in an industry initiative pledging a concerted effort on, er, neglected tropical diseases. O'Leary aims to mind pees and queues Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair and the man the flying public most loves to hate, has always said that multi-millionaires use his airline as well as more cost-conscious travellers. \"Do we carry rich people on our flights?\" he once said. \"Yes, I flew on one this morning and I'm very rich.\" But now O'Leary has been forced to broaden that strategy, as the company attempts to attract higher-spending punters as well as persuading more of its existing passengers to keep flying with the airline. And the solution O'Leary has come up with is to improve the company's notoriously hostile customer service. We will get early clues about the new touchy-feely Ryanair, when the company releases results on 3 February.

      "bodyText": "In the US, today is the real Groundhog Day; and on this side of the Atlantic there is a feeling that we have been here before. The economy may be growing, yet millions of households are struggling with crippling debt. To cover their repayments, many are turning to unscrupulous lenders for yet more credit. Gordon Brown's celebrated \"longest period of sustained growth in our history\" was, as we now accept, largely debt-driven. The boom brought a sense of economic optimism, and in that era of easy credit, huge debts could be racked up on multiple credit cards. That was accompanied by a massive rise in mortgage debt. Now, as the cycle turns again, there are hopes that banks and policymakers have learned lessons from the last boom and bust. Some of the signs are promising. The latest statistics on insolvencies, due this week, are likely to show the gradual fall seen over the last quarter of 2013 continuing. But such figures do not portray the true vulnerability of many households. This time around it is not easy credit that is driving indebtedness (with the notable exception of the car market, where soaring sales are built largely on cheap finance deals). In fact, talk of Britons' addiction to debt is insulting to households that have little choice but to borrow to make ends meet. The government has taken an axe to benefits and services, and real wages have been falling for years. Pay growth remains meagre and many have been forced into part-time work or self-employment \u2013 taxi drivers and web designers by the thousands are left waiting for jobs to come in. Being in work is no longer a safeguard against perilous debt. Charities say they are seeing a rising number of people unable to pay for essentials such as rent, council tax and food. Such unavoidable costs have risen faster than headline inflation, which was already high. The people who spend the biggest proportion of their incomes on essentials \u2013 and so suffer the most \u2013 are, of course, the poorest. A report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that while the consumer prices index was up 17% since the start of the downturn, there had been a 25% rise in its \"minimum income standard\" basket, based on the goods and services people think they need to meet a minimum acceptable living standard. It found childcare costs were up twice as fast as inflation at 37% and rent in social housing was up 26%. So where does that leave the debt situation? Personal debt, mortgages included, remains close to its all-time high at \u00a31.4 trillion. Average household debt now stands at \u00a354,000, nearly twice the level of a decade ago, according to a report from the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ). Breaking down the picture, the Bank of England says unsecured debts were rising last year, while mortgage debt levels were little changed, though \"relatively high\" by historical standards. Most worrying for many debt advisers is the explosion in payday loans. Debt charity StepChange says that in 2009, 2% of its clients had payday loans; now almost a quarter do. Of those, a fifth have five or more such loans. Again, this is not a story of easy credit and greedy scroungers. More than half of StepChange's clients are from a household where at least one person is in work. This picture of households on the edge raises problems for Bank policymakers. Now that the unemployment rate has fallen to within a whisker of the 7% threshold set by Mark Carney, talk is of an interest rate rise. The governor has stressed that borrowing costs will stick at their record low 0.5% for a while yet. But when the Bank does increase rates to a more normal level, it will tip households that are already stretched to the limit into severe financial difficulty. The Bank's own research last year found wide variation in the effects of rate rises on indebted households depending on how well incomes recover. Thinktank the Resolution Foundation reports that the number of families in debt peril \u2013 those spending at least half their disposable income on repaying debts \u2013 would almost double, to 1.1m, even with a relatively small rise in interest rates, to no more than 3% by 2018. Carney and colleagues will of course be focusing on the wider impact of any rate rise, but this effect on indebted households matters because of the consequent health costs, the threat to financial stability, the blow to productivity and the erosion of spending power. If we accept that the great rebalancing hasn't happened, and will not for some time, clearly that hit to consumers' spending power would be very detrimental to growth rates. Indebtedness is also storing up big problems for the more distant future. People are not saving enough for retirement. The Office for Budget Responsibility sees this getting worse as growth in consumer spending outpaces disposable income growth. With so much at stake we must, as the recovery gathers steam, ensure there is no repeat of the soaring indebtedness that characterised the previous growth years. Whether or not the banks have learned their lesson from the sub-prime crisis, tighter regulation should help. Banks must use their experience to help borrowers as soon as they show signs of problems \u2013 falling behind on essential bills for example. As for the government, George Osborne's move to place a cap on payday lenders' charges is welcome. But austerity-obsessed ministers must do much more to put safety nets in place for vulnerable households. They have been taking away benefits at a time of falling real incomes without offering alternatives to payday loans. And charities have been left to pick up the pieces. Ultimately, business and the coalition need to get serious about the cost of living. We need investment to drive up productivity and big firms to pass on more of their profits to workers, not just shareholders. This must be a recovery that finally ends the sorry picture of households borrowing just to pay the gas bill.",

To cover their repayments, many are turning to unscrupulous lenders for yet more&#xa0;credit.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's celebrated \"longest period of sustained growth in our history\" was, as we now accept, largely debt-driven. The boom brought a sense of economic optimism, and in that era of easy credit, huge debts could be racked up on multiple credit cards. That was accompanied by a massive rise in mortgage debt. Now, as the cycle turns again, there are hopes that banks and policymakers have learned lessons from the last boom and bust.</p> <p>Some of the signs are promising. The latest statistics on insolvencies, due this week, are likely to show the <a href=\"http://www.insolvencydirect.bis.gov.uk/otherinformation/statistics/201311/index.htm\" title=\"\">gradual fall</a> seen over the last quarter of 2013 continuing. But such figures do not portray the true vulnerability of many households. This time around it is not easy credit that is driving indebtedness (with the notable exception of the car market, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/07/uk-car-sales-five-year-high-smmt\" title=\"\">soaring sales are built largely on cheap finance deals</a>).</p> <p>In fact, talk of Britons' addiction to debt is insulting to households that have little choice but to borrow to make ends meet. The government has taken an axe to benefits and services, and real wages have been falling for years. Pay growth remains meagre and many have been forced into part-time work or self-employment \u2013 taxi drivers and web designers by the thousands are left waiting for jobs to come in.</p> <p>Being in work is no longer a safeguard against perilous debt. Charities say they are seeing a rising number of people unable to pay for essentials such as rent, council tax and food. Such unavoidable costs have risen faster than headline inflation, which was already high. The people who spend the biggest proportion of their incomes on essentials \u2013 and so suffer the most \u2013 are, of course, the poorest.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/media-centre/minimum-cost-living-soars\" title=\"\">report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year</a> found that while the consumer prices index was up 17% since the start of the downturn, there had been a 25% rise in its \"minimum income standard\" basket, based on the goods and services people think they need to meet a minimum acceptable living standard. It found childcare costs were up twice as fast as inflation at 37% and rent in social housing was up 26%.</p> <p>So where does that leave the debt situation? Personal debt, mortgages included, remains close to its all-time high at \u00a31.4 trillion. Average household debt now stands at \u00a354,000, nearly twice the level of a decade ago, according to a <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/publications/maxed-out\" title=\"\">report</a> from the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ).</p> <p>Breaking down the picture, the Bank of England says <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2013/qb130406.pdf\" title=\"\">unsecured debts were rising last year</a>, while mortgage debt levels were little changed, though \"relatively high\" by historical standards.</p> <p>Most worrying for many debt advisers is the explosion in payday loans. Debt charity <a href=\"http://www.stepchange.org/\" title=\"\">StepChange</a> says that in 2009, 2% of its clients had payday loans; now almost a quarter do. Of those, a fifth have five or more such loans. Again, this is not a story of easy credit and greedy scroungers. More than half of StepChange's clients are from a household where at least one person is in work.</p> <p>This picture of households on the edge raises problems for Bank policymakers. Now that the unemployment rate has fallen to within a whisker of the 7% threshold set by Mark Carney, talk is of an interest rate rise.</p> <p>The governor has stressed that borrowing costs will stick at their record low 0.5% for a while yet. But when the Bank does increase rates to a more normal level, it will tip households that are already stretched to the limit into severe financial difficulty.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2013/qb130406.pdf\" title=\"\">The Bank's own research</a> last year found wide variation in the effects of rate rises on indebted households depending on how well incomes recover.</p> <p>Thinktank the Resolution Foundation reports that the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press/debt2018/\" title=\"\">number of families in debt peril</a> \u2013 those spending at least half their disposable income on repaying debts \u2013 would almost double, to 1.1m, even with a relatively small rise&#xa0;in interest rates, to no more than 3% by 2018.</p> <p>Carney and colleagues will of course be focusing on the wider impact of any rate rise, but this effect on indebted households matters because of the consequent health costs, the threat to financial stability, the blow to productivity and the erosion of spending power. If we accept that the great rebalancing hasn't happened, and will not for some time, clearly that hit to consumers' spending power would be very detrimental to growth rates.</p> <p>Indebtedness is also storing up big problems for the more distant future. People are not saving enough for retirement. The Office for Budget Responsibility <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/economic-fiscal-outlook-december-2013/\" title=\"\">sees this getting worse</a> as growth in consumer spending outpaces disposable income growth.</p> <p>With so much at stake we must, as the recovery gathers steam, ensure there is no repeat of the soaring indebtedness that characterised the previous growth years. Whether or not the banks have learned their lesson from the sub-prime crisis, tighter regulation should help. Banks must use their experience to help borrowers as soon as they show signs of problems \u2013 falling behind on essential bills for example.</p> <p>As for the government, George Osborne's move to place a cap on payday lenders' charges is welcome. But austerity-obsessed ministers must do much more to put safety nets in place for vulnerable households. They have been taking away benefits at a time of falling real incomes without offering alternatives to payday loans. And charities have been left to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>Ultimately, business and the coalition need to get serious about the cost of living. We need investment to drive up productivity and big firms to pass on more of their profits to workers, not just shareholders. This must be a recovery that finally ends the sorry picture of households borrowing just to pay the gas bill.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Turkey's finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, understands the two-faced nature of western capitalism. A former banker with Merrill Lynch, based in London, he has seen the way investment banks work. One minute you are feted and showered with bonuses; the next you are being shown the exit. It can be the same for a developing country. At one moment it's the darling of international investors; the next it finds itself standing over a trapdoor to the lower economic regions. Only a few years ago Turkey's economy was growing at 10% a year and predicted to become a Middle East powerhouse. While Syria and the rest of the region struggled with internal strife, it was Turkey, with its educated young population, that would accelerate into the first rank of countries. Even after the financial crash, money poured into Istanbul, and into the many enterprise zones set up by Simsek and his predecessors to lure US and European manufacturers. Then the tide turned. Since 2011 the country has been struggling. The currency lost 25% of its value as the prospect of higher interest rates in the US triggered a flight of capital back to New York. A corruption scandal that has reached as far as the prime minister's office has not helped settle the nerves of investors. Simsek, a dapper Europhile with a calm public manner, has gambled that raising Turkey's base rate to 10% will avoid a further exodus of funds. He has ruled out anything more draconian, for fear of spooking the markets. Last week he denied any plans to introduce capital controls, adding that Turkey would in effect bend over backwards to please western investors by further liberalising its financial sector. Turkey would leave its floating exchange rate system in place, he said, though prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a more volatile character, who is facing a general election in a few months, heightened anxieties when he referred to a possible \"out of the ordinary\" economic package. But plenty of analysts believe that whichever way he turns, Simsek will lose. Stephen Jen of currency hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners said: \"Many of these emerging-market economies [including Turkey] are cornered: they have to choose between defending the exchange rate, fighting inflation and supporting growth. Sudden stops in capital inflows tend to force countries to face lose-lose situations.\" India, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil, which were grouped with Turkey recently as \"the Fragile Five\" by Morgan Stanley, are in the same boat, as are Argentina and Russia. Each has its own special circumstances, but they share problems that have left investors disenchanted. Raghuram Rajan, head of India's central bank, is also keen to liberalise financial markets in order to encourage investment. Like Simsek, he has problems stemming the exodus of funds without jacking up interest rates and killing growth. But his stance is more openly aggressive: he accuses the US and Europe of supporting international monetary co-operation only while they were in recession, and of ditching it now their recoveries are under way. \"International monetary co-operation has broken down,\" said Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. \"Industrial countries have to play a part in restoring that [co-operation between central banks], and they can't wash their hands and say, we'll do what we need to and you do the adjustment.\" His chief bugbear is the prospect of higher US interest rates making the dollar more attractive and pulling more cash out of India. The same goes for the others in the fragile five. Their problem is that investors, like a huge shoal of hungry fish moving from one feeding ground to another, enjoy visiting emerging markets when the returns are high. Sovereign wealth funds control about $30 trillion around the world, and pension funds another $30tn. They cruise the financial markets in tandem and put up with political instability and developing-world restrictions on the movement of capital only so long as the gap with negative real US interest rates exaggerates their gains. Hence the defensive increase in Turkish base rates last week. Rajan remains concerned that the west's self-interest will restrict India's ability to shrug off internal opposition to financial reforms. At worst, it will trigger a return to recession, and western leaders, he says, are blind to the fact that such a downturn will eventually rebound on them. Rajan was one of the few people who warned about the potential for financial meltdown in the years before the 2008 crash. His concerns should not be dismissed.",

The chief executive of the $35bn social media company clearly decided it was wise to share a little less. Appetite for Twitter stock means Costolo is now worth north of $500m. Letting followers know whether he is at his San Francisco home, entering the Goldman Sachs building in New York or visiting the offices of a Silicon Valley startup could swing Twitter's share price and compromise his own safety.</p> <p>The much-loved microblogging platform's valuation is off the map. Twitter is now worth more than BT, or more than M&amp;S and Sainsbury's combined.</p> <p>Twitter went to market on 7&#xa0;November at $26 a share. It is now trading at $64. This is 54 times the $650m in revenues for 2013 that the loss-making platform is expected to announce at its maiden results as a public company on Friday. A read-across from Facebook, valued at 20&#xa0;times last year's revenues, suggests Twitter should be worth maybe $13bn.</p> <p>Twitter has more than 230 million monthly active users \u2013 a fraction of Facebook's 1.23 billion-strong following \u2013 although Twitter's users are probably more engaged, sending on average two tweets a day.</p> <p>Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research Group, one of the financial analysts with the best grasp of online advertising, thinks Twitter will be earning no more than $5bn in 2018 and therefore deserves to be traded at no more than $34 a share. The hedge funds seem to agree: more than 10% of Twitter's shares have been shorted \u2013 a significantly greater proportion than for Facebook and LinkedIn.</p> <p>Do its employees secretly agree too? We will find out in February, and again in May, when the lock-ins preventing them selling their shares expire. The same moment at Facebook was the trigger for a massive selloff, though with economic recovery taking root, investors could be more gentle with Twitter. Still, the coming weeks may well bring the bird back down to earth.</p> <h2>Sky heads off a BT drama<br></h2> <p>Spare a thought for the what-might-have-been moment of last week, when BSkyB announced that it had acquired exclusive rights to the entire HBO catalogue for another five years. With one stroke \u2013 the signature on a \u00a3275m cheque \u2013 the satellite broadcaster headed off the possibility of BT following the launch of its profitable BT Sport with BT Drama. Such a channel would have opened up a new competitive front in one of the most interesting corporate rivalries of recent years.</p> <p>If Sky's strength is sport, drama is not far behind, thanks to its movie channels and Sky Atlantic, home to its HBO content. BT's interest was a serious industry whisper and was allegedly a major reason why BSkyB hurried to tie HBO, maker of <em>The Wire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, to a new five-year deal. That and denying Andy Gray the chance of presenting BT Drama.</p>",

This is 54 times the $650m in revenues for 2013 that the loss-making platform is expected to announce at its maiden results as a public company on Friday. A read-across from Facebook, valued at 20 times last year's revenues, suggests Twitter should be worth maybe $13bn. Twitter has more than 230 million monthly active users \u2013 a fraction of Facebook's 1.23 billion-strong following \u2013 although Twitter's users are probably more engaged, sending on average two tweets a day. Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research Group, one of the financial analysts with the best grasp of online advertising, thinks Twitter will be earning no more than $5bn in 2018 and therefore deserves to be traded at no more than $34 a share. The hedge funds seem to agree: more than 10% of Twitter's shares have been shorted \u2013 a significantly greater proportion than for Facebook and LinkedIn. Do its employees secretly agree too? We will find out in February, and again in May, when the lock-ins preventing them selling their shares expire. The same moment at Facebook was the trigger for a massive selloff, though with economic recovery taking root, investors could be more gentle with Twitter. Still, the coming weeks may well bring the bird back down to earth. Sky heads off a BT drama Spare a thought for the what-might-have-been moment of last week, when BSkyB announced that it had acquired exclusive rights to the entire HBO catalogue for another five years. With one stroke \u2013 the signature on a \u00a3275m cheque \u2013 the satellite broadcaster headed off the possibility of BT following the launch of its profitable BT Sport with BT Drama. Such a channel would have opened up a new competitive front in one of the most interesting corporate rivalries of recent years. If Sky's strength is sport, drama is not far behind, thanks to its movie channels and Sky Atlantic, home to its HBO content. BT's interest was a serious industry whisper and was allegedly a major reason why BSkyB hurried to tie HBO, maker of The Wire and Game of Thrones, to a new five-year deal. That and denying Andy Gray the chance of presenting BT Drama.",
