      "bodyText": "The pension scheme deficit at Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group has risen to nearly \u00a31bn, which means another headache for the former BHS owner. Documents to be published on Sunday by MPs investigating the demise of BHS and pensions regulation, reveal that the Topshop to Dorothy Perkins group\u2019s two pension schemes \u2013 one for senior executives, another for the rest of the staff \u2013 had a combined deficit of \u00a3993m in March last year on a buyout basis. That valuation is based on the likely cost of winding up the scheme and securing benefits with an insurer. On a going concern basis, based on maintaining the scheme alongside the retail business, the deficit was still nearly \u00a3565m at the time of the three-yearly official revaluation in March last year \u2013 up from \u00a3455.8m in 2013. Arcadia has now agreed to pay a combined \u00a350m into the schemes each year, with the aim of eliminating the deficits over the next 10 years. That will increase to \u00a354.5m a year from 2019. The deal was struck soon after Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m to resolve the pension deficit at BHS, which fell into administration about a year after it was sold to a group led by a former bankrupt for \u00a31. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions select committee, said the Arcadia deal was \u201ca credible plan for tackling a giant deficit and great news for Arcadia pensioners\u201d, but he said the new details on the scheme revealed Green had favoured that group over BHS, which had more members. Field said: \u201cNot long after he refused to shift on a ludicrous 23-year recovery plan for the BHS scheme, he agreed a 13-year plan for Arcadia with well over double the deficit contributions. I imagine Green would say Arcadia could afford it because it was profitable, whereas BHS was not. But it is clear that all his companies are run as one large tax-efficient empire in the family interest.\u201d The documents show that the senior executive pension scheme is 59% funded, compared with 63% four years ago, while the main scheme has slid to 55% funded against 63% in 2013. Independent pension expert John Ralfe said the \u00a31.3bn in underlying liabilities that underpin the deficit would make it difficult for Green to find a private equity buyer for Arcadia. \u201cArcadia didn\u2019t address the deficit properly in 2013 and now it is being more realistic.\u201d The schemes\u2019 funding levels slipped after Arcadia agreed to pay \u00a39.2m a year into the executive pension scheme, nearly 6% of the \u00a3155.4m deficit four years ago. That compares with a \u00a315.1m a year agreed for the main pension scheme, 5% of its \u00a3300.4m deficit in 2013. Ralfe said the documents revealed that, historically, Green seemed to favouring the senior scheme over the main scheme. The deficit contributions agreed in 2013 would have paid off the deficit in about 17 years, compared with 20 years for the main scheme. Green declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Karen Millen is used to seeing her name in lights. With 400 outlets spread across 65 countries, there is even a store that bears the Kent-born designer\u2019s name in Mongolia. But last week Karen Millen, the woman, became famous all over again for the wrong reasons, after suffering the humiliation of being declared bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill. Until the public airing of her financial difficulties, Millen had appeared to be living a fashion fairytale. She had grown up in a council house on a Maidstone estate but had become a millionaire many times over by the time she was in her 30s, after the eponymous fashion label she had started with her husband Kevin Stanford was sold for \u00a395m at the height of the retail boom that preceded the last recession. But despite receiving \u00a335m for her share of the business \u2013 a blockbuster deal that involved Millen signing away the rights to use her own name \u2013 the rags-to-riches story returned to rags in the high court after she failed to hand over an estimated \u00a36m that HM Revenue and Customs said it was owed. Millen told the Times her accountants had advised her to use a tax planning scheme, the validity of which was successfully challenged by HMRC in 2010. Millen has not designed clothes for the company that bears her name for well over a decade, yet she remains forever yoked to the business that she started with Stanford in 1981, when she was just 19. \u201cWhen I hand over my credit card, people will often say: \u2018How funny, you have the same name as the shop,\u2019\u201d she said in a recent interview. The enterprising couple got the business off the ground with a \u00a3100 loan and used the money to buy bolts of cotton with which to make the crisp white shirts that would be their early bestsellers. The first store opened two years later and by the time they sold out in 2004 it had become a chain of 100, retailing a sexy look of tight-fitting dresses and Versace-style bustiers that was firmly plugged in to the fashion zeitgeist. In the 13 years since Millen sold the company, she has appeared to be living in a bubble, dividing her time between her three children and charity fundraising. She celebrated her 50th birthday by throwing a 1930s-themed party on the Orient Express for close friends that included the models Kelly Brook and Caprice and the entrepreneur Jacqueline Gold. In interviews Millen, who was appointed an OBE for services to fashion in 2008, was often snapped posing by the swimming pool of her immaculate Georgian mansion, which boasted a football pitch and lake. It is now expected to be sold. Millen says she is \u201cdevastated\u201d by bankruptcy but blames Kaupthing, the collapsed Icelandic bank that backed the 2004 deal, rather than her own financial decisions for her current woes. Her story is a stark reminder of the noughties\u2019 high street boom, fuelled by the expansion of Icelandic banks, that would go spectacularly bust during the credit crunch. Although Kaupthing had made her rich, Millen and Stanford, whose business interests remained linked despite their divorce in 2001, suffered heavy losses after the bank failed during the 2008 banking crisis, taking many of their personal investments with it. When the couple worked together, Millen had focused on the creative side while Stanford ran the shops. \u201cI was never the driving force behind it,\u201d she told one interviewer. \u201cIt was always Kevin. He\u2019s the ambitious one. I\u2019ve just gone along with it.\u201d The same approach appears to have cost her dearly when it came to investing the fortune they made together. Without the involvement of the founders the Karen Millen stores have kept on going, although the chain is having something of a midlife crisis as millennials opt for a casual look even on nights out. \u201cThe consumer has moved on,\u201d says Lorna Hall, retail analyst at trend forecaster WGSN. \u201cFashion trends have become more casual and that has sidelined brands like Karen Millen that had a vernacular focused on getting dressed up.\u201d The shift in the fashion landscape has led to a concerted push by Karen Millen\u2019s new management to shed its \u201cFootballers\u2019 Wives\u201d image by highlighting, among other things, that its clothes are designed at head office in London\u2019s trendy Shoreditch district. However, the most recent accounts available at Companies House show a loss of \u00a310.5m on sales of \u00a3161m in the year to the end of February 2016, reflecting the heavy investment involved in the revamp. \u201cI never wear the clothes,\u201d Millen said in a 2012 interview as she started a legal campaign to win back the right to use her name on new designs. \u201cSometimes I find it a little difficult as I have no control over what they design and at times it can be a little embarrassing,\u201d she said, before suggesting the brand had \u201csomewhat stood still\u201d while the clothing was \u201ctoo heavily branded and overpowering\u201d. But the action also proved an expensive mistake. Insiders pointed out she had been paid \u201ca lot of money\u201d for her name and in 2016 Millen lost \u2013 the judge agreed with the company that letting her use her signature elsewhere would create confusion for shoppers. The ruling left her to foot an estimated \u00a32m-\u00a33m bill for both sides\u2019 legal costs. Millen and Stanford have pursued several legal claims against the estate of Kaupthing in an attempt to recover the tens of millions they \u2013 and many other investors \u2013 lost in Iceland\u2019s financial meltdown. The designer says the last nine years have been \u201cone long legal battle\u201d that has left her exhausted and ready to \u201cfinally put the past behind me\u201d. It seems Millen is finally letting go of Karen Millen.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At Romford station, in the Essex centre of \u201ctaking back control\u201d, there\u2019s a choice of trains into London: those run by the Dutch, or those run by the Chinese. Anyone heading for nearby Basildon has to change at Upminster and pay a fare to the Italian firm that has been operating C2C since January. Welsh railways fell to German-owned Arriva long ago, while ScotRail is also in the hands of the Netherlands\u2019 Abellio. The French, as part of Govia, own much of Britain\u2019s biggest commuter franchises, including Southern Rail. Still, the news last week that South West Trains \u2013 serving destinations such as Weymouth and Windsor from Waterloo \u2013 would from August be operated by First MTR, partly owned by the Hong Kong government, marked a tipping point in Britain\u2019s rail franchising. With the transfer of this network, which has been operated since 1995 by Britain\u2019s Stagecoach, one in two of the 1.7bn passenger journeys made in the UK each year will be on trains operated by foreign firms. And all of those firms are ultimately owned by foreign states \u2013 which outrages unions and others who call rail privatisation into question. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said: \u201cIt is savagely ironic that the Tories say they don\u2019t believe in state control, yet are perfectly happy to allow Britain\u2019s train companies to be run by state-owned railways \u2013 as long as it\u2019s another state!\u201d Some believe that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU could prompt reform. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, says: \u201cWith the government triggering article 50, and freeing the UK from EU rail directives, there is now no excuse at all for carrying on with the wholesale rip-off that exports British fare payers\u2019 cash overseas.\u201d But few other EU states opened their networks to competition the way Britain has. British firms such as National Express do have contracts in Germany for local and regional networks, but long-term franchises of such scale, revenues and potential profits have been a peculiarly British gift. Yet foreign firms are expanding as domestic transport groups start to question whether they can afford the risk. National Express has quit the UK rail market altogether, selling C2C to Trenitalia this year. Stagecoach let itself be outbid by First MTR, and has struggled with East Coast. Passenger growth has slowed after a recent boom, and at least one losing bidder for the Greater Anglia franchise retained last year by Abellio privately admitted to relief, having seen the figures. One industry source said: \u201cPeople have been bidding bonkers numbers. But these foreign firms can absorb more risk because they are state-backed.\u201d Train operators\u2019 total UK income in 2015-16 was \u00a312.4bn, including fares and government subsidy, according to the Office of Rail and Road, while expenditure was \u00a312.1bn, only \u00a3285m short of that. Dividends paid last year included \u00a315m to Deutsche Bahn via Arriva Wales, \u00a320m to Northern owner (until April 2016) Abellio, and a share of \u00a359m from Govia\u2019s franchises to SNCF. A 2013 report by the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at the University of Manchester found that the Wales and Northern franchises had paid out similar levels of dividend, \u00a3176m, between 2007 and 2011, accounting for all of their profits \u2013 profits that wouldn\u2019t exist without \u00a32.5bn in government subsidies. Is this, as the RMT suggests, entirely \u201cplunder\u201d? Not necessarily, said Chris Cheek of Passenger Transport: \u201cYou cannot assume that all the money is repatriated. Abellio and Arriva, for example, have bus businesses in the UK, so may well be reinvesting profits in that. Keolis helped build the Nottingham tram extension which opened last year. \u201d And he says FirstGroup, Stagecoach and National Express all have overseas interests, albeit more bus than rail. According to Paul Plummer of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, franchising has meant \u201crail companies from around the world bring new ideas and innovation to Britain\u2019s railway, and railways across the world still want to learn from our successes\u201d. For Aslef\u2019s Whelan, however, the latest foreign incursion underlines how \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d franchising is: \u201cWe have to ensure that, instead of haemorrhaging money into the pockets of private shareholders or to subsidise the publicly owned railways of other countries, we keep it in Britain either to reinvest in infrastructure, to reduce fares, or to help build the schools and hospitals we need.\u201d OWNERS OVER HERE Europe Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bahn owns Arriva, which operates Chiltern, Cross Country, Wales &amp; Borders, London Overground and Grand Central. Italy\u2019s Trenitalia now runs Essex Thameside, and French state firm SNCF owns Keolis, which runs numerous franchises in joint ventures. As part of Govia, with Go-Ahead, it operates Thameslink, Great Northern, Southern, Southeastern and London Midland; with Amey it runs the Docklands Light Railway. Dutch state rail owns Abellio, which runs ScotRail and Greater Anglia, and Merseyrail. China Hong Kong state owns MTR, which holds the South West Trains franchise with First. MTR will also run Crossrail.",

      "body": "<p>At Romford station, in the Essex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/14/romford-aberystwyth-most-eurosceptic-europhiliac-places-uk\">centre of \u201ctaking back control\u201d</a>, there\u2019s a choice of trains into London: those run by the Dutch, or those run by the Chinese. Anyone heading for nearby Basildon has to change at Upminster and pay a fare to the Italian firm that has been operating C2C since January.</p> <p>Welsh railways fell to German-owned Arriva long ago, while ScotRail is also in the hands of the Netherlands\u2019 Abellio. The French, as part of Govia, own much of Britain\u2019s biggest commuter franchises, including Southern Rail. Still, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/27/chinese-firm-help-operate-uk-south-west-trains-franchise\">the news last week that South West Trains</a> \u2013 serving destinations such as Weymouth and Windsor from Waterloo \u2013 would from August be operated by First MTR, partly owned by the Hong Kong government, marked a tipping point in Britain\u2019s rail franchising.</p> <p>With the transfer of this network, which has been operated since 1995 by Britain\u2019s Stagecoach, one in two of the 1.7bn passenger journeys made in the UK each year will be on trains operated by foreign firms. And all of those firms are ultimately owned by foreign states \u2013 which outrages unions and others who call rail privatisation into question.</p> <p>Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said: \u201cIt is savagely ironic that the Tories say they don\u2019t believe in state control, yet are perfectly happy to allow Britain\u2019s train companies to be run by state-owned railways \u2013 as long as it\u2019s another state!\u201d</p> <p>Some believe that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU could prompt reform. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, says: \u201cWith the government triggering article 50, and freeing the UK from EU rail directives, there is now no excuse at all for carrying on with the wholesale rip-off that exports British fare payers\u2019 cash overseas.\u201d</p> <p>But few other EU states opened their networks to competition the way Britain has. British firms such as National Express do have contracts in Germany for local and regional networks, but long-term franchises of such scale, revenues and potential profits have been a peculiarly British gift.</p> <p>Yet foreign firms are expanding as domestic transport groups start to question whether they can afford the risk. National Express has quit the UK rail market altogether, selling C2C to Trenitalia this year. Stagecoach let itself be outbid by First MTR, and has struggled with East Coast. Passenger growth has slowed after a recent boom, and at least one losing bidder for the Greater Anglia franchise retained last year by Abellio privately admitted to relief, having seen the figures.</p> <p>One industry source said: \u201cPeople have been bidding bonkers numbers.
