Malia was one of hundreds of thousands to watch the boys perform during their sell-out US tour, during which the boys secured their second No 1 album and overtook the Beatles in the all-time US sales chart. And a re-edited video of her dad \"singing\" 1D's What Makes You Beautiful has been watched more than 3 million times on YouTube. It's not just our boy bands that do well in the US.

BAE Systems barely mentions its British heritage today \u2013 a starkly different tactic from Lord Hanson's Anglo-American Hanson Trust conglomerate, which ran a long series of US ads in the 1980s gloatingly describing itself as \"a company from over there doing rather well over here\". And it was doing rather well, with successful takeovers of US chemicals-to-typewriters business SCM Corporation \u2013 for almost $1bn \u2013 and of fellow conglomerate Kidde for $1.7bn, helping it rise to become one of the biggest companies in the FTSE. But as conglomerates fell out of favour in the late 1990s, Hanson broke itself up and in 2007 the remaining rump of the company was taken over by Germany's HeidelbergCement for \u00a38bn.",

Even the name was an obstacle. \"Sounds like a deodorant,\" one woman said when the store opened. Another said it made her think of a women's sanitary product. The name never really caught on or tripped off people's tongues. Then there was the initial unwillingness to embrace the \"coupon culture\" so beloved of American shoppers. While in Britain money-off coupons are often seen as a sign of desperation, here it is a national pastime. Even the most well-heeled customers clip coupons as if their life depended on it. Some women keep a separate purse to hold their booty. And there is less loyalty to stores here. People often make their mind up where to go day by day, depending on where the special deals are. There was confusion about what kind of store Fresh &amp; Easy was. Early advertising by Tesco made middle-class Americans think they were getting a rival to their beloved Trader Joe's, a sophisticated but simple chain which markets a warm and fuzzy feeling to customers with relaxing music, \"trading post\" decor, an emphasis on organic food, community involvement and even in-store competitions for children. Fresh &amp; Easy targeted Trader Joe's customers, undercutting their bananas, wine and other lines by a cent, and introducing their own kitchens giving away free tasters. But the Tesco's offshoot was far more downmarket. Even the buildings disappointed \u2013 cold and antiseptic, they more like aircraft hangars than cheery, pleasant places to shop. Tesco tried tinkering with decor to give the stores a warmer feel, but the damage had been done. This year many of the kitchens were closed. The retreat had started. Tesco was at first determined not to trade on its Britishness, another mistake. US shoppers were astonished to learn its parent was a top British retailer. \"Why can't we get some lovely British food there?\" was a common question. Eventually Tesco capitulated and devoted space to British goodies such as Colman's mustard and HP sauce. And the chain did not live up to its unpopular name. It was hard to get quality fresh food there \u2013 especially fruit and vegetables \u2013 and it was far from easy to shop: the self-pay checkouts for groceries were confusing for Americans so used to service. Here you can buy just a couple of items and staff are on hand to pack them and you are offered help out to your car (they always assume you have driven to the store). Although generations of Americans have been used to serving themselves in supermarkets, many drew the line at checking out their purchases - and it was not the most idiot-proof system, customers often had to plead for help. It was, in short, a wasted opportunity. Fresh &amp; Easy will soon be forgotten.",

Early advertising by Tesco made middle-class Americans think they were getting a rival to their beloved Trader Joe's, a sophisticated but simple chain which markets a warm and fuzzy feeling to customers with relaxing music, \"trading post\" decor, an emphasis on organic food, community involvement and even in-store competitions for children.</p> <p>Fresh &amp; Easy targeted Trader Joe's customers, undercutting their bananas, wine and other lines by a cent, and introducing their own kitchens giving away free tasters.</p> <p>But the Tesco's offshoot was far more downmarket. Even the buildings disappointed \u2013 cold and antiseptic, they more like aircraft hangars than cheery, pleasant places to shop.</p> <p>Tesco tried tinkering with decor to give the stores a warmer feel, but the damage had been done. This year many of the kitchens were closed. The retreat had started.</p> <p>Tesco was at first determined not to trade on its Britishness, another mistake.</p> <p>US shoppers were astonished to learn its parent was a top British retailer. \"Why can't we get some lovely British food there?\" was a common question. Eventually Tesco capitulated and devoted space to British goodies such as Colman's mustard and HP sauce.</p> <p>And the chain did not live up to its unpopular name. It was hard to get quality fresh food there \u2013 especially fruit and vegetables \u2013 and it was far from easy to shop: the self-pay checkouts for groceries were confusing for Americans so used to service. Here you can buy just a couple of items and staff are on hand to pack them and you are offered help out to your car (they always assume you have driven to the store).</p> <p>Although generations of Americans have been used to serving themselves in supermarkets, many drew the line at checking out their purchases - and it was not the most idiot-proof system, customers often had to plead for help.</p> <p>It was, in short, a wasted opportunity. Fresh &amp; Easy will soon be forgotten.</p>",

    "webTitle": "How Tesco's Fresh & Easy became Stale & Difficult", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Many British retailers have flopped in the US but few have done so as expensively as Tesco. Fresh &amp; Easy was meant to be a controlled experiment, a low-risk way to discover whether there was room in the US grocery market for a new style of store. At launch, in 2007, Tesco spoke about initial startup costs of \u00a3250m a year and break-even at the trading level within two years; what has happened is that a cool \u00a31.3bn has been spent on infrastructure and there has never been a sniff of profit. Add up the losses and the capital sunk, and some \u00a31.6bn has been thrown at the venture. There is no shame in experimenting with new formats and new markets, but persevering so long with an obvious dud takes some explaining. The sum of \u00a31.6bn represents about 15 months' worth of Tesco dividends, and we have yet to see what the \"strategic review\" can recoup. Shareholders will rightly ask whether management ego got in the way of hard-headed decision-making. Yes, the timing of the launch of Fresh &amp; Easy on the west coast of the US turned out to be wretched: recession arrived and bit hard in Tesco's chosen states of California, Nevada and Arizona. But much of the pain was self-inflicted. Despite the boasts about extensive market research \u2013 executives were sent to live with American families to study their habits and preferences \u2013 Tesco was surprised to discover Americans prefer their fruit and veg without the clingfilm. Stark stores also received a thumbs-down, and Tesco was obliged to fit doors to fridges and generally soften the look. Those adjustments were said to help, but Fresh &amp; Easy never got close to achieving the sales densities of veteran west-coast retailers such as Trader Joe's and Whole Food Markets. As for the supposedly low-risk nature of the experiment, that claim always looked hollow. As losses mounted, Terry Leahy, who launched Fresh &amp; Easy, and Phil Clarke, his successor as chief executive, argued the fresh-food-at-low-prices model would work only if done on a big enough scale. Tesco had to build a massive support network, including two distribution centres and a huge kitchen, before knowing whether the stores would ever earn a dime. Why wasn't time called earlier on the Stale &amp; Difficult adventure? Disagreements within the boardroom is one obvious theory. Observers of the Tesco politburo will note that Clarke's tribute to the departing Tim Mason, head of Fresh &amp; Easy, was hardly warm. Here it is in its entirety: \"Tim Mason, who leaves Tesco today, has played an important part in our success over a 30-year career with the company, and he leaves today with my thanks and good wishes.\" OK, that statement ticks a few boxes, but it hardly reflects Mason's lofty status at Tesco. Mason, remember, was the executive in charge of the Clubcard loyalty card at launch, which is generally regarded as being a revolutionary marketing and data success. Remember, too, Mason was deputy chief executive and group marketing director, taking those roles when Clarke was elevated above him to the top job. Asked whether Clarke and Mason had seen eye to eye on the future of Fresh &amp; Easy, Tesco's finance director, Laurie McIlwee, replied: \"That's not relevant.\" Not now, it isn't, anyway. The colourful surfboards that adorned Fresh &amp; Easy's Californian boardroom are history. It's a very safe bet that Clarke won't rehouse them in his no-frills Cheshunt head office.",

Add up the losses and the capital sunk, and some \u00a31.6bn has been thrown at the venture.</p> <p>There is no shame in experimenting with new formats and new markets, but persevering so long with an obvious dud takes some explaining. The sum of \u00a31.6bn represents about 15 months' worth of Tesco dividends, and we have yet to see what the \"strategic review\" can recoup. Shareholders will rightly ask whether management ego got in the way of hard-headed decision-making. Yes, the timing of the launch of Fresh &amp; Easy on the west coast of the US turned out to be wretched: recession arrived and bit hard in Tesco's chosen states of California, Nevada and Arizona. But much of the pain was self-inflicted.</p> <p>Despite the boasts about extensive market research \u2013 executives were sent to live with American families to study their habits and preferences \u2013 Tesco was surprised to discover Americans prefer their fruit and veg without the clingfilm. Stark stores also received a thumbs-down, and Tesco was obliged to fit doors to fridges and generally soften the look. Those adjustments were said to help, but Fresh &amp; Easy never got close to achieving the sales densities of veteran west-coast retailers such as Trader Joe's and Whole Food Markets.</p> <p>As for the supposedly low-risk nature of the experiment, that claim always looked hollow. As losses mounted, Terry Leahy, who launched Fresh &amp; Easy, and Phil Clarke, his successor as chief executive, argued the fresh-food-at-low-prices model would work only if done on a big enough scale. Tesco had to build a massive support network, including two distribution centres and a huge kitchen, before knowing whether the stores would ever earn a dime.</p> <p>Why wasn't time called earlier on the Stale &amp; Difficult adventure? Disagreements within the boardroom is one obvious theory. Observers of the Tesco politburo will note that Clarke's tribute to the departing Tim Mason, head of Fresh &amp; Easy, was hardly warm. Here it is in its entirety: \"Tim Mason, who leaves Tesco today, has played an important part in our success over a 30-year career with the company, and he leaves today with my thanks and good wishes.\"</p> <p>OK, that statement ticks a few boxes, but it hardly reflects Mason's lofty status at Tesco. Mason, remember, was the executive in charge of the Clubcard loyalty card at launch, which is generally regarded as being a revolutionary marketing and data success.</p> <p>Remember, too, Mason was deputy chief executive and group marketing director, taking those roles when Clarke was elevated above him to the top job. Asked whether Clarke and Mason had seen eye to eye on the future of Fresh &amp; Easy, Tesco's finance director, Laurie McIlwee, replied: \"That's not relevant.\"</p> <p>Not now, it isn't, anyway. The colourful surfboards that adorned Fresh &amp; Easy's Californian boardroom are history. It's a very safe bet that Clarke won't rehouse them in his no-frills Cheshunt head office.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Starbucks is attempting to defuse the mounting row about the amount of tax it pays in the UK by pledging to pay more corporation tax in the coming years. The US company is preparing to make an announcement on Thursday \u2013 the day after the chancellor's autumn statement, which is expected to focus on ways to bring in more revenue from major multinationals that have found legitimate ways to avoid paying huge amounts of corporation tax.

Anger over the measures \u2013 a condition of further aid form the EU and IMF \u2013 has been such that growing numbers of MPs had threatened to mutiny.

Also her unemployment rate has just edged lower from 14.7% to 14.6% in November. But we also have signs that what her low corporate taxes brought her such as booming pharmaceutical production are fading just as other countries are also questioning the impact of such taxation regimes. So to get out of this morass Ireland will need to find new things to produce especially drugs.

A global survey of 176 nations gives Ireland its worst ever ranking in the worldwide corruption league with Ireland ranked 25th.</p> <p>The index is one of the most commonly used measures of political risk and is used by credit risk agency Standard and Poor\u2019s to assess the likelihood of sovereign debt default. According to John Devitt, Chief Executive of TI Ireland, \u2018If investors believe government decisions are being swayed by political or private gain, it could have a harmful effect for our economic recovery. Small, open economies are much more exposed to reputational risk that their more powerful counterparts.

Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A 1.2% plunge in retail sales volumes in October fuels concern that consumer spending will be very weak across the Eurozone in the fourth quarter and will drag down GDP.</p> <p>It is notable that spending on non-food products fell by 1.4% month-on-month in October, which suggests that consumers were particularly wary of making discretionary purchases. There were also declines of 0.8% month-on-month in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and 0.1% month-on-month in sales of automotive fuel.</p> <p>Overall Eurozone retail sales were dragged down in October by a 2.8% month-on-month drop in Germany, while there was also another marked decline in Spain (1.2%) following the VAT hike at the start of September.</p> <p>The prospects for consumer spending in the Eurozone look troubling in the near term at least given very low consumer confidence, high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tightening fiscal policy in many countries. The only really good news for Eurozone consumers is that consumer price inflation fell back to a 23-month low of 2.2% in November from 2.5% in October, which will help purchasing power.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-12-05T10:25:43.092Z\">at 10.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50bf1af895cbe872a5d4eb2d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-05T10:17:18.689Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greece tops list of European countries perceived to be most corrupt</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece is perceived to be the most corrupt country in Europe, according to the latest index from Transparency International.</p> <p>My colleague Simon Rogers has all <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/dec/05/corruption-index-2012-transparency-international\">the details of the index here</a>.</p> <p>North Korea tops the list, but the UK is one place worse than last year while the US has improved.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50bf1ddeb57917337d4afec8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-12-05T10:11:42.944Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spain raises \u20ac4.3bn in bond sale but total disappoints</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Spain has successfully raised \u20ac4.3bn, but not the full \u20ac4.5bn it wanted, while the price it paid is still high, ahead of any bailout request from the country.</strong></p> <p>The country sold \u20ac1.1bn of ten year bonds at 5.29%, down from 5.458% in October's auction.

European markets have closed and - despite a disappointing Spanish bond auction, Finland going into recession, lower than expected US jobs figures, mixed European services and retail figures, not to mention austerity statements from the UK and Ireland - they have mostly managed to edge higher. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 23.04 points higher at 5892.08, up 0.39% \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.26% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.28% higher \u2022 The Athens market has added 1.05% \u2022 Spain and Italy were exceptions, down 0.24% and 0.54% respectively In the US, early falls thanks to a - so far unexplained - drop in Apple shares has reversed, as fiscal cliff discussions continue. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 102 points or 0.79% higher. Here's one succinct reaction to the Irish budget, from Trinity College economist Constantin Gurdgiev: Our US colleagues are blogging the latest developments in the US economy and the fiscal cliff, including these comments from President Obama: The good news is that despite the extraordinary challenges we've seen in the last four years, there is some progress in our economy. Obviously, globally, the economy is still soft. Europe is going to be in the doldrums for quite some time. Which has prompted this: Details of the Irish budget statements: Fresh from re-affirming its AAA rating on the EFSF European bailout fund, Fitch has now turned its attention to Spanish banks. And it is not quite as reassuring, saying the outlook for 2013 for the sector remains negative. Fitch director Carmen Munoz said: In the absence of an improving macroeconomic environment there is no scope for a stabilisation of the sector outlook in 2013. Back in Greece, it is not only the bond buy back scheme that is making the news today. The country\u2019s fragile coalition, writes Helena Smith, is also being rocked by widespread fury over the new tax code the government has proposed. Against a backdrop of outrage over the new troika-mandated tax measures, finance minister Yiannis Stournaras has been forced to take emergency action. In talks with Greece\u2019s head of state president Carolos Papoulias, prime minister Antonis Samaras and leaders of the two left-wing parties supporting the government, the economics professor has come under enormous pressure to not just give the new tax code \u201ca lifting but to start from the very beginning,\u201d say aides. Backbenchers in all three parties (let alone the opposition) had threatened openly to vote down the bill which included withdrawing tax breaks from families with children and slapping 45% income tax on anyone earning more than \u20ac26,000. Echoing the mood of many at large, the octogenarian president highlighted the perils of instituting laws that punished couples who chose to have children saying \u201cif not, we will remain without Greeks.\u201d Stournaras vowed to get around the problem \u201cby doing our best to work in favour of those on lower incomes\u201d and pledging that big-time tax evaders risked imprisonment if they continued to dodge their levies. The u-turn came as it became clear that the government\u2019s very survival was at stake. Anger over the measures \u2013 a condition of further aid form the EU and IMF \u2013 has been such that growing numbers of MPs had threatened to mutiny. Athens has to increase revenues by \u20ac2.5bn in the area of tax collection. Meanwhile, the US fiscal cliff impasse rumbles on: Away from Ireland for the moment, and you may recall Moody's cut the credit rating of the EFSF bailout fund, a consequence of it chopping France's AAA rating. Fitch, on the other hand, still has an AAA rating on France, and so: The link to the Fitch statement is here. Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin said there was a daunting challenge ahead, with \u20ac2bn spending adjustments required in 2013 out of a total of \u20ac3.5bn. As part of that, the number of public sector workers will be cut by 33,000 to 287,000 next year. No hike in fuel duty but as expected alcohol and cigarettes are up. Henry McDonald writes: Noonan has slapped an extra \u20ac1 on a 75cl bottle of wine while beer and cider rise by a mere 10%. Beyond the 'old reliables' the Finance Minister has introduced a property tax of 0.18 per cent up the market value of \u20ac1 million and 0.25 per cent on homes valued above one million. It will come into effect from next July and replace the deeply unpopular Household Charge. Noonan is winding up, saying bond yields are down from 10% to 2%. Confidence is returning to Ireland and judging by the PMIs, the country is the only one to show expansion. That's the attempt at confidence. Now come the spending cuts. Real estate investment trusts will be introduced in 2013, says Noonan. Also, a property tax will be introduced, beginning with a half year charge of \u20ac157 next year. Ireland's Noonan said the budget deficit for 2012 would be 8.2%, as before and within the target of 8.6%. For 2013 the deficit would be 7.5%, in 2014 it would be 5.1% and in 2015, 2.9%. The estimate for GDP growth is 1.5% in 2013, and 2.5% in 2014. Fianna Fail's Michael McGrath has briefly interrupted Noonan's speech to protest that the opposition had not received budget documentation ahead of time, calling it unprecedented. Noonan started with some general comments before moving onto to measures including fuel rebates for hauliers and relief from capital gains tax for farm land disposals. First time buyers will be exempt from property tax for four years. Coverage of the Irish budget has begun with a live stream here at RTE. As Noonan presented his report to the cameras at the back of Government Buildings only a small number of demonstrators had gathered around the other side at the gates of the Irish parliament, writes Henry McDonald. One protester is holding up a photocopy of Time magazine's edition praising Taoiseach Enda Kenny but with the words 'To Go' underneath it. Some details of the forthcoming Irish budget are emerging, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin. Among the measures about to be announced in the Dail by Michael Noonan is that cigarettes are to rise by 10 cents while the price of a pint could be hiked from between 5 to 10 cents. Irish pensioners, and that includes OAPs living in Northern Ireland, will still enjoy universal free travel. This means even the richest pensioners both inside the state and over the border can still travel free on bus and rail services. However OAPs in the republic, at least those over 70 who earn more than \u20ac60,000 will see a rise in the so-called social solidarity tax, the Universal Social Charge. But the budget does not seem to be capturing the attention you might expect. Henry adds: It is perhaps a measure of how much this budget has been flagged in advance by a series of strategic leaks...or maybe just a case of austerity-fatigue/resignation that the number one story running currently on RTE's news website is a story about a 20 year old being jailed for four months today after being found guilty of throwing a pet rabbit belonging to a homeless man into Dublin's river Liffey. Barney, the rabbit belonging to John Byrne, was saved after its owner jumped into the river and saved his beloved pet. Barricades have been erected outside the Dail in case demonstrations against the cost cutting budget get out of hand later this afternoon, writes Henry McDonald. Gardai are out in force around the Irish parliament in south central Dublin. Possibly in response to public anger over the pain they will have to endure for the sixth time in a row there are reports this lunchtime that party leaders in the Dail are going to take a 10% in their allowances with TDs [members of the lower house] also expected to take a hit in payments. Ahead of the US non-farm payrolls figures on Friday, come some disappointing employment figures. US private sector employers added 118,000 jobs in November, according to payroll processor ADP, but this was lower than the 125,000 expected by economists. October's number was revised down from an increase of 158,000 to 157,000. And yes, there is some talk of Hurricane Sandy being to blame. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Should the non-farm payrolls track the ADP report in November, the Friday employment report would be a touch stronger than expected but still weaker than in October. The effects of the superstorm Sandy will be clear in the November non-farm report and - despite today's ADP report - we still see non-farms to come in at around 90,000 in November. The ADP suggested that the Hurricane cut job creation by around 86,000 in November. Finland has become the latest eurozone member to slip into recession. The country, one of four left in the eurozone with its AAA rating intact, said GDP fell by 1.2% year on year in the third quarter, following a revised 0.2% decline in the previous three months. Finland's exports have been hit by the eurozone crisis, but one of its key companies, mobile phone group Nokia, has lost market share to the likes of Apple and Google. The new chairman of the eurogroup to replace Jean-Claude Juncker should be an acting finance minister, said a German government spokeswoman. Juncker - the prime minister of Luxembourg who was also finance minister when he took on the eurogroup job - announced this week he would step down at the end of this year or early in 2013. That leaves little time to find a replacement. Update: According to Reuters the spokeswoman has corrected the earlier statement to say the eurogroup chairman does not have to be an acting finance minister. So, as you were. George Osborne says the independent Office of Budget Responsibility has cut its forecast for UK GDP to 0.1% this year, blaming it on the euro crisis. In March the forecast was for growth of 0.8%. He said the OBR assumed the eurozone would recover but it continued to contract, and the euro crisis would constrain growth for several years to come. UK autumn statement begins. Follow live blog here. The calm before the storm? Greek finance ministry officials have reacted furiously to the banks' announcement this morning that they would decide on Friday whether to back the bond buying plan. They told our Athens correspondent Helena Smith that an extension to the buy-back operation is now definitely on the cards: \"What do they mean they will decide on Friday? They've had had all week to think about this. Have they not given it any thought?,\" asked one well-placed official. \"We will now have to see [following this announcement] whether the whole process will have to be prolonged which may well be the case.\" Independent economist Shaun Richards has been taking a look at the Irish economy ahead of today's budget. His conclusion: It seems incredibly unlikely that the Irish economy can expand by 2.5% in 2014 and 2.9% in 2015. If we now add in her austerity plans which after today\u2019s \u20ac3.5bn is supposed to have an extra \u20ac3.1bn in 2014 and \u20ac2bn in 2015 we see that she is in danger of foundering under the sea of debt that her banks have left her with. There are always two sides to every story and on the upside she has seen interest rates on her debt fall and not every economic number is grim as for example retail sales rose by 1.7% in October on September and by 3.1% on the year before. Also her unemployment rate has just edged lower from 14.7% to 14.6% in November. But we also have signs that what her low corporate taxes brought her such as booming pharmaceutical production are fading just as other countries are also questioning the impact of such taxation regimes. So to get out of this morass Ireland will need to find new things to produce especially drugs. Can anybody think of likely ones? 2013 looks like being the most crucial year for a country which has been lauded as the poster boy of austerity. Ahead of this afternoon's Irish budget there is some slightly encouraging data for the Fine Gael-Labour coalition to hold onto regarding Irish unemployment rates, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin. Figures published today by the Republic's Central Statistics Office show that the numbers on the unemployment register for November were 2,895 lower than the previous month. The current jobless total is also down 12,290 compared to the same period last year according to the CSO although this may be only a crumb of comfort for the economy as the overall unemployment rate in Ireland is currently 14.6 per cent. This could however be put down to more and more Irish people, particularly those under 40, who are emigrating from the state to countries such as Australia and Canada. Back in Greece, and Reuters is reporting that the country's banks will decide on Friday whether to take part in the crucial bond buying plan. Greek lenders hold around \u20ac17bn of the \u20ac63bn bonds eligible for the buyback so their support is crucial. Over in Italy, and Silvio Berlusconi is stirring it up again. According to La Stampa (via Open Europe) Berlusconi plans to discuss at a lunch with party members today whether to withdraw support from prime minister Mario Monti's government and possibly force an early election. The paper also says the country's new draft electoral law will not be submitted to the senate today, as planned, because of disagreements between the various parties. More bond auctions, and Germany's has - predictably - been a success. In its last issue of the year, it sold \u20ac3.3bn of two year Schatz notes at a yield of -0.01% - a sign investors are still prepared to suffer negative interest rates for security amid the eurozone crisis and, increasingly, worries about the US fiscal cliff. Meanwhile: On a lighter note: More from Henry McDonald ahead of the Irish budget: One of the key aims of the Fine Gael-Labour government is to restore fulll economic sovereignty and no longer rely (as the Republic has done since 2010) on the largesse of the so-called troika - the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the EU - to pay for Ireland's public services. The coalition wants to return to the international markets to borrow in order to finance the state sometime in 2013. However according to Transparency International today confidence in Ireland may be hard to obtain. A Transparency International index (see earlier), launched on Budget Day, reveals that corruption in Ireland is still higher than in some developing nations like Uruguay and the Bahamas. A global survey of 176 nations gives Ireland its worst ever ranking in the worldwide corruption league with Ireland ranked 25th. The index is one of the most commonly used measures of political risk and is used by credit risk agency Standard and Poor\u2019s to assess the likelihood of sovereign debt default. According to John Devitt, Chief Executive of TI Ireland, \u2018If investors believe government decisions are being swayed by political or private gain, it could have a harmful effect for our economic recovery. Small, open economies are much more exposed to reputational risk that their more powerful counterparts. Risk-averse and politically aware investors will also look elsewhere when deciding where to locate or do business if they suspect that favoured businesses and government are in bed with one another\u2019. Meanwhile Dublin based Russian-born Trinity College economist Constantin Gurdgiev is unconvinced by the Irish budget debate. He has tweeted: The entire Irish Budget 2013 'debate' is amusing: no serious reforms being discussed one side of tax-&amp;-spend policies or the other by the Govt or opposition parties. Instead, incessant bickering as to how we can find someone else to pay for the benefits to a specific interest group draws a picture of a dysfunctional governance system reliant on 'the feeding trough' model of the Social Partnership. Earlier, a eurozone service sector survey also painted a picture of continuing decline. Markit's eurozone services PMI index came in at 46.5 in November. That was better than the initial estimate of 45.8 and an improvement on October's figure of 45.7. But it is still way off the 50 level which would signal growth. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Looking at the biggest EMU countries PMIs, we clearly see that the upward revision is fully explained by a substantial correction in the German Services PMI (up to 49.7 from 48 initially estimated). Other EMU countries' PMI were extremely sluggish over the month. The uptick [from October] is good news as it might be a sign that activity has bottomed out in the third quarter. Nevertheless we see no signs of improvement that suggest that the EMU economy might recover any time soon. Further contraction in GDP remains our baseline scenario at least until the first quarter of 2013. Retail sales volumes in the eurozone dropped by 1.2% in October compared to the previous month, the biggest fall since April as the economic woes continue to bite. Economists had been expecting a 0.1% fall, and on top of that, September's figure was revised down from a 0.2% fall to a 0.6% decline. The year on year drop was 3.6%, compared to forecasts of a 0.8% fall. So much for hopes of a consumer led recovery from the downturn. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: A 1.2% plunge in retail sales volumes in October fuels concern that consumer spending will be very weak across the Eurozone in the fourth quarter and will drag down GDP. It is notable that spending on non-food products fell by 1.4% month-on-month in October, which suggests that consumers were particularly wary of making discretionary purchases. There were also declines of 0.8% month-on-month in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and 0.1% month-on-month in sales of automotive fuel. Overall Eurozone retail sales were dragged down in October by a 2.8% month-on-month drop in Germany, while there was also another marked decline in Spain (1.2%) following the VAT hike at the start of September. The prospects for consumer spending in the Eurozone look troubling in the near term at least given very low consumer confidence, high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tightening fiscal policy in many countries. The only really good news for Eurozone consumers is that consumer price inflation fell back to a 23-month low of 2.2% in November from 2.5% in October, which will help purchasing power. Greece is perceived to be the most corrupt country in Europe, according to the latest index from Transparency International. My colleague Simon Rogers has all the details of the index here. North Korea tops the list, but the UK is one place worse than last year while the US has improved. Spain has successfully raised \u20ac4.3bn, but not the full \u20ac4.5bn it wanted, while the price it paid is still high, ahead of any bailout request from the country. The country sold \u20ac1.1bn of ten year bonds at 5.29%, down from 5.458% in October's auction. The bond was covered 2.3 times, up from 1.9 times in October. Its 2015 bond raised \u20ac2.1bn at a yield of 3.39% (3.61% in November), with a lower cover of 2 times (from 2.1 times), It sold \u20ac1bn worth of 2019 bonds with a yield of 4.669% and was 2.5 times covered. In the market, the yield of Spanish ten year bonds have edged up to 5.366%. RIA Capital Markets strategist Nick Stamenkovic told Reuters: A bit disappointing they didn't manage to raise the full amount...that caused a bit of a correction in the market. The sheer scale of issuance next year and the lack of demand from domestic investors suggest to me that it's just a matter of time before Spain has to make an official bailout (request), but that's a story for early 2013. Meanwhile Nicholas Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, questioned the recent rally in Spanish debt prices: The rally... not only looks overdone but is becoming more and more detached from economic fundamentals. This is an entirely externally driven improvement in sentiment which is unsustainable given the severity of Spain's troubles. The Rajoy government is bound to interpret the dramatic improvement in sentiment towards Spain as part of a reassessment of Spanish risk. The government is now even less keen on requesting a sovereign bail-out since it believes the markets are becoming less and less sensitive to a Spanish request for an ECB-backed bond-buying programme. Some worrying news for the UK economy \u2013 the service sector grew by its weakest amount in nearly two years in November, with a PMI of just 50.2 (down from 50.6 in October and well shy of forecast of 51.1.) That means it barely grew at all. Chris Williamson of Markit, which produces the data, says it shows Britain faces the risk of contracting again in the current quarter. Not good news for George Osborne ahead of today's autumn statement. The UK isn't the only country struggling \u2013 Spain's service sector shrank for the 17th month in a row in November (with a PMI of just 42.4). And with that I'm going to concentrate on the autumn statement blog, so I'll leave the eurozone in the hands of my colleague Nick Fletcher. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan will deliver the 2013 Irish budget at 2.30pm. Our Dublin correspondent, Henry McDonald, explains that it will be the country's sixth cost-cutting, indirect tax-raising austerity budget since the financial crisis began: Henry writes: As Ireland tries to plug the hole in its public finances and, ultimately regain its economic sovereignty, Noonan will announce an expected \u20ac1.25bn indirect tax hikes as well as cuts in public spending amounting to \u20ac2.25bn. His Cabinet colleague, the Labour Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore has promised that although the budget will again be tough it will also be fair. High earners and the rich elite will endure pain through the budgetary measures, Gilmore insisted. Those with the broadest financial backs including banker pensioners, retired ministers and hospital consultants, are going to take a \u20ac500m hit across several fronts in the budget for 2013. For those at the bottom of the pile the bad news will include a cut in ten euros to child benefit although rent and fuel allowances will remain untouched. There is also expected to be a property tax average at about \u20ac300 per year on most households. The state of Irish public finances remains in chronic shape with Noonan's own department revealing this week that the Irish Exchequer took in \u20ac300 million less than it expected from income tax this autumn while there continues to be over-spending of nearly \u20ac100 million in social welfare and the health service. Ireland, which still has one of the most generous social welfare systems in the western world (the dole for a single person in Ireland is \u20ac188 euros per week as compared to Greece where it is around \u20ac50), still relies on the support of the IMF and Europe to keep paying for its social and public services. Europe's stock markets are up in early trading, and close to their highest levels of 2012. FTSE 100: up 31 points at 5900, + 0.5% German DAX: up 36 points at 7472, + 0.5% French CAC: up 23 points at 3604, + 0.6% Spanish IBEX: up 62 points at 7964, + 0.8% Italian FTSE MIB: up 141 points at 16182, + 0.88% Robin Bew, chief economist of The Economist Intelligence Unit, is concerned by the failure to make significant progress towards a single eurozone banking supervisor (if you were here yesterday, you'll already know that Berlin and Paris remain divided over how to regulate the region's banks). It's also a big day in the UK, with the chancellor, George Osborne, presenting his autumn statement to the House of Commons at 12.30pm. We're covering it live in a separate blog: Autumn statement 2012 - live coverage of George Osborne's speech. Much of today's Irish budget was agreed under the terms of the \u20ac85bn bailout that Ireland signed up for in 2012. Measure expected include: \u2022 \u20ac1bn in tax rises \u2022 \u20ac500m cuts to capital expenditure \u2022 \u20ac1.7bn cuts to departmental budgets \u2022 A property tax Today's Irish austerity budget will be presented as the final dose of seriously unpleasant medicine on the country's slow return to health. Ireland's deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore set the ground yesterday, saying it will be a \"very tough budget\": It was always going to be a tough budget, but it is the budget that is going to get us to 85% of the adjustment that has to be made. It will therefore put the end in sight for these type of measures and these type of budgets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis. Today we're focusing on Ireland, where another tough budget will be unveiled this afternoon. The Dublin government is expected to announce spending cuts and tax hikes worth \u20ac3.5bn. The measures will be billed as a move towards ending Ireland's austerity programme and returning to growth, but it will be another blow to a country that was forced to seek financial help two years ago. We'll also be tracking the reaction to Europe's failure yesterday to agree the details of a banking regulator for the eurozone, due to a rift between Germany and France.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has announced an embarrassing retreat from the US after pouring \u00a31bn into a bid to take on the mighty Wal-Mart in its own backyard. The supermarket group's deputy chief executive, Tim Mason, who heads the loss-making US Fresh &amp; Easy chain, is to quit the company after 30 years. The UK's biggest retailer confirmed on Wednesday it was launching a \"strategic review\" of the US business. The chief executive, Phil Clarke, who took over from Sir Terry Leahy last year, said that while all options were under consideration it was \"likely, though not certain\" that Tesco will quit the US entirely. He said it was clear Fresh &amp; Easy \"will not deliver acceptable shareholder returns on an appropriate timeframe in its current form\". The group had in recent months received \"a number of approaches\" from parties interested in buying all or part of Fresh &amp; Easy, or in partnering with Tesco to develop the business. He promised an update when the group presents its full-year results in April. Mason, once seen as a candidate to replace Leahy, will quit the group immediately.
