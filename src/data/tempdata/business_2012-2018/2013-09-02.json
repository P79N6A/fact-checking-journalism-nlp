      "bodyText": "Stock markets soared on Monday as surveys of manufacturing output around the world gave the strongest indication yet that the richest countries are finally shaking off the after-effects of the financial crisis. British manufacturing order books and output grew at their fastest in almost two decades while China, which has suffered a year-long contraction in manufacturing output, saw activity expand in August. Factory sectors in Spain and Italy returned to growth for the first time since 2011. Only France and India among the world's biggest economies experienced falls in production and Paris will be comforted by indications that some areas of manufacturing stabilised during the summer. India, though, appeared to be heading into deeper trouble after a fall in the rupee failed to arrest the country's first contraction in manufacturing for more than four years. The FTSE 100 jumped almost 100 points to 6507 with mining groups leading the charge. Rio Tinto and Anglo American saw a sharp rise in their values as investors bet on a more widespread use of iron, coal and nickel. The French Cac and German Dax also rose strongly. George Osborne has taken comfort in recent months that the UK's long-awaited recovery in manufacturing is under way. The services sector has expanded for more than a year, but the economy was unable to push ahead while construction and manufacturing contracted. Since the beginning of the year those sectors have stopped being a drag on growth and in recent months have added momentum to the growth figures. The monthly snapshot from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Markit said the return of confidence, a rosier outlook for exporters and demand for new products had all helped UK factories in August. The purchasing managers index (PMI) rose from 54.8 in July to 57.2 last month \u2013 its highest level in two and a half years. The PMI is made up of various measures of industrial activity including orders, output, employment, stock levels and inflationary pressure. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said orders and output were growing at their fastest since the summer of 1994, a period when the UK was recovering from recession. He said: \"The UK's factories are booming again. Orders and output are growing at the fastest rates for almost 20 years, as rising demand from domestic customers is being accompanied by a return to growth of our largest trading partner, the eurozone.\" Meanwhile, Britain's high streets have performed well this year and the British Retail Consortium said the trend continued into August. Sales rose 3.6% on a year ago as shops expanded to cope with rising demand. The BRC said the figures augured well for the autumn because they were strong enough to show an improvement on last August, when the Olympics was at its height. Strong manufacturing growth has been accompanied by an increase in price pressures, the Markit report said. Companies reported rising costs for fuel and raw materials, with its input prices index up by 10.4 points on the month \u2013 the second highest rise in the survey's history. The potential for a rise in inflation, coupled with analysis showing that much of the boost to the economy has been based on consumer spending while investment remained on hold, has persuaded some analysts to conclude that the quickening recovery is unsustainable. Trevor Greetham, a director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, accused the government of \"unleashing the beast\" of cheap mortgages to foster a dash for growth before the 2015 election. He said a large part of the current recovery could be traced back to the government's Funding for Lending Scheme, which offers cheap money to banks, and the housing market scheme Help to Buy, which have channelled money into mortgages at the expense of business lending. The TUC said the benefits of the recovery were being swallowed up by business managers and shareholders, leaving workers worse off. Speaking before the TUC's annual conference next week, general secretary Frances O'Grady pointed out that UK workers have suffered a huge squeeze on their incomes over the last five years, with average pay falling by 6.3% in real terms. She said many have remained on frozen or low pay while inflation has jumped, leaving someone earning \u00a326,000 a year more than \u00a330 a week worse off in real terms. The study, part of the TUC's Britain Needs a Pay Rise campaign, compared hourly pay rates in 2007 (at 2012 prices) with those in 2012, and \"shows the extent of the pay squeeze being felt by families across the UK as incomes fail to keep pace with rising prices\". O'Grady said the north-west was the hardest hit region in the UK following a fall in average hourly pay from \u00a311.43 in 2007 to \u00a310.52 in 2012 \u2013 an 8% drop in real terms. France, India and Russia struggle France's manufacturing sector is struggling to recover after a difficult year of redundancies at the state-backed car makers Renault and Peugeot Citro\u00ebn and high-profile steel works closures. While eurozone manufacturing activity expanded for a second successive month in August, in France the purchasing managers index was confirmed at 49.7, where a figure below 50 shows activity contracted. It was the only eurozone country where the measure of activity failed to improve. However, output has fallen in France over the last four years far less than some other eurozone countries, and the slow rate of contraction was read by many analysts as a sign that the recession is bottoming out. India also suffered a slowdown in manufacturing output in August, though much of the blame was heaped on the administration of prime minister Manmohan Singh, a former economics professor, who has run the country since 2004 and was re-elected in May. The HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 48.5 after a drop in domestic and export orders. In the last two years GDP growth has more than halved to 4.4% and investment funds have flowed out of the country. The central bank has hiked interest rates, making it tougher for businesses and consumers to borrow. India was not alone among the \"Bric\" countries to suffer a contraction in manufacturing. Russia's output also fell, largely because of government neglect and a high rouble.

The UK authorities, though, will not directly receive anything from the sale.</strong></p> <p>That's according to a section in <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/vodafone-group-plc--vod-/rns/vodafone-to-realise--130bn-for-45--interest-in-vzw/201309021712040484N/\">Vodafone's statement to the stock market tonight</a>, called \"Transaction structure and tax impact on Vodafone\". It explains that the Verizon stake is held by a company listed in the Netherlands, but argues that it wouldn't make any difference if it were in the UK.</p> <p>I've pasted the relevent section here in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Vodafone owns the interest in VZW through a US group which also owns non-US interests acquired in the merger with AirTouch Communications Inc. in 1999 together with other non-US interests acquired over time (together, the \"RoW Interests\"). Vodafone will be exiting its principal US business as a result of the VZW Transaction and will, therefore, undertake a rationalisation and reorganisation prior to completion of that transaction so that those RoW Interests will be held by Vodafone outside the US in the future. The reorganisation will give rise to a US tax liability estimated at approximately US$5 billion under standard US tax rules and based on the current valuation of those RoW Interests.</p> <p>The US Group is owned by a Vodafone European holding company, based in the Netherlands, and will be sold to Verizon as part of the VZW Transaction in its entirety once the rationalisation and reorganisation is complete. The sale of the US Group is not taxable under standard US and Dutch tax rules. Under the US tax code, US tax is not imposed on these types of sales of shares by non-US residents. Such treatment is also consistent with US tax treaties. Dutch tax law provides a participation exemption on capital gains arising from the sale of shares. Whilst the UK is not a relevant jurisdiction for tax purposes given the locations of the buyer and the seller, under rules established in 2002, the UK has similar shareholding disposal exemptions to those of the Netherlands and the VZW Transaction would, therefore, not be taxable under standard UK tax rules were the US Group to be sold from the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>Vodafone's tax affairs have been widely aired in the UK media over the last three years, since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/dec/06/hmrc-tax-deal-vodafone\">the firm reached a controversial deal with the Inland Revenue over outstanding tax liabilities</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T16:48:23.946Z\">at 5.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5224bd3ce4b074ec23392221\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T16:31:22.174Z\">5.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's the breakdown of the funds that will go to Vodafone investors:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/statuses/374568013443645440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>24bn to UK shareholders, there are more than 500,000 of them, 38bn to shareholders in other countries</p>&mdash; Laura Kuenssberg (@ITVLauraK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ITVLauraK/statuses/374568013443645440\">September 2, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T16:31:33.098Z\">at 5.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5224bbe0e4b0b6f34d589f5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T16:30:19.325Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you're a Vodafone customer, you may be pleased to hear that the company is committing \u00a36bn of its Verizon windfall towards a new programme called \" Project Spring\" (as in <em>springing into action?

Second, the economy is starting to grow for the first time in about a year and half.

As he put it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One year after the inception of the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs), financial markets in the euro area are in much calmer conditions and fragmentation is receding. Yet, OMTs have created turmoil elsewhere: in the hallways of economics faculties, newspaper commentaries and, maybe, dinner tables across Europe; today, it is not government bond spreads but emotions that are running high.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'd be surprised if many European families have debated the merits of Mario Draghi's pet project over the Sunday roast or tapas (<em>Mrs W invariably changes the subject, alas</em>). Still, C\u0153ur\u00e9 argues that people <strong>should</strong> reflect on why OMT helped to ease fears of a eurozone break-up, even though it has not been activated.</p> <p>Here's his conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>OMTs are necessary from a monetary policy perspective; they were effective in counteracting the destructive market turmoil in the summer of last year; and they are designed in a way that overcomes the key concerns associated with government bond purchases by the central bank.</p> <p>OMTs are not just words: the ECB is fully prepared to use them. But even if euro area member states comply with the conditions, there is no automatism to activate OMTs. For the Governing Council of the ECB, there is only one single deciding criterion and that is the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. This overarching criterion has shaped the design of OMTs, and it will decide over its potential activation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Here's the full speech: <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2013/html/sp130902.en.html\">Outright Monetary Transactions, one year on</a></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52246e07e4b074ec233921e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-02T11:24:57.679Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone crisis looms over German elections</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d49f5585-3519-4a0e-a7a4-9e9936a2cca3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/2/1378120893208/0d9ca5aa-2ba2-4af8-b35d-504d34c7ed4e-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"People watch the only TV election debate between German chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) top candidate Peer Steinbrueck on a screen at a CDU election campaign event in Hanover, Germany, 01 September 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People watch the only TV election debate between German chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) top candidate Peer Steinbrueck last night.

I'll be back tomorrow for more live coverage of events in the City, the eurozone and the global economy (and who knows what other dramas could unfold?) Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW Our technology editor Charles Arthur writes that Vodafone has engineered one of the biggest deals in corporate history - one that could deliver a windfall to half a million small shareholders. It could also give a boost to the UK economy, and help improve the UK's mobile broadband coverage. Charles reports tonight: British mobile phone group Vodafone pulled off one of the biggest deals in corporate history on Monday\u2212 selling its stake in America's biggest mobile phone business for $130bn (\u00a384bn). More than \u00a354bn of the proceeds will be returned to Vodafone's shareholders \u2212 with \u00a322bn going to UK investors. Vodafone will also pour cash into its existing business to accelerate the rollout of superfast 4G broadband services across Europe. The deal \u2212 the third biggest transaction between two companies ever recorded \u2212 involves Vodafone selling its 45% shareholding in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications, which owns the other 55% of VW. It will end years of bickering between the two joint owners, who had tussled over the direction and control of Verizon Wireless, which was formed in 2000 and has since become the US's most profitable mobile carrier. Coming five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US which triggered the worldwide credit crunch, the deal also underlines the extent to which financial markets have recovered: $65bn of the cash Verizon is using to finance the deal is coming from four banks. Vodafone is one of the UK's most widely held shares and the huge return of cash was likened by some City sources to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme, which aims to boost the economy by electronic money printing. As many as 500,000 private shareholders in the UK who own up to \u00a310,000 of shares each could be in line for payments of up to \u00a34,000, a windfall that will be tax-free as long as it is invested through an individual savings account (ISA) or pension fund. Here's the full story: Vodafone pulls off one of biggest deals in corporate history with $130bn sale One of Vodafone's largest shareholders, Standard Life, has welcomed the news that the Verizon Wireless stake is being sold for $130bn. Andrew Millington, investment director at Standard Life, said Vodafone had got a good deal, adding: It will leave Vodafone with control over a greater proportion of its cash flow, a strengthened balance sheet, and the opportunity to return a large amount of capital to shareholders. (via the FT) Standard Life may also be relieved that Vodafone ignored the advice of, errr, Standard Life in 2006 when it called for the Verizon Wireless stake to be sold (details here). Vodafone would have received rather less had it cashed in seven years ago.... Is this the scene in HMRC tonight? (hat-tip to our cartoonist Kipper) Here's how Reuters are reporting the biggest deal in a decade: Verizon Communications agreed on Monday to pay $130 billion to buy Vodafone out of its U.S. wireless business, signing history's third largest corporate deal to bring an end to an often fractious 14-year marriage. The two firms said Vodafone would get $58.9bn in cash, $60.2bn in Verizon stock, and an additional $11bn from smaller transactions in a deal that is due to close in the first quarter of next year. The British group will return 71% of the net proceeds to shareholders, including all of the stock, in a sign that it does not expect to go on a new acquisition spree across its remaining core European and emerging markets. The move to sell out of the joint venture closes a heady expansionist chapter for Vodafone, one of Britain's best-known companies, which grew rapidly over the last 20 years through a spate of aggressive deals, taking its brand into more than 30 countries across Europe, Africa and India. The deal is also likely to be the defining event in the careers of Vittorio Colao and Lowell McAdam, the chief executives of Vodafone and Verizon, who rebuilt relations between the two sides, which had long argued over issues including the level of dividends to be paid from Verizon Wireless. More here: Verizon and Vodafone agree $130 billion Wireless deal Analysts reckon that a deal of this magnitude will mean fees of between $200m and $250m for various investment banks. So there could be cheering in the City wine bars tonight... or tears at those firms who didn't get on the ticket. We know that Goldman Sachs and UBS both advised Vodafone, so they shouldn't go hungry.... On the tax issue, there are three reasons Vodafone is confident of avoiding a UK bill (see 5.47pm): 1) The Verizon Wireless stake is held in a Netherlands holding company, and Dutch law exempts firms from capital gains tax 2) The US tax code doe not impose a tax bill on firms based outside America when they sell shares in this way 3) Even if the stake was held in the UK, tax changes to the corporation tax rules (made by the former Labour government) mean a tax bill would not apply. Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao may use some of his Verizon windfall towards a new bicycle, ITV's Laura Kuenssberg reports: Maybe he's planning another race against Verizon's boss, Lowell McAdam..... Could Vodafone now find itself a takeover target? Simon Maughan, analyst at Olivetree Financial Group, reckons so: Vodafone owed its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to former chief executive Chris Gent, and his voracious appetite for deals. As a minority partner, though, Vodafone didn't really influence the way Verizon Wireless operated. As such, the deal will have little immediate effect on US cellphone users. Associated Press explains: The buyout, the second-largest acquisition deal on record, would give Vodafone PLC additional cash to pursue its expansion ambitions in Europe. It would also give Verizon Communications Inc., the opportunity to boost its quarterly earnings, as it would no longer have to share a portion of proceeds from the nation's No. 1 wireless carrier with Vodafone. The deal isn't expected to have much of an effect on Verizon consumers or on the company's operations. Vodafone had little influence on Verizon Wireless' day-to-day operations, and the two companies have kept out of each other's territory. The Verizon-Vodafone partnership started in 2000. Verizon has had a long-standing interest in buying out its partner, but the two companies hadn't agreed on a price until now. Analysts said Verizon wanted to pay around $100 billion for Vodafone's stake, while reports suggested that Vodafone was pressing for the $130 billion. City veteran David Buik doesn't believe the huge payout heading to Vodafone's City shareholders will prompt a splurge of fresh investment: A bit more clarity about what the $130bn deal means for Vodafone shareholders. Verizon will pay Vodafone $58.9bn in cash, $60.2bn in its own shares, and $11bn from smaller transactions. All the stock will go straight to shareholders, plus over a third ($23.9bn) of the cash, once the deal is finalised. In total, it's the equivalent of 112p per Vodafone share. UK shareholders could then choose to sell their Verizon shares (potentially yielding a capital gains tax bill), or hold onto them (so no tax liability would apply). The cash could act as a mini-stimulus to the UK economy, if people decide to spend it. ...and if today's deal works out, it could ease Colao's passage into politics one day Reuters again: A few years ago he confided to friends that he would like to be Italy's foreign minister, although his political ambitions are said to have ebbed since then. More here. Colao's message to reporters tonight is that he's not going anywhere, and is \"super committed\" to Vodafone. The two men who hammered out the biggest deal in a decade bonded over food, wine, and bicycle frames, Reuters reports: Vittorio Colao... drew on a stronger and more trusting relationship with Lowell McAdam, Verizon Communications CEO, meeting him over dinner and wine, and sharing a passion for cycling that saw them once do a 50km (30 miles) race together. Vodafone now holds two places in the list of the five largest deals in history. Once as a buyer and once (today) as a seller: 1999: Takeover of Mannesmann by Vodafone, for $203bn 2000: Merger of Time Warner and AOL, for $181.6bn 2013: Sale of Vodafone's 45% in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $130bn 2008: Philip Morris spun off by shareholders for $113bn 2007: Aquisition of ABN-AMRO by consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland for $98bn The AOL-Time Warner meger is now seen as the textbook example of dot-com excess (or possible madness), while buying ABN-AMRO forced RBS into a massive nationalisation to save it from complete collapse. Mega deals can turn into mega disasters, but on this occasion Vodafone appears to have done well (shares have surged by over 10% since rumours of an agreement with Verizon leaked late last week). Robert Peston of the BBC has outlined the complicated history of Vodafone's deal with Verizon, in this blog post: Vodafone: No UK tax to pay on \u00a384bn sale And this post by Hugo Dixon of Breaking Views is a fine explanation of how the two companies found themselves locked in a marriage of inconvenience for so long: Speaking of tax.... Margaret Hodge, head of the public accounts committee, has already sounded the alarm over Vodafone's sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless tonight (see 5.16pm onwards) Hodge called for government ministers and officials at HMRC to urgently scrutinise the deal. My colleague Rajeev Syal reported her concerns earlier today: Hodge told the Guardian that HMRC officials should intervene at the earliest opportunity. \"HMRC must begin an absolutely thorough investigation to make sure that UK taxpayers receive the maximum to which they are entitled,\" she said. She added that Treasury ministers should also examine whether there is a loophole being exploited by the British company. \"If there is a flaw in the law, it needs to be addressed by Treasury ministers urgently,\" she said. More here: Vodafone-Verizon deal: Margaret Hodge raises alarm over tax loss Moody's has already given its reaction to the deal -- it has downgraded Verizon's credit rating by one notch, from A3 to Baa1. Vodafone has stated that the process of selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless will generate a $5bn tax liability in America. The UK authorities, though, will not directly receive anything from the sale. That's according to a section in Vodafone's statement to the stock market tonight, called \"Transaction structure and tax impact on Vodafone\". It explains that the Verizon stake is held by a company listed in the Netherlands, but argues that it wouldn't make any difference if it were in the UK. I've pasted the relevent section here in full. Vodafone owns the interest in VZW through a US group which also owns non-US interests acquired in the merger with AirTouch Communications Inc. in 1999 together with other non-US interests acquired over time (together, the \"RoW Interests\"). Vodafone will be exiting its principal US business as a result of the VZW Transaction and will, therefore, undertake a rationalisation and reorganisation prior to completion of that transaction so that those RoW Interests will be held by Vodafone outside the US in the future. The reorganisation will give rise to a US tax liability estimated at approximately US$5 billion under standard US tax rules and based on the current valuation of those RoW Interests. The US Group is owned by a Vodafone European holding company, based in the Netherlands, and will be sold to Verizon as part of the VZW Transaction in its entirety once the rationalisation and reorganisation is complete. The sale of the US Group is not taxable under standard US and Dutch tax rules. Under the US tax code, US tax is not imposed on these types of sales of shares by non-US residents. Such treatment is also consistent with US tax treaties. Dutch tax law provides a participation exemption on capital gains arising from the sale of shares. Whilst the UK is not a relevant jurisdiction for tax purposes given the locations of the buyer and the seller, under rules established in 2002, the UK has similar shareholding disposal exemptions to those of the Netherlands and the VZW Transaction would, therefore, not be taxable under standard UK tax rules were the US Group to be sold from the UK. Vodafone's tax affairs have been widely aired in the UK media over the last three years, since the firm reached a controversial deal with the Inland Revenue over outstanding tax liabilities. And here's the breakdown of the funds that will go to Vodafone investors: If you're a Vodafone customer, you may be pleased to hear that the company is committing \u00a36bn of its Verizon windfall towards a new programme called \" Project Spring\" (as in springing into action? Or as in happier days after a period of frostiness?) From its statement: Vodafone intends to implement a new organic investment programme, Project Spring, to establish further network and service leadership through additional investments of \u00a36 billion over the next three financial years. Fast FT have captured the first pronouncements from the CEOs of Vodafone and Verizon following their long-awaited $130bn deal (see 5.16pm) Verizon's Lowell McAdam: The timing was right to execute a transaction that benefits both companies and their shareholders. Today's announcement is a major milestone for Verizon, and we look forward to having full ownership of the industry leader in network performance, profitability and cash flow. Vodafone's Vittorio Colao: We are pleased that our long and successful partnership with Verizon will yield a significant return of value to our shareholders, rewarding them for their continuing support of Vodafone's investment strategy. Doubtless they'll both say more on press conferences this evening, but that gives a good flavour of how the mega-deal is being discussed. PS: Vodafone's statement is online here. It's official, Vodafone is selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for a cool $130bn. Verison has just announced that it has reached agreement to take full control of its wireless arm, a move which gives Vodafone a long-awaited windfall of around \u20ac100bn, or \u00a384bn. Here are the snaps from the Reuters terminal: \u2022 VERIZON REACHES AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE VODAFONE'S 45 PERCENT INTEREST IN VERIZON WIRELESS FOR $130 BILLION \u2022 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC SAYS VERIZON BOARD AUTHORIZES 2.9 PERCENT INCREASE IN QUARTERLY DIVIDEND \u2022 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC SAYS TRANSACTION EXPECTED TO BE IMMEDIATELY ACCRETIVE TO VERIZON'S EPS \u2022 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC SAYS TRANSACTION PROVIDES VERIZON WITH 100 PERCENT OWNERSHIP OF VERIZON WIRELESS \u2022 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC SAYS TRANSACTION WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF VERIZON AND VODAFONE \u2022 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC SAYS HAS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF 53 CENTS PER OUTSTANDING SHARE, AN INCREASE OF 1.5 CENTS PER SHARE \u2022 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC SAYS VERIZON WILL PAY VODAFONE $58.9 BILLION IN CASH As discussed earlier (see 1.39pm), EU commissioenr Neelie Kroes hopes that the deal could help drive Europe's telecoms industry. Vodafone, though, has just announced that it will return some $84bn of the windfall to its shareholders.... Britain's FTSE 100 has just posted its biggest points rise in almost two months, as investors cheered the strong performance by UK factories last month. The blue-chip index has closed 93 points higher at 6506, the biggest one-day increase since July 4. Other European markets also rose strongly, on optimism that the European economy was recovering. However, City analysts are urging caution tonight, given Europe's growth problem and the tension over America's plans to slow its economic stimulus plans. Here are the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 93.2 points at 6506, + 1.45% \u2022 German DAX: up 130 points at 8233, + 1.6% \u2022 French CAC: up 64 points at 3998, 1.6% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 300 points at 16988, +1.8% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 139 points at 8,429, +1.7% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, warns that the optimism could melt away as we ease into September, with Wall Street back in action tomorrow: Whenever the Americans are on holiday it always feels as if markets in Europe and the UK are enjoying a day off as well, in the knowledge that sobriety will return on the morrow. Helped by a burst of late sunshine however, the FTSE is putting in a solid performance today. Good Chinese data gave a lift to miners, but with so much US data coming up it is possible that we have now seen much of the excitement for this week. And Jessica Hinds of Capital Economics predicts that eurozone stock markets will soon fall back. She writes: There are at least three reasons why investors\u2019 enthusiasm for euro-zone equities has grown. First, the crisis in the region has shown little sign of flaring up again, in part due to the perceived \u201cbackstop\u201d provided by the ECB. Second, the economy is starting to grow for the first time in about a year and half. And third, valuations are attractive in an international context: the cyclically-adjusted price/earnings ratio of the non-financial sector was still only around 14 at the end of August, compared to 23 in the US. However, the recovery in the euro-zone is likely to be lacklustre at best, with rates of growth in many peripheral economies insufficient to ease debt burdens. We would therefore not be surprised to see euro-zone equities underperform US equities again before too long. A leaked report on the Cyprus bailout package from the country's lenders provides confirmation that the eurozone crisis is not yet over. The Financial Times and Reuters both got their hands on the latest draft Troika report on the Cypriot situation. It shows that Cyprus is still hitting the targets 'agreed' earlier this year, but also that serious problems need to be overcome. The FT has helpfully uploaded the whole report (click here to see it). Its top man in Brussels, Peter Spiegel, flags up that the Troika is playing hardball, and putting heavy pressure on Nicosia to meet its promises to restructure its largest bank and apply severe 'haircuts' to large deposit holders. He writes: The report makes clear the recapitalisation process of Bank of Cyprus has gone slower than Brussels would have liked, and now it has linked the cleaning up of the banking sector as the condition for two important Cypriot carrots. Jumbo-sized carrots, in fact. One is the eventual abolition of capital controls, and the other is Cyprus's next tranche of bailout funds. Reuters flags up that the Troika are concerned about \"delays and partial compliance\" from Cyprus over some structural reforms, although fiscal targets appear to be within reach. More here. Factory activity in Mexico rose last month, Markit reports: However we won't find out how the United States manufacturing sector performed until Tuesday, as it's Labour Day today. The Institute of Directors has blasted plans for a strike ballot at Royal Mail (see 1.54pm). Ripping into the unions like a dog might tackle a postman's trouser leg, the IoD claimed industrial action would be \"unjustified and irresponsible\", and would also hurt UK businesses. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the IoD, added: It would serve only to undermine the reputation of the Royal Mail at a time when the focus should be on making the most of the privatisation process. Leach urged the government to stand firm, and \"consider reaching out to all existing private providers in an effort to overcome trade union intransigence\" if necessary. That'll help.... As explained earlier, the CWU's position is that staff need and deserve proper protection before they enter the brave new world of private ownership. Back in the manufacturing sector, and Brazil's factory activity has shrunk again in August - but at a slower pace. The Brazilian manufacturing PMI came in at 49.4, an improvement on July's 48.5 but still below the 50-point that separates expansion from contraction. HSBC and Markit warned that conditions continue to deteriorate in Brazil -- again highlighting the problems in emerging markets (see also India this morning). Brazilian firms reported that new orders fell (unlike in the UK and eurozone last month), with exports also down. Key points: \u2022 PMI rises to 49.4, but remains in contraction territory \u2022 Output falls at marginal and slower pace \u2022 Incoming new work declines and firms reduce workforce numbers And here's more details from Phillip Inman from today's FSB briefing: There are concerns that new rules in the EU and US governing how banks are handled when they go bust will prove incompatible and trigger disputes between shareholders and bondholders in different jurisdictions. At its most basic level, the EU's recovery and resolution directive, which is scheduled to surface before the end of the year, could be incompatible with the Dodd Frank act and lead to cross border legal wrangles between bondholders in the two jurisdictions over how much to contribute to a bailout. Carney said the cultural barriers to developing compatible rules was also a problem.\"I think one of the key issues is developing mindsets of regulators and participants because this is new territory for many of them.\" Here's the seven key recommendations made by the Financial Stability Board to the G20 today (see 2.06pm) on how to tackle 'too big to fail' financial institutions: \u2022 Bring in new legislation by 2015 to create effective resolution regimes for every part of their financial sector that could cause systemic problems if they collapsed. \u2022 Give domestic authorities the power to share information and cooperate fully. \u2022 Take legislative action as necessary to make resolution effective in a cross-border context; \u2022 Address \"impediments to resolvability\" that arise from complexities in firms\u2019 legal, financial and operational structures; \u2022 Consider complementary domestic structural measures that help promote financial stability; \u2022 Implement policy measures for domestic systemically important banks; \u2022 Give supervisors enough resources and independence to meet their mandate. All sensible stuff. But nearly five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it's alarming that the problem isn't fixed..... More details on the FSB website The Financial Stability Board has warned members of the G20 that they need to do more to resolve the problem of financial institutions who are 'too big to fail'. The warning comes ahead of the G20 meeting later this week, where the Syria crisis will probably overshadow economic issues. Our economics correspondent Phillip Inman was at the Financial Stability Board press conference in London today. He reports that Mark Carney, the chair of the FSB (as an additional role to his day job running the Bank of England) warned leaders ahead of the G20 summit in St Petersburg that there was still much work needed to make banks safe. Phillip adds: Carney said a political consensus established after the financial crisis must be maintained or risks that taxpayers will pick up the tab for failed backs will continue to undermine stability. Some countries have been slow to implement new banking rules and insurers and other city institutions lag the banks in agreeing rules and creating buffer reserves against a potential crash. I'll pull together the FSB's key recommendations now.... Over at the UK Royal Mail, a national strike is looming over its planned privatisation. Union leaders have just announced that they will hold a strike ballot, in protest at the way the staff are being treated as the Royal Mail IPO approaches. Press Association has the details: Postal workers are to be balloted for national strikes over issues linked to the Government's controversial plans to privatise the Royal Mail. The Communication Workers Union said 125,000 of its members will vote in the coming weeks over pay, jobs, pensions and the impact of any sell-off, with the result due in early October. The first strike could be held on October 10 if there is a yes vote. The move is a major challenge to the planned privatisation, which ministers are expected to press ahead with in the coming months. The CWU wants to secure a new deal on terms and conditions before the post office passes into private hands, and says a strike is 'inevitable' otherwise. The UK's Department for Business, though, insists Posties are getting a good deal already. A spokesman said: [The CWU] are standing between their members and a generous pay offer of 8.6% over three years, which is more than teachers, nurses and our armed forces, who have had pay increases capped at 1%. One to watch.... Neelie Kroes, the EC commissioner, is excited by the news that Vodafone is on the brink of selling its stake in America's Verizon Wireless for an estimated $130bn (\u20ac100bn). She's asking her Twitter followers for ideas on how the money should be spent: At the risk of dashing Kroes's dreams, I fear answer \"I\" may be popular in the City. Crowd-sourcing corporate strategy on social media is a welcome development, though. Think of the management consulting fees that Vodafone could save.... Europe's stock markets have climbed steadily higher, driven by optimism that factories in the UK and eurozone are on the road to recovery. In London, the FTSE 100 is proudly showing a triple-digit gain, driven partly by mining firms such as Rio Tinto who would benefit from stronger economic growth. Mobile giant Vodafone has helped push the Footsie up 113 points to 6526, up 1.7%, as traders anticipate the official announcement that it has sold its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. Here's our latest story on the negotiations: Vodafone shares surge as it confirms talks over $130bn sale of Verizon Wireless (FT Alphaville flags up that the news (apparently) briefly leaked on Voda's website - see 11.57am in their Markets Live for this screengrab). Hugo Dixon of Breaking Views has also written a chunky piece about Vodafone's takeover exploits over the years: Dealmaker Returns Over its 31-year life, Vodafone has completed an astonishing series of deals. As so often with mergers and acquisitions, it has been a better seller than buyer. The same is likely to be the case with the Verizon deal. \"Today, it is not government bond spreads but emotions that are running high.\" So declared European Central Bank board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 this morning, in a speech to mark the one-year anniversary of the launch of the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme. C\u0153ur\u00e9 told an audience in Berlin that the crisis had been calmed by OMT \u2013 the ECB's pledge to buy unlimited quantities of government bonds if a country needed help. As he put it: One year after the inception of the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs), financial markets in the euro area are in much calmer conditions and fragmentation is receding. Yet, OMTs have created turmoil elsewhere: in the hallways of economics faculties, newspaper commentaries and, maybe, dinner tables across Europe; today, it is not government bond spreads but emotions that are running high. I'd be surprised if many European families have debated the merits of Mario Draghi's pet project over the Sunday roast or tapas (Mrs W invariably changes the subject, alas). Still, C\u0153ur\u00e9 argues that people should reflect on why OMT helped to ease fears of a eurozone break-up, even though it has not been activated. Here's his conclusion: OMTs are necessary from a monetary policy perspective; they were effective in counteracting the destructive market turmoil in the summer of last year; and they are designed in a way that overcomes the key concerns associated with government bond purchases by the central bank. OMTs are not just words: the ECB is fully prepared to use them. But even if euro area member states comply with the conditions, there is no automatism to activate OMTs. For the Governing Council of the ECB, there is only one single deciding criterion and that is the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. This overarching criterion has shaped the design of OMTs, and it will decide over its potential activation. Here's the full speech: Outright Monetary Transactions, one year on Less than three weeks to go until Germany goes to the polls, and the eurozone debt crisis continues to dominate the election. Last night, chancellor Angela Merkel and SPD challenger Peer Steinbr\u00fcck argued over Germany's handling of the crisis during a primetime live debate. Steinbr\u00fcck was deeply critical of Merkel's approach, saying her austerity message had driven bailed out countries into a \"vicious cycle\" of deepening debt and no growth. He also called for \"a new beginning\" for Germany, declaring: We\u2019ve been standing still for four years. A lot of things didn\u2019t get done. Merkel was defiant, saying Germany had tried to 'encourage' Europe's weaker members into making economic reforms. She also pointed out that the SPD had supported her in many key eurozone votes. This video shows some highlights: The German media were split over who won the debate. Snap polling this morning suggests an increase in support for Steinbr\u00fcck. Merkel, though, still holds a solid lead when peopel are asked who would make a 'good' chancellor. The invaluable Electionista rounds up the data: Time for a quick round-up of this morning's manufacturing data, so we can move onto other matters: \u2022 Britain's economic recovery appears to have picked up pace, after factory managers reported the biggest rise in new orders in almost 20 years. See 9.51am onwards for details and reaction. \u2022 The Eurozone manufacturing sector has also strengthened, with almost all countries reporting a rise in activity. This pushed factory activity across the euro area to a 26-month high (see 9.32am onwards). \u2022 Spain and Italy's factory sectors both returned to growth for the first time since 2011. And France was the only European country that didn't post an improved reading (see 8.33am onwards) \u2022 China's manufacturing PMI also showed encouraging signs, rising above the 50 no-change mark for the first time in four months... \u2022 ... India, though, slumped into contraction for the first time in over four years. (see 7.41am onwards) Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank is also cheered by the surge in UK manufacturing orders. He calls today's data \"the icing on the cake\" after a string of recent positive surveys. Like many in the City, Wood believes the Bank of England will not manage to leave interest rates unchanged for another three years. The economy appears to be running way ahead of the BoE\u2019s forecast from just last month of 0.5% qoq GDP growth in Q3 and Q4, which should strengthen the view of those MPC members that thought a first rate hike in late 2015 would be reasonable. However... For us the big picture is that the BoE under Mark Carney\u2019s leadership will err on the side of waiting too long before raising rates. Reaction to this morning's factory data continues to arrive. Nida Ali, economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, says Britain's manufacturing recovery appears to now be 'entrenched', adding: So far the strength in the recovery has been driven by household spending. But today's data confirms our view that, amid a more favourable global environment, the much-needed rebalancing of the economy, away from consumer spending and towards exports, is finally underway. UK government debt has fallen in value this morning, pushing up the yield (effectively the interest rate) on 10-year gilts to a new two-year high of 2.83%. Traders may be selling gilts on the back of this morning's strong factory data, calculating that the Bank of England won't launch another round of quantitative easing to stimulate the UK economy. British factories, after all, seem to be doing OK on their own... Here's our story on last month's revival in Britain's manufacturing sector. And here's a flavour, from economics editor Larry Elliott: After struggling during 2012, manufacturing has put on spurt since the spring of 2013, with the PMI above 50 \u2013 the cut off level between expansion and contraction \u2013 for the past five months. The PMI is made up of various measures of industrial level including orders, output, employment, stock levels and inflationary pressure. European stock markets have romped higher following the strong manufacturing growth in the UK (see 9.51am) and the eurozone (see 9.32am). In London, the FTSE 100 is up nearly 100 points, with mining stocks leading the charge. Other markets are showing similar gains, as investors begin September with a buying spree. Here's the situation in the main markets, a few minute ago: Markets had already been given a lift by China's manufacturing sector returning to growth overnight (7.41am). Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, says the Chinese data \"renewed hope over sustainable growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy\". A small beat on the corresponding Eurozone number and a decent upside surprise on the UK measure leant further impetus to the move, and with the US having pulled back from any immediate strike on Syria, market mood this morning is noticeably more upbeat. Sterling has risen sharply this morning, with the pound up almost three quarters of a cent against the US dollar at $1.558. Traders are encouraged by the strong data from British factories, which may make it harder for the Bank of England to follow its plan of keeping interest rates at 0.5% until 2016. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, explains: The data again are consistent with the resurge in UK economic activity on almost every facet, fuelling hopes the country has found its path to recovery. That being said, this does prompt many to question the BOE\u2019s forward guidance policy \u2013 if we continue seeing strong growth in the UK, the BOE will have to adjust the thresholds on monetary policy and may even have to hike rates earlier than anticipated. Amid the good news, UK firms are seeing \"a marked upsurge in cost inflationary pressures\". Factory bosses reported that commodities, feedstock, oil, paper, polymers and timber are all costing more, Markit said. That could mean higher prices for consumers - driving inflation up. And that could be awkward for Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows until the UK unemployment rate falls from 7.8% to 7%. A surge in new orders has helped Britain's factory sector post its strongest rise in activity in two and a half years. Markit's monthly survey of UK manufacturing output showed that British firms saw the fastest surge in output and new orders since 1994. That drove overall activity to its biggest rise since February 2011. Exporters said they saw stronger demand from the USA, China, mainland Europe, India, Scandinavia, Brazil and Ireland. Manufacturers in the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors all reported a strong rise in output, suggesting the recovery is pretty broad-based. And there is also good news for employees, with job creation rising for the fourth month running. This graph shows how activity in Britain's factories has improved steadily this year, to today's reading of 57.2 (up from July's 54.8). That's well over the 50-point mark that shows whether a sector grew or shrank. Rob Dobson of Markit said that UK\u2019s factories are \"booming again\". Orders and output are growing at the fastest rates for almost twenty years, as rising demand from domestic customers is being accompanied by a return to growth of our largest trading partner, the eurozone. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, agreed that the data showed Britain's recovery was gathering pace: Manufacturing maintained Q3 momentum to reach a two and a half year high thanks to the biggest jump in output and new orders in almost two decades. This boon was driven by strong domestic demand and accelerated growth in export orders; all of which area sign of growing confidence in the UK economy more broadly. Europe's manufacturing sector continues to show \"signs of recovery\", comments Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson. Here's his reaction to the news that eurozone factories posted their strongest growth in 26 months (see 9.32am for full details) Although gains are still only modest, companies reported the strongest improvement in business conditions for just over two years, with a pick up in new orders growth suggesting the upturn will be sustained into September. What\u2019s especially encouraging is that the upturn is broad-based, with PMIs rising in all countries with the exception of France, where business conditions have at least stabilised after the steep downturn reported earlier in the year. Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and Italy are now all seeing manufacturing grow at the fastest rates for at least two years, and even Greece saw a marked easing in the rate of manufacturing decline. Williamson says policymakers will be \"reassured\" by signs of a growing recovery but warns that many firms are still resisting hiring more staff. The fact that companies remain reluctant to take on staff [due to the need to cut costs to boost competitiveness and offset rising oil prices] suggests that there\u2019s a long way to go before the recovery feeds through to a meaningful job market improvement. It's official: The eurozone's manufacturing sector's recovery gathered pace in August. Factory bosses in almost every country across Europe reported that conditions improved last month. The conclusion of this morning's splurge of data (see 8.33am onwards) is that eurozone manufacturers have posted growth for the second month in a row. The final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI (based on interviews with thousands of 'purchasing managers' across the region ) surged to 51.4 in August. That's up from July's 50.3, and indicates solid growth after the long recession which ended in the last quarter. France was the only laggard, failing to post an improved PMI reading. Apart from France and Greece, every country posted a reading above 50 points -- which indicates a rise in activity. Factories benefitted from a decent rise in new orders. Markit reported that growth rates for production, new orders and new export business all accelerated to the fastest since May 2011. Here's a round-up of the key readings: Netherlands: 53.5. A 27-month high Austria: 52.0. An 18-month high Ireland: 52.0. A 9-month high Germany: 51.8. A 25-month high Italy: 51.3. A 27-month high Spain: 51.1. A 29-month high France: 49.7. Unchanged Greece: 48.7. A 44-month high Relief for Greece? Its manufacturing sector has posted its best (or least worst?) reading in almost four years. \"Vast improvements on the output and order books front\" helped Greece to report a manufacturing PMI of 48.7 in August. That shows that the sector kept shrinking, but at a much slower rate than July (when the PMI was measured at 47). At this rate, it could soon hit the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Markit said the data showed Greece only suffered a \"modest\" contraction last month. Manufacturers even reported a \"slight upturn\" in new orders from foreign clients. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, pointed out that the Greek manufacturing PMI has risen for seven of the last eight months. That suggests steady improvement, he argued: The most encouraging developments signalled by August\u2019s survey were a stable trend in new orders and a slight upturn in export sales. A repeat of this scenario next month is likely to halt the downturn in goods production, which is already showing signs of abating, and fuel belief that a recovery can get underway before the end of the year. However, the bad news is that Greek factories continued to cut jobs -- mirroring the trend seen in this morning's Italian and Spanish data. Some instant rection to the German manufacturing data: The powerhouse German manufacturing sector has posted its best PMI reading in 25 months, suggesting that Germany's economy is expanding steadily. Market reports that the German PMI index rose to 51.8 last month, showing a decent uptick. Slightly lower than analysts had expected, but the underlying message is that the sector kept growing last month. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said the good news kept \"rolling in\" for Germany, with firms reporting that work was piling up. Improvements in domestic sales and a rebound in export demand combined to generate the fastest expansion of output volumes since the middle of 2011. Increased production schedules could not prevent an accumulation of unfinished work for the first time in five months, which should stimulate job creation and investment spending as autumn approaches. Moore added: Overall, the latest figures provide a strong indication that manufacturing output will have a positive contribution to German GDP in the third quarter of 2013. No relief for France's factories in August. Markit reports that its manufacturing PMI was unchanged at 49.7, which indicates another small drop in activity. This graph shows how Italy's factory activity has suffered since the financial crisis began: More good news for Southern eurozone. Italy's factory activity has hit its highest level since May 2011. The Italian manufacturing PMI rose strongly to 51.3, which indicates solid growth after July's 50.4. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, explained: The recovery in Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector gathered pace in August, with both production and new orders rising to the largest degree since April 2011. Manufacturers\u2019 greatest success again came in export markets, sales in which provided a substantial boost to overall orders. However, as with Spain, there was no boost to the jobs market. Employment in the manufacturing sector dropped for the 25th month in a row, with firms reporting that they were achieving growth without having to raise staffing levels. As Markit put it: Despite recording sustained growth in output over the past three months, manufacturers maintained a preference for lower staffing numbers. The rate of job shedding in August was slightly faster than one month earlier, although still only moderate overall and slower than at the start of the year. City analysts are encouraged that Spain's factory output has finally risen after 27 months (see 8.33am), but disapppointed that firms continued to cut their workforce. Here's some instant reaction: Big News: Spain's manufacturing sector has returned to growth for the first time in 28 months, which will fuel optimism over Europe's recovery. However, factory owners continued to shed staff last month, despite the improving conditions, meaning no respite to the Spanish unemployment crisis. Markit reported that the Spanish purchasing managers index jumped to 51.1 in August. That's shows a return to growth for the first time since April 2011. After two grim years of recession, today's survey shows that Spain's manufacturers benefitted from a jump in exports. However, many responded by running down their stocks of finished goods rather than looking to hire new staff and increase production. This meant that employment fell at the fastest rate in four months. Here's Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit: The news from the Spanish manufacturing sector improved again in August, with PMI data highlighting a first rise in output for 28 months. As has been the case in recent months, exports were the key source of positive momentum as growth quickened sharply. Firms appear still to doubt the sustainability of the current improvements, however, opting to raise output only modestly and often using existing stocks to meet new order requirements. Reaction to follow.... Norway's manufacturing activity rose to a 17-month high, returning to growth: Factories in the Netherlands performed better in August, Markit reports. The Dutch manufacturing PMI has hit a 27-month high of 53.5 in August, up from July\u2019s 50.8. The news that China's manufacturing sector has returned to growth (see 7.41am) has sparked an early rally in Europe's stock markets. The FTSE 100 index jumped 79 points at the open to 6491, a rise of 1.2%. Other European trading floors are sharing the optimism: \u2022 German DAX: up 1.4% \u2022 French CAC: up 1.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 1.5% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 1.1% Russia's factories are battling to keep their heads above water, Markit reports. The Russian manufacturing PMI showed another monthly contraction, inching up to 49.4 from 49.2 (so still showing a drop in activity). Firms cut staffing levels again, in the face of a 'weak' rise in new orders. HSBC's chief economist, Alexander Morozov, commented: Overall, the PMI survey downplays the contraction concerns in manufacturing, which is good news taken in the context of very weak economic activity data in July. A crawling-style shaky growth seems to be the most plausible scenario for Russian manufacturing looking forward, we think, although there are also moderate risks of stagnation. Markit sums up the Asian situation in this tweet: Indonesia's manufacturing sector has suffered its worst month since May 2012, according to its PMI survey. The index tumbled into contraction territory in August with a reading of 48.5, down from July's 50.7. HSBC warned there was an \"overall deterioration\" in Indonesia's factory sector, with exports down and employment also declining. Su Sian Lim, ASEAN Economist at HSBC said: Weaker demand both domestically and externally appeared to be behind the worsening in manufacturing conditions in August. Elsewhere in Asia, there is little relief for South Korea, where factory conditions fell again. Its manufacturing PMI rose slightly to 47.5, up marginally from July\u2019s 47.2. But Taiwan's three month decline is over. Its manufacturing PMI was recorded at 50.0, which means the sector was flat. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the global economy, and the eurozone. A big morning for economic data has begun with encouraging news from China, and alarming signs from emerging markets. China's factory output rose in August for the first time in four months. HSBC and Markit's closely-watched manufacturing PMI survey, released this morning, rose to 50.1. That suggests a small rise in activity during August (any reading above 50 indicates growth), and is a stronger reading than July's 47.7. The survey also showed a small increase in new orders. However, the survey also found a drop in export orders, which HSBC blamed on \"weak client demand in Europe and the US\". Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist, said the data shows that China's manufacturing sector has begun to stabilise after a few rocky months, adding: We expect some upside surprises to China's growth in the coming months. However, today's PMI readings from India contained no such good news. Instead, its factory sector suffered its first contraction in four and a half years, adding to India's mounting problems. Market reported that India's manufacturing PMI slid to 48.5 in August, a drop from July's 50.1. This is the first reading below 50, indicating shrinking output, since March 2009. India's manufacturing sector had been stagnating for some months, as it suffered from a weakness in the global economy and problems at home. Today's data, though, shows that the situation worsened in August. with Indian factory bosses blaming fragile economic conditions and \"subdued client demand\". Alarmingly, export orders dropped for the first time in a year. Leif Eskesen, HSBC's chief economist for India, commented: Manufacturing activity contracted in August for the first time since March 2009. This was led by a decline in new orders, especially export orders. Indian firms also reported that their input prices rose, as the increasingly weak rupee pushed up the cost of imports. Some responded by hiking prices, which won't help efforts to bring Indian inflation under control.... So, a mixed picture. There's plenty more PMI data to come in the next few hours, including readings from across the Eurozone and the UK. I'll be tracking them here in the liveblog, along with other key developments through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "British mobile phone group Vodafone pulled off one of the biggest deals in corporate history on Monday\u2212 selling its stake in America's biggest mobile phone business for $130bn (\u00a384bn). More than \u00a354bn of the proceeds will be returned to Vodafone's shareholders \u2212 with \u00a322bn going to UK investors. Vodafone will also pour cash into its existing business to accelerate the rollout of superfast 4G broadband services across Europe. The deal \u2212 the third biggest transaction between two companies ever recorded \u2212 involves Vodafone selling its 45% shareholding in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications, which owns the other 55% of VW. It will end years of bickering between the two joint owners, who had tussled over the direction and control of Verizon Wireless, which was formed in 2000 and has since become the US's most profitable mobile carrier. Coming five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US which triggered the worldwide credit crunch, the deal also underlines the extent to which financial markets have recovered: $65bn of the cash Verizon is using to finance the deal is coming from four banks. Vodafone is one of the UK's most widely held shares and the huge return of cash was likened by some City sources to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme, which aims to boost the economy by electronic money printing. As many as 500,000 private shareholders in the UK who own up to \u00a310,000 of shares each could be in line for payments of up to \u00a34,000, a windfall that will be tax-free as long as it is invested through an individual savings account (ISA) or pension fund. Cash returned to pension funds is likely to be immediately reinvested in the stockmarket, which could drive share prices higher. The deal was thrashed out by the chief executives of the two companies on Saturday morning and rubber stamped by the directors of the UK and US businesses on Sunday and Monday. The details were released last night after the stock exchange had closed. Vodafone plans to invest \u00a36bn over the next three years on updating its own mobile and fixed networks and opening more high street stores. It will also use the proceeds to pay off debt to arm itself for further investments in Europe and emerging markets. Vittorio Colao, Vodafone's chief executive, insisted it was \"not a retreat in any way\" from the US, but declined to discuss what interest he might have in US businesses in future. He paid tribute to Chris Gent, the former Vodafone chief executive who led the move into the US: \"He had a great idea.\" It is unclear exactly how much profit Vodafone has made from the deal, but it is tens of billions of pounds. In what could become a controversial element of the deal Vodafone will not have to pay any UK tax on the deal \u2212 even though it had insisted for years that it could not exit from the prickly relationship with Verizon Communications because it would have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) at 40%. But a company tax law introduced by Gordon Brown in 2002 governing the sale of substantial shareholdings means that Vodafone was never liable for CGT. Vodafone's stake in the US business is owned by a Dutch holding company \u2212 similar rules on CGT apply in the Netherlands. It will, however, pay about $5bn in US taxes. \"This transaction happened in the Netherlands, but even if it had happened in the UK there would be no tax liability,\" Colao said as the deal was closed. He insisted it was a completely different situation to the rows that have broken out over Google's and Amazon's tax arrangements. The terms of the deal will give Vodafone almost $60bn in cash, and another $60bn in Verizon Communications shares, together with $11bn from smaller transactions related to businesses it owns. The Verizon sale is not the first time Vodafone has pulled off a gigantic deal. It also made the world's biggest ever deal in 2000 when it made a hostile takeover of German industrial and mobile conglomerate Mannesmann for $200bn (\u00a3112bn at the time). However, the UK group had to write off the acquisition six years later \u2212 which at the time resulted in the UK's biggest ever corporate loss of \u00a323.5bn. The years-long struggle to control Verizon Wireless was likened by Benedict Evans, technology analyst at Enders Analysis, to \"two pythons swallowing the same pig from opposite ends. Noses meet in the middle and neither can go forward or back\". Solving the tax quandary, along with a rise in Verizon's offer from $100bn to $130bn, finally shifted Vodafone \u2212 and meant that Verizon Communications could swallow its namesake whole. Over the past 20 years Vodafone has expanded aggressively to more than 30 countries across Europe, Africa and Asia. But without the US business, it will be more reliant on its European business, as well as being less profitable.",

      "standfirst": "Leading shares boosted by signs of recovery in global economy and confirmation of $130bn mobile phone deal", 
      "body": "<p>Call it the US holiday effect.</p> <p>On Labor Day, with Wall Street closed, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has recorded its biggest daily points rise since July 4, another American break from work.</p> <p>The index closed 93.26 points higher at 6506.19, its best level for two weeks. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG said:</p> <blockquote> Whenever the Americans are on holiday it always feels as if markets in Europe and the UK are enjoying a day off as well, in the knowledge that sobriety will return on the morrow. Helped by a burst of late sunshine however, the FTSE is putting in a solid performance today. But with so much US data coming up [including non-farm payrolls on Friday] it is possible that we have now seen much of the excitement for this week. </blockquote> <p>Several factors were behind the rise, not least positive manufacturing data for August from, first China, then the eurozone and UK. On top of that the easing of fears of an imminent attack on Syria also helped sentiment.</p> <p>A $130bn deal for <strong>Vodafone</strong> to sell its US wireless business to joint venture partner Verizon - confirmed after the UK market closed - also gave support. Vodafone finished 6.95p higher at 213.2p, adding 13 points to the leading index.</p> <p>Still with telecoms, <strong>BT</strong> was 12.9p better at 338.2p as Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating and 350p price target ahead of the group's second quarter results in October. BT has spent heavily on sports rights to boost its consumer offering and take on BSkyB, and Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> We reiterate our outperform rating on BT as we look forward to a key quarter for the company. We see BT's second quarter update as the first chance to assess the potential impact (direct and indirect) of BT's content strategy on its underlying business. As a result, key fibre and line loss performance indicators are likely to prove more interesting than the financials. <br> </blockquote> <p>With Chinese manufacturing expanding last month at its fastest pace in more than a year - the PMI index rose to 51 from 50.3 - mining shares were among the main gainers. <strong>Anglo American </strong>added 57.5p to \u00a315.36, <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rose 122p to \u00a330.35 and <strong>Antofagasta</strong> climbed 30.5p to 885.5p.</p> <p>But Mexican precious metal miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> fell 28p to \u00a312.75 after UBS moved from buy to neutral:</p> <blockquote> We continue to like Fresnillo's low cost position, growth profile, low corporate governance and country risk and strong balance sheet.

      "bodyText": "Call it the US holiday effect. On Labor Day, with Wall Street closed, the FTSE 100 has recorded its biggest daily points rise since July 4, another American break from work. The index closed 93.26 points higher at 6506.19, its best level for two weeks. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG said: Whenever the Americans are on holiday it always feels as if markets in Europe and the UK are enjoying a day off as well, in the knowledge that sobriety will return on the morrow. Helped by a burst of late sunshine however, the FTSE is putting in a solid performance today. But with so much US data coming up [including non-farm payrolls on Friday] it is possible that we have now seen much of the excitement for this week. Several factors were behind the rise, not least positive manufacturing data for August from, first China, then the eurozone and UK. On top of that the easing of fears of an imminent attack on Syria also helped sentiment. A $130bn deal for Vodafone to sell its US wireless business to joint venture partner Verizon - confirmed after the UK market closed - also gave support. Vodafone finished 6.95p higher at 213.2p, adding 13 points to the leading index. Still with telecoms, BT was 12.9p better at 338.2p as Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating and 350p price target ahead of the group's second quarter results in October. BT has spent heavily on sports rights to boost its consumer offering and take on BSkyB, and Credit Suisse said: We reiterate our outperform rating on BT as we look forward to a key quarter for the company. We see BT's second quarter update as the first chance to assess the potential impact (direct and indirect) of BT's content strategy on its underlying business. As a result, key fibre and line loss performance indicators are likely to prove more interesting than the financials. With Chinese manufacturing expanding last month at its fastest pace in more than a year - the PMI index rose to 51 from 50.3 - mining shares were among the main gainers. Anglo American added 57.5p to \u00a315.36, Rio Tinto rose 122p to \u00a330.35 and Antofagasta climbed 30.5p to 885.5p. But Mexican precious metal miner Fresnillo fell 28p to \u00a312.75 after UBS moved from buy to neutral: We continue to like Fresnillo's low cost position, growth profile, low corporate governance and country risk and strong balance sheet. As a result we believe the stock deserves to trade at a premium to its precious metal peers. However, it now looks expensive trading on a 12 month forward PE of 36 times versus historical average of 21 times ...... the valuation now looks full and this is likely to limit upside from current levels unless we see a material upside to gold and silver prices. But Serco, slammed last week by government over a prison escort contract, was steady at 547.5p after UBS and Jefferies both cut their target prices. The outsourcing group could lose its place in the FTSE 100 at next week's reshuffle. With oil prices easing from recent highs, Royal Dutch Shell A shares slipped 12.5p to \u00a320.75 and BP dipped 0.65p to 445.5pp. But Tullow Oil put on 10p to \u00a310.18 despite another drilling disappointment.

Mike Ashley's retailing group - which was recently found to employ 90% of its staff on so-called zero hour contracts - has seen its share price jump more than 70% this year as it boosts profits and takes market share from struggling rivals. Meanwhile Greek bottling group Coca Cola Hellenic, which listed its shares in London earlier this year, is now eligible to join the UK indices and is large enough to move straight into the FTSE 100.

      "bodyText": "The chair of an influential select committee has called on HMRC officials and Treasury ministers to urgently examine an \u00a384bn deal being brokered by Vodafone that is expected to avoid paying UK taxes. Margaret Hodge, head of the public accounts committee, expressed concerns following confirmation that the British telecoms company is on the brink of a deal to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless. Reports claim that the firm will not have to pay any tax in Britain because it will take place through a Dutch holding company. Vodafone has confirmed it is in \"advanced discussions\" to sell its stake for $130bn (\u00a384bn), with reports suggesting what will be one of the biggest corporate deals ever will be announced later on Monday. Hodge told the Guardian that HMRC officials should intervene at the earliest opportunity. \"HMRC must begin an absolutely thorough investigation to make sure that UK taxpayers receive the maximum to which they are entitled,\" she said. She added that Treasury ministers should also examine whether there is a loophole being exploited by the British company. \"If there is a flaw in the law, it needs to be addressed by Treasury ministers urgently,\" she said. Tax analysts believe Vodafone can structure its deal so as to reduce tax to $5bn, significantly less than the $40bn that could be due. Under the terms of the deal, Vodafone would sell the US-registered company \u2013 through which it owns Verizon Wireless shares and a number of its European assets \u2013 to Verizon Communications. The European assets would then be sold back to Vodafone, minimising the tax bill. Robert Peston, the BBC's business editor, is among a number of commentators who have claimed that tax officials will not be entitled to any of the proceeds because the deal would involve the sale of a stake in a US group, whose holding company is in the Netherlands. Vodafone could also take advantage of UK legislation known as substantial shareholdings exemption, which means companies do not have to pay capital gains tax on profits made from selling shares in another firm. If the deal goes through it will be the second most valuable corporate deal ever completed by a UK company, after Vodafone's own takeover of Mannesmann of Germany in 2000. Company sources have argued that tens of billions of pounds could be paid out to UK investors, which would be a significant injection of cash into the economy, similar to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme. Investors would also have to pay tax on it. It is understood that the the stake in Verizon has been held in Vodafone's Netherlands business since it was bought in 1999. Hodge could well raise the deal at a select committee meeting this afternoon when MPs are due to question HMRC officials over the use of 0845 numbers on advice lines for taxpayers. It would not be the first time that Hodge and the committee have clashed with HMRC over the use of tax loopholes by Vodafone. The committee issued scathing criticisms of a \"sweetheart\" deal brokered by HMRC officials with the telecoms giant over the Mannesmann deal. Dave Hartnett, the former head of tax, was accused of letting Vodafone forgo a reported \u00a36.75bn in tax when settling a longstanding dispute with the company. The dispute began in 2000 when Vodafone acquired the German engineering company and mobile phone operator. A deal was settled in July 2010, which, according to those with knowledge of it, included estimates of future profits for Vodafone for the years 2011 and 2012. There was no implication that Vodafone had done anything wrong whilst completing the Mannesmann deal. In a brief statement, the telecoms giant confirmed that a Verizon Wireless deal is on the table: \"Vodafone confirms that it is in advanced discussions with Verizon Communications Inc regarding the disposal of Vodafone's US group whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless for $130bn.\" \"The consideration would substantially comprise a mixture of Verizon common stock and cash.\" AN HMRC spokesman said they could not comment on the affairs of an individual business.",

    "webTitle": "Funding for Lending Scheme stalls in first year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A flagship Bank of England scheme to increase the flow of cheap finance to credit-starved businesses has resulted in no increase in lending in its first year. Threadneedle Street said that despite having access to billions of pounds of subsidised credit since the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) was launched in the summer of 2012 net lending by banks and other financial institutions taking part in the scheme had fallen slightly. The results of the Bank's quarterly survey show a small increase in lending during the second quarter of 2013 but the \u00a31.6bn increase was insufficient to make up for the cumulative \u00a33.9bn fall in the previous three quarters. Under the scheme, UK financial institutions can obtain funding from the Bank of England at lower cost provided they pass on the benefits to households and firms. When the FLS was launched, ministers were particularly keen to find ways of providing credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) but the evidence suggests that the cheap funds have found their way into the mortgage market. The Bank's overall figures for business lending \u2013 including both FLS and non-FLS participants \u2013 show that lending to SMEs continued to decline in the second quarter, although less rapidly than previously. Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank of England, said: \"The FLS is continuing to support lending to the UK economy with a range of indicators suggesting that credit conditions are steadily improving for households and firms, and FLS participants collectively expect net lending volumes to pick up over the remainder of this year.\" Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, commented: \"The Funding for Lending Scheme has bathed the mortgage market in cheaper credit, but has left the SME market parched and arid. Although net lending is flat, banks have used the scheme to lower mortgage rates, ease criteria and introduce a wider choice of loans, which has prised open the first-time buyer market and sent house prices skywards. \"Gross mortgage lending has recovered to its pre-financial crisis levels, and looks set to remain strong. House purchase lending is 30% higher than last year and the number of loans could hit 70,000 per month by the end of the year. The scheme has done wonders for the housing market, but the main point of it was to provide credit to SMEs, who are starved of funding and can't grow.\"",

      "body": "<p>A flagship Bank of England scheme to increase the flow of cheap finance to credit-starved businesses has resulted in no increase in lending in its first year.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street said that despite having access to billions of pounds of subsidised credit since the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) was launched in the summer of 2012 net lending by banks and other financial institutions taking part in the scheme had fallen slightly.</p> <p>The results of the Bank's quarterly survey show a small increase in lending during the second quarter of 2013 but the \u00a31.6bn increase was insufficient to make up for the cumulative \u00a33.9bn fall in the previous three quarters.</p> <p>Under the scheme, UK financial institutions can obtain funding from the Bank of England at lower cost provided they pass on the benefits to households and firms.</p> <p>When the FLS was launched, ministers were particularly keen to find ways of providing credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) but the evidence suggests that the cheap funds have found their way into the mortgage market.</p> <p>The Bank's overall figures for business lending \u2013 including both FLS and non-FLS participants \u2013 show that lending to SMEs continued to decline in the second quarter, although less rapidly than previously.</p> <p>Paul Fisher, executive director for markets at the Bank of England, said: \"The FLS is continuing to support lending to the UK economy with a range of indicators suggesting that credit conditions are steadily improving for households and firms, and FLS participants collectively expect net lending volumes to pick up over the remainder of this year.\"</p> <p>Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, commented: \"The Funding for Lending Scheme has bathed the mortgage market in cheaper credit, but has left the SME market parched and arid. Although net lending is flat, banks have used the scheme to lower mortgage rates, ease criteria and introduce a wider choice of loans, which has prised open the first-time buyer market and sent house prices skywards.</p> <p>\"Gross mortgage lending has recovered to its pre-financial crisis levels, and looks set to remain strong. House purchase lending is 30% higher than last year and the number of loans could hit 70,000 per month by the end of the year. The scheme has done wonders for the housing market, but the main point of it was to provide credit to SMEs, who are starved of funding and can't grow.\"</p>",

The problems created by the end of the investment side of the mining boom, the structural decline of the manufacturing sector, and the high value of the dollar unfortunately will not go away just because the election is over. To grasp the change in our economy in the past decade, you only need to compare the growth in the capital expenditure of the mining and manufacturing industries. Up till 2005 the expenditure in both was roughly the same, then once the minerals price boom kicked in, expenditure in the mining sector exploded. In the June quarter of this year the level of expenditure was around 612% above what it was in March 2005. By contrast, in the manufacturing sector, capital expenditure in the most recent quarter is around 27% below the level of March 2005. The latest data capital expenditure showed that while the mining boom is over, that doesn\u2019t mean investment in the industry is over. It remains high and has stabilised somewhat after a drop at the end of last year and the start of 2013. But the manufacturing side remains depressing reading. The sharp declines have largely occurred in the past two years. The value of the dollar in 2011 and 2012 pretty much destroyed any chance of increasing investment. But when we look at these two sectors it\u2019s easy for economists to be fixated on numbers and forget about people. Rather like the narrator in Banjo Paterson\u2019s \u201cClancy of the Overflow\u201d economists and commentators like myself get caught in \u201cthe round eternal of the cash-book and the journal\u201d. When this occurs we note that since March 2005 the manufacturing sector has lost 92,000 jobs, but in the same period mining sector jobs have increased by 145,000.
