      "bodyText": "One Sunday in September 2008, the world waited for the expected rescue of Lehman Brothers by the US Treasury. It didn't happen. When no buyer could be found, the plug was pulled on the investment bank. The assumption that Lehman was too small to matter proved wrong \u2013 disastrously wrong. Unless Europe wishes to compound the follies of the past week, the Lehman precedent will surely be borne in mind at the talks on Sunday to piece together a bailout for Cyprus \u2013 the fifth in the eurozone in less than three years. Those who say the monetary union has been a success must have an interesting definition of failure. The Cypriot storm came as a shock to Europe's policy elite. The assumption has been growing for the past few months that the crisis was over, which was true to the extent that the existential threat to the euro has greatly diminished. Financial markets were soothed by the pledge by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), to do \"whatever it takes\" to safeguard the euro, but life was not really returning to normal. The rest of the eurozone knew Cyprus was festering away, but considered the country too inconsequential to worry much about. Meanwhile, complacency set in and there was no longer the urgency to make rapid progress on the economic and political integration necessary to underpin monetary union. Europe lapsed back into its default mode: muddling through. That was a mistake, because the problems of a country that accounts for just 0.2% of eurozone GDP have highlighted two structural weaknesses of the monetary union. Firstly, it contains far too many countries that should not really be in the club, and were allowed in only because politics was permitted to trump economics. The fact that Cyprus was an offshore tax haven was ignored, just as a blind eye was turned to Greece's lack of competitiveness and Italy's high level of public debt. This lack of cohesion can no longer be overlooked, and making the euro work will require a far greater centralisation of power. In reality, that means countries such as Greece, Spain, Italy and indeed Cyprus taking orders from Germany, and accepting they have the status of regions rather than sovereign states. This would be hard to stomach for these proud nations, even in good times. The fact that these are seriously bad times for Europe is the second big problem facing the single currency, because while finance ministers and central ministers have been preening themselves on \"ending\" the threat to the monetary union, the crisis was clearly not over for those eurozone citizens affected by slow growth, rising unemployment and painful austerity programmes. This meant most of them, since the weakness that started on the euro's fringes has since spread to the core nations. France is in a poor state, as is the Netherlands, and even Germany is starting to suffer. Predictably, comparisons are being made between Europe today and Japan 20 years ago. Europe does indeed seem to share some of Japan's traits: an ageing population, a dysfunctional financial system and an inability to grow. The history of the past 150 years shows that most recessions are over within a year and few last longer than two. Europe's downturn is five years old and shows no immediate sign of ending. Nor, unlike in the US and the UK, is there any sense of the ECB taking any policy initiatives that might boost growth. As David Owen, an economist at Jefferies investment bank, noted last week there have been few examples of recessionary conditions becoming ingrained, but Europe seems to be one of the special cases. There is a European precedent for the current crisis, although it is not one the continent likes to be recall. A paper called Till Debt Do Us Part, by Bob Swarup and Dario Perkins of Lombard Street research, says there are direct parallels between Europe now and Europe in the 1920s, only with the roles reversed. Today it is Germany that is imposing austerity on the weak countries on the euro's periphery, at a time when they have no easy way out due to their membership of a fixed exchange-rate system. Back in the 1920s, Germany was in a similar position to the Mediterranean countries today. It had financed the first world war through excessive borrowing and was then forced to pay reparations by the allies, with France in particular insisting on draconian conditions. Membership of the Gold Standard meant there was no escape. When the Wall Street crash struck in October 1929, the dogged determination of Germany \u2013 fresh from the hyperinflation of 1923 \u2013 to stay on the Gold Standard meant it felt the full blast of the deflationary storm coming out of the US. Swarup and Perkins note: \"The German government, bowing to international pressure, haunted by fears of hyperinflation and facing reparations linked to gold, refused to either default on its debt or devalue its currency by suspending membership of the Gold Standard. Instead it adopted brutal austerity policies, much like those it is now forcing on the Mediterranean countries. \"This compounded the country's economic misery and sent unemployment surging higher. It pushed the economy into what today we might call a Greek-style austerity/depression trap.\" A straight read across from the interwar years to 2013 is too simplistic. Europe's population is older and welfare provision more extensive, even in the countries where austerity is biting hardest. Slow to act it may be, but the ECB is there to ensure financial stability across the eurozone. Even so, the growing popularity of antiestablishment parties is a warning. The same toxic mix of economic hardship, political impotence and resentment at outside interference that was evident in Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s is again present. Swarup and Perkins rightly warn it is vital that the economic lessons of the 1930s are remembered. There will need to be debt relief rather than restructuring, a realisation that aggressive fiscal austerity is a mistake when exchange rates are fixed, and a much more activist approach by the ECB to provide a growth stimulus. The longer the depression lasts the stronger extremist forces will become and the greater the risk that one or more countries will decide to leave the single currency because they cannot tolerate the economic distress, the social unrest and the political instability. Germany, of all nations, should understand this.",

    "webTitle": "Farewell to the FSA \u2013 and the bleak legacy of the light-touch regulator", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was the watchdog that didn't bark. When the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was created in its current form by Gordon Brown, it was modelled on the all-powerful US regulators, but it is likely that it will be remembered for only thing: presiding over the near-meltdown of the UK's banking system. In its short life, the FSA failed to rein in the banks, and even encouraged the City to explode in the mid-2000s with a \"light touch\" approach to regulation. It did not notice that Northern Rock was built on such shaky foundations that it could easily run out of money, and failed to prevent the takeover of ABN Amro by RBS just as the credit crunch was biting in late 2007. By this time next week the FSA, which was set up in 1997, will be entering its final hours. The blue-and-white sign hanging inside its low-rise Canary Wharf headquarters will be taken down and a new white-and-maroon logo bearing the initials FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) put up in its place. At the same time, in the City, just a few metres away from the Bank of England, another new regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), will be preparing to be officially opened by chancellor George Osborne. Tearing up the FSA \u2013 which united the nine regulators that had existed before Labour was swept to power in 1997 \u2013 was one of the first key policy announcements by Osborne after the May 2010 election. But it has taken almost three years \u2013 much longer than expected \u2013 after he first pledged to disband Brown's regulator to fulfil the vision to create two new ones \u2013 the PRA (a subsidiary of the Bank of England to ensure banks have enough capital and liquidity) and the FCA (essentially charged with putting consumers at the heart of the matter when dealing with financial regulation). Both formally begin operating on 2 April, although in practice the separation has already taken place. When the FSA was created, the Bank of England was reeling from the collapse of Barings two years earlier. Paul Edmondson, a financial services partner at law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, reckons that at the time the FSA was a \"sensible idea\" to replace the array of organisations with acronyms such as Imro and Fimbra that policed the City in a form of self-regulation. While the FSA's legacy seems likely to be the banking crash, Kevin Burrowes, UK head of financial services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, acknowledges that the watchdog was not alone in missing the warning signs. \"It's not apparent that any regulator from around the world can stand up and say they did a great job over this period,\" he says. Even before Osborne announced the breakup of the FSA, changes to the philosophy of regulation were already under way following stinging criticism \u2013 including some from damning internal reviews \u2013 in the wake of the crisis. Lord Turner, who leaves on Monday, was installed as chairman just as the trouble started in September 2008, while insider Hector Sants had been promoted to chief executive just months before the run on Northern Rock a year earlier. In the fallout from the crisis, they set about changing what Sants's predecessor, John Tiner, had described as principles-based approach to regulation. In 2006, reflecting the mood of the time, Tiner said: \"Firms' managements \u2013 not their regulators \u2013 are responsible for identifying and controlling risks. A more principles-based approach allows them increased scope to choose how they go about this. In short, the use of principles is a more grown-up approach to regulation than one that relies on rules.\" But by 2009, Sants was saying, damningly: \"A principles-based approach does not work with individuals who have no principles.\" Meanwhile, Turner was outlining to MPs what he saw as a major problem, telling the Treasury select committee: \"It was not the function of the regulator to cast questions over overall business strategy of the institutions \u2026 You may find that surprising.\" Thankfully, the new regulators are now being encouraged to be more curious and ask more questions. Andrew Bailey \u2013 who was brought in to run the PRA after Sants stunned the City by bowing out last year \u2013 has already begun to adopt a more intrusive approach to regulation for the 300 major financial institutions he is overseeing. Meanwhile, Martin Wheatley, the new head of FCA, unveiled his strategy last week and made clear that two \"C\"s would be important. The \"C\" in his new logo had a white flash through the maroon to \"shine a torch\" on consumers, Wheatley said. But the \"C\" could equally stand for \"competition\", the new and untested mandate the former London Stock Exchange executive, who was running the Hong Kong regulator during the financial crisis, has been given. Wheatley's FCA will also hand out fines \u2013 continuing the investigations into Libor-rigging, for example \u2013 and police the markets. The coalition has also set up a financial policy committee inside the Bank of England \u2013 a bit like the monetary policy committee which oversees interest rates \u2013 to look for the next bombshell that might hit the financial system. It is the clearest illustration of how the approach to regulation is changing: this week it is scheduled to unveil the results of three-pronged review of bank capital that could reveal a hole of \u00a360bn \u2013 although its powers of intervention are yet to be tested. The FSA is leaving some unfinished business: the report into the near-collapse of HBOS is still to be published. But as the doors shut for the last time, remarks by its first boss Sir Howard Davies remain prescient. When he bowed out in 2003, Davies said: \"The biggest disappointment of my time at the FSA has been the failure of firms, and particularly their senior management, to learn the lessons of past mis-selling \u2026\" He was not referring to payment protection insurance, but that latest mis-selling scandal has proved to be the industry's costliest yet at \u00a312bn. Wheatley's FCA has power to prevent a repeat of such scandals by banning the sale of unsuitable products. Other issues may take priority, however. As he outlined his strategy on Thursday, Wheatley made no secret of his concern about potential for contagion in the eurozone \u2013 and this weekend it is clear why, as Cyprus scrambles to secure a bailout and reopen its banks. So it may not be too long before the new watchdogs have to show their teeth \u2013 and prove they can actually bark.",

Paul Edmondson, a financial services partner at law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, reckons that at the time the FSA was a \"sensible idea\" to replace the array of organisations with acronyms such as Imro and Fimbra that policed the City in a form of self-regulation.</p> <p>While the FSA's legacy seems likely to be the banking crash, Kevin Burrowes, UK head of financial services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, acknowledges that the watchdog was not alone in missing the warning signs. \"It's not apparent that any regulator from around the world can stand up and say they did a great job over this period,\" he says.</p> <p>Even before Osborne announced the breakup of the FSA, changes to the philosophy of regulation were already under way following stinging criticism \u2013 including some from damning internal reviews \u2013 in the wake of the crisis. Lord Turner, who leaves on Monday, was installed as chairman just as the trouble started in September 2008, while insider Hector Sants had been promoted to chief executive just months before the run on Northern Rock a year earlier.</p> <p>In the fallout from the crisis, they set about changing what Sants's predecessor, John Tiner, <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2006/1013_jt.shtml\" title=\"\">had described as principles-based approach to regulation</a>. In 2006, reflecting the mood of the time, Tiner said: \"Firms' managements \u2013 not their regulators \u2013 are responsible for identifying and controlling risks. A more principles-based approach allows them increased scope to choose how they go about this. In short, the use of principles is a more grown-up approach to regulation than one that relies on rules.\"</p> <p>But by 2009, Sants was saying, damningly: \"<a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2009/0312_hs.shtml\" title=\"\">A principles-based approach does not work with individuals who have no principles.</a>\" Meanwhile, Turner was outlining to MPs what he saw as a major problem, telling the Treasury select committee: \"It was not the function of the regulator to cast questions over overall business strategy of the institutions \u2026 You may find that surprising.\"</p> <p>Thankfully, the new regulators are now being encouraged to be more curious and ask more questions. Andrew Bailey \u2013 who was brought in to run the PRA after Sants stunned the City by bowing out last year \u2013 has already begun to adopt a more intrusive approach to regulation for the 300 major financial institutions he is overseeing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Martin Wheatley, the new head of FCA, unveiled his strategy last week and made clear that two \"C\"s would be important. The \"C\" in his new logo had a white flash through the maroon to \"shine a torch\" on consumers, Wheatley said. But the \"C\" could equally stand for \"competition\", the new and untested mandate the former London Stock Exchange executive, who was running the Hong Kong regulator during the financial crisis, has been given.</p> <p>Wheatley's FCA will also hand out fines \u2013 continuing the investigations into Libor-rigging, for example \u2013 and police the markets.</p> <p>The coalition has also set up a financial policy committee inside the Bank of England \u2013 a bit like the monetary policy committee which oversees interest rates \u2013 to look for the next bombshell that might hit the financial system. It is the clearest illustration of how the approach to regulation is changing: this week it is scheduled to unveil the results of three-pronged review of bank capital that could reveal a hole of \u00a360bn \u2013 although its powers of intervention are yet to be tested.</p> <p>The FSA is leaving some unfinished business: the report into the near-collapse of HBOS is still to be published. But as the doors shut for the last time, remarks by its first boss Sir Howard Davies remain prescient. When he bowed out in 2003, <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2003/sp141.shtml\" title=\"\">Davies said</a>: \"The biggest disappointment of my time at the FSA has been the failure of firms, and particularly their senior management, to learn the lessons of past mis-selling \u2026\"</p> <p>He was not referring to payment protection insurance, but that latest mis-selling scandal has proved to be the industry's costliest yet at \u00a312bn. Wheatley's FCA has power to prevent a repeat of such scandals by banning the sale of unsuitable products.</p> <p>Other issues may take priority, however. As he outlined his strategy on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/21/financial-conduct-authority-raising-fines-will-not-change\" title=\"\">Wheatley made no secret of his concern about potential for contagion in the eurozone</a> \u2013 and this weekend it is clear why, as Cyprus scrambles to secure a bailout and reopen its banks. So it may not be too long before the new watchdogs have to show their teeth \u2013 and prove they can actually bark.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A friend in the \"penny off a pint\" pub told me on budget evening that the economy was rebalancing well. \"In my high street it is rebalancing towards betting shops, fried chicken outlets, pawn shops, Poundland and payday loans,\" he said. \"And do you know what the payday loan shops advertise themselves with? 'The banks won't give it to you, but we will'.\" Yes, and at what rates of interest! The \"penny off\" reminded me of budgets of the old days, but in this day and age it was a wonderful jape on the part of a government that thinks we all drink too much. Perhaps they have finally got the point that in the face of an increasingly irrational economic policy, the public just wants to drown its sorrows. Sorry, did I say \"irrational\"? It may be irrational to us Keynesians, but we must never forget that Osborne's budgets are based on a political strategy that assumes the general public is gullible enough to accept indefinitely the misleading propaganda that our economic troubles are caused entirely by the profligacy of the last government, and the fallacy that when the private sector cuts back then so must the public sector. You would not believe, to listen to this most dangerous of chancellors, that the so-called \"structural deficit\" inherited by the coalition in 2010 was no worse than the one inherited by Labour in 1997. Gordon Brown and Ed Balls may have made the mistake of paying too much heed to the likes of George Osborne and thus placing faith in the financial sector that let everybody down, but they did not cause the worldwide collapse of bank lending in 2008-09 that precipitated the great recession and the first annual decline in world trade since the 1930s. One's concern until recently was that the coalition had been getting away with its misrepresentation of causes, effects and required solutions; also, until recently, that while being very effective in criticising the government, Labour appears to have given the impression to most people that it does not have much of an alternative. \"They would cut, but more slowly\" has been the general view. To judge from the standard of debate on the BBC's Question Time the day after the budget, Labour still has an uphill struggle to get across the fundamental point that it is not the borrowing that is the problem, but the prolonged depression and the way that the multiplier effects of budget cuts make the situation worse and hold back the recovery. Output in this country is some 15% below what it would have been on past trends, and it is not true that the potential for economic growth in this country has come to a halt. What has come to a halt is the application of the lessons of the interwar years that governments have the fiscal tools at their disposal to revive demand. In a sense this government is getting the worst of both worlds: it is excoriated by the right for continuing to borrow, yet its failure to boost demand and borrow more means that it is not taking the necessary action to provide what the governor-in-waiting of the Bank of England calls \"escape velocity\". Mark Carney refers to monetary policy, but what monetary policy and the government's reluctant toleration of higher-than-intended borrowing have essentially achieved is not growth, but stabilisation at a depressed level. Now there were some good, Heseltinian \"supply side\" efforts in the budget \u2013 we can pass over the chaos of the chancellor's housing measures \u2013 but, in macroeconomic policy terms their combined effect is marginal, as can be seen from the gloomy forecasts from an Office for Budget Responsibility that usually errs on the side of optimism. It is a not-unfounded leftwing interpretation of what is going on that a nasty, rightwing government is using the pretext of a much-exaggerated \"Labour mess\" to cut back public services and the social safety net quite deliberately, in a way that is severely aggravating poverty, homelessness and hardship for many citizens. But not every backer of this policy has nasty rightwing motives. It is just that they are trapped in a mindset where they have been convinced that they will lose \"credibility\" with the financial markets if they do not persevere with the fiscal version of sado-monetarism. Yet as the failure of the policy becomes more apparent, and the prospect of growth recedes, they will find they will lose credibility anyway. For Whitehall and City insiders, the centrepiece of the budget was the plan, wrapped in a mist of vagueness, to encourage the Bank of England to be more like the US Federal Reserve in taking account of unemployment as well as inflation, and giving the markets more guidance as to how long interest rates will remain low. For Mervyn King and Mark Carney, the US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is the exemplar. But, unlike Sir Mervyn, Bernanke did not commit himself to supporting an inappropriate fiscal strategy. The chancellor repeated in his budget speech that \"active monetary policy and a responsible fiscal policy are two components of our economic plan\". Unfortunately, monetary activism has its limits in a depression; and the fiscal policy is \"responsible\" in a different sense. It is responsible, as the OBR recently pointed out to the prime minister, for hampering the \"recovery\".",
