      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our news story on Apple\u2019s meteoric rise: Goodnight. GW Apple has beaten several tech rivals for the crown of America\u2019s first trillion dollar company. At one stage it looked like Amazon could get their first, but it\u2019s currently \u201conly\u201d worth around $880bn. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is close behind with a market capitalisation of around $850bn. Facebook, though, dropped firmly out of the running after it slashed profitability forecasts last week. One important aspect about Apple\u2019s revival since its 1990s slump is that it started perfecting, rather than creating, new product types. Apple wasn\u2019t first with a smartphone or a digital music player, but it created compelling devices that trumped what had gone before. Our tech writer Alex Hern explains: MP3 players already existed, such as Malda\u2019s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer? With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark \u201c1,000 songs in your pocket\u201d. By 2003 Apple\u2019s advertising agency, Chiat/Day, had come up with silhouette adverts to promote the iPod. The ads were almost too successful, turning the iPod\u2019s white earphones into such a marker of desirability that the Metropolitan police blamed them for a 26% rise in street robberies in 2005. The iPod revolutionised Apple\u2019s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer. In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone. More here: Here\u2019s a reminder of Apple\u2019s impressive track record over the years: Apple has seen off plenty of critics on its march towards a trillion dollars, particularly in the 1990s when it was losing the Desktop PC battle to cheaper Windows machines. Bloomberg\u2019s Shira Ovide has some examples: Apple\u2019s rise to become America\u2019s most valuable publicly quoted firm began more than 40 years ago, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began a company that would help kickstart and drive the computer revolution. Today, the firm behind the Macintosh, the iMac, the iPhone and the App Store is now worth more than Exxon Mobil, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG.N) and AT&amp;T put together. Reuters points out how the return of the late Steve Jobs two decades ago was crucial: . One of three founders, Jobs was driven out of Apple in the mid-1980s, only to return a decade later and rescue the computer company from near bankruptcy. He launched the iPhone in 2007, dropping \u201cComputer\u201d from Apple\u2019s name and super-charging the cellphone industry, catching Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Nokia off guard. That put Apple on a path to overtake Exxon Mobil in 2011 as the largest U.S. company by market value. The Silicon Valley stalwart\u2019s stock has surged more than 50,000 percent since its 1980 initial public offering, dwarfing the S&amp;P 500\u2019s approximately 2,000-percent increase during the same almost four decades. During that time, Apple evolved from selling Mac personal computers to becoming an architect of the mobile revolution with a cult-like following. More here. Newsflash: Apple has become the first US listed company to be worth one trillion dollars. The technology giant hit a $1 trillion market cap as its shares rallied following strong earnings results earlier this week. Apple shares jumped 3% to hit a session high of $207.05 , enough to reach the magic $1trn figure. More to follow.... Richard Flax, Chief Investment Officer at Moneyfarm, thinks today\u2019s rate rise is hard to justify: \u201cThe fact the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a hike itself is notable. At the last meeting in June, the MPC voted by 6-3 to keep rates where they are. If anything, since then the case for rate hikes has gotten weaker not stronger. It doesn\u2019t require too much cynicism to see the unanimous vote as some sort of message. \u201cThe Bank and its governor are in an unenviable position - with a combination of low interest rates, low unemployment / low wage growth, sluggish economic growth, declining inflation and massive policy uncertainty around Brexit. They clearly want to normalise interest rate policy if they can - but the data hasn\u2019t made it easy to justify.\u201d Reuters agrees... Higher interest rates will eat into the profits of Britain\u2019s buy-to-let lenders. Paul Haywood-Schiefer of accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says today\u2019s rate rise is a blow to the sector: \u201cFor many people who were getting no return on their capital due to long term low interest rates and decided to invest in buy to let properties this will be another blow.\u201d \u201cThey wanted to get better returns and for many it was also part of their retirement plans.\u201d One solution is to push up rents, of course. And one controversial buy-to-let landlord has swiftly passed today\u2019s rate rise onto new tenants. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of properties across Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, has announced: Following the interest rate rise I have increased rents in all our properties by \u00a350 per month (fifty pounds). It is merely passing onto the tenant the additional mortgage charge. This increase starts immediately. I think this will only apply to new tenants, or when existing tenancies come up for renewal. Wilson was heavily criticised by Britain\u2019s equality watchdog last year, as we reported: The buy-to-let mogul Fergus Wilson\u2019s ban on \u201ccoloured\u201d tenants because they allegedly left curry smells in his properties has been overturned in a court victory for the Equality and Human Rights Commission. At Maidstone county court, the judge, Richard Polden, granted an injunction against the landlord. \u201cThis policy clearly amounts to discrimination,\u201d Polden said. \u201cI find the policy is unlawful. Such a policy has no place in our society.\u201d Ed Hall, director at law firm Gowling WLG, says today\u2019s rate rise could hurt the economy, if it spooks consumers and businesses: Given that a quarter point rise is perceived to have a limited long-term impact on most business, the move would seem to make sense in terms of longer term strategy. However, in a period of increasing political and economic uncertainty, it can be argued that this move could damage confidence in what could be perceived as an already fragile economy.\u201d Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM, says today\u2019s rate hike is a \u201cpunchy move\u201d, given the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU: Growth in the economy could hardly be described as above trend so members may have realised that this could be the last chance to move ahead before reaching the final Brexit end state. In any case the Bank of England\u2019s response in a few months\u2019 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed. The currency markets aren\u2019t totally buying the hawkish message otherwise the pound would be rising, which it most certainly isn\u2019t.\u201d Indeed. As you can see, the pound has dropped to its lowest level since 20th July today - not the move you\u2019d expect after a rate hike. UK interest rates won\u2019t rise again until at least March 2019, predicts Dean Turner, UK Economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to see further moves from the Bank ahead of Britain leaving the EU. Monetary policy is unlikely to be the key driver for sterling in the markets in the short term, as the spotlight returns to the Brexit saga. The real surprise is that all nine Bank of England\u2019s policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Before noon, many experts were predicting an 8-1 split, or even 7-2, with the most dovish MPC members pushing to keep rates on hold. Our Larry Elliott suggests the data doesn\u2019t support such unanimity: Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so [something Carney rejected earlier] Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were weak in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u2019re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think. Jon Ostler, UK CEO at price comparison site Finder.com, says savers need to be proactive to benefit from today\u2019s rate rise. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly good news for savers, who have suffered ultra-low interest rates for the past decade. They can expect a rise to their savings, albeit a small one. Now is a good time to consider switching your banking products, as banks will be reviewing their rates. Make sure you keep an eye on which banks are offering the best interest rates as not all of their products will increase by the BoE\u2019s 25 basis points. Mortgage holders, and other borrowers, face a hit, through, he adds: For example, those paying off the UK\u2019s average mortgage debt with a variable rate mortgage face paying an extra \u00a317-\u00a318 per month, which adds up to an extra \u00a3200 per year or more than \u00a36,000 over the life of a 30-year loan term.\u201d Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England has raised UK interest rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, despite concerns that Brexit could hurt the economy. The Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, from 0.5%, arguing that a modest increase is needed to keep inflation on target. Governor Mark Carney has defended the move. He told reporters that the economy is in a much healthier place than August 2016, when the BoE cut rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. Carney argued that: UK households were well-prepared for the rise, and that the poorest families would suffer most if the Bank allowed inflation to spike. The Bank was ready for all possibly Brexit outcomes, including Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal Monetary policy needed to \u201cwalk, not run\u201d to keep inflation on target and the economy growing. That\u2019s a hint that future rate rises will be modest. Banks might not pass the entire increase onto savers The Bank might actually CUT rates, if Brexit negotiations go badly. The move has received a mixed reception, with business leaders criticising it and debt charities fearing that poor families will be dragged into financial difficulties. There is relief in the City that the Bank didn\u2019t back away from pushing the button, having given plenty of hints that rates would rise today. But... Carney\u2019s cautious words have hit sterling; the pound is still in the red against the dollar, at $1.3050. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains why: Today the Bank of England defied Brexit uncertainty and brought music to the ears of Sterling bulls as the MPC voted unanimously to increase interest rates to 0.75%. Unfortunately, Sterling\u2019s rally higher was halted by the \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d stating that the monetary policy needs to \u201cwalk, not run, to stand still\u201d as the interest rates\u2019 natural level rises gradually. And finally, an important but technical question from the Financial Times. Q: does the Bank of England\u2019s low estimate of the equilibrium level of interest rates (R*) means that quantitative easing is becoming a standard tool of economy policy, rather than just for emergencies? [explainer: if R* is really between zero and 1% today, as the Bank believes, rates might never get high enough to allow the Bank to start selling off the \u00a3435bn of bonds it bought through QE during the crisis to stimulate the economy]. Mark Carney says this is a good question, to which he gives a long answer. The upshot is that Bank still expects to start unwinding QE when rates have risen to 1.5%. So if R* rises towards 2-3%, then this plan would still hold. Upshot: the MPC does not expect to keep holding its QE assets on its balance sheet indefinitely. Back on Brexit, and Mark Carney is defending the Bank\u2019s approach over the last two years. After the referendum, the BoE decided to take the hit in higher inflation (by cutting rates) rather than pushing unemployment up (by raising rates to strengthen the pound), he says. Q: But wouldn\u2019t it be better to have waited a few months until we know how Brexit will pan out? No, governor Carney replies. We need a \u2018modest\u2019 adjustment to policy now because wages are rising faster than inflation. He then explains that rates could rise, stay on hold, or even be cut depending how UK-EU negotiations play out. There are a wide range of Brexit outcomes, but in many of them interest rates will be at least as high as they are today. We don\u2019t need to keep our powder dry for that. There are certain circumstances where it would be appropriate to either keep rates the same or lower them. If that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s what the MPC will do. It would be a mistake to wait, wait, wait until you have perfect certainty, because you never know when that point will arise, he concludes. Q: What do you say to business groups who think this rate rise is a mistake? We have a good sense of the challenges faced by British businesses, Carney replies. The Bank knows that this has been the shallowest investment recovery in decades. But...the overwhelming issue for businesses is the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. They should be confident that we will focus on our responsibilities, keeping inflation on target while ensuring the economy is prepared for whatever the outcome is. Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX says Mark Carney\u2019s cautious guidance on future rate rises is hitting the pound. On trade wars, Carney says the tariffs imposed by the US, China and Europe on each others imports are \u201cone of the reasons that global growth is little weaker.\u201d The Bank doesn\u2019t see a material impact on the UK economy, yet, but it would be hurt by a slump in global confidence and investment. Mark Carney is now giving a long explanation about the equilibrium interest rate in the UK (known as R*). This is the level at which interest rates should be set to ensure the economy stays at an even keel. The Bank has estimated today that R* is zero to 1 percent, more than 2 percentage points below its pre-financial crisis level. That\u2019s because UK productivity, fiscal headwinds and economic uncertainty are all pulling R* down. If they improve, R* could move closer to the 2-3% range, Carney explains. Danny Blanchflower has hit back at Carney\u2019s jibe, pointing out that UK wage growth has slowed recently - and is nowhere near 3% per year today. Our economics editor Larry Elliott goes next. Q: The Bank thinks the natural rate of unemployment is 4.25% (slightly above the current rate of 4.2%), which is why you\u2019ve raised interest rates. But some experts disagree; former MPC member professor Danny Blanchflower thinks it could be 3%. Why is he wrong, and you\u2019re right? Where do I begin, mutters Mark Carney (somewhat recklessly), before adding that he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Prof B, but his time on the MPC has passed. Carney then explains that policymakers need to reorientate to new reality. He points out that labour cost growth is rising, and productivity growth remains disappointing, thus the UK needs higher borrowing costs to keep inflation on target. [historical note: Danny Blanchflower called, in vain, for UK interest rate cuts before the financial crisis struck, when the rest of the MPC was more worried about inflation] Q: Will this rate rise be passed onto savers, and what will the Bank do to help on this? Mark Carney says that savers have suffered over the course of the last decade from the absolutely necessary low interest rates. But he then suggests that banks might not pass today\u2019s rate rise on in full. H explains that when rates hit record lows after the crisis, the spread between bank lending and borrowing rates were compressed. (That ate into bank profitability, so they will want to repair that by raising borrowing costs more than saving rates). As rates move up, one should expect more of them to be passed along, Carney adds. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in, saying: Historically you never get full pass-though of interest rate changes. Q: Surely poorest households are going to suffer from this rate rise? Mark Carney rebuts this, arguing that the Bank has a responsibility to keep inflation under control. The households that are most affected by high or volatile inflation, and most likely to be out of work, unfortunately, are poorer households. The best thing we can do is keep inflation sustainably on target, and keep the economy on track, he adds. Ouch! Sterling has just dropped against the US dollar, and is now down a whole cent at $1.303. The selloff began as Mark Carney explains that monetary policy needs to \u201cwalk not run to stand still\u201d, as the natural level of interest rates slowly rises. That looks like a hint that borrowing costs will not rise sharply in the next couple of years. Onto questions: Q: Are households ready for today\u2019s interest rate rise, particularly the poorest? Governor Carney says the Bank of England has been saying for a while that interest rates will go up, at a modest rate. That \u2018forward guidance\u2019 was meant to give households and businesses clarity. And it worked, Carney says, with three-quarters of households expecting interest rate to go up over the next year. The important thing to recognise is that UK households have worked hard over the last decade to get into a better financial position, they\u2019ve paid down debt and put themselves in a better position to service their debts. It would take another 100 basis point increase (to 1.75%) to bring the UK debt servicing burden back to the historic average. There is a lot more capacity for UK households to service their debts, Carney concludes. He also cited new \u2018mortgage affordability\u2019 tests that are meant to prevent reckless borrowing. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England is well prepared for a wide range of Brexit outcomes. The banking system has enough money to keep lending through a cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that will be, the governor says. We are working with the Treasury and the European Central Bank to address risks that the banks can\u2019t solve themselves, he adds. Onto Brexit. Mark Carney says that talks between the UK and the EU are at a \u201ccritical period\u201d. Households have been resilient but not indifferent to Brexit uncertainty, he adds, but there are signs that business confidence is softening again. The Bank\u2019s forecasts are based on a \u2018relatively smooth\u201d transition period, the governor points out (implying it could take action if we end up with a No-Deal Brexit). Carney signals that further interest rate rises will be needed. If interest rates stay at 0.75%, then inflation will be over the Bank\u2019s 2% target over the next three years, he explains. Mark Carney says UK exporters are in \u201ca sweet spot\u201d with sterling down 17% compared to its pre-Brexit levels. He adds that the UK labour market is \u201cstrong\u201d, with signs that earnings growth will accelerate later this year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is giving a press conference now. Carney begins by referencing a famous quote from Harold Wilson, saying: If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is an eternity in monetary policy. He reminds us that the Bank cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0.25%, after the Brexit vote. Back in 2016, there was substantial spare capacity in the economy, business confidence was its lowest since the financial crisis, and inflation was due to overshoot its target \u201centirely\u201d due to Brexit fears which had driven the pound down. Now, though, the economy is strong enough to justify an interest rate rise to 0.75%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, says Mark Carney and colleagues have taken a \u201cbold move\u201d by raising borrowing costs today. By early 2019, we\u2019ll know if they\u2019re right, he adds. \u201cThe Bank has so clearly telegraphed this rate rise that markets would have been shocked had rates been left on hold. The unanimity of the decision probably reflects the view that the UK is, quite simply, running out of spare capacity. But sub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u2019 time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.\u201d Oof! Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), says the Bank of England was wrong to raise interest rates today: \u201cThe decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. \u201cThe increase reinforces a concerning aspect of the Bank of England\u2019s recent approach to monetary policy, which appears to be overly focused on reinforcing an idealised direction for rates, rather than on economic reality \u2013 an approach that unnecessarily risks UK\u2019s growth prospects. The central bank\u2019s assumption that the economy\u2019s speed limit has slowed is unduly pessimistic, as sustained action to fix the fundamentals at home, from closing the skills gap to greater infrastructure investment, would materially help lift the UK\u2019s growth potential. Thiru hopes the Bank won\u2019t raise borrowing costs again anytime soon: \u201cThe MPC must carefully consider what happens next. The most preferential option would be for a sustained period of monetary stability amid the current economic and political uncertainty.\u201d Simon Underwood, business recovery partner at accountancy firm, Menzies LLP, fears that this rate rise will hurt businesses - especially those reliant on consumer spending. He says: \u201cThe MPC may have been swayed by the summer heatwave and England\u2019s success in the World Cup, which have had a positive impact on consumer behaviour, boosting retail sales temporarily. However, it is unlikely this positive sentiment will be maintained and today\u2019s decision to increase rates will impact consumer spending ahead of the critical final quarter. \u201cFor businesses serving consumers in the retail and hospitality &amp; leisure sectors, today\u2019s decision will be very unwelcome news and we should expect more turmoil on the high street in the short to medium term.\u201d My colleague Richard Partington reports from the Bank of England: The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced straight after the financial crisis, despite mounting fears over Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Signalling the gradual return of higher borrowing costs, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u2013 the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee judged the economy could withstand higher interest rates, which it believes are required to curb persistently high inflation above its 2% target set by the government. An extra 0.25% interest will add \u00a312 a month to a \u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00a325 on a \u00a3200,000 loan. However, nearly 70% of homebuyers now have fixed rate mortgages so will be unaffected. Here\u2019s our Q&amp;A on how higher UK interest rates will affect you: Although today\u2019s interest rate rise is modest, it will hurt families who are already forced to borrow to pay for the essentials. Phil Andrew, chief executive at StepChange Debt Charity, says politicians need to provide more help to theses households: \u201cWhilst a rise in interest rates might be right for the wider economy, from a consumer debt perspective many households are walking a precarious budget tightrope, as their incomes don\u2019t stretch to cover the basics each month. These are the households that a rate rise will affect most. Policymakers mustn\u2019t lose sight of what a rate rise means for real people on a tight budget. The fact that the wider economy can cope doesn\u2019t always mean individual households can. Government and policymakers need to take parallel steps to ensure support is there for those who are negatively affected, especially if more rate rises are coming.\u201d I mentioned earlier this morning that Mark Carney was known as the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 for failing to stick to his promises. Calum Bennie, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, thinks the governor has turned over a new leaf by raising rates today: \u201cToday\u2019s rate rise means that Mark Carney has probably shaken off his tag of being the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 for good. While the decision indicates the UK\u2019s economy is picking up steam, it also means higher borrowing costs, so households must be even more prudent to absorb the additional cost. The move is good news for savers but still cash account rates are unlikely to beat inflation, so stocks and shares Isas remain better for those looking to grow their savings long-term.\u201d There\u2019s not much reaction in the financial markets to the rate hike - which figures, as it was widely expected. The pound has clawed back some of its losses, but is still slightly lower against the US dollar today at $1.31. Shares are still being pummelled by those trade war fears, leaving the FTSE 100 down 93 points or 1.2%. The Bank of England has hinted that it\u2019s in no rush to raise interest rates again in the coming months. It say that \u201cany future increases in Bank Rate are likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.\u201d The Bank of England also has also warned that Brexit could damage the UK\u2019s economic recovery: The MPC continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal. The Bank of England says it is raising interest rates because the economy has recovered from its slowdown during last snowy winter. The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s meeting says: Recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter. The labour market has continued to tighten and unit labour cost growth has firmed. The MPC continues to judge that the UK economy currently has a very limited degree of slack. Unemployment is low and is projected to fall a little further. The BoE also points out that prices are rising faster than its target (2%), so it is raising borrowing costs to squeeze inflation. CPI inflation was 2.4% in June, pushed above the 2% target by external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling\u2019s past depreciation and higher energy prices. The contribution of external pressures is projected to ease over the forecast period while the contribution of domestic cost pressures is expected to rise. Every member of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee voted to raise interest rates. NEWSFLASH: The Bank of England has voted to raise UK interest rates to their highest level in almost a decade. The BoE is raising Bank rate to 0.75%, from 0.5%. That\u2019s the highest level since March 2009, and only the second rise since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. More to follow! An interest rate rise would obviously be a blow to borrowers, as it would push up the cost of repaying debts. This chart from Resolution Foundation shows how a rise to 0.75% would force a small number of mortgage owners to \u2018take action\u2019 in some way: Back in June, the Bank of England\u2019s MPC was split six-three -- with a trio of policymakers voting to raise interest rates. Danielle Haralambous, UK Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that the majority will vote to hike today, but it won\u2019t be a 9:0 win for the hawks. \u201cWe expect the MPC to raise the policy rate to 0.75% today, although it is unlikely to be a unanimous vote. Some of the economic data has softened in recent months, notably core inflation and wage growth, which may prevent some MPC members from changing their vote in favour of higher interest rates. Our economics correspondent, Richard Partington, explains why the Bank of England will (probably) raise borrowing costs today: Inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u2019 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d. More here: Tension is rising in the City, with around 30 minutes to wait until the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision. Traders broadly expect borrowing costs to rise at noon today, to a nine-year high of 0.75%. But this isn\u2019t giving the pound any love. Sterling is still bobbing at a two-week low against the dollar, with some investors speculating that the Bank could dampen expectations of further interest rate rises any time soon. John Goldie, FX Strategist at Argentex, explains: \u201cThe Bank of England are firmly expected to raise rates this lunch time, only the second hike since 2007. However, most commentators are expecting a \u201cdovish\u201d hike with perhaps some dissenters within the committee (one or two may vote to keep rates on hold still) and/or the statements to play down further hiking expectations in the near term. Plus, you can\u2019t discount the possibility that the Bank sits on its hands again. But that would badly hurt its credibility, given its recent guidance that a rate rise is close. Sue Kershaw, managing director of major project advisory at KPMG, says Britain\u2019s builders benefitted from the hot summer, but warns that Brexit could derail the recovery seen last month. She writes: \u201cSeeing housebuilding come back to good health is hugely positive. As the longstanding driver of activity, the weakening demand we\u2019d seen in recent months did cause some concern and raised questions as to whether residential construction had peaked and was heading for a steady decline. \u201cBut supply chain and cost pressures still remain a cause for concern. We\u2019re seeing input costs continue to creep up and the outcome of Brexit negotiations is still far from clear. Those with infrastructure arms will also be concerned about the sluggish-looking civil engineering market, traditionally quite a reliable source of activity.\u201d Phil Harris, Director at BLP Insurance, fears that the collapse of the merger between shopping centre groups Hammerson and Intu could hurt construction. \u201cJuly was another strong month for commercial activity but the sector remains vulnerable to volatility. British retailers continue to close shops at a pace and the full impact of shopping centre developer, Hammerson\u2019s failed takeover of rival Intu may have yet to be fully felt. With many predicting the closure of more Hammerson sites, growth in July may prove a false dawn.\u201d Brendan Sharkey, head of construction and real estate at accountancy firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, points out that Carillion\u2019s shock collapse in January has caused less damage than feared. However, a hard Brexit might not be shaken off as easily: Construction has been relatively slow to wake up to the dangers posed by Brexit. Given the industry doesn\u2019t depend on exports, the potential pitfalls of a no-deal Brexit have perhaps been easier to overlook. Yet construction does depend on the import of raw materials, and crucially on the free movement of labour. Over the next few months we will see more focus on contingency planning and demand for additional information and support from the government. \u201cThe consequences of Carillion\u2019s collapse were over-hyped but only a very foolhardy captain of industry can assume the same will be true about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Newsflash: China has hit back at America\u2019s threats to impose steep tariffs on its goods (see earlier post). Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry has told reporters it is fully prepared to fight back, if America delivers on Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose 25% tariffs. This is driving financial markets deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down 80 points, with mining stocks leading the selloff. Trivia corner: UK interest rate have never been pegged at 0.75%, since the Bank of England was established in 1694. Back in July 2007, the BoE raised interest rates to 5.75% just as the credit crunch began. It was began cutting as the financial crisis kicked in, including a monster Bank Rate cut from 4.5% to 3% in November 2008. In March 2009 it halved borrowing costs to 0.5%, where they remained until the Brexit vote prompted a cut to 0.25%, which was reversed in November 2017. The pick-up in building activity in July will reassure the Bank of England, as it suggest the construction sector could handle higher borrowing costs. However, yesterday we heard that manufacturing growth slowed a little last month, so it\u2019s a mixed picture. The opposition Labour party is concerned that consumers will be hurt by higher borrowing costs. John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has warned that higher interest rates will push more people into debt: \u201cWith wages still below 2010 levels and the gap between people\u2019s income and outgoings at record levels, the concern must be that a pattern of interest rate rises will push more families into higher levels of debt. \u201cThe Government needs to end its counterproductive austerity programme and raise people\u2019s incomes.\u201d Here\u2019s the key points from today\u2019s survey of purchasing managers at UK construction firms: Britain\u2019s builders achieved an \u201cimpressive turnaround\u201d in July, says Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit. He sees several signs that the construction sector has strengthened this summer: New business volumes expanded at the strongest rate since May 2017, while workforce numbers increased to the greatest extent for just over two- and-a-half years. \u201cHouse building was the bright spot for construction growth in July, alongside a stronger upturn in commercial development projects. Residential activity and commercial work both increased at the sharpest pace since December 2015, which contrasted with another subdued month for civil engineering. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s construction sector has recorded its fastest growth in 14 months. Data firm Markit reports that builders picked up pace in July, led by a surge in housebuilding. This pushed Markit\u2019s construction PMI, which measures growth in the sector, up to 55.8 from 53.1. Anything over 50 shows growth, and this is the highest reading since May 2017. Housebuilders reported the strongest pick-up in growth since the end of 2015. More to follow.... Stock markets around the globe are sliding today, thanks to the threat of a US-China trade war. Investors have been spooked by the news that the Trump administration is considering a 25% tariff on $200bn of Chinese imports - previously it had been planning a 10% levy. It\u2019s the latest shot in an increasingly bitter and protracted trade spat between Washington and Beijing. CNN explains: The United States has already slapped 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion to punish Beijing for what it says are its unfair trade practices, such as forcing American companies to hand over valuable technology. China immediately responded with equal measures. In the latest step, President Donald Trump has directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariff level on fruit and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, and more. The trade office has extended its previous deadline of Aug. 30 to allow the public more time to comment on the new plan. Those comments are now due on September 5. In London the FTSE 100 has shed 32 points, or 0.4%, to 7620, its lowest level in over two weeks. There are heavier falls across Europe, with Germany\u2019s DAX shedding 1.3%. Over in Asia, the Chinese markets have tumbled by around 2%. Other markets also in the red as traders fear an escalating trade dispute will hurt growth and exports across the region. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision is the main event of the day: Bloomberg polled 58 forecasts...10 expect no change, and 48 expect a 25 basis point hike (including us). Sterling meanwhile, continues to bump along the bottom of its historic trade-weighted range. There isn\u2019t nearly enough good news in a much-anticipated rate hike to propel it higher, but the downside is limited. An interest rate rise today would be risky, argues our economics editor Larry Elliott. He points out that many UK households are struggling, meaning incomes are lagging spending for the first time in three decades. Households are not borrowing because they are brimful of confidence. In many cases they are borrowing to make ends meet. The MPC knows this and will go out if its way to reassure consumers and businesses that any further policy tightening will be both modest and gradual. Thursday\u2019s rate rise is supposed to prevent wage inflation from taking off, underpin sterling and boost the Bank\u2019s credibility without harming growth. The next eight months will see Brexit negotiations come to a climax and the inevitable period of uncertainty means this is the MPC\u2019s last opportunity to raise rates for some time. Yet the fact remains that this is an ill-timed and risky venture, not least for the millions overburdened with debt. The pound will tumble if the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold today, says Miles Eakers of global payments, FX and Treasury management firm Centtrip: \u201cA hawkish hike will boost the Pound but only for the short term. That said, Mark Carney may catch market participants off-guard again and not increase rates, which will weaken the Pound substantially and could fall as low as its yearly nadir of $1.2956 or even below. Even if the BoE does hike, the Brexit negotiations are still under way, keeping the Pound under pressure for the foreseeable future.\u201d The pound is dropping this morning, as the City braces for the Bank of England interest rate decision at noon. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3068, its lowest in nearly two weeks. Normally you\u2019d expect a currency to rally when interest rates go up. But there may be some anxiety over whether the Bank will actually do the deed today. Traders may also be anticipating a \u2018dovish hike\u2019 - the BoE could raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, but hint that the next rise is a long way away. This chart shows how sterling has struggled, even as an August rate hike looked more likely. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is hurting the pound: \u2018Thursday could be a hugely symbolic day if the Bank of England decides to raise interest rates above 0.5% for the first time since the financial crisis. However it doesn\u2019t actually change too much on the ground. Markets are already expecting a rise, and from here on in, further hikes are going to be few and far between because UK economic growth is so fragile. We could see some reaction from sterling though, which has remained resolutely weak against the dollar, despite rising expectations of a rate rise. That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u2019t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks. He also points out that rates could yet be cut, if the economy falters. Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system. Few people thought rates would ever be cut from 0.5%, but that\u2019s exactly what happened following the EU referendum result. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Love Island finally off our screens, it\u2019s time for the nation\u2019s favourite unreliable boyfriend to show if he\u2019s mended his ways, or is as fickle as ever. The Bank of England will announce today whether UK interest rates are going up, for only the second time in a decade. The City widely expects a hike, after governor Mark Carney declared last month that the economy seems to have recovered from its slowdown at the start of 2018. The City is pricing a 91% chance of an interest rate rise today. That would take borrowing costs up to 0.75% today -- their highest level since March 2009 (but still low in historic terms). But traders are edgy. Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u2013 promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u2019s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today. The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index explains: The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE. It\u2019s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 tag, but it\u2019s not a title the governor appreciates. He would argue that businesses and households have understood his message -- that interest rates will rise at a modest pace as the recovery allows. Also coming up Data firm Markit will report how Britain\u2019s construction sector performed last month. Economists predict that growth slowed, as the bounceback after the winter freeze fades. Trade war fears are weighing on the markets again. There are reports that Donald Trump is considering slapping a 25% tariff on Chinese imports into the US, which would have a hefty impact on world trade.

That probably reflects the fact that economic data hasn\u2019t been resoundingly positive in the lead up to this interest rate decision, plus of course the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has raised its head in recent weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also points out that rates could yet be <strong>cut</strong>, if the economy falters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even though rates are very low and will remain so for the foreseeable future, they can still move down if there is an economic shock to the system.

Carney has a long track record of capriciousness \u2013 promising that a rate hike is imminent only to back away when the big day arrives. So there\u2019s a possibility that the Bank will shy away from pressing that rate hike button today.<br></p> <p>The decision is unlikely to be unanimous, as some monetary policy committee members are concerned that the economy may not be strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs.<br></p> <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks</strong> of <strong>Capital Index </strong>explains:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The market is currently expecting an 8-1 split in favour of a hike, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only member expected to dissent and vote against a hike. </p> <p>However, if we get more MPC members voting against a hike then sterling could come under pressure, as it would suggest a future dovish stance by the BOE.</p> </blockquote> <p>It\u2019s four years since Labour MP Pat McFadden gave Carney his \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 tag, but it\u2019s not a title the governor appreciates.

House of Fraser is battling for survival after Wednesday\u2019s decision by the Chinese owner of Hamleys, C.banner, to pull out of a plan to invest \u00a370m in the ailing retailer and buy a majority stake. Resolution of the legal battle with landlords could be a vital step towards securing an urgently required \u00a350m of new funding. The department store\u2019s chief executive, Alex Williamson, has said that the closure of 31 of House of Fraser\u2019s 59 stores was the \u201conly viable option\u201d to secure the future of the business. The company is in talks with a number of potential investors understood to include Mike Ashley, the boss of Sports Direct, and Alteri, the former owner of Jones Bootmaker. Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Jaeger and Austin Reed, and restructuring firm Hilco, the group which recently bought DIY chain Homebase, are also thought to be taking a look. House of Fraser is looking to secure either a short-term loan or a long-term investor or buyer to stave off a fall into administration. The retailer urgently needs cash as it struggles to meet its quarterly rent bill of nearly \u00a325m which is due in late September, fund the purchase of stock and its monthly payroll. Industry experts believe a rescue deal is highly unlikely given tough trading conditions and the high cost of updating House of Fraser\u2019s stores and mending its troubled online business. However, fighting off the legal challenge to the store closures, which is to be heard in Edinburgh\u2019s court of session, is thought likely to give it a better chance for survival. C.banner partly blamed its withdrawal on the legal battle with landlords which has delayed House of Fraser\u2019s store closure plan, arranged via an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement. The hearing, which could last several days, will consider a complaint filed by five landlords who have been working with advisory firms Begbies Traynor and JLL.

The high street lender reported a 29% fall in pre-tax profit to \u00a31.7bn for the six months to 30 June, while total income for the period was flat at \u00a310.9bn. Profits were knocked by a \u00a3400m PPI charge and a \u00a31.4bn settlement with US authorities over its sale of mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the financial crisis \u2013 both of which were logged in the first quarter of the year. When stripped of litigation and conduct costs, half-year pre-tax profits rose 20% to \u00a33.7bn. The bank cheered its second-quarter performance, during which it logged no major legal costs or further PPI provisions. Its chief executive, Jes Staley, said: \u201cIt was the first quarter for some time with no significant litigation or conduct charges, restructuring costs or other exceptional expenses which hit our profitability. \u201cIn effect then, it is the first clear sight of the statutory performance of the business which we have re-engineered over the past two-and-a-half years \u2013 Barclays\u2019 transatlantic consumer and wholesale bank \u2013 and it is a positive sight.\u201d Statutory pre-tax profits for the second quarter came in at \u00a31.9bn, up from just \u00a3659m during the same period last year. Total group income for the second quarter rose 10% to \u00a35.6bn, while costs fell 3%. Staley said the first-half performance overall showed the bank was starting to \u201cdemonstrate its true potential and value\u201d. \u201cThe numbers we have posted strengthen our confidence that Barclays can deliver attractive and sustainable profits, and in our ability to return a greater proportion of those profits to shareholders over time.\u201d Its corporate and investment bank (CIB) \u2013 which has faced scrutiny after activist investor Edward Bramson took a 5% stake in the lender \u2013 reported a 17% rise in pre-tax profits for the half-year to \u00a32bn. Total income from the division rose just 1% to \u00a35.4bn. Bramson, the New York financier who disclosed a surprise 5% stake in Barclays in February, has argued that the lender should pare back parts of the investment bank that do not directly serve corporate clients. \u201cWe are in conversations with Bramson, I have met him and we look forward to meeting him post these results but he has not outlined what his strategy is to us,\u201d Staley told reporters. Barclays said it was \u201ctoo early to provide comments on expected performance\u201d for the group for the second half of the year. The bank has forecast that income from Barclays UK \u2013 its retail operations \u2013 will \u201cremain steady despite margin pressures\u201d. However, income its international division will depend on investment banking market conditions, as the bank notes that volatility was low in July. Barclays shares closed down 2.7% at 186.5p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced after the financial crisis despite mounting fears about the economic impact of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Citing concern that the lowest unemployment rate since the mid-1970s risked re-igniting wage pressure, Threadneedle Street raised interest rates to 0.75% from 0.5% \u2013 the level they were dropped to in March 2009 as the economy lurched through the last recession. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, told businesses and households there would be further increases in borrowing costs if economy continued to recover from a softer patch earlier this year, but he also signalled willingness to reverse the quarter-point increase in the event of a disorderly Brexit. \u201cIf there is a major shift [in the Brexit talks]... then that could have consequences for monetary policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can adjust when necessary.\u201d The pound fell on foreign exchanges over speculation the Bank would be blocked from tweaking the cost of borrowing until after Britain formally left the EU next March. Sterling dropped by almost a cent against the dollar and the FTSE 100 slipped by more than 1%. Charles Hepworth of the City investment management company GAM said: \u201cThe Bank of England\u2019s response in a few months\u2019 time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed.\u201d In delivering its verdict on Thursday, the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously for the increase, judging that the economy had bounced back from the effects of the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d earlier this year. The MPC said recent readings for economic growth \u201cappear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter\u201d. It also said an \u201congoing tightening of monetary policy\u201d \u2013 meaning more interest rate rises \u2013 would be required if the economy continued to recover as forecast to return inflation toward the Bank\u2019s 2% target over the next few years. The Bank\u2019s decision, only the third change in interest rates in the last decade, comes as fears mount over Brexit, with Theresa May facing parliamentary divisions over her plan. Raising rates will mean higher borrowing costs on mortgages and loans for consumers and businesses as they adapt to Britain leaving the EU. An extra 0.25% will add \u00a312 a month to a \u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00a325 on a \u00a3200,000 loan. Nearly 70% of homebuyers, however, have fixed-rate mortgages so will be unaffected. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the rate rise would be bad news for hard-pressed households: \u201cGiven recent revelations that households are spending more than they receive in income for the first time since 1988, today\u2019s rise will be a blow to those facing high levels of personal debt.\u201d Business groups also criticised the decision given the mounting Brexit uncertainty which, along with higher borrowing costs, stood to deter firms from investing in Britain. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy.\u201d There has been some better news for the economy in recent months, with the summer heatwave and royal wedding giving the country a shot in the arm by encouraging a rise in consumer spending. Inflation has fallen from its highest level in five years, and unemployment remains at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. Factory output has slowed, however, as global economic growth softens and Donald Trump slaps import tariffs on some of the US\u2019s biggest trading partners, including the EU and China. Despite the low levels of unemployment in the UK, pay rises for British workers remain elusive. In giving its rate decision, the MPC said it believed wages should begin to rise over the next three years, helped by the low levels of unemployment, while economic growth should average around 1.75% per year. It said the pay rise for public sector workers following the government\u2019s removal of the 1% cap may spill over to help workers in the private sector demand better wages. Some economists argue that the unemployment rate of 4.2% masks the precarious nature of work for many people, which could hold back wage growth as workers\u2019 bargaining power remains subdued. The most recent official figures show wage growth dropped to its lowest level in six months in the three months to May. David Blanchflower, a former MPC member, said: \u201cThe economics of walking about suggests that the MPC has no idea what is going on for ordinary people outside London. They are not getting 3% wage rises and don\u2019t expect them.\u201d Having previously delayed raising interest rates in May, preferring to wait and see if the economy would recover, the decision had been widely expected this time. The unanimous vote is likely to stoke speculation that further increases are around the corner. Outlining its decision, the Bank said interest rates were unlikely to return to the levels seen before the financial crisis, when they were more commonly set above 5%. Any future increases in the cost of borrowing are likely to come at a \u201cgradual pace and to a limited extent,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "Global demand for gold fell to its lowest level since 2009 in the first half of this year as an improving US economy drove investors to riskier assets and consumers bought less gold jewellery, particularly in India where an inauspicious period for Hindus led to fewer weddings. Central bank purchases also slowed, although demand for gold used in electronics such as smartphones, games consoles and vehicles hit a three-year high. Global demand for gold was 1,959.9 tonnes between January and June, the lowest first-half total since 2009, according to the industry-funded World Gold Council. In the second quarter, demand fell 4% year on year to 964.3 tonnes. Purchases of gold for investment fell 9%, driven by a 46% decline in buying by gold-backed exchange-traded funds. Investment was weakest in North America, where funds recorded outflows of 30.7 tonnes in the second quarter because of a stronger US economy. Meanwhile, European investors sought refuge in gold at a time of political uncertainty, caused by the Italian elections. In China, an escalating trade dispute with Washington and falling stock markets lifted investment demand. A weaker rupee and the imminent monsoon also dragged down jewellery purchases in India, the world\u2019s biggest gold market. Other declining local currencies meant consumers in many countries did not benefit from a fall in the dollar-denominated gold price. It dropped 5.5% between April and June to $1,250 (\u00a3959) an ounce.",

      "bodyText": "In the end, there were no doubters. Despite some markedly mixed signals from the economy in recent months, the nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to raise interest rates by a quarter point to 0.75%. The decision to lift official borrowing costs above 0.5% for the first time in almost a decade came as no surprise, but the lack of any dissenting voices certainly did. The Bank\u2019s latest quarterly health check on the economy is almost identical to the one it produced in May. Back then, the MPC had been gearing up for a rate rise but put the move on hold because it wanted to make sure that the weakness of the data for the first three months of 2018 reflected only temporary weather-related effects linked to the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d storm. The MPC said growth would bounce back to 0.4% in the second quarter and there are signs that it has. Hence, the UK is getting the rate rise scheduled for May with a three-month delay. Make no mistake, this was a big moment. Interest rates have been on an emergency setting for well over nine years but are now heading back to what the Bank considers to be a new normal range of 2-3%. But the comment from Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, that policy needed to \u201cwalk not run\u201d was telling. It will be a long time before borrowing costs hit 2% and the chances of another hike this side of Brexit are slim. The decision gives the Bank a bit more scope to cut rates in the event that Britain leaves the EU without a deal but that was not the real reason for the MPC\u2019s decision. Rates are going up because the committee thinks the fall in unemployment to its lowest level since 1975 is leading to upward pressure on wages. The MPC points to an edging up of earnings growth from post-crisis levels. A survey conducted by its regional agents showed that two-thirds of firms questioned reported having difficulty recruiting and retaining skilled staff and 40% said it was hard to get staff for any positions. This makes the MPC uneasy. It thinks unemployment cannot fall below 4.25% without wage inflation, and its forecast is for the jobless rate to dip below 4% next year. If the economy performs in the way the Bank expects, further increases in interest rates would be appropriate, it said. That said, Threadneedle Street has been overestimating wage inflation for years, and the former MPC member and labour market expert David Blanchflower says it is still doing so. Recent official data has shown growth in total pay falling not rising; annual growth in total earnings has come down from 3.1% in December to 2.5% in May, regular pay \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 has edged down from 2.7% to 2.6%, and weekly earnings adjusted for inflation were unchanged from their \u00a3489 level a year later. It\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that rates are going up because the Bank feared for its credibility if they were again left unchanged. Continually talking tough and doing nothing is a risky strategy. But so is raising rates when the case for doing so is weak. The economy, despite bouncing back in the second quarter, is far from booming. Retail sales were soft in June, the housing market is dead and inflation is coming back toward its 2% target more quickly than the Bank expected. Tellingly, the response from business was negative. The Institute of Directors said the Bank had \u201cjumped the gun\u201d, while the British Chambers of Commerce said the move was ill-judged and threatened to undermine confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty. It is a tough trading environment out there, as demonstrated by House of Fraser teetering on the brink of collapse and Countrywide, the UK\u2019s biggest estate agency chain, launching a \u00a3140m fundraising bid. Sprinkle in the risk of a global trade war and a crucial few months ahead for the Brexit talks and it is obvious why business groups were underwhelmed by the Bank\u2019s decision. In such circumstances, it is strange, even a little troubling, that not one MPC member opposed a rate hike, which helps explain why Carney was asked at his press conference whether the MPC was guilty of groupthink. The inflation report makes it sound as if higher interest rates are a no-brainer. They\u2019re a lot riskier than the Bank appears to think.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England on Thursday raised its base rate for only the second time in a decade, inching it up from 0.5% to 0.75%. What impact will it have on your mortgage, savings and the property market? How will it affect me? The direct impact on most people is minimal. Most people with large mortgages are on fixed rates, so the increase has zero impact. The proportion of borrowers with variable mortgages \u2013 which move up and down in price as the base rate changes \u2013 has fallen to only 35% compared with 70% in 2001. I have a variable rate mortgage. How much more will it cost? If you are on a tracker mortgage that matches any rise in the base rate, then an extra 0.25% adds \u00a312 a month to a \u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage and \u00a325 on a \u00a3200,000 loan. For the 400,000 households on Nationwide\u2019s base mortgage rate, their monthly bill will rise from \u00a3449 to \u00a3461 (on a loan size of \u00a3100,000) and from \u00a3897 to \u00a3922 on a \u00a3200,000 loan. Will I finally get an uplift on my savings account? Banks tend to push through rate rises on mortgages immediately but are much slower to raise savings rates. The average interest rate on an easy access account at one of the \u201cbig five\u201d high street providers is currently only 0.23%. The most that savers are likely to see is increases to 0.3% or 0.4%, as the banks use the rate rise to widen their net interest margin and increase their profits. Is this just the start of many more rate rises? Possibly but the tone from the Bank of England governor suggests the next rate rise might not be until 2019 at the earliest. Almost no one in the City expects a return to the 5% base rates common before the financial crash. Most suggest a \u201cnew normal\u201d base rate of no more than 2% to 3% \u2013 and even then that\u2019s unlikely for some time to come. That said, household finances are under intense pressure, with the average person spending more than they earn, piling up debt or running down their savings. If the Bank of England raises the base rate by another 1.5%, then customers on Nationwide\u2019s main mortgage deal will see the cost of a \u00a3200,000 loan spike to \u00a31,055 a month; \u00a3158 more than they are paying now. That would knock a huge hole in the personal finances of many families \u2013 which is why the Bank of England is unlikely to go down that road if it can possibly avoid it. Should I fix my mortgage for the long term to beat future rate rises? One of the striking new developments in the mortgage market is the sudden availability of 10-year fixes at interest rates that are only marginally above the two- or five-year fixes taken out by most households. HSBC, for example, is allowing borrowers to lock in for 10 years at only 2.49% and Coventry building society at only 2.39%. Given the rising interest rate environment, longer-term fixes are likely to be much more popular this year. What impact will it have on the property market? In London and the south the market is in the doldrums but is more active in the Midlands and north. Expect more of the same; Brexit uncertainty, stamp duty rises and higher tax on buy-to-let is already hammering the capital\u2019s market, so a 0.25% rate rise has little extra impact. In the rest of the country, economists are forecasting 2-3% annualised price rises. Will the value of the pound rise and give me more holiday money? Sadly not. Even though the rate rise has been widely anticipated, sterling remains stuck at around \u20ac1.12, marginally down on this time last summer. Unless there is a breakthrough on the Brexit negotiations, expect the pound to remain under pressure.",

Even though the rate rise has been widely anticipated, sterling remains stuck at around \u20ac1.12, marginally down on this time last summer. Unless there is a breakthrough on the Brexit negotiations, expect the pound to remain under pressure. </p> <h2></h2> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Tessa Tennant, who has died of cancer aged 59, was led by her ruling passions into a position of huge influence in the world of green finance. Realising the need to reconcile planetary limits with the power of directing investment, for 30 years she was at the forefront of a movement that has encouraged fund managers to invest money in a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion. Tessa co-founded the UK\u2019s first green investment fund, the Merlin (now Jupiter) Ecology Fund, in 1988. She was later head of responsible investment at NPI (now part of Janus Henderson Investors), where she managed massive amounts of institutional money on socially and environmentally responsible lines \u2013 for instance by refusing to take shares in high-polluting companies or those involved in child labour. In 1991 she co-founded the UK Social Investment Forum, which lobbied for the wider adoption of responsible investment in Britain. She was also involved in setting up what is now the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, an alliance of more than 200 financial institutions that seeks to improve understanding of how banks, insurance companies and other major investors can take account of environmental, social and governance factors when deciding where to put their money. In addition Tessa co-founded, in 2000, the Carbon Disclosure Project, a successful programme that has encouraged major companies to make annual disclosures of the greenhouse gas emissions they generate, and which works with them to cut those emissions. Now known as CDP, the project has grown dramatically since its inception, and works with more than 6,000 companies across the globe, including most of the biggest corporations. Tessa was born in Bletchingley, Surrey, to John Cormack, a pilot, and Jean Davies, the daughter of a Liberal peer. After leaving Prior\u2019s Field school, in Godalming, she gained an environmental studies degree at King\u2019s College London. Working after her degree at the environmental thinktank Green Alliance, she spotted the power that was latent in fund management, and noted that few investors at the time were routinely weighing up the environmental impacts of their decisions. Fewer still considered that excellent long-term returns could be had by investing in business that respects the natural world. After an internship in the US with the green asset management firm Trillium and its inspiring leader Joan Bavaria, she co-founded Merlin (now Jupiter) Fund Management in London and was its head of social investments. There she helped to build up an investment team that featured many people who fanned out into new responsible investment operations across the world over the next quarter of a century. At NPI she built and led a team that grew sustainable assets under management faster than any other group in the UK, winning large institutional mandates. Seeing the implications of billions of far eastern consumers joining the global economy, in 2000 she relocated to Hong Kong. There she set up the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia, which is now part of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an international network of investors pledged to incorporate social and environmental issues into their investment analysis and decision-making processes. After helping to create the Carbon Disclosure Project, she became its first executive chair and then a board member until 2014 \u2013 encouraging, sometimes embarrassing, corporations into measuring and reporting their emissions. Through defining and disclosing their climate impacts, companies saw the need to bring them down \u2013 reducing demand for fossil fuels and driving finance into low-carbon technologies. Over the last 20 years of her life Tessa developed an impressive portfolio of directorships. These included non-executive directorships at the Green Investment Bank and Solarcentury, a solar electricity company. She was possessed of an exceptional combination of energy, social confidence and free-spirited charm that brought her many admirers \u2013 her advice was sought by politicians including Tony Blair. In 1983 she had married Henry Tennant, whose father became Lord Glenconner. Tessa and Henry had a son, Euan, shortly before Henry recognised that he was gay. They separated but remained close; in 1990 Henry died from complications of Aids. Tessa took over his forebears\u2019 mansion in the Scottish borders, the grade A-listed Glen House, with accompanying farmland, cottages, steadings and offices. In 2006 she met Bill Staempfli, a New York architect who was in Oxford on sabbatical studying environmental policy, and they married in 2007. Responsibility for managing the Glen estate without the financial means to run it was a legacy that Tessa occasionally thought she could do without, but in partnership with Bill she brought the farm back in hand by managing it organically, planting new native woods, tackling a backlog of repairs and hiring it out for film and fashion shoots. In 2012 Tessa discovered she had ovarian cancer \u2013 recording her treatment with wry commentary on a blog. In 2017 she found it had returned \u2013 though she spared her friends the knowledge. She declined further treatment, spending her last months at Glen with Bill, Euan, and her two grandchildren, who all survive her. One of her last acts was to be driven by Bill in their all-electric car to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, to collect the insignia of her OBE from the Queen. \u2022 Teresa Mary Tennant, green investment campaigner, born 29 May 1959; died 7 July 2018",

    "webTitle": "Countrywide shares plunge 60% after emergency cash call", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in Countrywide have plunged by more than 60% after the struggling estate agent asked investors for \u00a3140m of emergency funds to save it from collapsing under the weight of its debt. Countrywide, which has nearly 10,700 staff and operates under about 50 brand names including Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves, launched the rescue plan after downgrading profit forecasts four times in eight months. It will raise cash by offering new shares to existing investors but at an 80% discount to their previous value, a markdown that sent the company\u2019s stock market value tumbling as much as 70% in early trading. The fall meant that at one point the UK\u2019s largest property services company was valued at less than the \u00a335m average house price on Britain\u2019s most expensive street, Kensington Palace Gardens in London. Shares closed down nearly 63% at 18.5p. Like rivals such as Foxtons, which announced that it had sunk to a \u00a32.5m half-year loss earlier this week, Countrywide has suffered from malaise in the property market, particularly in the south-east. Estate agents have said Brexit-related uncertainty \u2013 coupled with stamp duty rises on properties above \u00a31m and second homes \u2013 has brought the housing market in London to a near standstill. While the number of housing transactions has been in decline, traditional estate agents have also come under mounting pressure from no-frills online agencies. Alongside its fundraising plan, which will be used to whittle down its \u00a3212m debt pile, Countrywide revealed it had fallen \u00a3206m into the red during the most recent six-month period. The scale of the loss was largely due to a \u00a3211m charge from slashing the value of its assets and brand. The executive chairman, Peter Long, blamed the company\u2019s woes on the \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d strategy pursued by the former chief executive Alison Platt, who resigned in January. Platt sought to run the estate agent like a retailer, bringing its sales and lettings businesses together and concentrating expertise centrally with local branches functioning like shops, a plan that triggered an exodus of middle management. \u201cIt completely destroys the business model by saying it\u2019s a retailer and saying we don\u2019t need management expertise locally,\u201d said Long. \u201cYou disempower people, demotivate them and lose key expertise.\u201d He said high debt, racked up during an acquisition spree in 2014 and 2015, was \u201ccompounded by the perfect storm of a chief executive getting the strategy completely wrong\u201d. Long doubled his salary to \u00a3360,000 when he took over day-to-day running of the business from Platt, adding the role to his vice-chairman\u2019s seat at travel group Tui and the chairmanship of Royal Mail. But he insisted he was not overburdened, despite also dealing with the fallout from last month\u2019s pay revolt at Royal Mail, one of the largest shareholder rebellions in corporate history. He said Countrywide\u2019s performance was improving, vowing that a turnaround plan could result in the company making an \u00a380m underlying profit within three years. In a statement to the stock market, Countrywide said its problems had been exacerbated by a flagging housing market, particularly in London. \u201cThe prime central London housing market continues to experience low levels of activity owing to political and economic uncertainty, particularly in relation to stamp duty and Brexit, which is felt more acutely in the capital,\u201d it said. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at investment adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, said Countrywide had been \u201cdamaged by its attempt to bring the sales and lettings businesses together under one roof, and by its centralisation programme, which took decisions out of the hands of local managers\u201d. Khalaf added: \u201cMeanwhile the entire sector has been going through an existential crisis thanks to digital disruption. \u201cOn top of that, Brexit and changes to stamp duty prompted a 22% fall in London property transactions last year, ensuring Countrywide didn\u2019t get away with its wayward strategy. \u201cInvestors now need to decide if they are throwing good money after bad, though even the best-case scenario is a long road to recovery.\u201d While investors still have to vote on the fundraising plan, it has been underwritten by Barclays and stockbroker Jefferies, which will buy the shares if shareholders decide not to.",

The LSE said plans include creating new entities within the European Union, but also warned that the complexity of Brexit could make its actions less effective. \u201cThe group is executing contingency plans to maintain continuity of market function and customer service in the event of a hard Brexit. These contingency plans include incorporation of new entities in the EU27 and applications for authorisation within the EU27 for certain group businesses,\u201d the LSE told the City on Thursday. \u201cHowever, the complexity and the lack of clarity of the application of a hard Brexit may decrease the effectiveness, or applicability of some of these contingency plans.\u201d The LSE said last month that it had applied for several trading licences in Amsterdam for its Turquoise, TRADEcho and UnaVista platforms so they can continue to offer their services to EU customers after 29 March 2019. The group said on Thursday that Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU continue \u201cbut the UK\u2019s final exit terms are still unclear\u201d. It noted that the government\u2019s white paper released on 12 July, agreed at Chequers, focused on an enhanced equivalence model for financial services rather than passporting or mutual recognition, the preferred option for many City firms. It added: \u201cAlthough this provided further clarity around the UK\u2019s negotiating position, there remain several issues to be resolved with the EU or risk a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario.\u201d The EU has \u201cequivalence\u201d regimes which provide limited access for some non-EU countries to some areas of EU financial services markets. At present, banks and other financial firms based in London rely on an \u201cEU passport\u201d to operate freely across the EU\u2019s financial markets. David Warren, the LSE\u2019s chief financial officer, said the debate was \u201cvery much in flux\u201d. He added: \u201cOur focus is going to be on the continuity of services and what the customer wants. We need to ensure orderly markets \u2026 Fragmentation increases costs and systemic risk. Customers don\u2019t want that.

Warren declined to comment directly but insisted that the LSE\u2019s LCH clearing house remained a global leader. \u201cWe have seen no discernible change in customer behaviour.\u201d The LSE reported a 30% rise in pretax profit to \u00a3480m for the first six months of the year, with double-digit revenue growth in LCH and its capital markets and information services divisions.

Problems with the Trent 1000 engines, which power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and its sister Trent 900 engine have forced the company to carry out costly inspections and repairs and to redesign some parts. Several aircraft have been grounded, leading to flight cancellations and forcing airlines to lease other planes. As a result Rolls-Royce has been forced to accept a one-off cost of \u00a3554m \u2013 pushing the business \u00a31.3bn into the red in the first six months of the year. In the same period last year the company made \u00a31.4bn profit. Rolls-Royce said the cost of fixing the Trent 1000 and Trent 900 problems would be about \u00a3450m this year and next, and then decline by at least \u00a3100m in 2020. Its chief executive, Warren East, apologised to airlines using the engines for the inconvenience: \u201cThe Trent 1000 in-service engine issues have caused significant disruption for a number of our customers, which we sincerely regret.\u201d However, thanks to strong growth in other parts of the business Rolls-Royce expects to make underlying operating profits of \u00a3400m-\u00a3500m this year, at the upper end of its guidance. East has embarked on a major shakeup of the business, selling the firm\u2019s fuel injection and commercial marine businesses and slashing 4,600 mainly managerial and administrative jobs, to focus on three core divisions. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cHappily, they\u2019re all showing signs of improvement. \u201cThe challenge will be managing the disruption caused by failures in its Trent line, while avoiding any more mishaps.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England poised to raise interest rates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is poised to raise interest rates above the level set since the aftermath of the financial crisis for the first time, despite a weakening outlook for the British economy and growing risks from Brexit. Economists widely expect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) to lift the cost of borrowing above 0.5% on Thursday to reach 0.75%. Financial markets suggest a 91% chance of rates returning to levels unseen since March 2009, when Britain was in the grip of recession. However, recent readings for the economy have painted a mixed picture for economic growth. Survey data on Wednesday showed factory output falling to the lowest levels for 16 months in July, amid fears over Brexit and trade wars. On the eve of the interest-rate decision, the latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply showed weaker domestic activity for the manufacturing sector, which could suggest weaker growth lies ahead for the British economy. However, inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. Some rate setters on the MPC, including the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u2019 bargaining power for higher pay. The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup helped boost the economy, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The Office for National Statistics found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d. Having watched the economy grind to a halt in the cold weather as building cranes and diggers fell idle across the country, the Bank delayed raising interest rates in May above 0.5%, preferring to wait for better news. Keeping them on hold again could test the Bank\u2019s credibility after a series of speeches from MPC members suggesting that higher interest rates would be required if economic growth continued to recover. Despite some stronger readings for the economy, some economists have warned the Bank against raising rates amid increasing uncertainty over Brexit, as Theresa May is faced with widening parliamentary divisions over her plans. Writing in the Guardian last month, David Blanchflower, a former MPC member , said there was no basis for the MPC to raise rates amid the uncertainty. Threadneedle Street has previously warned that lower interest rates could be required if the UK left the EU without a deal. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has said Brexit developments would have a significant influence on monetary policy. While the MPC has a mandate to steer inflation towards 2%, it also has the ability to deviate from this course to support the economy through difficult periods. Some economists have argued the unemployment rate of 4.2% masks the precarious nature of work for many people, which could hold back wage growth as workers\u2019 bargaining power remains subdued. The most recent official figures show wage growth dropped to the lowest level in six months in the three months to May. While higher interest rates would add to financial pressure facing consumers, there are fewer people than in previous years who would immediately feel the difference from higher borrowing costs. Nationwide said the share of outstanding mortgages on variable interest rates \u2013 which would lead to an increase in payments \u2013 has fallen to its lowest level on record, at around 35%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said: \u201cWhile the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u2019s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living.\u201d",

Survey data on Wednesday showed factory output falling to the lowest levels for 16 months in July, amid fears over Brexit and trade wars.</p> <p>On the eve of the interest-rate decision, the latest snapshot from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/aug/01/uk-manufacturing-set-for-slowdown-apple-value-heads-towards-1trn-business-live?page=with:block-5b616f9fe4b0353e1304fc7b#block-5b616f9fe4b0353e1304fc7b\">IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply</a> showed weaker domestic activity for the manufacturing sector, which could suggest weaker growth lies ahead for the British economy. </p> <p>However, inflation has remained stubbornly above the 2% target set for the Bank by the government, after having risen sharply straight after the EU referendum result. </p> <p>Some rate setters on the MPC, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/23/dont-wait-worried-workers-call-shorts-on-wages\">including the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane</a>, also believe wage growth is just around the corner for workers, amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s, a factor that could help boost workers\u2019 bargaining power for higher pay.</p> <p>The summer heatwave, royal wedding and England progressing to the semi-final of the World Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/10/uk-economy-gets-kick-from-world-cup-heatwave\">helped boost the economy</a>, triggering stronger retail sales in April and May before they unexpectedly fell back in June. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/10/uk-gdp-growth-britain-may-manufacturing\">Office for National Statistics</a> found that the warmer weather helped the economy rebound from a slowdown earlier this year after heavy snowfall from the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/04/construction-industry-frozen-by-beast-from-the-east\">beast from the east</a>\u201d. </p> <p>Having watched the economy grind to a halt in the cold weather as building cranes and diggers fell idle across the country, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/bank-of-england-holds-uk-interest-rates-at-05\">the Bank delayed raising interest rates in May</a> above 0.5%, preferring to wait for better news. </p> <p>Keeping them on hold again could test the Bank\u2019s credibility after a series of speeches from MPC members suggesting that higher interest rates would be required if economic growth continued to recover. </p> <p>Despite some stronger readings for the economy, some economists have warned the Bank against raising rates amid increasing uncertainty over Brexit, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay\">Theresa May</a> is faced with widening parliamentary divisions over her plans. </p> <p>Writing in the Guardian last month, David Blanchflower, a former MPC member , said there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/24/uk-brexit-uncertainty-economy\">no basis for the MPC to raise rates amid the uncertainty</a>.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street has previously warned that lower interest rates could be required if the UK left the EU without a deal.</p> <p>Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has said Brexit developments would have a significant influence on monetary policy. While the MPC has a mandate to steer inflation towards 2%, it also has the ability to deviate from this course to support the economy through difficult periods.</p> <p>Some economists have argued the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/08/carney-should-heed-employment-experts-before-rate-decision\">unemployment rate of 4.2% masks the precarious nature of work for many people</a>, which could hold back wage growth as workers\u2019 bargaining power remains subdued. The most recent official figures show wage growth dropped to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/17/uk-wage-growth-pay-unemployment\">lowest level in six months</a> in the three months to May.<br></p> <p>While higher interest rates would add to financial pressure facing consumers, there are fewer people than in previous years who would immediately feel the difference from higher borrowing costs. </p> <p>Nationwide said the share of outstanding mortgages on variable interest rates \u2013 which would lead to an increase in payments \u2013 has fallen to its lowest level on record, at around 35%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001.</p> <p>Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said: \u201cWhile the impact for most borrowers is likely to be modest, it\u2019s important to note that household budgets have been under pressure for some time because wages have not been rising as fast as the cost of living.\u201d</p>",
