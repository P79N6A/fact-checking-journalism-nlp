      "bodyText": "Labor will release its 10-year economic plan on Wednesday, in response to the Turnbull government\u2019s 10-year tax cut plan. It comes at the mid-point of the election campaign, with both parties locked at 50:50 on a two party-preferred basis in this week\u2019s Newspoll. Labor leader Bill Shorten and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, will release the plan in Brisbane, which they say has six key \u201cpriority areas\u201d that will support Australia\u2019s economic transition and boost productivity and living standards. Australian\u2019s living standards have been declining for the past two years, as measured by real net national disposable income. Labor has not centred its 10-year economic plan around tax cuts for big and small businesses, like the Coalition, instead it says it will only support tax cuts for businesses with an annual turnover of less than $2m. Its six priority areas will see Labor focusing on boosting the quality of education and training; investing more in rail, roads and the NBN; driving investment in renewables and new industries; providing tax relief for startups and small businesses; better targeting tax concessions to middle and \u201cworking class\u201d families; and ensure greater female participation in the workforce. It has rested some of its infrastructure and education policies on advice from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). \u201cThe contrast between Labor and the Liberals could not be more stark,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cMr Turnbull wants to give big business a $50 billion tax giveaway, while at the same time running down our human capital and skills base. \u201cLabor is the only party with a fair policy agenda that will ensure a successful economic transition, by investing in nation building infrastructure, and growing a stronger and more productive economy in the future by investing in our best resource \u2013 our people,\u201d he said. On education, Labor says it will introduce a Student Funding Guarantee to remove the need for higher tertiary fees. It also wants to boost university degree completions by 20,000 graduates each year from 2020. It wants science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) occupations to become a \u201cnational strength,\u201d and will offer 100,000 Stem award degrees over five years, with the entire Hecs-Help debt to be written off upon graduation. It wants to give Infrastructure Australia new powers to make infrastructure investments well-planned and well-targeted. That includes a new $10bn financing facility to kick-start public infrastructure investment in priority projects like the Brisbane Cross River Rail, Melbourne Metro and Badgerys Creek Airport Link in Sydney. It also says it will commit $59m to a Manufacturing Transition Boost jobs package to attract new investment in advanced manufacturing and help automotive businesses transition to new products and markets. \u201cAustralia needs better than Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberals are offering,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cWe need a plan that will see middle and working class families prosper, so that Australia prospers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global growth will slow this year as oil exporters in the developing world struggle to cope with lower energy prices, the World Bank has said in its half-yearly economic health check. The benefit of cheaper oil pricesfor Europe, Japan and other oil importing nations, which has sustained their growth through 2015 and 2016, has failed to offset a slowdown in parts of Africa, Asia and South America that depend on selling energy to sustain their incomes. In one of the gloomiest predictions by an international forecaster, the bank said the effect of the collapse in oil income on developing countries would restrict global growth to 2.4% this year, well down on its January forecast of 2.9%. In the UK the growth rate will be restricted to 2% this year and 2.1% in 2017 and in 2018. The US will also stabilise at about 2% annually for the next couple of years, while the eurozone will expand at a more modest 1.6% in 2016 and in 2017 before slipping to 1.5% in 2018. The tumbling price of metals and food on world markets last year hit emerging and developing economies without triggering a significant rise in spending by richer countries. The Washington-based bank, which lends more than \u00a325bn a year to developing countries, said weaker global trade, a downturn in private and public investment and a slump in manufacturing added to the woes of economies that have become dependent on high oil prices to bolster growth. Commodity prices have recovered since the spring with oil, steel, aluminium and zinc gaining ground. The oil price, which fell below $27 (\u00a318) a barrel in January, has exceeded $50 in recent weeks, while zinc has recovered from $1,500 a tonne to more than $2,000 a tonne. But the bank said prices remained low compared with market expectations and would continue to hit investment and government spending across the developing world for the rest of this year. Jim Yong Kim, the bank\u2019s president, has warned Britons that a vote to leave the EU would further undermine confidence in global trade and hit growth, rebounding on economies such as the UK that rely on exports to drive growth. In its report, the World Bank echoed a warning by the International Monetary Fund in April, that the downside risks to growth were growing as richer countries struggled to free themselves from the debts associated with the financial crisis and poorer states struggled to cope with low commodity prices. Kaushik Basu, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cAgainst this backdrop of weak growth, pronounced risks, and limited policy space, policymakers in emerging and developing economies should put a premium on enacting reforms, which, even if they seem difficult in the short run, foster stronger growth in the medium and the long run. \u201cAmong these measures, efforts to invest in infrastructure and education, health and other human skills and wellbeing, as well as initiatives to promote economic diversification and liberalise trade, will boost growth prospects and improve standards of living. The international community has an important role to play in the pursuit of these goals.\u201d About half the downward revision in global growth came from emerging economies, which are expected to grow by 3.5% compared with a growth rate of 1.7% in advanced economies. It said richer countries had failed to capitalise on lower commodity prices and faced an equally uncertain year. \u201cInvestment continues to be soft amid weaker growth prospects and elevated policy uncertainty, while export growth has slowed reflecting subdued external demand. Despite an expected boost from lower energy prices, and the ongoing improvement in labour markets, growth is projected to level off in 2016 rather than accelerate,\u201d the report said. The IMF said in April that GDP growth would edge up slightly this year to 3.2%, from 3.1% in 2015, which many analysts said was an overoptimistic estimate.",

    "webTitle": "BHS managers blame Dominic Chappell for company's collapse", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The management team of BHS has apologised to staff over the collapse of the company, blaming it on the failure of Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium to raise funds that it had pledged to bring in. Chappell is scheduled to appear in front of MPs on Wednesday morning to discuss his role in the demise of the 88-year-old department store chain, which has put 11,000 jobs at risk. Other members of the Retail Acquisitions vehicle will also appear in front of MPs, as well as Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS. Chappell\u2019s consortium bought BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 from Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia. Green had controlled BHS for 15 years, during which time the tycoon and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments. The letter to BHS staff has been signed by nine members of the management team, not including Topp. It sets the scene for the hearings on Wednesday, which are likely to see Chappell face heavy criticism from members of the work and pensions committee and business, innovation and skills committee, who are investigating the collapse of the company. The letter says: \u201cWe, the management team of British Home Stores, would like to apologise to you and all our colleagues for the very sad situation we find the business in. \u201cThe inability of RAL [Retail Acquisitions] to raise sufficient funds and dispose of key property assets, hindered the management team in delivering the turnaround plan. \u201cAny sums of financing raised or property disposals appeared to fall short of expectations. Under challenge, Dominic Chappell continuously assured us he would deliver on raising funds, this was not the case.\u201d \u201cRAL ownership did not give confidence to the credit insurers and suppliers that would allow BHS to operate under normal trading terms. To compensate for this, BHS needed additional funds to guarantee supplier orders, this contributed further to major cash flow difficulties.\u201d The letter adds that Topp\u2019s leadership had been \u201cinspirational\u201d and praised the \u201ctrue BHS spirit\u201d of the workforce. Separately, Paul Sutton, who introduced Chappell to the deal, has spoken for the first time since BHS collapsed, saying he is \u201cdevastated\u201d. Sutton told the Guardian that BHS was \u201csaveable\u201d. He said: \u201cI am devastated about what has happened. I believe this company was saveable. It is devastating what has happened to 11,000 people\u2019s jobs and their pensions.\u201d Sutton was forced to walk away from a deal for BHS, passing it on to Chappell instead, after a whistleblower handed a dossier to Green showing he had been convicted of fraud in France. However, Sutton has provided new evidence showing a judge at a magistrates court in London in 1999 ruled there was no evidence of dishonesty and he should not be extradited to France. Further documents show France ruling in 2008 that the conviction and sentence was \u201cextinct\u201d, allowing Sutton to re-enter the country. Robin Saunders, the former BHS shareholder and City banker, told MPs on Tuesday that she introduced Sutton to Green in April 2013 after the retail tycoon told her he was looking to sell the business. \u201cI was under the impression he had capital,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is quite charismatic in character and I thought he could do it.\u201d Saunders told the hearing at the business, innovation and skills committee into the demise of BHS that she had been paid about \u00a3800,000 for her beneficial interest in shares in the retailer \u2013 a 0.5% stake \u2013 when the business was transferred into Green\u2019s Taveta holding company in 2009 as part of a restructuring. The payment came on top of about \u00a32m in dividends understood to have been received by Saunders from BHS during Green\u2019s ownership of the company. The admission demonstrated the scale of the financial benefit for early shareholders \u2013 including Saunders, restaurateur Richard Caring and Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter \u2013 went beyond dividends that have already been declared. But Saunders insisted the company had not been asset-stripped. \u201cThe company was extremely cash generative in its own right. It was an extremely well run company,\u201d she said. Joseph Dryer of River Rock, which advised Chappell prior to his takeover of BHS, told the hearing on Tuesday that Chappell had given the impression that he had been led to the BHS deal as he knew the Greens and had attended parties on their yacht. Chappell had told his advisers that he had agreed a deal with Green that included the settlement of the pension deficit by the billionaire. When it emerged that no such deal had been agreed and the pension was still to be resolved River Rock resigned. Dryer suggested there had been a break down in relations. \u201cAt that point we had been working [with Chappell] over three weeks. Normally when you work with someone you build confidence levels with them. But that wasn\u2019t exactly the case,\u201d Dryer said",

      "body": "<p>The management team of BHS has apologised to staff over the collapse of the company, blaming it on the failure of Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium to raise funds that it had pledged to bring in.</p> <p>Chappell is scheduled to appear in front of MPs on Wednesday morning to discuss his role in the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/02/bhs-rescue-bid-fails-putting-11000-jobs-at-risk\"> demise of the 88-year-old department store chain, which has put 11,000 jobs at risk.</a></p> <p>Other members of the Retail Acquisitions vehicle will also appear in front of MPs, as well as Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS.</p> <p>Chappell\u2019s consortium bought BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 from Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia. Green had controlled BHS for 15 years, during which time the tycoon<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\"> and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments.</p> <p>The letter to BHS staff has been signed by nine members of the management team, not including Topp. It sets the scene for the hearings on Wednesday, which are likely to see Chappell face heavy criticism from members of the work and pensions committee and business, innovation and skills committee, who are investigating the collapse of the company.</p> <p>The letter says: \u201cWe, the management team of British Home Stores, would like to apologise to you and all our colleagues for the very sad situation we find the business in.</p> <p>\u201cThe inability of RAL [Retail Acquisitions] to raise sufficient funds and dispose of key property assets, hindered the management team in delivering the turnaround plan. </p> <p>\u201cAny sums of financing raised or property disposals appeared to fall short of expectations. Under challenge, Dominic Chappell continuously assured us he would deliver on raising funds, this was not the case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRAL ownership did not give confidence to the credit insurers and suppliers that would allow BHS to operate under normal trading terms. To compensate for this, BHS needed additional funds to guarantee supplier orders, this contributed further to major cash flow difficulties.\u201d</p> <p>The letter adds that Topp\u2019s leadership had been \u201cinspirational\u201d and praised the \u201ctrue BHS spirit\u201d of the workforce.</p> <p>Separately, Paul Sutton, who introduced Chappell to the deal, has spoken for the first time since BHS collapsed, saying he is \u201cdevastated\u201d. Sutton told the Guardian that BHS was \u201csaveable\u201d. He said: \u201cI am devastated about what has happened. I believe this company was saveable. It is devastating what has happened to 11,000 people\u2019s jobs and their pensions.\u201d</p> <p>Sutton was forced to walk away from a deal for BHS, passing it on to Chappell instead, after a whistleblower handed a dossier to Green showing he had been convicted of fraud in France.</p> <p>However, Sutton has provided new evidence showing a judge at a magistrates court in London in 1999 ruled there was no evidence of dishonesty and he should not be extradited to France. Further documents show France ruling in 2008 that the conviction and sentence was \u201cextinct\u201d, allowing Sutton to re-enter the country.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/02/philip-greens-adviser-robin-saunders-face-mps-bhs-collapse\">Robin Saunders, the former BHS shareholder and City banker, </a>told MPs on Tuesday that she introduced Sutton to Green in April 2013 after the retail tycoon told her he was looking to sell the business.</p> <p>\u201cI was under the impression he had capital,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is quite charismatic in character and I thought he could do it.\u201d <br></p> <p>Saunders told the hearing at the business, innovation and skills committee into the demise of BHS that she had been paid about \u00a3800,000 for her beneficial interest in shares in the retailer \u2013 a 0.5% stake \u2013 when the business was transferred into Green\u2019s Taveta holding company in 2009 as part of a restructuring.</p> <p>The payment came on top of about \u00a32m in dividends understood to have been received by Saunders from BHS during Green\u2019s ownership of the company. The admission demonstrated the scale of the financial benefit for early shareholders \u2013 including Saunders, restaurateur Richard Caring and Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter \u2013 went beyond dividends that have already been declared.</p> <p>But Saunders insisted the company had not been asset-stripped. \u201cThe company was extremely cash generative in its own right. It was an extremely well run company,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Joseph Dryer of River Rock, which advised Chappell prior to his takeover of BHS, told the hearing on Tuesday that Chappell had given the impression that he had been led to the BHS deal as he knew the Greens and had attended parties on their yacht. </p> <p>Chappell had told his advisers that he had agreed a deal with Green that included the settlement of the pension deficit by the billionaire. When it emerged that no such deal had been agreed and the pension was still to be resolved River Rock resigned. Dryer suggested there had been a break down in relations.</p> <p>\u201cAt that point we had been working [with Chappell] over three weeks. Normally when you work with someone you build confidence levels with them. But that wasn\u2019t exactly the case,\u201d Dryer said</p>",

    "webTitle": "Mike Ashley's evidence: surprise answers to unsurprising questions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley made a series of admissions during nearly three hours of questioning by MPs over the treatment of staff at his retail group. Amid the revelations over pay, discipline and his own shortcomings as a boss, Ashley presented himself as somebody who was shocked to discover what was really going on at a company he founded \u2013 and still controls. The appearance followed a Guardian undercover investigation last year that found workers at Sports Direct\u2019s main warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, were receiving an effective hourly pay rate below the minimum wage, after being subjected to compulsory searches at the end of shifts and deductions from their pay for late attendance. MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee covered a range of topics in their session with Ashley, whose answers raised further concerns about the management of Sports Direct. Minimum wage For the first time Ashley admitted that the compulsory and unpaid searches conducted on all workers leaving the warehouse at the end of a shift meant the company was breaking the law by paying workers less than the minimum wage. Asked if the searches meant Sports Direct had failed to pay the legal minimum, Ashley said: \u201cOn that specific point, for that specific point of time, yes.\u201d This was a major concession \u2013 confirming the top line of the Guardian\u2019s December investigation and a complete climbdown from the company\u2019s initial reaction. Then it said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d Ashley also admitted the company is under investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which could impose heavy financial sanctions on the company. Staff discipline Internal documents have outlined the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out system\u201d in place at Shirebrook where workers are given a strike for certain \u201coffences\u201d that include \u201ca period of reported sickness\u201d. \u201cAny person who exceeds six strikes within a six-month period will have their assignment at Sports Direct ended,\u201d an internal document states. Understandably this causes some staff concern about the security of their jobs, but Ashley told MPs he would review this policy within 90 to 180 days. He said: \u201cWould you want your son or daughter under that regime? Simple. If the answer\u2019s no, what you\u2019ve put in is wrong. You need to change it.\u201d As the six-strike system has been a live issue for some time \u2013 and was publicly aired in a Dispatches film on Sports Direct more than a year ago \u2013 it is not entirely clear why Ashley might need up to six months to look at it. Internal review Ashley kept stating that his internal review, which was announced in December on the back of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, was an \u201congoing process\u201d which left him unable to share many of his conclusions with MPs. However, the frequency with which he told MPs that they were giving him new information suggests that he needs to ask more questions internally. He appeared horrified about the accusations of female employees being pressured sexually. While these allegations are very difficult to prove, the stories are commonplace around Shirebrook. In a session before Ashley\u2019s appearance it was put to Andrew Sweeney, of Sports Direct\u2019s employment agency The Best Connection, that when female employees started work they were described as \u201cnew meat\u201d. Ashley said that allegations of misogynistic behaviour by managers were \u201crepugnant, they\u2019re disgusting\u201d. Staff relations Ashley contradicted himself over whether he was the best person to be conducting a review of working practices. He initially seemed to say he was, only to then acknowledge he might not be. The committee\u2019s chairman, Labour MP Iain Wright, asked him how honest workers would be when speaking to the founder of the company. Ashley admitted he could understand that question and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one, that.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re 19 years old and Mike Ashley walks up and asks, \u2018Are you having a good day?\u2019, he\u2019s not going to say, \u2018No.\u2019 I accept that.\u201d This concern was widely raised by commentators last year when Ashley launched his review. Health and safety A BBC investigation in October 2015 found that ambulances were called out to Shirebrook 76 times in two years. Many of the calls were for \u201clife-threatening\u201d illnesses, while one was called after a woman gave birth in a warehouse toilet. The report helps support the theory that Sports Direct staff are too worried for their jobs to protest about conditions. Ashley\u2019s testimony failed to convince he has command of the detail. Asked why were so many ambulances were called, the billionaire told MPs that the number was \u201cexcessive\u201d. Still he suggested staff could have been overhasty \u2013 calling 999 when they could have just given the worker \u201ca glass of water\u201d. When it was pointed out that calling an ambulance for a worker giving birth in the toilets might not be classed as \u201cexcessive\u201d, Ashley was briefly silenced. Managing the business In a surprise admission, Ashley acknowledged that the retailer he had created was now \u201ctoo big\u201d for him to control, and appeared to agree with suggestions that the group needs new management. \u201cOne minute [I] had a tiny little inflatable and you\u2019re in control and the next minute you are on an oil tanker,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the things you\u2019ve said today have shown that it\u2019s definitely outgrown me,\u201d he added. This did not sound reassuring for Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey and chairman Keith Hellawell. \u201cI am not going to do nothing when I hear stories like this,\u201d Ashley added when asked if he would review management structure. The City has long been critical of Sports Direct\u2019s corporate governance structure, as well as the lack of talent at the top of the firm alongside Ashley. Trade unions Ashley appeared accommodating to committee requests and agreed to look at a range of concerns. However, he refused to explain why the company employed so many temporary workers or to agree to meet Unite, the union leading a long-running campaign against conditions at Shirebrook. He finally said he would be happy to meet the union at the AGM, which is not until September. Asked if he will work with Unite to discuss problems, Ashley replied: \u201cI can do a better job for the workers than Unite.\u201d Nonetheless, Unite could have told him months ago about the issues that surprised Ashley. Their local representatives would be a good source of information for the billionaire. Zero-hours contracts Ashley claimed his internal review of Sports Direct had not yet covered zero-hours contracts \u2013 under which staff are not guaranteed set hours \u2013 but agreed with MPs that more staff should be transferred to permanent contracts. The founder admitted that 80% of workers were on zero-hours contracts, but insisted that hundreds of the company\u2019s permanent employees had started out on temporary deals. \u201cSome of our top people have come from zero-contract employment,\u201d he said.",

Then it said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Ashley also admitted the company is under investigation by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which could impose heavy financial sanctions  on the company. </p> <p><strong>Staff discipline</strong><br></p> <p>Internal documents have outlined the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out system\u201d in place at Shirebrook where workers are given a strike for certain \u201coffences\u201d that include \u201ca period of reported sickness\u201d. \u201cAny person who exceeds six strikes within a six-month period will have their assignment at Sports Direct ended,\u201d an internal document states.</p> <p>Understandably this causes some staff concern about the security of their jobs, but Ashley told MPs he would review this policy within 90 to 180 days.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWould you want your son or daughter under that regime? Simple. If the answer\u2019s no, what you\u2019ve put in is wrong. You need to change it.\u201d</p> <p>As the six-strike system has been a live issue for some time \u2013 and was publicly aired in a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/sports-direct-investigation-reveals-harsh-working-conditions\">Dispatches film on Sports Direct more than a year ago</a> \u2013 it is not entirely clear why Ashley might need up to six months to look at it.</p> <p><strong>Internal review</strong><br></p> <p>Ashley kept stating that his internal review, which was announced in December on the back of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, was an \u201congoing process\u201d which left him unable to share many of his conclusions with MPs.</p> <p>However, the frequency with which he told MPs that they were giving him new information suggests that he needs to ask more questions internally.</p> <p>He appeared horrified about the accusations of female employees being pressured sexually. While these allegations are very difficult to prove, the stories are commonplace around Shirebrook.</p> <p>In a session before Ashley\u2019s appearance it was put to Andrew Sweeney, of Sports Direct\u2019s employment agency The Best Connection, that when female employees started work they were described as \u201cnew meat\u201d.</p> <p>Ashley said that allegations of misogynistic behaviour by managers were \u201crepugnant, they\u2019re disgusting\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Staff relations</strong><br></p> <p>Ashley contradicted himself over whether he was the best person to be conducting a review of working practices. He initially seemed to say he was, only to then acknowledge he might not be. </p> <p>The committee\u2019s chairman, Labour MP Iain Wright, asked him how honest workers would be when speaking to the founder of the company. Ashley admitted he could understand that question and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one, that.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re 19 years old and Mike Ashley walks up and asks, \u2018Are you having a good day?\u2019, he\u2019s not going to say, \u2018No.\u2019 I accept that.\u201d</p> <p>This concern was widely raised by commentators last year when Ashley launched his review. </p> <p><strong>Health and safety</strong><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34178412\">A BBC investigation in October 2015</a> found that ambulances were called out to Shirebrook 76 times in two years. Many of the calls were for \u201clife-threatening\u201d illnesses, while one was called after a woman gave birth in a warehouse toilet.</p> <p>The report helps support the theory that Sports Direct staff are too worried for their jobs to protest about conditions. Ashley\u2019s testimony failed to convince he has command of the detail.</p> <p>Asked why were so many ambulances were called, the billionaire told MPs that the number was \u201cexcessive\u201d. Still he suggested staff could have been overhasty \u2013 calling 999 when they could have just given the worker \u201ca glass of water\u201d.</p> <p>When it was pointed out that calling an ambulance for a worker giving birth in the toilets might not be classed as \u201cexcessive\u201d, Ashley was briefly silenced.</p> <p><strong>Managing the business</strong><br></p> <p>In a surprise admission, Ashley acknowledged that the retailer he had created was now \u201ctoo big\u201d for him to control, and appeared to agree with suggestions that the group needs new management.</p> <p>\u201cOne minute [I] had a tiny little inflatable and you\u2019re in control and the next minute you are on an oil tanker,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the things you\u2019ve said today have shown that it\u2019s definitely outgrown me,\u201d he added. This did not sound reassuring for Sports Direct chief executive Dave Forsey and chairman Keith Hellawell. \u201cI am not going to do nothing when I hear stories like this,\u201d Ashley added when asked if he would review management structure.<br></p> <p>The City has long been critical of Sports Direct\u2019s corporate governance structure, as well as the lack of talent at the top of the firm alongside Ashley.</p> <p><strong>Trade unions</strong><br></p> <p>Ashley appeared accommodating to committee requests and agreed to look at a range of concerns.</p> <p>However, he refused to explain why the company employed so many temporary workers or to agree to meet Unite, the union leading a long-running campaign against conditions at Shirebrook.</p> <p>He finally said he would be happy to meet the union at the AGM, which is not until September.

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct is facing a multimillion-pound bill in fines and back pay after the billionaire admitted his company had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. The concession, which was made as Ashley appeared in front of MPs investigating his firm\u2019s treatment of its workers, confirmed the findings of a Guardian investigation last year in which undercover reporters exposed how the company was paying staff less than the legal minimum. Ashley, who could also face being disbarred as a company director because of the breach, admitted that at a \u201cspecific time\u201d Sports Direct effectively paid workers less than the minimum wage because they were held back at the end of their shift and searched by security before leaving the company\u2019s warehouse. While the admission that the company was breaching employment law was the main headline, the MPs also extracted a string of revelations, with Ashley telling them that: it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the company\u2019s workers to be docked 15 minutes of pay for being one minute late for work; he is struggling to control the company he founded and in which he still owns a majority stake; the group may have to reorganise its top management; he would review the use of the controversial \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy under which workers are sacked for six black marks within six months. Appearing before MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee, Ashley also launched a passionate defence of his retail group, saying Sports Direct had a \u201chard-working culture\u201d and was a \u201cvictim of its own success\u201d. But he said: \u201cI\u2019m not Father Christmas, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll make the world wonderful.\u201d Ashley said a review of Sports Direct\u2019s working practices had uncovered \u201cunpleasant surprises\u201d for him. Ashley confirmed that HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which polices minimum wage abuses, is investigating the retailer and that the company is in talks with its full-time staff about a deal to offer back pay. An HMRC spokesman said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about doing deals. While we don\u2019t discuss individual cases we won\u2019t accept anything less than what\u2019s owed. Our role is to investigate all cases where we believe an employer is not paying its workers the national minimum wage to ensure those workers receive what they are owed under the law.\u201d Experts said that the minimum wage admission now raised the prospect of hefty fines for the company. Businesses that have breached the legislation can be forced to pay arrears to workers, as well as being fined up to 200% of those arrears. Using rough figures derived from the experience of the Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters last year, the pay arrears could total around \u00a32m per year for the warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Jeni Morris, a former HMRC minimum wage investigator and founder of a consultancy firm NMW Direct Ltd, said: \u201cHMRC will have their high-profile specialist taskforce conduct this investigation as thoroughly and swiftly as possible. \u201cThe investigators will be looking at all areas of the company\u2019s business \u2013 for the maximum six years that the law allows. I think they will make an example of Sports Direct because of all the publicity that has been involved. It has the potential to be the highest national minimum wage fine since the introduction of national minimum wage legislation in 1999.\u201d To date, the record figure retrieved by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the \u00a31.7m paid by Total Security Services to 2,519 employees that was announced earlier this year. That figure does not include fines. In December, the undercover Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct warehouse staff were required to go through searches at the end of each shift, during which their time was unpaid, and they also suffered deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late. The practices contributed to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour against the then statutory rate of \u00a36.70, which potentially saved the FTSE-100 firm millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK. Ashley said that he had moved to address the queues of workers waiting, unpaid, to be searched at the end of each shift, but also admitted that docking workers 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being one minute late was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d. Both practices had led to breaches of minimum wage legislation, the Guardian investigation found. Earlier, the committee heard from Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite trade union. He said there was \u201carrogance and contempt\u201d at the top of Sports Direct, and that its approach to working practices was a \u201cdetermined business model\u201d. Luke Primarolo, regional officer at Unite, who has led a campaign highlighting the working practices at the firm, referred to a culture of fear at the Sports Direct warehouse. \u201cPeople are scared because they are working under a system when they know they could lose their employment at any moment,\u201d he said. Unite officers said there had been 110 ambulance callouts to the warehouse, including 38 times when workers had complained of chest pains. Five ambulances had been called to Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in birth and miscarriage-related matters, including one worker who gave birth in the toilets. MPs also heard that some staff received their wages through a pre-paid card. Staff were charged \u00a310 to get a card, plus a \u00a310-a-month management fee, 75p to use it at an ATM machine, and 10p when they got a text message confirming they had used it. Conservative MP Richard Fuller said the evidence from Unite was \u201cvery disturbing\u201d. Unite\u2019s Turner said no workers had yet received back pay from the company. \u201cWe have been in discussions with the company and HMRC. There is an agreement with HMRC and we are currently in the process of balloting our members \u2026 But this only affects employees [and not around 3,000 temporary workers].\u201d Unite added that around 200 warehouse workers were employees of Sports Direct, while more than 3,000 people working in the warehouse were supplied by employment agencies. On Monday, Ashley admitted for the first time to problems with the security procedures at the retailer\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse. In a letter to the sport chain\u2019s 27,000 staff, the billionaire founder of the sport chain acknowledged that there had been issues with searches, and he also revealed that the group\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, would not be taking his four-year share bonus, worth as much as \u00a34m. Sports Direct responded to the Guardian\u2019s reports by announcing an internal review of the retailer\u2019s working practices to be led personally by Ashley, plus a pay rise for staff, which the company said would cost it \u00a310m. MPs had been locked in a battle to get Ashley to attend parliament to answer their questions on working practices at the firm. He had repeatedly refused, despite the MPs formally issuing him with a summons, and he also taunted committee members by calling them a joke. However, Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, backed down over the weekend. MPs had indicated they would proceed with plans to potentially have him found in contempt of parliament, and would seek to trigger a Commons vote on whether the tycoon was a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to be running a business. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cIt\u2019s truly shameful and deeply worrying that Sports Direct is saying it has so little control over its company, which has led it to actions breaching the law. No one person or company should be above the law or think they can opt out of it.\u201d.",

It has the potential to be the highest national minimum wage fine since the introduction of national minimum wage legislation in 1999.\u201d </p> <p>To date, the record figure retrieved by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the \u00a31.7m paid by Total Security Services to 2,519 employees that was announced earlier this year. That figure does not include fines.</p> <p>In December, the undercover Guardian investigation revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">Sports Direct warehouse staff were required to go through searches at the end of each shift</a>, during which their time was unpaid, and they also suffered deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late.</p> <p>The practices contributed to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour against the then statutory rate of \u00a36.70, which potentially saved the FTSE-100 firm millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK.</p> <p>Ashley said that he had moved to address the queues of workers waiting, unpaid, to be searched at the end of each shift, but also admitted that docking workers 15 minutes\u2019 pay for being one minute late was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d. Both practices had led to breaches of minimum wage legislation, the Guardian investigation found.</p> <p>Earlier, the committee heard from Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite trade union. He said there was \u201carrogance and contempt\u201d at the top of Sports Direct, and that its approach to working practices was a \u201cdetermined business model\u201d.</p> <p>Luke Primarolo, regional officer at Unite, who has led a campaign highlighting the working practices at the firm, referred to a culture of fear at the Sports Direct warehouse. \u201cPeople are scared because they are working under a system when they know they could lose their employment at any moment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Unite officers said there had been 110 ambulance callouts to the warehouse, including 38 times when workers had complained of chest pains. Five ambulances had been called to Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in birth and miscarriage-related matters, including one worker who gave birth in the toilets. </p> <p> MPs also heard that some staff received their wages through a pre-paid card. Staff were charged \u00a310 to get a card, plus a \u00a310-a-month management fee, 75p to use it at an ATM machine, and 10p when they got a text message confirming they had used it.</p> <p>Conservative MP Richard Fuller said the evidence from Unite was \u201cvery disturbing\u201d.<br></p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Unite\u2019s Turner said no workers had yet received back pay from the company. \u201cWe have been in discussions with the company and HMRC. There is an agreement with HMRC and we are currently in the process of balloting our members \u2026 But this only affects employees [and not around 3,000 temporary workers].\u201d</p> <p>Unite added that around 200 warehouse workers were employees of Sports Direct, while more than 3,000 people working in the warehouse were supplied by employment agencies.<br></p> <p>On Monday, Ashley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/06/mike-ashley-admits-to-problems-at-sports-direct-warehouse\">admitted for the first time to problems with the security procedures at the retailer\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse</a>.<br></p> <p>In a letter to the sport chain\u2019s 27,000 staff, the billionaire founder of the sport chain acknowledged that there had been issues with searches, and he also revealed that the group\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, would not be taking his four-year share bonus, worth as much as \u00a34m.<br></p> <p>Sports Direct responded to the Guardian\u2019s reports by announcing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/sports-direct-accusations-workers-pay-conditions\">internal review of the retailer\u2019s working practices</a> to be led personally by Ashley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise\">plus a pay rise for staff, which the company said would cost it \u00a310m</a>.</p> <p>MPs had been locked in a battle to get Ashley to attend parliament to answer their questions on working practices at the firm. He had repeatedly refused, despite the MPs formally issuing him with a summons, and he also taunted committee members by calling them a joke.</p> <p>However, Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, backed down over the weekend. MPs had indicated they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/03/sports-direct-mike-ashley-mps-to-discuss-sanctions\">proceed with plans to potentially have him found in contempt of parliament</a>, and would seek to trigger a Commons vote on whether the tycoon was a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to be running a business.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cIt\u2019s truly shameful and deeply worrying that Sports Direct is saying it has so little control over its company, which has led it to actions breaching the law. No one person or company should be above the law or think they can opt out of it.\u201d.</p>",

Kerviel, 39, whose deals lost the bank \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.82bn), sued for wrongful dismissal and the tribunal agreed. It ruled he was fired \u201cwithout real or serious cause\u201d and that the bank had full knowledge of his shady dealings long before he was fired in 2008. The judgment \u2013 described in France as spectacular \u2013 is the first positive verdict for Kerviel in his eight-year battle to throw the spotlight back onto the bank which he claims was well aware of his trading which initially generated profits before going wrong. The Kerviel case was one of the biggest bank trading scandals in history but he maintained that he was just one cog in a rotten machine and had been made a scapegoat for the bank\u2019s whole system. In October 2010, Kerviel was sentenced to three years in jail after being convicted by a Paris court of breach of trust and fraud in the loss of \u20ac4.9bn in equity derivatives trades that went wrong in 2008. He was released in September 2014, with an electronic bracelet, after spending less than five months in prison. Kerviel continues to claim his superiors knew what was going on and deliberately turned a blind-eye as long as the profits kept rolling in. The bank has insisted it was not aware of his actions. SocGen\u2019s lawyer, Arnaud Chalut, said the employment tribunal ruling for unfair dismissal was \u201cscandalous\u201d and the bank would appeal against a decision that he said ran counter to the law. Kerviel\u2019s lawyer David Koubbi told Reuters that the tribunal\u2019s decision \u201crestores justice and tears apart the story that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has presented from the beginning\u201d. The public image of Kerviel, who came from a working-class family in a small town in Brittany before working his way up at the bank, has gradually been transformed from villain to a kind of folk hero fighting against the power of the banking world. Before his prison term, he met the Pope and walked from Rome to France in a kind of pilgrimage against the excesses of the financial system. A separate civil case is due to open this month before an appeals court to decide how much Kerviel has to pay the bank towards the losses. He had initially been ordered to pay \u20ac4.9bn in damages to the bank, the full trading loss, but that was overturned. French investigators are also currently weighing Kerviel\u2019s request for a retrial of the criminal case. Kerviel mounted a fresh legal challenge after Nathalie Le Roy, the police officer who led the Kerviel investigation in 2008 and 2012, last year expressed concerns about how she was pressured to focus solely on evidence that would incriminate him, and said Kerviel\u2019s superiors must have known what he was doing. The financial police contested her account.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct shares have closed up more than 5% at 383.2p, adding a cool \u00a365m to the value Mike Ashley\u2019s stake. On that note, we\u2019ll close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bloomberg have helpfully captured the testimony from Unite about the Victorian workhouse conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse: Despite Mike Ashley\u2019s admissions of failings, he\u2019s still guilty of growing rich from treating humans like battery hens, writes my colleague Aditya Chakrabortty: If we learned one thing from Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley today, it is that he\u2019s not Santa Claus. He enjoyed repeating this message to MPs. Instead, he\u2019s a hardworking billionaire who just can\u2019t keep on top of everything in his company. Employees on wages that were effectively illegally low? True enough. Temp workers offered permanent jobs in return for sexual favours? No worse than what happens at Sainsbury\u2019s. Docking pay for anyone turning up a minute late? If it happened to one of Ashley\u2019s kids he wouldn\u2019t be too impressed. On he went, in a mealy-mouthed exculpation for utterly immoral behaviour. You wouldn\u2019t have thought, listening to the human bulldozer that he ran a warehouse ruled by fear. Where workers were expected to walk 20 miles a day and blared at over a tannoy. Where men too scared to call in sick instead went in and suffered a stroke. Where ambulances were called out to deal with births and miscarriages \u2013 including a woman who gave birth in the loos. All this happened at one of the key sites of the Ashley business \u2013 but to listen to the man, it was all down to overzealous managers and, besides, he couldn\u2019t be expected to keep an eye on every part of operations..... Here\u2019s Aditya\u2019s full take: Piers Hillier, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management, has issued a statement explaining his company\u2019s concerns. \u201cToday\u2019s select committee hearing has highlighted that significant corporate governance failings amongst the management of Sports Direct still exist and are yet to be addressed. We firmly believe that, over the long term, shareholder value is intrinsically linked to corporate governance and companies ignore this at their peril. \u201cIn our view, the long list of corporate governance failings at Sports Direct, highlighted at today\u2019s hearing, are a contributing factor in its fall from the FTSE 100. \u201cMr. Ashley frequently suggested at the hearing today that he has no oversight or knowledge of large parts of the company\u2019s business; this is extremely concerning for investors. It is critical that these issues are addressed and the likelihood of this being achieved will be greatly increased by strengthening independent oversight on the board.\u201d Royal London\u2019s stake in Sports Direct is worth \u00a33.85m, or around 0.2% of the company (not 0.0.2% as I wrote earlier, sorry) Sports Direct shares have been climbing this morning, and are now up 5%. That may show relief that Ashley didn\u2019t reveal fresh trading problems, or optimism that he might beef up the company\u2019s management. Other retailers are also rising, though, after a report showed spending rose in May. City AM have rounded up the best quotes from Mike Ashley\u2019s appearance: On being the boss: \u201cI can\u2019t be responsible for everything that goes on at Sports Direct. I can\u2019t be.\u201d On giving it his all: \u201cI can only do my best but my best might not be good enough.\u201d On corporate bonding: \u201cI dunno what you call it. Fun day? Corporate day? We call its Sports Direct day.\u201d \u201cThe value of Sports Direct is its people.\u201d On BHS: \u201cI can\u2019t resist it: 100 per cent I wanted to buy BHS.\u201d On ignoring PR people: \u201cI won\u2019t listen to them because I can\u2019t be house trained\u201d On why he gets up in the morning: \u201cI didn\u2019t build Sports Direct, Sports Direct built me.\u201d On whether or not he is Santa: \u201cI\u2019m not Father Christmas, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll make the world wonderful.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m Santa Claus.\u201d On answering questions from MPs: \u201cI\u2019m one human being! So stop it Paul! Let\u2019s keep things positive!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been positive so far, stop making it negative.\u201d On women in the workplace: \u201cWhat do you call it...sexual...within the office? Harassment!\u201d On ending sexual harassment: \u201cSimple as that fellas. Not just fellas. Girls. Sorry.\u201d On sexual harassment at Sainsbury\u2019s: \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not happening Sainsbury\u2019s? I think it probably is.\u201d On managers creeping on women: \u201cThey\u2019re repugnant, they\u2019re disgusting\u201d And here are some video clips: At least one City shareholder isn\u2019t impressed by Mike Ashley\u2019s admissions: They hold less than 0.2% of Sports Direct, though, compared to Ashley\u2019s 55%. City journalists have grumbled for years that Mike Ashley has failed to communicate with the press, in a way that isn\u2019t acceptable for the founder of a major company. But he has made some amends today, with a performance that few observers will forget. Crucially, Ashley has confirmed that standards at his company fell far below acceptable standards, as the Guardian exposed last year. In a significant admission, he said that the company failed to pay its workers the minimum wage, due to forcing them to queue for 15 minutes for intrusive security checks at Shirebrook. That\u2019s a breach of the law. Ashley also revealed that the company is being investigated by HMRC about this, and developing a deal to give staff backpay. He insisted, repeatedly, that he\u2019s been unpleasantly surprised to learn how staff have suffered at Shirebrook. For example, he\u2019d be unhappy if his own children were fined for being a minute late, as many staff have been. And he even conceded that too many agency staff were employed on zero-hours contracts -- another long-overdue admission. But although Ashley admitted that the buck stops with him, there were plenty of excuses too. He claimed that the boom in internet shopping had been a complete surprise, meaning Sports Direct obviously had to take on an army of agency workers. However, it\u2019s 21 years since Jeff Bezos founded Amazon. A retailer of Ashley\u2019s undoubted nous had plenty of warning that customers might perhaps choose to buy their Sports Direct socks online. And other companies have managed to embrace 21st century work patterns without creating Victorian workhouse conditions (as Unite put it). Ashley tried to set expectations, declaring: \u201cI\u2019m not Father Christmas, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll make the world wonderful. And at one point, he argued that the six-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out system could work, if \u201cexecuted correctly\u201d. But he also conceded that some parts of the system weren\u2019t fair - but haven\u2019t yet been fixed. That should have been a key issue for Ashley\u2019s precious internal review to address - given reports that staff are afraid to take time off work, or penalised for wearing the wrong clothes. Ashley argued that it\u2019s impossible for him to know \u201cevery single thing that happens in Sports Direct.\u201d, but he was worryingly vague about how Sports Direct had allowed the situation to deteriorate so much. His open admissions seemed to fox the committee, especially when Ashley freely conceded that Sports Direct has probably outgrown him. Ashley seemed to genuinely believe that he\u2019s better qualified than the unions to monitor workers\u2019 welfare - even though a staff member gave birth in the toilets because she was scared to take time off work. If Ashley was truly serious about fixing this situation, surely he would do more than agree to see Unite at his annual AGM. And the allegations that female workers were called \u2018fresh meat\u2019, and offered a permanent position in return for sexual favours, need to be fully investigated. The session ended with the remarkable scenes of Ashley ignoring his PR man and declaring his desire to rescue BHS from collapse. All terribly entertaining - but a cynic might wonder if this revelation might take our attention off Shirebrook. Full coverage of the session with Mike Ashley starts here. And coverage of the evidence from Unite, and from the agencies who supply Sports Direct, start here. Ashley has left the building.... Committee chair Iain Wright tries to get Ashley to agree to some concrete points. Q: Will you commit to a review of senior management at Sports Direct? Ashley suggests that he\u2019s got no problem with an independent review, but defends his decision to hold his own inquiry first. Wright then turns to some off-piste issues -- panicking Ashley that he might get asked about his freshly relegated Newcastle United. But no..... Instead, Wright turns to another retail crisis- the collapse of BHS. Q: Do you think Sir Philip Green [head of Arcadia] has done anything wrong? PR man Keith Bishop tries to earn his fee by telling the committee that Ashley won\u2019t comment. Q: Did you want to buy BHS? That\u2019s another unfair question, Bishop replies. Fair enough, Wright replies... and starts to thank Ashley for coming. But Ashley can\u2019t keep his mouth shut..... blurting out: I can\u2019t resist it. Yes, 100% I wanted to buy BHS. And he explains that he always thought there was real logic in fitting the two companies together. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m a saint.... it\u2019s because we could have made a successful business. [Background: BHS went into liquidation last week, putting 11,000 jobs on the line]. Wright asks if Ashley will reveal what happened one day. You\u2019ll find out a lot eventually, Ashley grins back. And that is the end of a remarkable session. Q: Do you admit that there have been aspects of business at Sports Direct that have made workers more exposed to exploitation? Ashley tries to dodge this question.... returning to his point about the security queues were too long. And then he insists that the review of working practice is ongoing -- It will carry on when I\u2019m in the grave. Q: Will you commit to meeting with Unite about their concerns? Mike Ashley looks highly reluctant to hold a special meeting with the union. Instead, let\u2019s have a meeting at our AGM in September. Everyone\u2019s welcome, he claims -- surprising journalists who were banned from last year\u2019s gig. Q: Why wait until September? You could meet Unite now. Ashley suggest the union is concerned about furthering its interests, not the workers. He then admits that he \u201csaid hello to them last year\u201d at the AGM \u2013 [hardly a wide-ranging discussion of the situation] Q: Could you sign up to a 10-point list of improvements, asks Iain Wright MP (clearly keen to get some commitments out of his witness). Ashley suggests that he might.... Q: Do you have confidence in the agencies you have used? Yes....but I\u2019ve also been surprised by the mistakes that have been made, such as the queues to get through security. Q: Well, who\u2019s to blame and who has the ultimate responsibility? Ultimate responsibility is mine, Ashley replies. I build this company. And then he repeats that Sports Direct may have now outgrown his ability to run it. This really isn\u2019t a typical performance from a top UK boss. Ashley is now arguing that he can\u2019t just wave a magic wand to fix everything that\u2019s gone wrong. But he\u2019s committed to fixing it - as long as MPs have a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of what can be achieved. The committee look stunned.... Paul Blomfield MP tries to nail Ashley down - is it fair that temporary workers employed through Transline aren\u2019t able to take work elsewhere? If it\u2019s true, then it\u2019s clearly unreasonable, Ashley replies. You can answer your own question. Q: So why did you allow it? I don\u2019t take all the decisions, an impassioned Ashley hits back (and hits the table another two dozen times). Q: But aren\u2019t you negligent for not knowing the full details of how staff were employed? Let\u2019s say I had \u201cno idea\u201d, Ashley replies ruefully. That\u2019s not fair.... Ashley\u2019s mask of bonhomie is slipping -- he loses his cool with Paul Blomfield MP for questioning his claim that internet shopping forced Sports Direct to take on thousands of agency workers. You must accept that this was a phenomenon that we couldn\u2019t predict, and also accept that we\u2019ve made mistakes, says Ashley \u2013 giving his table a fearful thumping. Blomfield\u2019s point, though, is that other retailers have adjusted to e-commerce without such problems. Ashley says that agencies are experts at what they do that\u2019s why they use them. Really? I was hired after responding to an ad and then filling in a form, plus a very quick interview with somebody who only spoke broken English. The clincher was being asked if I could turn up at 5am the next day. I could, so I was in. [And that led to the investigation that exposed the conditions at Sports Direct] MPs are pushing Ashley to promise to take on more permanent staff. He argues that Sports Direct can\u2019t suddenly hire an army of permanent staff -- and he claims it was \u201cphysically impossible\u201d to predict internet shopping. Q: Would you consider taking on more permanent staff, rather than using zero hours contracts? Why not, why not, replies Mike Ashley. Permanent staff can deliver a better service for a company after all. We have moved hundreds of staff from zero hours contracts onto permanent roles, he adds. Some reaction from a frankly stunned financial press: A classic Freudian slip from the Sports Direct boss. Asked if he\u2019d seek independent help in changing its management structure, Ashley says it\u2019s hard to create a process to create a better \u201cincome\u201d. I think he means outcome. But Ashley is a billionaire, so maybe it\u2019s the same thing. Q: Has Sports Direct outgrown your ability to manage it? Probably, a long time ago, Ashley freely agrees. Q: You compared it to a small boat turning into a supertanker. So perhaps you should consider hiring someone who knows how to steer it? Again, Ashley agrees, saying he\u2019s been shocked by the evidence he\u2019s heard today. Some of the things you\u2019ve said today have shown that it\u2019s definitely outgrown me, he adds. What about the allegations that temporary workers were offered a permanent job in return for sexual favours? That\u2019s clearly wrong, Ashley agrees. And then he suggests that it probably happens at Sainsbury\u2019s too! Another bizarre moment, as Ashley is asked if he\u2019s a kind person. His PR man, Keith Bishop, tries to answer but is brushed aside. Jonathan Reynolds MP says Ashley\u2019s open performance means he doesn\u2019t need to bring a PR executive in future. We\u2019ll halve your fee Keith, Ashley jokes. Ashley then concedes that it wasn\u2019t kind for a worker to be told that she was selfish for leaving work on time. Q: Are you being investigated by HMRC for paying less than the minimum wage? Yes, Ashley admits. Ashley defends using agencies to supply workers - saying they are the experts in this area. He\u2019s now blaming the boom in online shopping, which has meant Shirebrook needed more and more workers. He admits that the warehouse doesn\u2019t yet have the automation it needs (something we flagged up in our investigation). And he admits that the queues at security have been unacceptable. I\u2019ve never quite seen a performance from a CEO like this one. Ashley just told MPs that \u201cI\u2019ve not always been on my game, but if you judge that then you throw out the other 30 years when I was on my game.\u201d This makes him a tricky target to hit..... Ashley is promising progress on his independent review within 180 days.... There\u2019s some curious note-passing going on too.... Mike Ashley then explains that retail is unpredictable - it rains sometimes, don\u2019tya know. Working out how to supply stock across a whole retailer is an art. Q: So, is it correct that 80% of Sports Direct staff are on zero-hours contracts? Couldn\u2019t some move onto a permanent contract? Yup, Ashley grunts, and then gives his table another thumping. It\u2019s a reasonable idea, and he intends to make progress on it. Q: Are you happy that a Sports Direct worker was called selfish, for ending their shift on time? Mike Ashley has a think..... and asks if we\u2019re really sure that happened. Q: We\u2019ve got the evidence here... Oh well, in that case it\u2019s clearly wrong. Asked about pay, Ashley says 80% of directly employed staff in stores are on some kind of bonus structure. Q: Are you happy with the six strikes policy at the warehouse? Yes, if it\u2019s implemented fairly, says Ashley. There\u2019s then a brief moment of levity, as the chairman Iain Wright says Ashley sounds like a government minister (pledging an ongoing review). The committee ask Ashley about reports of Sports Direct staff getting drunk in the local city centre I can\u2019t stop people drinking, Ashley replies... What would you do about it, he asks? He\u2019s reminded that the MPs are asking the questions.... Q: Why were so many ambulances called to Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse? It\u2019s excessive, Ashley replies. But he suggests that staff have been overhasty - calling 999 when they could have just given the worker a glass of water. Q: I don\u2019t think calling an ambulance when a worker gives birth in the toilets is excessive... Ashley is silenced (briefly....) Q: Are you aware that a worker was promised sexual favours in return for a permanent position? I\u2019m 100% unaware of that, Ashley insists. We\u2019ve waited a long time for Ashley\u2019s hearing -- six long months since the Guardian exposed the situation at Shirebrook. But it\u2019s been worth the wait. Q: Could MPs drop in unannounced at Shirebrook? 100%, 24-7, Ashley replies. Anyone here is free to do it. I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019ll find things wrong, he adds - but things are getting better. Q: Are workers now getting paid overtime for working late? (the Guardian exposed that it didn\u2019t happen) Not yet, Ashley says. Q: And are you still haranguing workers over the tannoy system? Thumping the table again, Ashley claims this is a bit of a myth. We do use the tannoy, but to tell staff where to go - like an airport, directing passengers to their gate. If we are abusing it, we deserve the cane. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s within the committee\u2019s remit.... The committee now turn to the various offences that can get a worker Struck Out. Q: Why do you dock workers 15 minutes pay if they are one minute late? And in another major concession. Ashley acknowledges that the policy of docking workers 15 minutes of pay if they are one minute late is unfair. The Guardian\u2019s undercover reporters tested this. It also brings workers below the National Minimum Wage. Q: So who set it up? I don\u2019t know, Ashley replies. And furthermore, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. If it happened to one of my kids, I wouldn\u2019t be very impressed, he adds. A jaw-dropping moment. MPs are now asking why Sports Direct can\u2019t search workers BEFORE they check out. This is an obvious point - and almost certainly would have been done if it was that simple. But it\u2019s not as easy as that because of the current layout of the warehouse. Mike Ashley is now explaining that he knows his workers closely - he regularly eats with them in the staff canteen to find what\u2019s going on. Q: But does that mean you\u2019re the right person to investigate the allegations against the company? For as long I\u2019m at Sports Direct, the review into working practices will go on. And it will be totally independent, he replies. Ashley is now thumping the table, insisting that the review will be successful.  Q: Would you work with the Unite union to discuss the problems they\u2019ve heard? I can do a better job for the workers than Unite, Ashley declares. If you\u2019re just tuning in, Unite officials told MPs of a \u201cculture of fear\u201d at Shirebrook, which led one worker to give birth in the toilets because she was afraid to take time off. In 21st century Britain. Oh, the perils of business success.... The committee are keen to find what oversight Ashley has over Sports Direct. Waving his hands and miming typing, Ashley is explaining that the company creates thousands of reports. Staff should alert me when there are red flags and problems, not when things are running smoothly. Q: Transline [one of the agencies supplying staff] just told us that they only got 45 replies to a survey (out of 2000). Are you surprised? Ashley looks highly unsurprised - people say they want to give feedback, but they rarely take it up. That\u2019s why he prefers to talk to people on the shop floor. Q: What is the culture at Sports Direct? Miek Ashley pauses... then says it is a \u201chard-working culture\u201d, which should come with high rewards. He than concedes that he can\u2019t know absolutely everything that\u2019s going on all the time across the company which he has built. It\u2019s a truly global business, I can\u2019t keep track of all the companies we\u2019ve got across the world... it\u2019s just too big. Mike Ashley has now admitted that the searches revealed by the Guardian mean he was breaking the law by paying workers less than the minimum wage. This is a major concession and should mean sanctions from HMRC. The company said in December: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d Iain Wright MP asks about the Guardian\u2019s revelation that workers have been paid below the minimum wage as they were searched in their own time. Q: Do you accept that the company was effectively paying below the minimum wage? At that specific time.. yes, Mike Ashley admits. Q: And have you addressed it? I hope so, yes, Ashley replies. But I\u2019m not there all the time, he adds. Q: So are workers now being paid for those searches? No, Ashley replies. But the process is much faster, so \u201cliterally hundreds of people\u201d can walk through the security line each minute. Q: Have you discovered things that you\u2019re not happy with? Ashley admits that some things have come as \u201ca bit of an unpleasant surprise\u201d, and he cites the bottlenecks at the Shirehouse warehouse which have been addressed (he says). First question... Q: What\u2019s the status of the review into working practices at Sports Direct? It\u2019s an ongoing progress, says Mike Ashley. Q: When will it be completed? Never. Q: Why not, asks chairman Iain Wright? Because it\u2019s an ongoing process. Q: Are you the best person to conduct it? Ashley concedes that he doesn\u2019t have full expertise on the whole issue, but he believes he could make the most difference. Q: Who have you spoken to? All sorts of people across the operation Q: Have you spoken to the Trade Unions? No, says Ashley, but then he corrects himself and says he did have one discussion. He expects to hear from again at the company\u2019s AGM. Q: Is that the only time you speak to the unions? Yes. Mike Ashley has arrived, wearing a Newcastle United tie. His PR man, Keith Bishop, is here too. Reminder, you can watch it live here. And that\u2019s the end of the second mini-session. I can safely say that MPs were not impressed with what they heard from the two companies who supply staff to Sports Direct. Next up, Mike Ashley! More guffawing, as Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy claims that a face-to-face survey of agency workers at Shirebrook was \u201canonymous\u201d. Sports Direct workers aren\u2019t impressed with the agency\u2019s performance: (bit=but) Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy reveals that 45 staff, out of 2,000, responded to a survey about work conditions. She argues that this may show that people are happy. MPs, though, suggest it is because people are scared. Transline just said its office in warehouse has an \u201copen door policy\u201d. That\u2019s not quite how the workers view it - or I remember it. This from my piece in December: \u201cThe result seems to be a workforce afraid of the sack \u2013 but also afraid to quit and seek a job elsewhere. \u2018People won\u2019t leave because they don\u2019t think they will find anything else. Most of the Polish people who work there don\u2019t speak a word of English,\u2019 says one eastern European worker Everyone\u2019s afraid of the [employment agency] office. As soon as you go into the office you think they are probably going to sack you\u2019.\u201d Q: Do you believe that staff have been mistreated at Sports Direct\u2019s factory, asks Richard Fuller MP? I don\u2019t believe that, replies Andy Sweeney, CEO of Best Connection Group. He claims that the Unite union has misrepresented the situation at Shirebrook. He wants MPs to visit the site to see for themselves. Q: have you used the phrase \u201cNew Meat\u201d? No, Sweeney replies. It\u2019s used to describe new female workers at the factory, Fuller explains..... Q: Have you heard of people being hit, or being called selfish for finishing their shift on time? No. Committee chairman Iain Wright just brandished this table at the agency executives; it shows the various \u2018strikes\u2019 that workers can suffer. Offences include \u201chorseplay\u201d, \u201cgoing AWOL\u201d or \u201cusing a mobile phone\u201d. Six strikes and a worker is out. Q: Who set the strikes policy? Chris Birkby says Transline inherited the strikes policy when they began supplying workers to Sports Direct. Iain Wright MP points out that the policy means a worker could be dismissed if they asked for time off to visit family overseas. Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy argues that the policy protects workers  . Wearing headphones is banned, to stop someone being run over by a vehicle in the factory. The agencies are struggling to give any convincing reasons why a 336-hours-per-year contract is better than a zero hour\u2019s one. A zinger of a question from Iain Wright. After Jennifer Hardy, Transline\u2019s finance director, takes a sip of water, he asks if it\u2019s right that a Sports Direct worker would get a \u201cstrike\u201d for asking for a drink out of the designated area. Hardy agrees that this isn\u2019t right, but also suggests that employees don\u2019t want workers getting drinks all the time. Q: What have you done to improve conditions at Sports Direct? Transline\u2019s Chris Birkby says they have work to reduce queuing time to clock out, and started holding HR surgeries. We held a recent anonymous survey, and 96% of staff were satisfied, or above, he says. Transline\u2019s claim that it voluntarily withdrew from Gangmaster Licensing Authority process may surprise the GLA itself. According to the GLA, it\u2019s parent company, Qualitycourse, lost the licence after \u201c refusing to provide sufficient details relating to its travel and expenses scheme.\u201d The GLA said in a statement in 2014 that: For obstructing the inspection process, the GLA decided that the named Principal Authority on the licence, Colin Beasley, and other named directors of Qualitycourse had failed the \u2018fit and proper\u2019 person test. This is a critical requirement for a GLA licence. Another issue uncovered included workers not being paid for attending induction sessions, which failed another standard. Not exactly an \u201cadmin error\u201d..... Here\u2019s an example of the form which agency workers are handed, to sign up for a prepaid debit cards on their wages. Q: Do you feel a duty of care to the staff at Sports Direct? Yes, absolutely, the Transline representatives reply, Q: But we\u2019ve heard that the Gangmasters Licensing Authority has barred you from providing labour to the food industry. Transline\u2019s Jennifer Hardy says the company voluntarily withdrew from the application process. Q: Amanda Milling MP asks about the insurance which some agency workers are paying. Best Connection\u2019s Andy Sweeney says this insurance is optional. When the panel talks about a \u201c336 contract\u201d - they mean a contract that guarantees 336 hours over a 12-month period. This is equivalent to 1.4 hours a day, assuming a five-day week. So the distinction between 336 contracts and zero hour contracts is effectively meaningless. Q: Why are some workers being paid on pre-paid cards? (with those steep fees which Unite are so concerned about) Chris Birkby, Managing Director of agency group Transline, says the cards are optional. He defends them, saying they let workers get their wages quickly, and avoid being hit by high charges elsewhere. It\u2019s there to help workers, he insists. Andy Sweeney of Best Connection (the other agency firm engaged at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse) says his firm doesn\u2019t offer these cards. Q: Where do the fees go? Birkby says some goes to Contis, the company which supplies the cards. But there is also a fee to Transline. Q: Why are agency workers on contracts only guaranteeing 336 hours per year? That\u2019s that\u2019s the minimum requirement set by HMRC. The committee are now hearing from the two agencies who provide workers to Sports Direct. Jennifer Hardy, Finance Director, Transline has just confirmed that Sports Direct sets the wage rates inside the warehouse. Mike Ashley had previously said that Sports Direct pays the agencies a fee and they take their cut, implying that he had nothing to do with the rates of pay. Some instant reaction from the committee: Here\u2019s our news story about the revelation that Sports Direct is going to compensate its staff, for effectively paying below the minimum wage: Q: What needs to be done to fix these problems? Steven Turner singles out the pernicious impact of zero hours contracts. New Zealand have outlawed zero hours contracts - and the companies who used them have managed to move onto rosters. He also wants the Gangmasters licensing authority given more authority to control agencies. And that\u2019s the end of the hearing. The Health and Safety executive needs to take a closer took at Sports Direct, and other warehouses, Turner adds. Q: Is Sports Direct willfully causing these problems, or is it a managerial misunderstanding? Turner says it\u2019s a \u201cdetermined business model\u201d, set by the top. There is no need to employ workers through these agencies, with on zero hours contracts or short-term contracts. If you cut out the agencies, you could pay staff more. Sports Direct has a \u201ccontempt for human rights\u201d, Turner continues, as he continues to lambast Mike Ashley for the problems at Shirebrook. Q: Who do you blame for the culture at Sports Direct? Unite\u2019s Steven Turner pins the blame firmly on Mike Ashley. It comes from the top, he says. There is \u201carrogance and contempt\u201d at the top of the company. We\u2019ve seen it described as a workhouse, not a warehouse. Staff call it a gulag. Q: What is the culture within Sports Direct? There is a culture of fear, says Luke Primarolo. People are scared. People are scared because they are working under a system when they know they could lose their employment at any moment. And he cites the \u201cstrikes\u201d which the Guardian exposed last year - such as taking a day off for a sick child or spending too long in the toilet. Six strikes and you\u2019re out. This is making people ill, Primarolo insists, and making workers a danger to themselves and others. He says there have been 110 ambulance call outs, 38 times when workers complained of chest pains. Unite have also found there were five instances of births, miscarriages of pregnancy issues, including one workers who have birth in the Sports Direct toilets. Q: Surely you\u2019re not saying you\u2019d get a strike for giving birth? You can get a strike for being ill too much. One of the Guardian\u2019s undercover journalists was offered one of these cards when he gained a job in the warehouse. Workers issued with these prepaid cards are being charged \u00a310 per month, just for the privilege of getting paid, Turner says. Q: So are they being paid less than the minimum wage? Staff are signing up to a service when they get these cards, Turner explains, so it not a deduction from their gross pay. But in reality, he argues, that is what happens. Q: How common is the prepayment debit card which Sports Direct uses to pay some staff? Turner says he has never come across such a thing before. And he explains that they are offered to workers from overseas, who don\u2019t have a UK bank account. Then he explains how it works...... They are charged to get the card, plus a \u00a310 per month management fee. Then charged 75p to use it in an ATM machine, and 10p when they get a text message confirming they\u2019ve used it. Turner says the company issuing the card charges a \u00a32 per month management fee, so who is getting the \u00a38?..... Q: Have conditions changed at Sports Direct since last December? (when the Guardian exposed the issues at Shirebrook)? Turner says that there have been no significant changes, although some improvements have been made. However, the 20p per hour pay increase announced recently have addressed the minimum wage issue. Jonathan Reynolds MP asks about allegations that workers at Shirebrook are being coerced into sexual relationships. Has anything been done about it? Turner says not. Unite have written to the agencies, and only received a curt reply from one. Turner is explaining that Sports Direct\u2019s short-hours contract given to agency staff is effectively a zero hours contract. It only guarantees 336 hours per year - so workers hit that limit and find they have no guarantee of extra work. Workers have been employed at Shirebrook for four or even six years, but are still on these contracts, even though the warehouse is open 364 days a year. Turner insists: There is no legitimacy for employing workers in a precarious way... either in the workforce or the retail space. Dignity and respect and justice is vital....and it\u2019s being denied to workers in this warehouse. Q: What\u2019s different about Sports Direct that attracts such criticism? Turner says it is the company\u2019s business model, which he fears is being exported across other industries. Primarolo adds that effective backstops need to be put in place to prevent Sports Direct\u2019s practices spreading. Q: Have workers received backpay for having received less than the minimum wage (due to the searches after their shift)? Not yet, Turner says, but there have been discussions with the company and HMRC over a proposed deal. That\u2019s an important issue -- as HMRC have the powers to intervene if a company is not following the law Steven Turner says that Unite has statutory recognition at Shirebrook, but only represents around 200 workers. There\u2019s no recognition for the thousands of agency workers. He adds that there\u2019s not been any agreement on pay for several years, the only discussions have related to the minimum wage issue. Luke Primarolo says there is no statutory recognition with SPD\u2019s retail workers. Chairman Iain Wright asks what input Unite have had into Mike Ashley\u2019s review of working practices. No input, Turner replies. The hearing is underway. First up.... Steven Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite Union, and regional Unite officer Luke Primarolo. You can watch it here, or on Parliament Live. The press pack locked outside the hearing are getting restless, particularly Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville: There\u2019s a small demonstration outside parliament against working practices at Mike Ashley\u2019s company: The committee are hearing from Sports Direct staff in a private session, according to The Times\u2019s Deirdre Hipwell: And that means reporters aren\u2019t allowed in yet. We should be underway shortly... Today\u2019s hearing will be broadcast live on the internet: Business, Innovation and Skills Committee: Working practices at Sports Direct (right-click to open in a new tab) Crowds are gathering at the House of Commons, with 30 minutes until the hearing begins. Reminder: Ashley is the headline act, at 11am, after MPs have heard from unions and recruitment firms (here\u2019s the agenda) My colleague Graham Ruddick points out that Mike Ashley has reinforcements at today\u2019s hearing: Last Friday, Ashley surprised the committee by announcing that he couldn\u2019t attend today\u2019s meeting as his lawyer wasn\u2019t free. He then changed his mind on Sunday and said he would turn up, perhaps stung by Iain Wright\u2019s suggestion that he had something to hide... Are grim working practices a price worth paying? That\u2019s not a question we\u2019d usually ask. But according to Jeremy Baker, retail analyst and affiliate professor at Europe Business School, workers at the bottom of the jobs ladder can\u2019t expect to be treated well until they\u2019ve \u201cworked their way up\u201d and proved they deserve better. He told the Today Programme that the BIS committee must realise there is a \u201cglobal labour force out there\u201d; people willing to be exploited in return for a wage. We can\u2019t just shouldn\u2019t push for \u201cdecency and middle-class values\u201d without seeing the cost in a global economy, he declares. Host John Humphrys gamely argues that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, as listeners tweet their disapproval: BIS committee chairman Iain Wright isn\u2019t impressed either, asking if we really want a Victorian world where the mill owner occasionally throws some coins down for his staff to scrabble over? Iain Wright, chairman of the Business, Innovation and Skills committee, says he wants Mike Ashley to answer the allegations against his company. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: Essentially we want to ask Mr Ashley are working conditions getting better? Not Just at the factory warehouse Shirebrook, but at retail outlets up and down the country. Wright is also planning to press Ashley on the allegations that staff received below the minimum wage due to the 15 minute-long searches after their shifts. The committee are also looking into the wider issue of Britain\u2019s labour market, in an era of job insecurity and zero hours contracts. What is the balance between rights for the workers and rights for the boss? The Today Programme has also spoken to some shoppers at Sports Direct\u2019s Oxford Street. One admitted that he\u2019d heard staff were treated \u201creally, really poorly\u201d, but he still shops at Sports Direct as it is cheap. Another pointed out that customers never really know how workers at any retailer are treated behind the scenes. Our undercover reporters took these videos last December, showing conditions inside Shirebrook: In the spirit of helpfulness, we\u2019ve pulled together the 10 questions which MPs should ask Mike Ashley today. They include: Has Ashley concluded his internal review, what were its findings and will it be made public? What has Sports Direct done to improve working conditions? How many teachers and community leaders did Sports Direct speak to during the review? After the allegations emerged about warehouse workers being paid, in effect, below the national minimum wage, Sports Direct pledged \u00a310m towards a staff pay rise. Does the company accept, therefore, that compulsory unpaid searches on staff leaving the warehouse meant they were previously receiving pay that was in effect below the minimum wage? Is Sports Direct being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs regarding the allegations that workers have been receiving pay that is effectively below the minimum wage? Has Sports Direct had any discussions with workers or their representatives about topping up wages with back pay? Ashley has said: \u201cNo Sports Direct employees are engaged in the Shirebrook warehouse on a zero-hours contract, and the main agencies have confirmed to us that none of their workers are engaged on a zero-hours contract.\u201d Can he disclose what guaranteed hours warehouse workers are entitled to? Does Sports Direct influence the hourly rates paid to agency workers? Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse is operational 24 hours a day and for 365 days a year. The facility always requires a substantial number of staff, so why are the vast majority of the workers employed on temporary contracts? Will Ashley reveal if any temporary staff have been dismissed after falling foul of a six-strikes-and-you-are-out system at Shirebrook? More details here: Mike Ashley appears to have admitted that there have been problems at the Shirebrook site, even before the hearing begins. The Daily Telegraph are reporting that Ashley has written to his 27,000 staff, saying it has been a \u201cdifficult year\u201d but pledging to defend Sports Direct\u2019s \u201cgood name\u201d today. Apparently, the letter also shows that chief executive Dave Forsey is foregoing his four year share bonus, worth as much as \u00a34m. \u201cDifficult\u201d is arguably an understatement. Sports Direct shares tumbled in December, as our investigation was immediately followed by poor trading figures. In January, SPD issued a profit warning, and in March shares slid again after Ashley told the Times that \u201cWe are in trouble, we are not trading very well\u201d. The company has also been ejected from the FTSE 100, after its value fell by around 40%. Sports Direct have issued a statement to the City, ahead of today\u2019s hearing. It confirms that executive deputy chairman Mike Ashley will answer questions about conditions at Shirebrook, and discuss the review of agency workers terms and conditions, prompted by our investigation. Ashley also pays tribute to his staff, saying: \u201cOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all of the people at Sports Direct for their hard work, commitment and amazing achievements over the years. I and the Board are proud of our people and what we stand for, and I know that we can move onwards and upwards for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\u201d Good morning. Six months ago, the Guardian revealed that working conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, fell below the standards you might expect from one of our largest retailers. Two undercover reporters discovered that staff at Mike Ashley\u2019s operation were subjected to a regime of daily searches \u2013 after their shift had ended. That meant that some were effectively being paid below the legal minimum wage, as they were forced to roll up their trouser legs and show the top of their underwear in their own time, to prove they weren\u2019t stealing stock. Things weren\u2019t any better during the shifts, we learned. Workers would be regularly chivied by tannoy, as they trudged almost 20 miles per day around the site. We also heard that local parents were afraid to take time off work when their children were ill, and at risk of being fired if they broke some bizarre rules. No wonder unions talked about a culture of fear that left workers afraid to speak out, and calling it \u201cthe gulag\u201d As Simon Goodley and Jonathan Ashby reported last December: Mike Ashley, the publicity-shy tycoon, and his business have been widely criticised for the conditions at Shirebrook \u2013 known locally as \u201cthe gulag\u201d \u2013 where up to 5,000 staff clock in each day. It is hard to discern why the place is so maligned when you first arrive, but slowly the reason emerges. Step by step, minimum-wage workers are informed of what is expected of them for the headline rate of \u00a36.70 an hour (in reality, many receive less) \u2013 including being told they will walk almost 20 miles each day inside the warehouse as they pick products off the shelves. They can occasionally be harangued by name via tannoy if they don\u2019t move quickly enough \u2013 \u201cplease speed up with your order as soon as possible\u201d, the speaker system barks \u2013 while \u201ccrimes\u201d against the company \u2013 called \u201cstrikes\u201d and including \u201cerrors\u201d, \u201cexcessive/long toilet breaks\u201d, \u201ctime wasting\u201d, \u201cexcessive chatting\u201d, \u201chorseplay\u201d, \u201cwearing branded goods\u201d and \u201cusing a mobile phone in the warehouse\u201d \u2013 are punished. Six strikes in six months and you\u2019re out. The revelations sent shockwaves through the retail industry, prompting parliament to investigate exactly what is going on. After months of prevaricating, and speculation that he could be held in contempt of parliament if he didn\u2019t turn up, Ashley is now heading to Westminster for a showdown with the Business, Innovation and Skills committee. MPs will want to know how Ashey responded to our findings \u2013 he\u2019s been personally overseeing a review for months. The committee will also be hearing from unions, and from the agencies who supply shift workers to Sports Direct. Here\u2019s the agenda: At 10.00am Steven Turner, Assistant General Secretary, Unite Union Luke Primarolo, Regional Officer, Unite Union At 10.30am Chris Birkby, Managing Director, Transline Group Jennifer Hardy, Finance Director, Transline Group Andy Sweeney, CEO, The Best Connection Group Ltd At 11am Mike Ashley, Owner, Sports Direct Keith Bishop, Keith Bishop Associates We\u2019ll have rolling coverage and instant reaction and analysis to the hearing.",

      "bodyText": "Rising numbers of millionaires in the fast-growing economies of China and India helped to push global private wealth to $168tn (\u00a3115tn) in 2015. The 5.2% increase in wealth among the world\u2019s richest individuals was driven largely by the Asia-Pacific area, which is expected to overtake western Europe as the second wealthiest region behind North America next year. The annual snapshot measures private wealth by cash, deposits and assets such as shares and bonds, but excludes property. China recorded one of the the biggest jumps in millionaire households of all countries in the BCG annual wealth report, up 27% to 2.07m. Sustained economic growth has created a new class of wealthy individuals in the world\u2019s second largest economy, including Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce business Alibaba, and the country\u2019s richest man, the property tycoon Wang Jianlin. The number of millionaire households in India jumped by a quarter last year, to 71,876. In a reflection of the global shift in economic power, the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, experienced the strongest rate of growth in private wealth, although it remained behind North America and western Europe in total wealth. Asia-Pacific was the only region to post double-digit growth, up 13% at $37tn, with China \u201cthe principal growth motor\u201d, BCG said, despite slowing economic growth in the region and increasing market volatility. \u201cChina and India have strong GDP growth and that has fuelled a lot of wealth creation,\u201d said Anna Zakrzewski, one of the report\u2019s authors. Despite the rise in global wealth in 2015, the growth rate slowed in all regions apart from Japan, where a government stimulus drive boosted asset values. BCG said the growth in global private wealth hit a \u201cspeed bump\u201d in 2015, slowing to 5.2% from 7.5% in 2014 as weaker financial markets and slowing growth weighed on most regions. However, global financial wealth is expected to continue to rise over the next few years, hitting $224tn in 2020. The TUC, the umbrella body for British trade unions, said there was still a huge gap between the wealthy and the poorer sections of society. Paul Nowak, the TUC\u2019s deputy general secretary, said: \u201cFor all the moral angst being expressed by business leaders and politicians about growing wealth inequality, very little is being done to change the status quo. \u201cUnless companies here and across the globe reign in executive salaries, pay their fair share of taxes and invest in decent jobs the yawning gap between the haves and have-nots will continue to grow.\u201d The number of millionaire households around the world grew by 6% last year to 18.5m. By 2020, millionaire households are expected to account for a 52% share of global wealth, up from 47% in 2015. The UK had 961,000 millionaire households in 2015, up 12.4%, putting it in fourth place behind the US, China and Japan. Nowak said: \u201cIt says much about current Britain, that at a time when millions are struggling to pay their rent or get a mortgage, others are paying for swimming pools and cinemas to be constructed in the basements of their homes in Chelsea.\u201d At 2%, wealth growth in North America was slowest of any region in 2015, totalling $60tn. BCG said the slowing growth rate was largely explained by falling equity prices, with the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 indices closing the year with negative returns for the first time since 2008. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to overtake North America in the global wealth rankings soon after 2020 according to BCG, although the US will remain the world\u2019s richest country. In western Europe, private wealth grew by 4.3% in 2015 to $40.8tn. It was a slower rate of growth than 2014, when riches increased by 6.1%. BCG said uncertainty about the future of the European Union and lower commodity prices weighed on equity and bond markets. The consultancy group said that private wealth growth could be further weakened should the UK vote to leave the EU on 23 June. \u201cRegional wealth [in western Europe] growth is expected to continue at rates similar to those in recent years, although this expansion could be held back by the low interest-rate environment and the potential exit of Great Britain from the European Union,\u201d BCG said in the report. \u201cFurther pressure could come from economic slowdowns in countries outside the region, such as China, in which western European nations have high investment stakes.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The company Adrian Flux has launched what it claims to be the UK\u2019s first personal driverless car insurance policy. The policy is designed for consumers who already have driverless features in their cars, such as self-parking, or are thinking of buying a car with autopilot features. Fully self-driving cars are not expected to be on the road until 2020 at the earliest, when Volvo has said it plans to launch such vehicles. Gerry Bucke, the general manager of Adrian Flux, said: \u201cWe understand this driverless policy to be the first of its kind in the UK \u2013 and possibly the world \u2026 More than half of new cars sold last year featured autonomous safety technology, such as self-parking or ABS [anti-lock braking systems], which effectively either take control or take decisions on behalf of the driver. And it\u2019s only going to continue. Driverless technology will become increasingly common in our cars over the next few years.\u201d Tesla Autopilot software, released late last year, and Nissan Motor\u2019s Infiniti Q50 technology allow drivers to take their hands off the wheel in certain circumstances. Adrian Flux said said its policy would be updated as both the liability debate and driverless technology evolved. It is estimated that human error is at least partly responsible for more than 90% of current road fatalities. As a result, a move to self-driving cars is expected to reduce car insurance premiums in the long term. Norfolk-based Adrian Flux, which has 600,000 customers, said that with the potential reduction in accidents, the new policy could be cheaper than standard ones, although other factors, such as location and overnight parking, remained important. Bucke said: \u201cWe already provide discounts for cars fitted with assistive technology, such as autonomous braking, as it has been proved to reduce accidents, and therefore claims.\u201d The driverless policy has additional features to a standardone. Customers will be covered for loss or damage in case of: failure to install vehicle software updates and security patches, subject to an increased policy excess; satellite failure or outages affecting navigation systems, or failure of the manufacturer\u2019s vehicle operating system or other authorised software; loss or damage caused by a failure to manually override the system to prevent an accident should the system fail; and loss or damage if the car gets hacked. The modern transport bill announced in last month\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech will extend compulsory cover to accidents where the car, rather than the driver, is at fault. The Association of British Industry welcomed the move and is working with the government on insurance and liability issues, to determine when manufacturers rather than drivers are responsible. Another major issue is the self-driving car\u2019s vulnerability to hacking. The Jeep manufacturer, Chrysler, was forced to recall cars after researchers showed they could take control of the car via simple text messages. Testing of driverless cars in the UK has already begun, with the government funding a number of projects. The first trial of self-driving cars in public pedestrianised areas is with the Lutz Pathfinder in Milton Keynes. It involves electric two-seater pods made by the Coventry-based engineering firm RDM and equipped with autonomous control systems developed by the University of Oxford\u2019s mobile robotics group. Volvo has announced it will start testing self-driving cars on public roads in London next year. A recent survey of nearly 1,800 customers by Adrian Flux revealed very few would consider buying one. Of those who answered \u201cnot likely\u201d to owning a self-driving vehicle, just over 45% said they didn\u2019t like the idea of giving up control to a computer, while 36% said they enjoyed driving too much to hand over the wheel.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A week after Alliance Trust announced it had received an informal approach from RIT Capital Partners about a possible \u00a35bn merger, the deal is off. RIT, chaired by British financier Jacob Rothschild, said it would not be in the best interests of its shareholders to make an offer for its fellow investment firm after all. Alliance, which has been under pressure from activist investor Elliott to make changes, has begun a strategic review and said this was making good progress. It said it would suspend any share buybacks under the review was completed. Alliance\u2019s shares have lost 5.5p to 511p on the news, while RIT is down 13p at \u00a315.91. Stephen Peters, investment manager at Charles Stanley said that despite the ending of merger talks, Alliance could not stay as it was: The announcement that RIT Capital and Alliance Trust are no longer in talks must be one of the shortest trust romances in recent memory. After a few messages and a date that got publicised and well discussed in the press, they\u2019ve decided to just be friends. Investors in RIT Capital are left untroubled, whilst Alliance Trust needs a solution to allow Elliott Advisors to sell their 16% stake. Whilst we do not wish to pre-judge the outcome of [Alliance\u2019s strategic] review, and accept the final outcome may be less radical than we would wish, we are at least comforted that there is a better and more open dialogue between the board and other interested parties, including shareholders, today than in the recent past. We are sure there are, and will be, other interested parties in Alliance Trust. The savings business is possibly its most attractive element and should have no shortage of suitors. Other investors may welcome the change to run a significant amount of assets in a closed ended form - large US based fund management houses may see it as attractive. The well-known investment trust managers in the UK would undoubtedly express an interest, although we would need some convincing that a simple merger with the likes of a Scottish Mortgage or Murray International, for instance is really in the best interests of shareholders and the sector in general. Whatever happens, the status quo is not an option.",

It said it would suspend any share buybacks under the review was completed.</p> <p>Alliance\u2019s shares have lost 5.5p to 511p on the news, while RIT is down 13p at \u00a315.91. Stephen Peters, investment manager at Charles Stanley said that despite the ending of merger talks, Alliance could not stay as it was:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The announcement that RIT Capital and Alliance Trust are no longer in talks must be one of the shortest trust romances in recent memory. After a few messages and a date that got publicised and well discussed in the press, they\u2019ve decided to just be friends. Investors in RIT Capital are left untroubled, whilst Alliance Trust needs a solution to allow Elliott Advisors to sell their 16% stake.</p> <p>Whilst we do not wish to pre-judge the outcome of [Alliance\u2019s strategic] review, and accept the final outcome may be less radical than we would wish, we are at least comforted that there is a better and more open dialogue between the board and other interested parties, including shareholders, today than in the recent past.</p> <p>We are sure there are, and will be, other interested parties in Alliance Trust. The savings business is possibly its most attractive element and should have no shortage of suitors. Other investors may welcome the change to run a significant amount of assets in a closed ended form - large US based fund management houses may see it as attractive. The well-known investment trust managers in the UK would undoubtedly express an interest, although we would need some convincing that a simple merger with the likes of a Scottish Mortgage or Murray International, for instance is really in the best interests of shareholders and the sector in general. Whatever happens, the status quo is not an option.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "One of the most ambitious \u2013 and ill-fated \u2013 private equity deals to take place before the 2007 credit crunch has been recounted in a London courtroom after financier Guy Hands began his fraud claim for at least \u00a31.5bn from Citigroup over the takeover of EMI. Hands embarked on a second attempt by his private equity firm Terra Firma to make a claim against Citi, adviser to the now defunct music group, after a US jury rejected the claim in 2010. Setting up a tit-for-tat battle over who said what to whom, Terra Firma\u2019s skeleton argument provided to the court on Tuesday said: \u201cIn a nutshell, the claim arises out of a number of fraudulent misrepresentations which were made orally by three very senior executives within Citi to Mr Hands in 2007. Those misrepresentations induced Terra Firma to bid for and acquire the music business, the EMI group.\u201d The three executives referred to are: David Wormsley, then head of UK banking at Citi, who was known as \u201cthe worm\u201d and described as a friend by Hands; Michael Klein, who was head of global banking; and Chad Leat, co-head of global credit markets. Wormsley was named in the US case six years ago. Reviving memories of the \u00a34.2bn deal in 2007, the Rolls Building courtroom in London was told that evidence would be taken from former and current bankers at Citi, which disputes the claim. Mark Howard QC, representing the bank, described the allegations as false and motivated by a desire from Terra Firma to \u201cpass the blame for a disastrous investment to someone else\u201d. Howard described how the deal took place after Terra Firma lost out in the race to buy the chemist Alliance Boots. \u201cThis was a very big prize for Terra Firma. They have a war chest of money which they\u2019ve got from the investors, they\u2019ve got to put that to good use,\u201d said Howard, describing Hands as a contrarian investor who can see what others can\u2019t. He said Citi had lost $1bn (\u00a3680,000) on the transaction. Terra Firma had put in \u00a31.5bn in equity, but by February 2011 had ceded control to Citi, which also helped it finance the deal. The judge, Mr Justice Burton, was told of evidence in phone calls, emails and handwritten notes which would support the claim by Hands that Wormsley knew that a rival bidder for EMI \u2013 Cerberus \u2013 had withdrawn its interest in bidding for EMI over a crucial weekend in May 2007, set as the deadline for offers. Wormsley, the court was told, disputed these events. \u201cYour Lordship will have to decide who is telling the truth,\u201d Lord Grabiner, representing Hands and Terra Firma, said. Grabiner read out an email sent by Jan Skarbek of Citi to a colleague, Matthew Smith, in May 2007 after the deal had been announced in which he said: \u201cWell done! I am amazed you got them to pay up for that pup.\u201d Smith replied: \u201cThanks. Can\u2019t imagine why Guy bought it \u2013 he must have a machiavellian plan. Three years of pain on this client.\u201d Another described EMI \u2013 once home to the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, as \u201ca terminally ill cancer patient on chemotherapy\u201d. The case is expected to last six weeks. Hands will give evidence on Wednesday.",

      "bodyText": "Negotiations about the shape of the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade arrangements would have to start from scratch after a leave vote in the EU referendum, the head of the World Trade Organisation said as he admitted there had been no preliminary discussions with the UK government. Roberto Azev\u00eado, the WTO director-general, said he expected any talks to be long and difficult, adding: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any discussions about the process. We don\u2019t know what the process would be. We do know it would be a very unusual situation.\u201d Trade has featured heavily during the referendum campaign, with much debate about whether a post-Brexit UK would seek to retain its membership of the European single market or aim for a looser arrangement in which exporters had the same access as other WTO members. Azev\u00eado said the position was complicated by the fact that all Britain\u2019s trade commitments had been negotiated by the EU and that these would cease to apply in the event of a decision to leave. Warning that it would be impossible for the UK to \u201ccut and paste\u201d its old EU trade deals into new agreements, Azev\u00eado said the UK would be starting from scratch without the institutional machinery necessary to negotiate trade deals. He said Britain did not have the investigative bodies that would look into issues such as steel dumping. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the official capacity. There is no institutional mechanism to conduct an investigation. That body of human resources would have to be set up fairly quickly.\u201d Azev\u00eado said he felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d being dragged into the UK\u2019s referendum debate but thought it was right to counter a great deal of misinformation about the UK\u2019s future as a WTO member. He said there had been no pressure on him from the government to speak out. \u201cBritain is a member of the WTO and will continue to be a member of the WTO. But it will be a member with no country-specific commitments. We have had no other situation like that,\u201d he said. One of the leading figures on the leave side, Prof Patrick Minford, has said Britain could avoid protracted negotiations by adopting a free trade approach, under which the UK would impose no barriers on goods and services entering the country. Minford said this would help the economy by making imports cheaper. Azev\u00eado said this would be an all-or-nothing approach: \u201cIf you are a duty-free country, you can\u2019t be selectively duty-free. If you want to go duty-free, you have to go duty-free across the board. There can be no tariffs on anything, including agriculture and steel.\u201d The WTO director-general has been seeking reductions in protectionism from member countries as part of his organisation\u2019s mission to promote free trade. He said: \u201cIf everybody went in a duty-free direction it would be a golden time for classical and orthodox economics.\u201d Noting that only Macau and Hong Kong adopted a complete duty-free approach, Azev\u00eado said: \u201cI recognise reality for what it is. I think it is very unlikely it (a duty-free world) is going to come to pass.\u201d Azev\u00eado, who has been struggling to bring to a conclusion the Doha round of liberalisation talks which began in 2001, said he had no idea how long it would take the UK to negotiate trade deals afresh in the aftermath of a leave vote. \u201cIt is very difficult to predict. Russia\u2019s accession to the WTO took 20 years. Other negotiations happened faster. It will be a very high risk bet to hope that negotiations would be quickly completed and that negotiations would be uneventful,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The eurozone\u2019s reputation as the laggard of the global economy appeared to be overly pessimistic, after revised figures showed annual GDP growth in the currency bloc edged higher to 1.7%. Eurostat, the official data agency for the European Union, showed that GDP growth in the first quarter was 0.6%, after being trimmed to 0.5% in an earlier estimate, pushing the annual growth rate up from the previous estimate of 1.6%. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 was also revised up to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3%. Eurostat pointed out that an increase in investment was among the biggest factors in the boost to GDP across the eurozone along with a rise in exports of 0.4%, though the eurozone\u2019s healthy trade balance was slightly eroded by a rise in imports of 0.7%. It added that the US economy expanded by just 0.2% in the first quarter. Campaigners for the UK to remain in the EU are likely to welcome the figures, which show the rise in eurozone growth and the 0.5% average rise in GDP for the 28 countries of the EU outstripping the UK\u2019s 0.4% growth rate in the first three months of the years. Among the largest economies in the EU, France grew at 0.6%, Germany 0.7% and Spain 0.8%. Italy could only manage a 0.3% growth rate while Greece contracted by 0.5%, Poland slipped by 0.1% and Hungary suffered a 0.8% drop in national income. In the fourth quarter of 2015, GDP grew by 0.4% across the 19-member eurozone and 0.5% across the EU. In May, the European commission forecast euro area growth of 1.6% and EU growth of 1.8% in 2016. If the current momentum is maintain, analysts said these figures would need to be revised upwards, though most have warned that this depends on the UK voting to remain in the EU. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, warned that uncertainty surrounding global growth could slow regardless of the referendum vote. He said: \u201cIt is probable that eurozone GDP growth will soften in the second quarter. Global economic uncertainties and problems are still a handicap for Eurozone growth not only through limiting exports but also through limiting the upside on business and consumer confidence. \u201cIt is also notable that first quarter growth was clearly helped in some countries (notably Germany) by the mild weather helping construction activity. \u201cNevertheless, there are important positives for eurozone economic activity and we believe it should be able to sustain steady growth around 0.4% quarter-on-quarter. \u201cConsequently we expect eurozone GDP growth to come in at 1.7% in 2016, which would be up slightly from 1.6% in 2015 and the best performance since 2010.\u201d",

The value of takeovers of UK companies by foreign firms rose to \u00a349.4bn between January and March, the highest since the second quarter of 2007, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This compares with \u00a39.2bn at the end of 2015. Shell\u2019s \u00a335bn takeover of BG Group accounted for most of the first-quarter total. The number of deals fell, however, from 49 to 29 in the fourth quarter. The value of takeovers between UK companies rose to \u00a311.6bn, up from \u00a31.2bn in the fourth quarter and the highest since the end of 2008. This reflected BT Group\u2019s acquisition of mobile operator EE, Britain\u2019s largest mobile phone network. The deal was valued at \u00a312.5bn including debt, which was not included in the ONS figures. Overall, there were 114 domestic and cross-border acquisitions and mergers involving UK companies in the first quarter, valued at about \u00a368bn. The number of acquisitions made abroad by UK companies fell to 22, the lowest since the end of 2013. The ONS said: \u201cDespite quarter-on-quarter volatility, the total number of mergers and acquisitions involving UK companies remains at a historically low level of activity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shell added $1bn (\u00a3690m) to its estimate of gains from the takeover of BG Group as it set out a plan to support its dividend in an era of low oil prices. In a presentation to investors, the Anglo-Dutch company said it expected cost savings from the \u00a335bn takeover of BG to be $4.5bn, up from an earlier estimate of $3.5bn. The deal, completed in February, was the biggest in the energy sector for a decade. Some investors doubted the wisdom of buying BG as oil prices plunged after the announcement but Shell has argued BG gives it a leading position in deepwater production and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which allows gas to be shipped around the world in tankers. Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe BG deal is an opportunity to accelerate the reshaping of Shell. Integration is gathering pace, and today we expect to deliver more synergies, and at a faster rate.\u201d He said the pledges Shell made to shareholders when the BG takeover was announced remained intact. They included $30bn of asset sales, less debt and maintaining Shell\u2019s dividend, which is an important income source for many pension fund investors. Shell, Britain\u2019s biggest company with a market value of \u00a3138bn, said that low oil prices were reducing its free cashflow and that this could continue for some time. The energy sector has been forced to cut costs after the price of Brent crude plunged from $115 a barrel in summer 2014 to less than $30 at the start of this year. Oil has since staged a partial recovery and was $50.57 a barrel on Tuesday morning. To generate cash, Shell plans to push down capital spending to the low end of its $25-30bn range and cut operating costs by 20% to $40bn by the end of this year. Shell stuck to its $30bn target for asset sales by 2018 and said new projects since the end of 2014 should add $10bn to cashflow by that time. The company also set out plans to invest in new energy sources such as low carbon biofuels, solar and wind. Van Beurden said: \u201cBy capping our capital spending in the period to 2020, investing in compelling projects, driving down costs and selling non-core positions, we can reshape Shell into a more focussed and more resilient company, with better returns and growing free cashflow per share.\u201d Shell shares rose 1.3% to \u00a317.34.",
