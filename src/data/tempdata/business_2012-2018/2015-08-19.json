      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index has slipped to its lowest level since January as global investors reacted to concerns that a slowdown in China will undermine demand for oil and industrial metals in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Weak data from the US helped drive fears that global growth is slowing and commodity prices have much further to fall, hitting mining and oil stocks in London as well as shares across Europe. The selloff began in China on Wednesday, where an initial slump of 5% in the Shanghai Composite Index was reversed as authorities signalled their continued financial support for higher prices. However, US figures revealing lower than expected inflation and a glut in oil production then hit stock markets in Europe, as investors expressed concerns that a global slowdown could accelerate. Mining conglomerate Glencore was the biggest faller as the FTSE 100 sank almost 2% to 6403. The company, which owns a vast array of mines from Chile to Norway, lost almost 10% of its value, bringing its total loss to more than 40% since May or \u00a318bn. Rival miners Rio Tinto and Anglo American, which saw share price declines of 3.5% and 4.5% respectively, were also dragged lower in a febrile market that saw billions of pounds lost by several of Britain\u2019s major corporations. Any euphoria following the Greece deal with Brussels that had sent continental stock markets higher earlier in the week evaporated as fears over China and the direction of global trade took centre stage. The German Dax fell more than 2% to 10682 while the Paris-based CAC was down 1.7% at 4844. The Dow Jones in New York closed almost 1% down. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cMarkets are looking east and don\u2019t like what they are seeing. Slowing economic growth, currency devaluation and stock market mayhem in China have hit commodities and mining stocks, and with them the UK stock market. \u201cThe fact UK stocks fell so steeply despite Germany signing off on the Greek bailout underlines how peripheral this issue has now become, and how quickly the market can switch its focus,\u201d he said. The FTSE 100 index is heavily skewed to oil and mining companies. Together they make up about of a fifth of the index. The combined loss of value for the mining sector was 4.7%, taking it to its lowest level since 2009. Oil prices also registered losses after falling about 4%. US crude hit a six and a half year low and threatened to break below $40, after figures showing an unexpectedly large stockpile reinforced concerns about a growing global oil glut. US crude inventories rose by 2.6m barrels last week to 456.21m, the government\u2019s Energy Information Administration said. The figures stunned energy market analysts on Wall Street, as well as traders and investors who had been expecting a cut in the stockpile. US over-production stems in part from a new generation of fracking plants, many of them uneconomic at current prices, maintaining operations. The oil-rich middle east countries have kept pumping at levels more aligned with a strongly recovering world economy. But reductions in global demand for oil, especially in south east Asia, have created a mismatch between supply and demand, forcing a return to rock-bottom prices last seen at the beginning of the year. The price of Brent, the global benchmark for oil, was down $1.72, or 3.5%, at $47.09 a barrel. Prices traded above $110 before a decline last summer that followed worse than expected manufacturing and industrial production figures from China. A recovery in the spring pushed oil above $60, but renewed fears of a global slowdown has seen prices fall by a third since June. The intentions of the US Federal Reserve are also unsettling investors. The US central bank could raise interest rates as soon as next month after a series of speeches by boss Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed was readying itself for a rise. Minutes of its last meeting showed that many of its voting members believe the date of a rate rise is nearing. But several weeks of lacklustre US figures and the worsening situation in China could derail their plans and force a delay until next year. Robert Parkes, a strategist at HSBC, said he believed the pessimism surrounding China was overdone and the picture would brighten in the coming months. He expects China to react to the deteriorating situation with a cut in interest rates that would stimulate domestic demand and boost growth in the second half of the year.",

      "bodyText": "There has been no shortage of disturbing trends in Asian foreign exchange markets this year, even before China shocked traders last week with its unilateral devaluation of the yuan. The Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah have been in freefall for months, and the Thai baht was haemorrhaging support long before the Bangkok shrine bombing. Figures showing that emerging markets have suffered a near-$1tn (\u00a3640bn) outflow of funds over the last year give another indication that countries billed as the stars of the post-crash economy are now waning. According to a compilation of official data and estimates by the investment bank NN Investment Partners, total net capital outflows from the 19 largest emerging market economies reached $940.2bn in the 13 months to the end of July. The Netherlands-based bank said the figure was almost double the net outflow during the nine months following the 2008 banking collapse. Asia is not the only area to suffer. Turkey, Brazil and Mexico are among the other emerging economies to see capital flight back to the US and Europe. As their currencies shrink in value, it takes more cash to fund foreign debt payments in dollars. The report shows that emerging markets have spent vast portions of their foreign reserves to meet obligations that were much less onerous only a year before. Investors quitting emerging markets either sell property and stock market assets or simply take out and repatriate cash from local banks. If returned to the US, that cash might make a lower return but there will be less risk attached. Adding to the weakening picture, the latest survey of investor sentiment by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the threat of a recession in China and a broader emerging market debt crisis have eclipsed the eurozone\u2019s woes as principal concerns. Stock markets have tumbled in response. China has already suffered one calamitous crash this year and in recent days has appeared to be on the brink of another. A 6% plunge on Tuesday in the benchmark Shanghai Composite was followed by further 5% drop on Wednesday before a recovery pushed the index to finish 1.2% up at 3,794.11 points. The volatile nature of emerging market stocks and shares is not just a symptom of thin trading in August or speculators exaggerating market movements with their heavy bets. These factors probably play a part, but analysts have placed greater weight on global trade figures that show a slowdown over the last six months. Global trade declined by 8% between December 2014 and May 2015. It had previously recovered strongly since 2009, driven largely by emerging economies feeding off a China-induced stimulus to world trade. The momentum was lost last year, however, and a head of steam that saw a 40% rise in world trade over six years has vanished. China played a big part in the slowdown after the new political leadership in Beijing announced its determination to wean the economy off cheap borrowing that had fuelled a destabilising property boom. Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Lombard Street Research and a China expert, pointed out in a report that a contraction in the money supply, led by a retreat in bank lending, illustrated how well the policy was working. She said: \u201cBroad money growth, the best indicator of overall monetary conditions in an economy, has slowed to its lowest rate on record in recent months. Over the past few years the People\u2019s Bank of China [PBoC] has introduced an alphabet soup of new monetary policy tools, but the liquidity injected through these facilities has not been large. \u201cNot only has the PBoC been sparing in doling out cash to the banks, but credit growth has remained fairly subdued \u2013 a stark contrast to 2009.\u201d She said the world was living through a deliberate rebalancing by the Chinese authorities that the west will have to accommodate in order for it to work. An overreaction in the form of competitive devaluations by the US or Japan would wreck China\u2019s efforts and bring further anxiety to world markets. The US is already pushing up the value of its currency with anticipation about a rise in domestic interest rates. The Federal Reserve could raise rates within the next couple of months, and though the higher rate is largely factored into currency markets, there will be another boost to the dollar when it happens. A second rise will probably knock emerging markets further, as the US becomes an even more attractive destination for investment funds. An expected hike in the UK, where Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has signalled a move towards 2% starting in the spring, could intensify the pressure further. Some emerging economies will fare worse than others. Turkey\u2019s lira has lost around 20% of its value against the dollar so far this year, making it one of the worst performing emerging market currencies. An inconclusive election and its proximity to fighting in Syria have played their part in fuelling fears of economic turmoil, but the broader consideration is the hefty extra $3.8bn Ankara must pay on its energy import bill and the dependence of its major corporations on borrowed funds. These funds were borrowed in dollars and are increasingly expensive to finance. Higher interest rates in the US will make the situation worse. Earlier this week, the central bank left its base interest rate unchanged at 7.5%, despite ministers\u2019 clamour for a cut. The bank knows such a move would make investing in Turkey less attractive and accelerate the flow of funds out of the country. Countries that spurned cheap dollars in the aftermath of the crash are expected to be insulated from US rate rises. For Turkey and the rest it will be a rocky ride.",

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve is inching closer to the first interest rate increase in nearly a decade, minutes of the central bankers\u2019 latest meeting indicated on Wednesday. The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) 28-29 July meeting did not mention any timetable, but did state that most members believed that economic conditions were \u201capproaching\u201d those that would warrant a rate increase. Most economists expect that rates, which have been held at near-zero since the 2008 financial crisis, will be raised at the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting on 16-17 September. But the recent collapse in China\u2019s stock markets and worries that the sell-off could spread may slow the Fed, according to some economists. The minutes said: \u201cMost judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point. Participants observed that the labor market had improved notably since early this year, but many saw scope for some further improvement.\u201d However, other FOMC members continued to be concerned that inflation remains too low. \u201cSome participants expressed the view that the incoming information had not yet provided grounds for reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to 2% over the medium term and that the inflation outlook thus might not soon meet one of the conditions established by the [Fed] for initiating a firming of policy,\u201d the minutes said. At the last meeting, the committee left interest rates unchanged at near zero but once again signalled that rates will rise later this year. Since the July meeting, some members have also expressed concerns that the slowdown in China\u2019s growth could hold back the US economy. A Bloomberg survey of economists earlier this month found that 77% expect the Fed to raise rates at the September meeting, but the markets appear less confident, with all of the main stock indices dropping slightly after the release of the minutes. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said: \u201cThe minutes noted that conditions for a rate increase are \u2018approaching\u2019, although they did not specify timing.\u201d While the job market has continued to improve, most of the Fed\u2019s members judged that there was room for more improvement and conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, she noted. But the Fed committee also noted that conditions were approaching that point. Prior to the minutes\u2019 release, the futures market had been assigning a 46% chance of a rate hike in September, which fell to 36% after the release. In a Bloomberg survey taken 7-12 August, 77% of economists said the Fed will act at the September meeting. \u201cWe still think September is in play, barring a weak jobs report between now and then,\u201d Sonders said. The minutes indicated that there was a robust debate between the doves and hawks, with the former pointing to the lack of inflation \u2013 supported by today\u2019s release of the latest consumer price index (CPI), which showed only a marginal rise in the costs of food, gasoline and other staples over the month. \u201cWe think the desire by the Fed to move off the zero bound is greater than their desire to adhere dogmatically to their 2% inflation threshold, as long as they perceive the conditions being in place to allow inflation to tick up from here. I also think the market would like to see the Band-Aid ripped off so attention can be less Fed-obsessed,\u201d said Sonders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s agreement will unlock the first \u20ac13bn of bailout cash for Greece, a day before it is due to make a \u20ac3.2bn payment to repay a loan to the European Central Bank. Here\u2019s the Reuters take: According to a statement released by ESM, the board of governors approved a proposal for a Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (FFA) with Greece, under which the ESM will provide up to \u20ac86bn in financial assistance to Greece over a period of three years. The board also adopted a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Greece, specifying the policy measures that the Greekgovernment has agreed to undertake in order to tackle the main challenges facing its economy, the statement said. The first tranche under the ESM program will be worth up to \u20ac26bn, in which \u20ac10bn will be made available immediately for bank recapitalization. The other \u20ac16bn will be disbursed to Greece in several installments, starting with a first disbursement of \u20ac13bn by August 20, followed by one or more further disbursements in the autumn. On that positive note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. So, after a teleconference call the European Stability Mechanism\u2019s board of governors - who are the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers - have agreed the programme for the \u20ac86bn bailout package. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said: Today the countries in the eurozone have mandated the ESM to make to a maximum of \u20ac86bn available to finance Greece. The programme for the coming three years goes with strrict conditions.. aiming at setting right public finances and administration and dealing with the economy and problems in the financial sector. He said Greek government hds taken credible first steps but a lot of work needed to be done to stabilise the economy in Greece and for the return of confidence in Greece and the eurozone: But the decisions taken in the last couple of weeks and especially today are a big step in that direction. The video is here. So Greece will get its money, as confirmed by European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis: Martin Selmayr, European Commssion chief of staff, says: The request by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for the European Parliament to become involved in the bailout review will be considered at the next conference of presidents, said the EP\u2019s Martin Schulz: China will have to wait a little longer before fulfilling its hope of joining the International Monetary Fund\u2019s benchmark currency basket. The fund said in a statement it was extending the current basket by nine months from the end of December to September 2016. It is set to decide in November whether China\u2019s yuan can join the Special Drawing Rights basket. The IMF said: The nine-month extension is intended to facilitate the continued smooth functioning of SDR-related operations and responds to feedback from SDR users on the desirability of avoiding changes in the basket at the end of the calendar year. The extension would also allow users sufficient lead time to adjust in the event that a decision were to be taken to add a new currency to the SDR basket. Beijing, which devalued the yuan earlier this month, is keen for its currency to have equal weighting with others such as the dollar, pound, euro and yen. Here\u2019s Reuters on the Dutch vote: The Dutch parliament on Wednesday voted down a motion calling on the government not to back a third bailout package for Greece, effectively endorsing the rescue of the debt-ridden fellow euro zone country. The motion was rejected by a margin of 81-52 in the 150-member parliament. One member of Prime Minister Mark Rutte\u2019s own party broke away to oppose the bailout, which is unpopular with Rutte\u2019s conservative voter base. Rutte said earlier that a parliamentary motion for or against the bailout was unnecessary, as it was the cabinet, not parliament, that makes policy. Rutte also easily survived a no-confidence vote called by right-wing lawmaker Geert Wilders, who deeply opposes the bailout. The Dutch parliament has expressed support for the Greek bailout package, Reuters is reporting. The FTSE 100 is down around 9.8% since its recent peak of 7103 towards the end of April. So it is close to correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from recent highs. A combination of concerns has sent investors scurrying for the exits once more. Fears about the outlook for the Chinese economy - despite a slight recovery in the country\u2019s stock market earlier - set the tone for the day and sent commodities - metals and oil - lower once more. US inflation figures came in much as expected, and did nothing to suggest the Federal Reserve would shy away from raising interest rates in September, another negative factor for the equity markets. Minutes from the Fed are due later. Meanwhile news during the afternoon that US crude stocks rose by 2.6m barrels last week instead of falling as expected sent oil sliding even further, with Brent crude now down more that 3.5% at $47 a barrel. Investors shrugged off the positive news that the Germany parliament had voted to approve the Greek bailout, paving the way for the country to receive much need cash. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slumped 122.84 points or 1.88% to 6403.45, its lowest level since 14 January Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.14 % to 10,682.15 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.75% at 4884.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.77% to 22,975.32 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.06% lower at 10,782.4 But the Athens market added 0.32% to 675.33 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 202 points or 1.15%. Back with the Dutch and the voting has begun: And here\u2019s the Alexis Tsipras letter to European Paliament president Martin Shulz: Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras reportedly wants the European parliament to joint the creditors overseeing the evaluation of its bailout: But as our Europe editor Ian Traynor points out, the German vote was the key one, and that went in favour of the Greek bailout: That was in reply to this: And we apparently have timings on the Dutch vote: Oil and markets are heading even lower after a surprise rise in US crude stocks last week, indicating once more lack of demand and oversupply. According to the Energy Information Administration, crude stocks rose by 2.6m barrels compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of a drop of 777,000 barrels. Brent crude is now down 1.5% at $48 a barrel, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 189 points or more than 1%. The FTSE 100 has lost 90 points or 1.3% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 183 points or 1.7%. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Oil prices dropped again after a surprise build of 2.6m barrels in US inventories when a decline was expected. It was the biggest build in four months and demonstrates the resilience of US oil output despite the falling price. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s comments about Greek debt in the debate in the Dutch parliament on the bailout deal: Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Wednesday he believes that eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund will be able to come to an agreement on IMF participation in Greece\u2019s latest bailout package. Dijsselbloem said that while European governments opposed any nominal writedown of Greek debt, and the IMF believed Greek debt was not sustainable as is, they will be able to find a compromise in the form of lower interest rates and longer repayment terms. Meanwhile, after Fitch upgraded Greece\u2019s debt by one notch from CC to CCC, the agency has also lifted the ratings for two of the country\u2019s banks: Fitch Ratings has upgraded the state-guaranteed long-term senior debt ratings of National Bank of Greece and Eurobank Ergasias to CCC from CC. At the same time, Fitch has affirmed Eurobank\u2019s state-guaranteed short-term senior debt rating at C. Full report here. Things now seem to be moving on in the Dutch parliament: And this will not be a comment welcomed by Germany: Germany of course is very keen that the IMF gets involved in this latest bailout. Jeroen Dijsselbloem has been speaking in the Dutch parliament. The finance minister and head of the Eurogroup is of course defending the bailout, but he admitted that the \u20ac86bn figure was \u201cuncertain\u201d and depended on the state of the Greek banks: The US market has joined in the global sell-off, which is not really a surprise. Ahead of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, investors continue to be unsettled by the outlook for China. The latest US inflation figures did nothing to dampen speculation of a US rate rise in September, adding to the downbeat mood in the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 145 points or 0.8% lower. Back with the Dutch parliament: Time for an afternoon summary: Greece is well on the way to a third bailout after the German parliament approved the \u20ac86bn plan. Some 113 MPs voted against the measures, but only 63 of the rebels were from Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc. Get the complete picture in our latest news story here The final hurdle for Greece is the approval of eurozone finance ministers, who are the governors of the currency union\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. They will be holding a conference call at 7pm CET. Recriminations over the bailout deal are causing trouble for the Dutch PM Mark Rutte who is fighting a no-confidence vote. Although Rutte is expected to win, he still had to listen to far-right populist Geert Wilders calling him \u201cthe Pinocchio of the Low Countries\u201d. Despite all this effort, Capital Economics thinks Greece could still leave the eurozone within a year. And questions are already being asked about the sale of concession rights to run Greek airports, a deal struck this week as part of a vast privatisation programme that is essential to the bailout. Away from the eurozone, US inflation increased marginally in July. But the small increase in consumer prices has not dampened expectations of a rate rise in September. The Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has defended his decision to break an election promise by backing another Greek bailout. While running for election in 2012, Rutte said Greece should not get another cent. Last month, his government backed the latest bailout for Greece, which includes a \u20ac5bn contribution from the Netherlands. Rutte told MPs. The circumstances in 2012 were different. It is not always possible to keep a promise in politics. You have to take responsibility. Although Rutte is expected to win the confidence vote, the debate puts the Dutch coalition government - and its majority of one - under strain. I\u2019ve taken the quote and figure from Dutchnews.nl Greece has almost cleared the final hurdle to its \u20ac86bn bailout, but it isn\u2019t time to break out the ouzo yet. Despite the approval of the German parliament, economics consultancy Capital Economics remains convinced Greece will be forced out of the eurozone in the next year. Grexit risks have not disappeared and are likely to flare up in the autumn when Greece fails to pass its first review and secure crucial debt restructuring, writes Capital Economics\u2019s senior European economist, Jennifer McKeown. Greece is still not out of the woods. Remember that it will have to pass regular reviews to be eligible for future aid payments. The requirement for it to run ever rising primary budget surpluses is based on forecasts for GDP to fall by a fairly modest 2.3% this year and then expand by 1.3% in 2016 \u2013 the latter assumption seems far too optimistic. Admittedly, Greece\u2019s debt redemption schedule is considerably lighter over the coming months than it has been of late, so future delays to bailout payments might not be disastrous. But note that a successful first review is also required before the creditors will consider debt restructuring and probably also before the ECB will reinstate the waiver allowing Greeks banks to access cheap loans. She also notes that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to face a vote of confidence or early elections, while IMF support is far from assured. Here is the German chancellor Angela Merkel just ahead of this vote. Job done. Now Merkel is jetting off to Brazil for a two-day intergovernmental meeting. US inflation rose slightly in July as a result of marginal increases in the prices of gas (petrol) and food. Here is a flavour of the wire report from Washington. The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1% last month after advancing 0.3% in June, marking the sixth straight month of increases... Signs of an ebb in the disinflationary trend, combined with a tightening labor market and strengthening housing sector could give the Federal Reserve confidence that inflation will eventually rise toward its 2 percent target. The US central is expected to raise its short-term interest rate next month. But given that inflation will likely remain tame because of a strong dollar, renewed weakness in oil and commodity prices, as well as China\u2019s devaluation of the yuan, the pace of monetary policy tightening is likely to be gradual. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.2 percent from June and gaining 0.2 percent from a year ago. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, ticked up 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in June. Shelter, which recorded its biggest increase in nearly 8-1/2 years, was the main contributor to last month\u2019s rise in the core CPI. The eurozone\u2019s current account surplus grew sharply in June, according to the latest official data from the European Central Bank. The current account of the euro area recorded a surplus of \u20ac25.4 bn in June 2015, reports the ECB. This reflected surpluses for goods (\u20ac27.2 bn), services (\u20ac5.7 bn) and primary income (\u20ac1.0 bn). The 12-month cumulated current account for the period ending in June 2015 recorded a surplus of \u20ac265.5 billion (2.6% of euro area GDP), compared with a surplus of \u20ac177.0 billion (1.8% of euro area GDP) for the 12 months to June 2014. Aside from the Greek debt saga, market watchers are also pretty excited about the release of the minutes of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest policy meeting, due later today. Economists will be combing through the document for clues on when the Fed will raise interest rates, after nearly a decade of keeping them on hold. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reminds us that the minutes, which relate to a policy meeting on 28-9 July, could already be a little out of date. There is the probability that the minutes are likely to be a little stale given recent events in China, and the volatility seen there, but nonetheless they should still give us an insight into the musings of those on the committee about the effects of overseas events might have on their deliberations. Furthermore they should be instructive in the context of whether any other members are also leaning in the direction of Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart when he stated earlier this month that the bar to not acting on rates was quite a high one. For now he is one member leaning in that particular direction, but if others on the committee were to also lean that way we could get a sharp reaction. Further reading: the BBC\u2019s Robert Peston explains why a rise in US interest rates is still risky. The ink is hardly dry, but doubts are already emerging about a deal to sell management rights to run 14 Greek regional airports to German company Fraport. According to Kathimerini, the consortium that won the 40-year concession for 14 Greek regional airports is asking for more guarantees and there are doubts whether the government will receive the \u20ac1.2 bn euros it was expecting from the project this year. A decision published in the Government Gazette on Monday indicated that the current coalition is ready to move ahead with the deal, which was struck in 2014 but had been in doubt until recently, the paper writes. ...However, Kathimerini understands that the consortium is asking for more guarantees from the Greek government following the uncertainty of the last few months. The group is also facing greater financing costs due to the higher country risk associated with Greece. This has raised doubts about whether Greece will able to reach its bailout target of receiving 1.2 billion euros from the agreement by the end of the year. A Fraport spokesman told Bloomberg on Tuesday. The Greek government\u2019s decision is not tantamount to the conclusion of a contract but rather offers a basis for the resumption of negotiations. JR NF Mark Harbers, finance spokesman of Rutte\u2019s liberals said all the crucial euro states now supported the bailout and there were no longer any international allies against the deal. Wilders calls this a weak argument and quotes Gandi: \u201cOnly dead fish swim with the stream.\u201d He urges the liberals to use the country\u2019s veto even if it would be isolated. Harbers says they achieved some of their demands although not everything but \u201cwe now want to leave this behind.\u201d NF More unhappiness in the Dutch parliament over the third Greek bailout: NF Think tank Open Europe is following the Dutch debate: Now for supporters of the bailout: But even here, there are digs at the Syriza government: Democrats 66 leader Alexander Pechtold: Not everyone is convinced: NF Meanwhile the debate in the Dutch parliament is well underway, with prime minister Mark Rutte facing a no-confidence motion from opposition rival Geert Wilders over an earlier pledge not to provide more emergency funding for Greece. Rutte is expected to survive the motion, while a majority of parliament supports the Greek bailout. However the debate is already proving lively. Wilders has called Rutte \u2018the Pinocchio of the lowlands\u201d and urged opposition to the bailout for \u201cthe European junkie called Greece.\u201d Nick Fletcher Breaking news: 63 German conservatives voted against the Greek bailout deal and three abstained. Last month 60 voted no and five abstained in a vote on starting the talks. So there was no big increase for the rebels among the conservative ranks. In light of the reforms that are being demanded by Greece, from cutting pensions and liberalising parts of the economy to privatisation of holiday islands and airports, Der Spiegel takes its magnifying glass to Germany\u2019s own economy, and asks, were Germany to face the humiliation of a Troika to oversee how it runs its economy - as Greece, Portugal and Ireland have had to - what might have to change? Here are the interesting answers: The first thing they would focus on would probably be the varied VAT rates, most significantly the reduced VAT rate (7%, compared to the usual 19%) paid by hotels, which the OECD has long advised should be scrapped. The burdens placed on the poor and middle class, which are considerably higher than in other industrial countries. It\u2019s widely agreed that the rich are not carrying enough of the load. A troika would likely recommend decreasing labour taxes and increasing property taxes. The liberalisation of pharmacies, allowing shops other than pharmacies to sell over-the-counter drugs, a move that has been staunchly resisted by the German pharmacy industry for years. A relaxation of the rules governing who can work in skilled manual work. Carpenters, plumbers, hairdressers and electricians are just a few of the jobs where a \u2018Meister\u2019 certificate is needed, which ensures quality, but also restricts other EU workers from entering the German labour market. A troika could force the government to sell its stakes in former state-run businesses, such as Deutsche Post and Deutsche Telekom. Many of Germany\u2019s unprofitable provincial airports might have to close under Troika orders. Greece has just relinquished control of 14 regional airports to the German airport operator Fraport, following the forced re-start of its privatisation programme. Obvious social welfare changes would be a reduction in civil servant pensions to the state pension level, as well as scrapping pensions paid to mothers for time spent outside the labour market. Possibly also a reduction in the generous parental money paid to parents for the first 14 months Lifting the ban on Sunday trading. Reuters has a useful take on how the politics of the Greek bailout plays in the Netherlands. Today\u2019s confidence vote is not only a test for prime minister Mark Rutte, but also for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, his coalition partner and the finance minister, who negotiated the deal. The debate may also show whether opposition politicians other than Wilders will seek to bring down Rutte\u2019s Cabinet, which is facing a huge challenge in trying to draft a budget for 2016 by next month. Dijsselbloem\u2019s Labour Party, the junior coalition partner, lost half its seats in the Senate in May after a disastrous performance in provincial elections. Rutte must now find support from at least two major opposition parties to achieve the majority in the Senate he needs to pass any legislation, including the budget. One potential key ally, the Christian Democrats, said Wednesday it would lobby against granting aid to Greece during the debate. Rutte\u2019s trump card in the debate and negotiations ahead is the improving Dutch economy. Voter dislike of the austerity-minded Cabinet has waned slightly since March, and Rutte and Dijsselbloem have said they now have room to make concessions to opposition parties willing to cooperate on the budget. As far as I can tell, we are still waiting for a breakdown on how German MPs voted. But Kate Connolly reports from Berlin that the figure for absences has now been revised down to 46, compared to an initial forecast of 73. As the German Bundestag completes its voting, the debate in the Dutch Parliament is just heating up. Geert Wilders, the far-right populist leader, who is one of the loudest opponents of the eurozone bailout, has compared Greece to a junkie. Unlike Spain or Germany, there is no legal obligation for the Dutch parliament to vote on eurozone bailout deals, but MPs have been recalled for their summer holidays for an emergency debate. The meeting was convened after Wilders called for a no-confidence vote in prime minister Mark Rutte. During his re-election campaign in 2012, Rutte promised that there would be \u201cnot one cent more for Greece\u201d. Oops It looks like many German MPs stayed away from the vote. Raoul Ruparel of Open Europe also suggests some members of the radical left party, Die Linke, may have changed how they voted. The size of the rebellion was slightly smaller than last month, when 119 German lawmakers voted against opening negotiations with Greece on a third bailout. But we are still waiting to hear how many of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU MPs voted against her. Breaking: MPs have approved the Greek bailout package, but a large number of MPs have voted against. A total of 454 voted in favour, 113 voted against and 18 abstained. As we wait for the result of the vote, Kate Connolly in Berlin explains the curious pro-Merkel, anti-bailout stance of the German rebels. The dynamics of this debate are interesting, not least because Merkel\u2019s conservatives, normally such a unified bunch, are so divided on the issue of Greece. The junior coalition partner, the SPD, is currently very divided on many issues - not least on the question of who should be its leading candidate for the 2017 election - but remains unanimously in favour of supporting a third bailout. So in effect the rebel conservatives can afford to rebel only thanks to the SPD and opposition Greens who are supporting Merkel. The question is to what extent that makes you a rebel. Yesterday, in a discussion with Klaus-Peter Willsch, one of the more prominent CDU rebels, in one breath he rubbished Merkel\u2019s Euro politics, and in the next, heaped praise on her as a chancellor, saying there was no one else in the party who could hold a candle to her. When asked if the vote today were to be combined with a vote of confidence in the German chancellor, he said he would always vote \u2018no\u2019 to the Euro bailout and \u2018yes\u2019 to Merkel \u201cevery time\u201d. And voting is underway... Here are some scenes from the Bundestag, ahead of the vote. Time for a caption competition? Social Democrat MP Johannes Kahrs is already talking about Greece\u2019s fourth bailout. Voting is due to start any minute now... Europe\u2019s man in charge of the euro has promised that eurozone taxpayers will be protected from losses on aid to Greek banks. Valdis Dombrovskis, a European commission vice president, with responsibility for the euro, said new rules on bank bailouts meant ordinary depositors would not pay the price for losses arising from bailing out Greece\u2019s banks. In an interview with Bloomberg TV he said the European Commission had insisted there would be no \u201cbail-in\u201d of ordinary bank depositors. It is not taxpayers that will pay for banking sector problems, but it is shareholders and bondholders of the banks. He said stress tests of Greek banks would be carried out in a few weeks. But the commissioner sounded less certain than the German government over whether the International Monetary Fund would contribute to the latest Greek bailout. The working assumption remains that the IMF would join the programme, he said. But he noted that many eurozone finance ministers oppose debt relief for Greece - one of the conditions the IMF has set for coming on board. It\u2019s clear that the IMF has its own procedures and will come back to its own programme in the fall... we are working to full participation of the IMF. A mass rebellion among Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative MPs is looking increasingly unlikely. In the days leading up to the vote, political insiders suggested that up to 120 conservative MPs could vote against the government, compared to around 60 last time. As flagged earlier, 60 MPs voted against or abstained on the Greek bailout deal in a mock vote on Tuesday. Perhaps talk of a big rebellion is useful for bringing doubters into line. MPs from Germany\u2019s radical left party Die Linke have been speaking out against the bailout deal. Die Linke has been Syriza\u2019s closest ally in the German Bundestag, being the only party in Germany to welcome Greece\u2019s no vote in last month\u2019s referendum on the bailout. But now Die Linke has parted company with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, although it remains in tune with most Syriza MPs. Die Linke MPs have also lambasted the deal to privatise Greece\u2019s regional airports, which benefits German company Fraport. As forecast, eurozone finance ministers will be holding a conference call tonight to finalise the Greek bailout deal. Eurozone finance ministers are the governors of the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which will be sending a cheque to Athens. The call will take place at 7pm CET/6pm British summer time. The Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly has been watching German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble explain why he is supporting the Greek bailout deal. As Sch\u00e4uble made the case for the German government, Angela Merkel looked on. \u201cThe decision for a further rescue package for Greece is no easy one, one has to be honest about that,\u201d he said, blaming the insufficient framework of the currency union. It was interesting to hear this coming from the finance minister who just a few weeks ago was campaigning for a temporary Grexit. He said that Greece had been \u201con the right path\u201d with a population willing to undergo reform, before the government of Tsipras took over and then the message was: \u201cGreece can stay in the eurozone without reforming\u201d, and that was just not tenable, particularly within the currency union, he insisted. Sch\u00e4uble called for MPs to agree on the \u20ac86 bn package, the first tranche of which - \u20ac26 bn - is meant be used to pay off the bridging loan issued in July. The \u2018institutions\u2019 he said - the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission - will make their first inspections in October. \u201cOur goal\u201d, he said, \u201cis that Greece is able to get back on its own feet as quickly as possible\u201d. Measures such as modernisation of the labour market, reform of the administrative service, pension reform and privatisation would be the main contributions to this. Once again he ruled out a debt \u2018haircut\u2019. \u201cDebt sustainability can be reached without a hair cut,\u201d he insisted, adding that the possibilities of changing the time frame within which the credits could be paid back were \u201climited\u201d. Bringing his 20 minute appeal to an end, he said: \u201cIt would now be irresponsible not to use the opportunity to bring economic recovery to Greece. With complete conviction I now appeal to you to vote in favour of the motion.\u201d \u201cThe chance is there, whether it is taken is only for the Greeks to decide\u201d. Will Alexis Tsipras call early elections in an attempt to see off opposition within his governing coalition to Greece\u2019s bailout deal? Since it became clear that the Greek prime minister was relying on opposition parties to get Greece\u2019s latest bailout through Parliament, the consensus held that Tsipras would soon call early elections. But today Greece\u2019s deputy culture minister Nikos Xydakis played down speculation that Tsipras could go to the polls soon. Xydakis pinned the timing on the first review of progress under the new bailout, which Greece\u2019s creditors will conduct in October. He told the state TV channel ERT. There are two views in order to have a strengthened government - elections either before or after the first bailout review. It is a decision the prime minister will make. He refuted accusations that Tsipras wants early elections to deal with his own internal rebellion. What is most important at this phase is that the government serve the interests of the Greek people and not those of the party...Tsipras is the prime minister of 11 million Greeks, not of 30,000 members of the Syriza party. Source: Reuters Social Democrat MEP Thomas Oppermann has been addressing the Bundestag. He is also a supporter of the bailout and as a junior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition backs the government. Next up is Anton Hofreiter of the Greens, who also support the bailout. Breaking away from the Bundestag to another Greece-Germany story. The Greek government has agreed to sell to a German company the rights to operate 14 regional airports. The deal is the first in a wave of privatisations Athens had previously opposed, but agreed to, in order to qualify for bailout loans. Here are the details of the AFP story that you can read in full here. The decision, published in the government gazette on Monday night would hand over the airports including several on popular tourist island destinations to Fraport AG, which runs Frankfurt Airport, among others across the world. The deal, worth \u20ac1.23bn euros (\u00a30.9bn/$1.37bn), is the first privatisation decision taken by the government of Alexis Tsipras, who was elected prime minister in January on promises to repeal the conditions of Greece\u2019s previous two bailouts. Sch\u00e4uble has finished his opening statement. Sch\u00e4uble is now saying that Germany needs a strong Europe and that requires trust and solidarity. He reiterates his view that a haircut, a reduction in Greece\u2019s overall debt, is not possible under European law. Sch\u00e4uble says there is a unanimous view among the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) that Greece has made a major shift. He says there is no guarantee that the bailout will work, but that it would be irresponsible not to use the opportunity for a new start. Via Reuters Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is introducing the vote on the bailout debate. He says is a good deal for Greece and Europe. The Bundestag debate is underway and is being live-streamed here. Greeks should grow their own tomatoes: that is the blunt message to Athens from one of the German MPs who plans to vote against the Greek bailout today. German Christian Democrat MP Klaus-Peter Willsch has been a vocal opponent of eurozone bailouts since 2011. A slightly longer, more-nuanced summary of his argument is that Greece should leave the euro to boost domestic production. He sets out several reasons for voting against the Greek bailout deal again, including the question mark hanging over the participation of the International Monetary Fund in the bailout. We are not sure if we\u2019re voting for a deal involving the IMF or not... But not only that, we only received the documents about the vote last night as a 207-page PDF. Many will be reading it on their way back from holiday, but they\u2019ll hardly have time to check the details. As the Guardian\u2019s Kate Connolly reports, Willsch was one of 60 rebels in last month\u2019s vote on whether to allow negotiations for a third bailout to proceed. He insists that excluding Greece from the euro would be the best solution for both parties. Then they can get back on their own feet, grow their own tomatoes and develop domestic produce at a much higher standard than if they were to continue importing tomatoes from Holland at huge cost to feed the tourists. You can read full story here: German politicians return to Berlin for key bailout vote Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Greece is now tantalising close to the \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout it desperately needs to stave off bankruptcy, with German MPs expected to approve the plan today. After months of brinkmanship that nearly broke up the eurozone, a third bailout for Greece is almost in the bank. On Tuesday the parliaments of Spain and Estonia approved the bailout, as did a special committee of MPs in Austria. But that was just a warm-up to the main event: a vote in the German Bundestag today. It could also be a dramatic day in Dutch Parliament, where MPs have been summoned back from the beaches for an emergency debate. A yes vote from the German parliament is not in doubt, although there have been nagging questions for chancellor Angela Merkel about divisions within her own conservative ranks. But there are some signs that the rebellion could be smaller than previously thought. In a non-binding test ballot on Tuesday, only 60 MPs from the 311-conservative bloc voted against or abstained on the Greek bailout vote - far short of the 120- strong rebellion predicted. But a mock ballot is not a vote. Once Parliaments approve the bailout deal, the European Stability Mechanism\u2019s board of governors - finance ministers - is expected to hold a conference call to rubber stamp the bailout cheque. In time-honoured bailout tradition, the money should drop into the Greek government\u2019s account just in time to allow it to make \u20ac3.2bn debt repayment to the European Central Bank on 20 August. And in another smidgeon of good news for Greece, the credit ratings agency Fitch upgraded Greece\u2019s debt one notch to CCC from CC - still deep in junk territory, but a tad more optimistic. The 14 August agreement between Greece and its eurozone creditors had \u201creduced the risk of Greece defaulting on its private sector obligations\u201d, Fitch said. But then came the usual disclaimer The risks to the programme\u2019s success remain high. I\u2019ll be following all the latest on Greece\u2019s bailout progress and any other interesting news that crops up.",

Remember that it will have to pass regular reviews to be eligible for future aid payments. The requirement for it to run ever rising primary budget surpluses is based on forecasts for GDP to fall by a fairly modest 2.3% this year and then expand by 1.3% in 2016 \u2013 the latter assumption seems far too optimistic.</p> <p>Admittedly, Greece\u2019s debt redemption schedule is considerably lighter over the coming months than it has been of late, so future delays to bailout payments might not be disastrous. But note that a successful first review is also required before the creditors will consider debt restructuring and probably also before the ECB will reinstate the waiver allowing Greeks banks to access cheap loans.</p> </blockquote> <p>She also notes that Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is likely to face a vote of confidence or early elections, while IMF support is far from assured. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-19T13:09:03.521Z\">at 2.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55d47b4ee4b07318d17fdcd1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-19T12:56:31.221Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the German chancellor Angela Merkel just ahead of this vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba3fb4c29822156eeebc48999f4e22db8793a9d8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/19/1439988556265/c83e72d3-ab7a-48fe-9bd1-5d92aaad642f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smiles all round.

The \u2018institutions\u2019 he said - the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission - will make their first inspections in October. \u201cOur goal\u201d, he said, \u201cis that Greece is able to get back on its own feet as quickly as possible\u201d. Measures such as modernisation of the labour market, reform of the administrative service, pension reform and privatisation would be the main contributions to this.</p> <p>Once again he ruled out a debt \u2018haircut\u2019. \u201cDebt sustainability can be reached without a hair cut,\u201d he insisted, adding that the possibilities of changing the time frame within which the credits could be paid back were \u201climited\u201d. </p> <p>Bringing his 20 minute appeal to an end, he said: <strong>\u201cIt would now be irresponsible not to use the opportunity to bring economic recovery to Greece.

On Tuesday the parliaments of Spain and Estonia approved the bailout, as did a special committee of MPs in Austria. </p> <p>But that was just a warm-up to the main event: <strong>a vote in the German Bundestag today</strong>. It could also be a dramatic day in Dutch Parliament, where MPs have been summoned back from the beaches for an emergency debate.</p> <p>A yes vote from the German parliament is not in doubt, although there have been nagging questions for chancellor Angela Merkel about divisions within her own conservative ranks.</p> <p>But <strong>there are some signs that the rebellion could be smaller than previously thought</strong>. In a non-binding test ballot on Tuesday, only 60 MPs from the 311-conservative bloc voted against or abstained on the Greek bailout vote - far short of the 120- strong rebellion predicted. <em>But a mock ballot is not a vote.</em></p> <p>Once Parliaments approve the bailout deal, the European Stability Mechanism\u2019s board of governors - finance ministers - is expected to hold a conference call to rubber stamp the bailout cheque.</p> <p>In time-honoured bailout tradition, the money should drop into the Greek government\u2019s account just in time to allow it to make \u20ac3.2bn debt repayment to the European Central Bank on 20 August.</p> <p>And in another smidgeon of good news for Greece, the credit ratings agency Fitch upgraded Greece\u2019s debt one notch to CCC from CC - still deep in junk territory, but a tad more optimistic.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is facing a bill worth tens of millions of pounds to offload its struggling convenience store business. Britain\u2019s fourth largest food retailer is in talks to sell its 150 M Local stores to the investment firm Greybull Capital. However, it is understood that Morrisons will be lumbered with a liability of as much as \u00a3100m from any sale because there is a parent company guarantee on the rental agreement for the stores. This guarantee means that Morrisons will remain on the hook for the leases on the stores even after selling them. If the new owner closes stores, the supermarket group will have to pay the outstanding rent. Morrisons will have to recognise the liability by booking a writedown in its accounts. This writedown is likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, which is lower than the \u00a3100m liability estimated by industry sources because the structure of the sale should partly offset the damage to the retailer. Parent company guarantees are common on rental agreements, particularly for new businesses and ventures. For example, EMI, the record group, put in place parent company guarantees when it spun off entertainment retailer HMV in the 1980s, meaning it was liable for outstanding rent when the chain collapsed into administration in 2013. However, the bill underlines the scale of the problems that Morrisons has faced in trying to launch a convenience store business. Dalton Philips, the grocer\u2019s former chief executive, opened the first M Local shop in 2011 after claiming that Morrisons was lagging behind its rivals because it did not have high street convenience stores or an online delivery service. The expansion of M Local accelerated two years later when the company bought stores from Blockbuster and Jessops after the retailers collapsed into administration. Philips pledged to open 100 M Local stores a year, but these plans were halted as the performance of the company\u2019s main supermarket business worsened. Philips was fired in January and the new management team of chairman Andy Higginson and chief executive David Potts put the convenience store business under review. In March, Higginson said that 23 M Local stores would be closed. Greybull, which invested in airline Monarch last year and was a backer of electricals retailer Comet before it fell into administration, is now thought to be in advanced talks to buy the convenience stores. Its bid is being fronted by a collection of experienced industry executives. The sale of the M Local stores will be another blow to the legacy of Philips. Morrisons was forced last year to book a \u00a3163m writedown on the baby equipment retailer Kiddicare after announcing it would sell the ailing business. Morrisons could confirm the sale of the M Local stores in its interim results next month, the first to be presented by Potts as chief executive. He will use the results to outline his plan to get the supermarket chain back on track after a slump in sales and profits. Morrisons has struggled to adapt to changes in shopping habits and the rise of Aldi and Lidl in its northern England heartland. In March, the Bradford-based company reported an annual pre-tax loss of \u00a3792m after it wrote off the value of its supermarkets by \u00a31.3bn. Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, said Morrisons had launched its convenience store business too late. \u201cIn addition to what we believed was conceptual naivety, Morrisons had to contend with what were in effect poorly acquired and inferior sites, which has already led management to close 23 outlets that were materially under-performing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst relevant to a degree we were tearing our hair out under the prior regime when Morrisons blamed its poor relative performance on a lack of exposure to online and convenience stores. If Morrisons had over-worried about its superstores then we do notbelieve it would have blown hundreds of millions of pounds on Kiddicare, under-performing convenience stores or its tie-up with Ocado [to deliver online shopping], and its core would be in better shape.\u201d Morrisons declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets are fickle places. When Glencore, the mining and commodity trader, was floated in the spring of 2011, the assumption was that the shares would be the hottest property around. China was booming, fears of a second Great Depression were fading, central banks were pumping money into the financial system through quantitative easing. What was not to like? Quite a lot as it happens. Glencore peaked early and its share price has been on a downward trend ever since it joined the FTSE 100. The company has been the FTSE\u2019s worst performer in 2015 and has fallen by 55% in the past year. After another big drop on Wednesday, investors could pick up Glencore shares for 159p against an offer price of 530p. You don\u2019t need to be a genius to work out why Glencore\u2019s shares are on the slide: the company\u2019s profits are being hit badly by the sharp fall in commodity prices that has accompanied the more than halving of the cost of crude oil in the past year. Copper prices, for example, have dropped by 25% as global demand for metals has declined. There are three main reasons for the slump in commodity prices. The first is that they were too high in the first place, driven higher by QE-financed speculation. The second is that production has increased, leading to a supply glut. The third is that demand has not lived up to expectations, with China\u2019s economic slowdown having a marked impact on exports from commodity-producing countries. Brazil, heavily exposed to the drop in metals\u2019 prices, is experiencing a nasty bout of stagflation. Glencore has responded in textbook fashion: it has cut operating costs, sold assets and taken the axe to capital investment. This, however, is merely a temporary solution for a company with high debt and falling revenues. What Glencore needs is for growth to pick up in China, for the tentative recovery in Europe to gain traction and for the looming increase in US interest rates to cause no more than a ripple in the rest of the global economy. That looks unlikely. China is on the edge of a hard landing if not already suffering from one. Europe\u2019s recovery is and will remain modest. Emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa look highly vulnerable to a tightening of monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Glencore\u2019s share price reflects the sense that a fresh financial crisis is more likely than a surge in commodity prices.",

      "body": "<p>Stock markets are fickle places. When Glencore, the mining and commodity trader, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/18/glencore-ipo-price-london-flotation\">floated in the spring of 2011</a>, the assumption was that the shares would be the hottest property around. China was booming, fears of a second Great Depression were fading, central banks were pumping money into the financial system through quantitative easing. What was not to like?</p> <p>Quite a lot as it happens. Glencore peaked early and its share price has been on a downward trend ever since it joined the FTSE 100. The company has been the FTSE\u2019s worst performer in 2015 and has fallen by 55% in the past year. After another big drop on Wednesday, investors could pick up Glencore shares for 159p against an offer price of 530p.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to be a genius to work out why Glencore\u2019s shares are on the slide: the company\u2019s profits are being hit badly by the sharp fall in commodity prices that has accompanied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/07/brent-crude-below-50-barrel-2009-oil-bp-shell\">the more than halving of the cost of crude oil</a> in the past year. Copper prices, for example, have dropped by 25% as global demand for metals has declined.</p> <p>There are three main reasons for the slump in commodity prices. The first is that they were too high in the first place, driven higher by QE-financed speculation. The second is that production has increased, leading to a supply glut. The third is that demand has not lived up to expectations, with China\u2019s economic slowdown having a marked impact on exports from commodity-producing countries. Brazil, heavily exposed to the drop in metals\u2019 prices, is experiencing a nasty bout of stagflation.</p> <p>Glencore has responded in textbook fashion: it has cut operating costs, sold assets and taken the axe to capital investment. This, however, is merely a temporary solution for a company with high debt and falling revenues. What Glencore needs is for growth to pick up in China, for the tentative recovery in Europe to gain traction and for the looming increase in US interest rates to cause no more than a ripple in the rest of the global economy.</p> <p>That looks unlikely. China is on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/five-reasons-to-be-worried-about-the-chinese-economy\">edge of a hard landing</a> if not already suffering from one. Europe\u2019s recovery is and will remain modest. Emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa look highly vulnerable to a tightening of monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Glencore\u2019s share price reflects the sense that a fresh financial crisis is more likely than a surge in commodity prices.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece will receive the first batch of funds under its new bailout programme after the German parliament voted to support the deal, despite widespread misgivings about whether Athens will manage to implement reforms in return for the money. Following the Bundestag vote, eurozone finance ministers agreed to release \u20ac26bn (\u00a318.4bn) of the \u20ac86bn bailout immediately, helping Greece meet a payment due to the European Central Bank and recapitalise its struggling banking sector. The money will be disbursed by the EU\u2019s bailout fund, the European stability mechanism. The ESM board, staffed by the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, said it had agreed the programme for delivering the \u20ac86bn package. \u201cToday the countries in the eurozone have mandated the ESM to make to a maximum of \u20ac86bn available to finance Greece,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister. \u201cThe programme for the coming three years goes with strict conditions ... aiming at setting right public finances and administration and dealing with the economy and problems in the financial sector.\u201d The first tranche under the ESM program will be worth up to \u20ac26bn, in which \u20ac10bn will be made available immediately for bank recapitalisation. The other \u20ac16bn will be disbursed to Greece in several instalments, starting with a first disbursement of \u20ac13bn by Thursday, followed by one or more further disbursements in the autumn. Germany\u2019s parliament backed the bailout following a heated debate in the Bundestag, despite the expression of doubts among MPs over the sustainability of the deal. Following three hours of lively debate, 453 voted in favour of the rescue package, while 113 voted against it and 18 MPs abstained. A total of 63 MPs of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative alliance rebelled against the government despite warnings that there would be consequences if they failed to toe the party line. Three conservative MPs were among those who abstained. The rebellion is a blow to Merkel, amounting to three more than the number who rebelled during a similar vote in July. It is far fewer, however, than the 120 that it was suggested might have voted against the government. Absent from the chamber altogether were 47 politicians, with many said by colleagues to have deliberately chosen to stay away, rather than be forced to vote no and risk being accused of disloyalty towards Merkel. Of the 47 were from the CDU/CSU, and 16 from the SPD. Bundestag observers said that despite being held during the summer holiday and with some MPs either ill or unable to return from far-flung places, never had so few voted in such an important vote. It was a sign of how controversial the topic has been, they added. Addressing the parliament on behalf of the government, the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who until a few weeks ago was calling for a temporary exit of Greece from the euro, appealed to parliamentarians to vote in favour of the bailout, the third such deal in five years. \u201cOf course, after the experience of the last years and months there is no guarantee that everything will work and one is allowed to have one\u2019s doubts,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said. \u201cBut owing to the fact that the Greek parliament has already passed a large part of the measures, it would be irresponsible not to use the opportunity for a new start in Greece.\u201d His speech was greeted with strong applause from the house. Gregor Gysi of the leftwing Die Linke, 12 of whose MPs did not turn up to vote, accused the government of profiting from the crisis. He was particularly critical of the privatisation of 14 regional airports in Greece, for what he called a \u201cdumping price\u201d, to the German airport operator Fraport. He claimed Germany was expected to earn \u20ac100m from Greece and \u201cshould be helping to rebuild it, not forcing it to save\u201d. Thomas Oppermann of the Social Democrats, junior coalition partners in the government, said the third bailout was of a \u201cmuch higher quality\u201d to the first two, as it was conditional on reforms being implemented, including the abolition of tax exemptions for ship owners and farmers. \u201cA poor state cannot afford to have tax subsidies for rich ship owners,\u201d he said. Klaus-Peter Willsch, a CDU MP from Hesse who was one of the 63 \u201crebels\u201d and who has repeatedly called for Greece to leave the eurozone, said: \u201cIf you\u2019ve taken a head-first running jump at a wall twice, then you should probably look to see if there\u2019s door somewhere. And that door is called Grexit.\u201d Merkel did not participate in the debate, apparently to avoid the vote becoming a decision on her leadership, even though the Greek crisis and her chancellorship are now arguably inextricably intertwined. Instead she sat in the chamber, nodding, laughing and talking to fellow MPs before casting her vote and swiftly departing with her entire cabinet for a business trip to Brazil.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Glencore, the FTSE-100 miner and commodities trader, have slumped to a record low after tumbling prices for coal and metals linked to slowing Chinese demand hit first-half profits. Glencore closed down just under 10% at 159p, far below its 2011 float price of 530p, as it revealed a slump in earnings. In the first six months of 2015, adjusted earnings before interest, tax and other items fell 29% from a year earlier to $4.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) as the price of aluminium, nickel and other raw materials fell. The company\u2019s net income excluding significant items dropped by 56% to $882m. The shares have halved in value in the past year and have lost more than two-thirds since the company\u2019s flotation, cutting the fortune of Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore\u2019s chief executive, to about \u00a32bn from \u00a36bn. The Switzerland-based company added that it had cut planned capital expenditure for this year to $6bn, from an earlier forecast of up to $6.8bn, and that spending would fall further to a maximum of $5bn next year. Glencore has been hit hard by plunging prices of coal, metals and other raw materials as demand from China has fallen. But Glasenberg said declines had been exaggerated by \u201cmassive speculative positions\u201d taken against commodities by hedge funds. It made no sense for prices to have fallen to levels last seen when the world economy was entering recession, Glasenberg said, adding that market prices were out of step with supply and demand for physical materials. Glasenberg said: \u201cIt\u2019s the funds driving it ... It\u2019s not the actual demand in China. There has been negative sentiment on China. If you have a negative view on China, you have a negative view of commodities. Our view is based on physical demand for commodities and physical demand is not bad. This isn\u2019t 2008.\u201d China\u2019s slowdown to its weakest growth rate in a quarter of a century along with turmoil in the country\u2019s stock market have caused global fears about the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. China\u2019s position as the biggest global manufacturer also makes it by far the largest consumer of commodities. Glasenberg said that after China devalued its currency last week it was difficult to forecast what further moves the country\u2019s authorities might make. \u201cI can\u2019t predict what the Chinese are going to do next,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard market to call and it\u2019s getting harder and harder. All we can do is look at what they are doing today.\u201d The company said it had $10.5bn of undrawn credit and cash, giving it flexibility to support its balance sheet. It held the interim dividend at 6 cents a share, which it said was a sign of confidence in the company\u2019s prospects amid nervous markets. Steven Kalmin, Glencore\u2019s finance director, said maintaining the dividend at last year\u2019s level would cost the company $2bn, but he believed it could make the payout and hold on to its credit rating because the rating agencies took a long-term view of a company\u2019s financial strength.",

      "bodyText": "Whether it\u2019s the currency devaluation or the stock market rout, the economic news coming out of China seems unremittingly negative \u2013 and that\u2019s not to mention the horrific explosions in Tianjin. But here\u2019s some good news. Yet-to-be-released data shows that China has all but eradicated urban poverty. For a country with huge numbers of poor people streaming into its cities, many of whom living initially in conditions of abject misery, this is an extraordinary success. It has been achieved, in large part, because of a government subsidy paid to urban dwellers to bring incomes up to a minimum level of 4,476 yuan ($700 or \u00a3446). The data comes from the latest survey in the China Household Income Project (Chip) series and will not be formally published until next year. It shows that in 2013 the share of people living in cities below this minimum income line was just 1.6%, adjusted for purchasing power parity. According to Prof Li Shi, director of Beijing Normal University\u2019s institute of income distribution who works on Chip, that\u2019s mostly accounted for errors in targeting by the government. And it seems that the data is unusually robust: it is based on a behemoth household survey for which more than 100,000 families recorded their income and consumption every day for a whole year. China has lifted more people out of poverty than anywhere else in the world: its per capita income in increased fivefold between 1990 and 2000, from $200 to $1,000. Between 2000 and 2010, per capita income also rose by the same rate, from $1,000 to $5,000, moving China into the ranks of middle-income countries. Between 1990 and 2005, China\u2019s progress accounted for more than three-quarters of global poverty reduction and is the reason why the world reached the UN millennium development goal of halving extreme poverty. This incredible success was delivered by a combination of a rapidly expanding labour market, driven by a protracted period of economic growth, and a series of government transfers such as the above urban subsidy, and the introduction of a rural pension. The question now is whether the government can repeat this success and eradicate extreme poverty entirely: after all upto one person in 10 in the country remains poor. The current economic and social five year plan (the country\u2019s 12th) aims to eliminate all poverty by 2020 (10 years ahead of the newly agreed UN Sustainable Development Goal poverty eradication target, and it seems likely that this target will be reiterated in the new five year plan to be agreed by the Chinese Communist party\u2019s central committee next year. If that\u2019s to be achieved, the government will need to keep up its expensive transfer programmes, even at a time of economic downturn. In addition, inequality remains a big issue and will need to be tackled. Although China\u2019s Gini Coefficient for income inequality is improving from its 2008 peak of 0.491, it remained at a relatively high level of 0.473 in 2013. This is despite the government\u2019s record of progressive taxation, which has had a distributional effect, as well as raising money to fund transfer programmes. There are also significant gender and regional inequalities, meaning the government will need to do more to target women and people living in rural areas (as well as other groups such as disabled people) to ensure that no one is left behind. And finally, equitable growth will of course also need to be the sustainable kind that cuts rather than increases carbon emissions \u2013 no small order for a country where air pollution kills an estimated 4,000 people a day.

    "webTitle": "Calls for lithium battery review after Boeing Dreamliner fire at Heathrow", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investigators are calling for a safety review of all lithium battery-powered equipment on planes after a fire on board a parked Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow, which crew would have struggled to contain in flight, was traced to a tracking device carrying such batteries. The blaze, on board the empty Ethiopian Airlines jet in July 2013, burned through the fuselage and filled the cabin with acrid smoke while the plane was parked at a remote stand on the runway. Britain\u2019s Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB) said that while the fire was caused by the plane\u2019s lithium battery-powered emergency locator transmitter (ELT), the homing beacon used to find missing aircraft, there were concerns other on-board equipment powered by similar batteries may be vulnerable. Its investigation found the ELT\u2019s battery wires were \u201ccrossed and trapped\u201d under the battery compartment cover plate, which probably created a short circuit that caused an uncontrollable increase in temperature, leading to rupture and fire emitting toxic fumes. The trapped wires broke the battery seal, allowing flames, gas and battery decomposition products to escape. A circuit protector that should have tripped proved inadequate, which allowed the flames to take hold in the fuselage, according to a 182-page report published on Wednesday. A new \u201cslow blow\u201d fuse, which offered enhanced protection to the circuit protector, had not been fitted to any aircraft by June this year, the report noted. It recommended the US-based Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency and Transport Canada conduct a full review to ensure such batteries had acceptable circuit protection and complied with precautions for venting toxic gas. Had the aircraft been in flight, the location of the ELT, which was above ceiling panels at the rear of the passenger cabin, meant crew or passengers would not have immediately noticed the fire. \u201cIt is not known how long it may take for such a fire to be detected and the location of the ELT could prolong the time taken to locate the source,\u201d the report said. Since the Heathrow incident, Boeing has added a specific section on fighting lithium battery fires to its flight attendant manual. But cabin crew might not locate the source of a non-visible fire because the aircraft\u2019s environmental control system would distribute the smoke and fumes, the AAIB said. And if they did, crew on the B787 would have to stand on a seat or armrest to access it. Without specific training, locating the flames would be challenging and unrealistic, and if a fire happened in flight, odour and fumes could hinder crew, while opening the ceiling panel could fuel and invigorate the fire with oxygen. The jet\u2019s rescue and firefighting manual did not at the time include the location of the ELT lithium battery, which meant firefighters tackling the blaze at Heathrow initially had no idea it could be a source. The report highlighted \u201cdesign vulnerabilities\u201d in the battery and called for an overhaul of the certification process, parts of which were outdated, and more thorough testing of heat dissipation in the batteries. At the time of the Heathrow fire, there were an estimated 3,650 identical RESCU 406AFN ELT batteries in service, fitted to numerous aircraft types, plus 2,900 similar batteries in portable ELTs. The RESCU 406AFN ELT was part of the Boeing 787 Navigation Radio System (NRS) designed by US-based Honeywell Aerospace, who subcontracted the manufacture of the ELT to Instrumar Limited, who again subcontracted the development and design of the battery to Ultralife Corporation, in Newark, the report said. Honeywell was not aware of any previous thermal \u201crunaway\u201d events. But the company did know of a battery wiring anomaly on a previous ELT returned in February 2013 by a manufacturer where wires were trapped under the cover plate \u2013 though this did not lead to a fire, the report said. As a result the Instrumar battery assembly instructions were modified to better contain the wires on new ELTs in April 2013, though not on those already in service. Following the Heathrow fire, all similar units were subjected to a mandatory one-off inspection ordered by the US FAA. By August 2014, 35 had been identified with trapped wires. Wiring had since been moved to underneath the battery and away from the cover plate on all new units of this kind. However, said the report, \u201cwith a battery service life of 10 years, it will be many years until all in-service RESCU 406AF and AFN ELTs have the inverted battery installed\u201d. Boeing said it was \u201cconfident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity\u201d. In a statement, it added the AAIB report was \u201cextensive and thorough\u201d. \u201cWe are committed to a process of continual improvement of our airplanes and we will carefully review the AAIB\u2019s recommendations. \u201cIt is important that any potential changes to the airplane\u2019s design be reviewed with great care, and with due consideration for any potential unintended consequences of any change. We will work closely with regulators, operators and industry partners to ensure that the safety of the world\u2019s commercial jetliners continues at the highest levels.\u201d Following the Heathrow incident, all of its Honeywell RESCU 406 ELT units were checked and confirmed to be in compliance with FAA regulations, it said. A spokesman for Honeywell said: \u201cSince 2013 we have worked closely with government agencies to issue inspection notices for all applicable ELT units and updated the design, Honeywell is committed to the safety of all its products\u201d.",

      "body": "<p> Investigators are calling for a safety review of all lithium battery-powered equipment on planes after a fire on board a parked Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow, which crew would have struggled to contain in flight, was traced to a tracking device carrying such batteries.</p> <p>The blaze, on board the empty Ethiopian Airlines jet in July 2013, burned through the fuselage and filled the cabin with acrid smoke while the plane was parked at a remote stand on the runway.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB) said that while the fire was caused by the plane\u2019s lithium battery-powered emergency locator transmitter (ELT), the homing beacon used to find missing aircraft, there were concerns other on-board equipment powered by similar batteries may be vulnerable.</p> <p>Its investigation found the ELT\u2019s battery wires were \u201ccrossed and trapped\u201d under the battery compartment cover plate, which probably created a short circuit that caused an uncontrollable increase in temperature, leading to rupture and fire emitting toxic fumes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/heathrow-fire-boeing-dreamliner-battery\">Heathrow fire on Boeing Dreamliner 'started in battery component'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The trapped wires broke the battery seal, allowing flames, gas and battery decomposition products to escape.</p> <p>A circuit protector that should have tripped proved inadequate, which allowed the flames to take hold in the fuselage, according to a 182-page report published on Wednesday. A new \u201cslow blow\u201d fuse, which offered enhanced protection to the circuit protector, had not been fitted to any aircraft by June this year, the report noted.</p> <p>It recommended the US-based Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency and Transport Canada conduct a full review to ensure such batteries had acceptable circuit protection and complied with precautions for venting toxic gas.</p> <p>Had the aircraft been in flight, the location of the ELT, which was above ceiling panels at the rear of the passenger cabin, meant crew or passengers would not have immediately noticed the fire. \u201cIt is not known how long it may take for such a fire to be detected and the location of the ELT could prolong the time taken to locate the source,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Since the Heathrow incident, Boeing has added a specific section on fighting lithium battery fires to its flight attendant manual. But cabin crew might not locate the source of a non-visible fire because the aircraft\u2019s environmental control system would distribute the smoke and fumes, the AAIB said. And if they did, crew on the B787 would have to stand on a seat or armrest to access it.</p> <p>Without specific training, locating the flames would be challenging and unrealistic, and if a fire happened in flight, odour and fumes could hinder crew, while opening the ceiling panel could fuel and invigorate the fire with oxygen.</p> <p>The jet\u2019s rescue and firefighting manual did not at the time include the location of the ELT lithium battery, which meant firefighters tackling the blaze at Heathrow initially had no idea it could be a source.</p> <p>The report highlighted \u201cdesign vulnerabilities\u201d in the battery and called for an overhaul of the certification process, parts of which were outdated, and more thorough testing of heat dissipation in the batteries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/22/boeing-repairs-dreamliner-batteries\">Boeing starts costly repairs to Dreamliner batteries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time of the Heathrow fire, there were an estimated 3,650 identical RESCU 406AFN ELT batteries in service, fitted to numerous aircraft types, plus 2,900 similar batteries in portable ELTs.</p> <p>The RESCU 406AFN ELT was part of the Boeing 787 Navigation Radio System (NRS) designed by US-based Honeywell Aerospace, who subcontracted the manufacture of the ELT to Instrumar Limited, who again subcontracted the development and design of the battery to Ultralife Corporation, in Newark, the report said.</p> <p>Honeywell was not aware of any previous thermal \u201crunaway\u201d events. But the company did know of a battery wiring anomaly on a previous ELT returned in February 2013 by a manufacturer where wires were trapped under the cover plate \u2013 though this did not lead to a fire, the report said. As a result the Instrumar battery assembly instructions were modified to better contain the wires on new ELTs in April 2013, though not on those already in service.<br></p> <p>Following the Heathrow fire, all similar units were subjected to a mandatory one-off inspection ordered by the US FAA. By August 2014, 35 had been identified with trapped wires.<br></p> <p>Wiring had since been moved to underneath the battery and away from the cover plate on all new units of this kind. However, said the report, \u201cwith a battery service life of 10 years, it will be many years until all in-service RESCU 406AF and AFN ELTs have the inverted battery installed\u201d.</p> <p>Boeing said it was \u201cconfident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity\u201d. </p> <p>In a statement, it added the AAIB report was \u201cextensive and thorough\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to a process of continual improvement of our airplanes and we will carefully review the AAIB\u2019s recommendations. </p> <p>\u201cIt is important that any potential changes to the airplane\u2019s design be reviewed with great care, and with due consideration for any potential unintended consequences of any change. We will work closely with regulators, operators and industry partners to ensure that the safety of the world\u2019s commercial jetliners continues at the highest levels.\u201d </p> <p>Following the Heathrow incident, all of its Honeywell RESCU 406 ELT units were checked and confirmed to be in compliance with FAA regulations, it said. <br></p> <p>A spokesman for Honeywell said: \u201cSince 2013 we have worked closely with government agencies to issue inspection notices for all applicable ELT units and updated the design, Honeywell is committed to the safety of all its products\u201d. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are on the slide again as volatility in China continues to undermine commodity companies. But there are a couple of bright spots from businesses reporting positive trading updates. Insurer Admiral - the group behind confused.com - has added 64p to \u00a315.30 after it reported a better than expected 1% rise in first half profits to \u00a3186.1m. The improvement came as customer numbers increased and it released reserves set aside to cover the cost of future claims. Peel Hunt analyst Andreas van Embden said: Admiral\u2019s first half results were steady, with prior year reserve releases supporting a 1% increase in pretax profit. Given Admiral\u2019s significant market position in the UK Motor market, growth is not a priority. Management continues to focus on supporting UK underwriting margins as it pushes through Motor rate increases in the first half of 2015 and protects future profitability. Reserve buffers remain high and will fund the dividend as the company awaits a gradual turn in the UK underwriting cycle. Admiral trades at a 2016 estimated PE of around 15 times supported by a yield of around 6%. Also on the rise was Hikma Pharmaceuticals, up 48p to \u00a324.48, despite a fall in half year profits from $244m this time last year to $204m, as it confirmed full year revenue guidance for 6% growth. Jefferies said: Hikma\u2019s adjusted first half was solid driven by blow-out US margins; impressive given the tough base comp and foreign exchange headwinds, which had been well-flagged. Full year guidance was reiterated. In our recent upgrade, we had highlighted our view that the first half was irrelevant given strong upcoming growth prospects from 2016, and we expect the market to look beyond a second half weighted year to these future value drivers. Stifel analysts said: Hikma has announced results for the six months ended 30 June 2015 below our expectations primarily reflecting the impact of a strong US dollar. However, full year guidance remains unchanged. Ahead of the recently announced and transformational Roxane acquisition, we believe Hikma is well placed for sustained growth over the next few years. We reiterate our buy rating. Overall though the FTSE 100 has fallen 72.02 points or more than 1% to 6454.27 - its lowest level since early July - on continuing concern about China, even though the country\u2019s stock market recovered from yet another fall by the time it closed. So with commodity prices still under pressure, given fears of falling demand from China, mining companies were again the among the biggest losers in the index. Glencore, which had slumped in recent weeks, was expected to recover somewhat following its results on the basis that the worst could be over. But this has failed to happen and its shares are down 9.4p at 166.70p. Anglo American is also lower, down 18.4p at 723.5p, while BHP Billiton has lost 16.5p to \u00a310.96. With worries about the outlook for emerging markets, HSBC has fallen 12.4p to 543.6p. US inflation will also be in focus later, for any clues it gives as to when the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates. And investors will also be keeping an eye on the German parliament, which is expected to back the Greek bailout agreement although not without some opposition.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s failure to create sufficient high-skilled jobs for its rising proportion of graduates means the money invested in education is being squandered, while young people are left crippled by student debts, warns a new report. The mismatch between the number of university leavers and the jobs appropriate to their skills has left the UK with more than half of its graduates in non-graduate jobs, one of the highest rates in Europe, according to research commissioned by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). The trade group for the human resources sector said graduate over-qualification has reached \u201csaturation point\u201d and is squeezing lower qualified workers out of jobs. The trend also had serious consequences for the UK\u2019s already woeful productivity performance. \u201cThe assumption that we will transition to a more productive, higher-value, higher-skilled economy just by increasing the conveyor belt of graduates is proven to be flawed,\u201d said CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese. \u201cSimply increasing the qualification level of individuals going into a job does not typically result in the skill required to do the job being enhanced \u2013 in many cases that skills premium, if it exists at all, is simply wasted. This situation is unsustainable given that the government estimates that 45% of university graduates will not earn enough to repay their student loans.\u201d Graduate over-qualification appears to be a particular problem for the UK, according to international comparisons in the report, \u201cOver-qualification and skills mismatch in the graduate labour market.\u201d The authors said the UK has the second highest graduation rate in the OECD group of mainly advanced economies, at 54%, with only Iceland having a higher rate. By comparison, Germany has a graduation rate of just 31%, the report says. UK\u2019s poor record Using figures from the European Social Survey, the report charts a rise in most countries around the region in the proportion of graduates deemed to be in non-graduate jobs between 2004 and 2010. The authors highlight that the 2010 figure for the UK, at 58.8%, is exceeded only by Greece and Estonia. \u201cIn contrast, countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia, which have a history of strong vocational training, have 10% or less of graduates in non-graduate jobs,\u201d they add. The CIPD said the findings raised urgent questions over getting better value out of the UK\u2019s education system, raising the profile of alternatives to a degree such as apprenticeships, and how employers invest in further training. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial we as a nation take stock now of whether our higher education system is delivering desired returns for graduates, for organisations and society,\u201d said Cheese. \u201cThe government needs to ensure its productivity plan includes a specific focus on creating more high-skilled jobs and work with employers, particularly SMEs, and with key stakeholders like Local Enterprise Partnerships and Business Growth Hubs,\u201d he added. The report follows a claim from the Office for National Statistics in 2013 that almost half of recent graduates in the UK were in non-graduate jobs. But more recent figures have pointed to an improving jobs market for graduates and the latest findings on those who left university last summer showed professional employment was up and salaries were higher. Two-thirds of graduates from full-time degrees were in posts classified as \u201cprofessional employment\u201d, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa).",

      "bodyText": "Chinese stock markets fell sharply in their final hour of trading on Tuesday as investors were rattled by the withdrawal of government support for shares and further capital flight after last week\u2019s yuan devaluation. The Shanghai composite index dropped 6.12%, its biggest fall since an 8.5% slide on 27 July. By the end of trading about 1,000 companies had plunged by the daily 10% limit, with state-owned firms hardest hit. The news came as an analysis in the Financial Times found that the flight of capital from emerging markets has risen towards $1tn over the past 13 months as confidence in the world\u2019s developing economies dwindles. Total net capital outflows from the 19 largest emerging market economies reached $940.2bn in the 13 months to the end of July, almost double the net $480bn lost over three quarters during the 2008-09 financial crisis, according to a compilation of official data and estimates by NN Investment Partners reported by the FT. Maarten-Jan Bakkum, senior emerging markets strategist at NN, told the FT the flow could accelerate following last week\u2019s yuan devaluation. Another survey yesterday also showed investors have cut exposure to emerging markets to record low levels. The monthly Bank of America Merrill Lynch poll of 202 fund managers showed that China\u2019s slowing economic momentum and an emerging market debt crisis had replaced a eurozone break-up as the biggest global \u201ctail risk\u201d in investors\u2019 minds. \u201cInvestors are sending a clear message that they are positioned for lower growth in China and emerging markets,\u201d said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Emerging market currencies were weak across the board yesterday. In Turkey, where the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, was expected to give up trying to form a government, the lira hit a record low, and the South African rand slid to a 14-year low against a firm dollar. \u201cThe weakness of sentiment in emerging market FX [foreign exchange] is striking,\u201d Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale currency strategists said in a note to clients yesterday. \u201cFear of a resumption of significant capital outflows if the Fed does raise rates next month as well as fear of further yuan weakness and concern about the sluggish pace of global growth are all delivering persistent broad-based weakness.\u201d Earlier in the day China\u2019s central bank injected the largest amount of cash into the financial system on a single day in almost 19 months, but analysts said the effect was likely to be shortlived. Experts suggested markets were still unsettled by Friday\u2019s statement by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the state-owned lender that had been the main channel for injecting funds into the market, that the market should \u201cexercise its function of self-adjustment\u201d. \u201cIf I heard the government saying it plans to stop actively supporting the market I would sell too,\u201d said Francis Cheung, a Hong Kong-based strategist for brokerage CLSA. Shares were also dented by rumours that a reform of state-owned industries might not go far enough, said Guo Yanhong, a market strategist for Founder Securities. This was compounded by concerns that last week\u2019s yuan devaluation may accelerate capital flows out of China as people seek to safeguard themselves against further currency falls, and by fears over flagging economic growth in China. \u201cThe mentality of investors is still fragile,\u201d said Guo. \u201cThey won\u2019t hesitate to sell their holdings and get out of the market fast whenever they expect a big fall.\u201d The authorities managed to halt wild stock market fluctuations in early July when they took a number of dramatic steps to limit losses for investors, including ordering securities firms to buy stocks and banning company shareholders from selling holdings. The yuan continued to decline yesterday after last week\u2019s devaluation, despite its midpoint being raised to 6.3966 a dollar, slightly firmer than the previous fix of 6.3969. \u201cWith today\u2019s unsurprising yuan fixing, volatility in the [yuan] appears to have been put back in its box. However, the internal dynamics of China\u2019s economy continue to flash warnings that this calm will not last,\u201d Angus Nicholson, IG market analyst, wrote in a note.",
