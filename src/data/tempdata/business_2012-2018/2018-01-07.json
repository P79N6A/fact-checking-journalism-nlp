      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s top fracking firms has been accused of misleading the public over its intent to explore for shale gas in a protected area of ancient woodland in Sherwood Forest. Ineos, a UK-based petrochemicals firm, has said publicly it would exclude sensitive areas of the legendary home of Robin Hood from its seismic surveys. However, documents released under freedom of information rules reveal the company privately later sought and won permission from authorities to survey those areas, which involves laying small explosive charges underground. Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, the group that obtained the documents, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Ineos will stop at nothing to explore for shale gas, even in Sherwood Forest, home of Robin Hood and one of our most cherished woodlands. \u201cThey have misled everyone, promising publicly to spare the most ecologically sensitive parts of Sherwood Forest from their intrusive seismic surveys \u2013 while negotiating behind closed doors to press ahead with them.\u201d Ineos is one of the four main players exploring for oil and gas trapped below ground in shale rock across the country. The firm has taken a robust and sometimes controversial approach to exploration, winning and defending an injunction against anti-fracking campaigners, bypassing tardy councils and appealing to authorities to force the National Trust to allow it access to their land. In planning documents submitted to Nottinghamshire county council in May, Ineos said it would not undertake a seismic survey in a part of the forest known as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), one of 4,000 of the most important nature sites in England. \u201cIneos made a commercial decision to exclude all such designated areas from the survey. The Sherwood Forest NNR, Birklands and Bilhaugh SAC, Birklands and Bilhaugh SSSI and Birklands West and Ollerton Corner SSSI (all located in Nottinghamshire) were entirely removed from the survey area,\u201d the company said. But just over a month later, the company sought a licence agreement with the Forestry Commission that included maps showing parts of the Birklands SSSI would be within its survey areas. Seismic surveys are used to understand the geology below the forest, and see if shale gas could be recovered. They involve the use of small explosive charges buried in holes to create seismic waves, which are monitored by recording equipment known as geophones. As part of the licence, Ineos has agreed it is: \u201cnot to drive vehicles, set any charges, explosives or combustible equipment within 50m of any conservation site, badger set or other sensitive location (including ancient or veteran trees).\u201d The licence was subsequently agreed by the Forestry Commission on 5 July and signed-off by environment secretary Michael Gove. The commission made the decision but the rubber-stamping by Gove may be seen as sitting awkwardly with his series of pro-environment plans, such as tackling plastic waste. Ineos said despite the license agreement seeking to survey the Birklands SSSI, it would not be going ahead with a survey there. The company said its submission to the council took precedence over the Forestry Commission document. A spokesperson said: \u201cIneos has clearly set out its plans for the East Midlands seismic survey which clearly state it will not survey inside SSSI designated areas. This is true for all SSSI sites including Birklands. \u201cSurveying will take place throughout January and will include areas close by which have been pre-walked by surveyors and ecologists to ensure continued safe operations. In the case of Birklands Wood, we have determined that no vibration points will be deployed to further protect the SSSI.\u201d While Ineos\u2019s shale plans are mostly in the surveying and planning stages, other companies are further advanced. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is imminently expected to issue a green light for oil and gas company Third Energy to frack at a site in North Yorkshire. It will be the first well to be fracked in the UK since 2011. Meanwhile the National Trust has written to Ineos asking it to abandon plans to survey its Clumber Park estate near Worksop for shale gas reserves, according to the Sunday Telegraph.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve all been there: that moment when you get home and realise you didn\u2019t want that new jumper and couldn\u2019t really afford it either. It is known as buyer\u2019s remorse, and it was a concept that gave the remain camp comfort as it reeled from the shock of defeat in the EU referendum vote in June 2016. In the context of Brexit, buyer\u2019s remorse meant that people who had voted to leave would quickly regret what they had done because the economy would plunge instantly into the stonking recession predicted by the Treasury in the run-up to the plebiscite. Project Fear was actually Project Reality, it was said, and before too long Brexit voters would be clamouring for the chance to think again. No question there were those in the remain camp who, despite the obvious flaws in the European project, genuinely thought nothing good could ever come of Brexit and it would be the poor and the vulnerable who had voted leave who would suffer most from what they saw as its inevitable baleful consequences. There was, though, a snobbish and nasty subtext to the buyer\u2019s remorse theory, which was that the plebs were too dumb to know what they were voting for. Yet it was always a long shot that a second referendum would come about by these means and so it has proved. Eighteen months on and there has been little sign of buyer\u2019s remorse. In part, that is because people voted remain or leave in the referendum for complex reasons. The referendum was never just about economics, and in retrospect it was a strategic blunder on the part of the remain camp to fight only on what the vote would mean for GDP per head and house prices. Another reason why buyer\u2019s remorse has not set in is that the country \u2013 or rather the part of the country (by far the bigger part) that is not obsessed with Brexit \u2013 has moved on. There are Brexit fanatics, there are remain fanatics, and in between there are millions of people who were asked for a decision in June 2016, made it and now expect democracy to take its course. They have switched off from Brexit in just the same way that they switch off from politics between general elections. But buyer\u2019s remorse strategy required the UK to fall into recession and it has not come remotely close to doing so. The economy\u2019s performance has been lacklustre \u2013 especially in comparison with other major developed countries \u2013 but buyer\u2019s remorse would have required the economy to contract sharply and for unemployment to rocket. Something equivalent to 2009 \u2013 when the economy shrank by more than 4% \u2013 might have done the trick. Instead of which the economy is growing slightly below its long-term trend and unemployment has fallen to a 42-year low. The absence of economic Armageddon has simply reinforced the lack of trust in expert forecasters. The stickiest patch for the economy since the referendum was in the first half of 2017, when inflation rose sharply as a result of the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote, and even then growth averaged 0.3% a quarter. Since then, things have picked up a bit and, with inflationary pressures abating activity, is likely to remain reasonably firm in 2018. Expectations for the global economy are being revised up and that will help UK exporters of both manufacturing goods and services. Some of the exuberance in stock markets is froth, but one thing can be said with confidence: 2018 is not going to be another 2009. The tide turned for the global economy around the time of the Brexit vote and the upswing will continue for some time yet. There are a few reasons for the changed mood. Prolonged stimulus in the form of record-low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing has been one factor. Another has been the improved financial position of the banks. A third has been the natural rhythm of the business cycle, which means that even cautious firms have to start investing because their existing equipment packs up or becomes obsolete. For all these reasons, animal spirits started to revive. Firms that had made it through the Great Recession decided that things were going to get better rather than worse. They got fed up with being fed up. This does not mean that the world has been magically transformed and that all the problems that have dogged the past decade have magically gone away. Far from it. Those deep structural problems \u2013 the over-reliance on debt to support consumption, a lost decade of productivity growth, growing income inequality \u2013 have not gone awayand are merely being disguised by a strong cyclical upturn. A period of solid growth creates a more benign climate in which some of those weaknesses can be addressed. It remains to be seen whether the opportunity is taken. That is particularly true of Britain where the big story of the past decade has been dismal productivity. Had growth in output per head since 2008 continued on its pre-recession trend, living standards would be about 20% higher by now. Not even the most pessimistic predictions for the long-term impact of Brexit expect it to be that costly. All of which brings us to the final problem with the buyer\u2019s remorse theory: its proponents have spent so much time banging on about how terrible Brexit will be that they have neglected to come up with any solutions for tackling the reasons people voted for Brexit in the first place: low wages, job insecurity, the feeling that they were not being listened to. Remainers have latched on to any piece of negative economic news \u2013 no matter how trivial \u2013 in the hope that this will lead to change of heart among leave voters. But they have struggled to sketch out a plan for dealing with Britain\u2019s structural economic problems, which were there before 23 June 2016 and will still be there whether or not the referendum result is overturned. Constantly accentuating the negative without coming up with any solutions to Britain\u2019s chronic balance of payments deficit, its north-south divide and its reliance on debt-fuelled growth has helped create the impression that some remainers would welcome a stiff recession because it would bring voters to their senses. Remainers do themselves no favours when they over-hype the bad economic news. They may be better off pointing out that the part of the global economy that most outperformed expectations in 2017 was the eurozone and that Mario Draghi has done a brilliant job as president of the European Central Bank in disguising the single currency\u2019s innate flaws. The UK economy will do better than expected in 2018. That it will do better partly as a result of a stronger eurozone is one of life\u2019s ironies.

That it will do better partly as a result of a stronger eurozone is one of life\u2019s ironies.</p> <ul> <li><em>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</em><br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England missed a trick by not copyrighting Super Thursday, the term for the day when it releases its interest-rate decision, minutes and inflation report. Now the phrase has been co-opted for this week, when a host of retailers unveil their all-important Christmas trading updates on the same day. There is expected to be a rather mixed picture. Given the timing of Christmas, those with a strong online presence should do well \u2013 something already borne out by the Next figures last week. Next was also positive about clothing sales, which could be a good sign for Marks &amp; Spencer, which has struggled in recent years: Peel Hunt analysts predict a 1% rise in like-for-like general merchandise sales in the 13 weeks to the end of December, and a flat performance from the food business. (But for the third quarter as a whole, Barclays is forecasting a 1% drop in food sales and a 3% decline for clothing and home products.) Tesco is the other major listed retailer reporting on Thursday, and there are hopes its recovery will have continued, with Jefferies bank expecting a 2.5% like-for-like increase. Other updates due include John Lewis, House of Fraser, Mothercare, AO.com, Boohoo and Moss Bros. This week also sees news from Morrisons, Sainsbury, SuperGroup and Ted Baker among others. Phew. Fat cats can test the water Super Thursday may be on the way, but last week the day had a different designation. Yes, it was Fat Cat Thursday \u2013 so called because Britain\u2019s bosses had made more money by lunchtime on Thursday than the average worker will earn in the entire year, according to an analysis by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the High Pay Centre. The report maintains that the chief executives of FTSE 100 companies are paid a median average of \u00a33.45m a year. This is 120 times the \u00a328,758 earned on average by full-time UK workers. So perhaps bosses could afford to take a little time off, and where better to head than to the ExCeL centre for the London Boat Show, which begins this week. In its 64th year, the show boasts 300 exhibitors and has added new attractions, including a yachtsman\u2019s champagne bar, so there should be plenty of opportunities to check out the latest luxury boats such as Fairline\u2019s Squadron 53 and relax at the same time. There\u2019s even a party night on Thursday, so they could celebrate the one-week anniversary of Fat Cat Thursday. Or not, as the case may be. Micro Focus gets maximum impact It is not exactly a household name, but Micro Focus International recently became Britain\u2019s biggest quoted technology company. The catalyst was its near-\u00a37bn purchase of Hewlett-Packard software assets, finally completed last September, a year after it was first announced. The software group, which specialises in updating IT systems, will announce its half-year results on Monday and investors will be keen to hear how the combined group is settling in. The company may also have comments on the Meltdown and Spectre bugs found in key computer processors. Numis analysts said the numbers were likely to be complicated, given that they include two months of the Hewlett-Packard business and a change of year-end. In the year to October, the HP operations are expected to show a 10% to 15% drop in revenues, but overall Numis expects the joint group to show a $100m improvement in earnings to $1.47bn (\u00a31.08bn). Numis said: \u201cWe continue to see good opportunity here, as: a) attention shifts from the temporarily depressed fourth quarter [Hewlett-Packard] revenue to the longer term [earnings] and cash opportunity, and b) management get the first opportunity to educate investors in detail about the financial road ahead.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If Christmas showed us anything, it is that the high street is dying in most of our towns and many of our cities. Figures emerging from the main high-street shops covering the Christmas trading period show that a combination of falling disposable incomes and internet shopping seriously dented sales. Next was one of the first fashion retailers to reveal that its festive cheer had all been online, where sales rose 13.6%. Its high-street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. It\u2019s a trend seen by all the major retail chains in recent years that appears to be accelerating \u2013 especially when \u201csmart speakers\u201d such as the Amazon Echo were among the must-have presents under the tree. The Echo and its rival Google Home can be purchased in major stores, but it is almost counterintuitive to buy a gadget from a shop when that gadget is designed to help consumers avoid buying any goods or services from a bricks-and-mortar business. Debenhams was among the worst-hit chains. The department store saw its share price fall 20% after it announced a steep drop in December sales. Marks &amp; Spencer will tell all this week, but a better than expected performance \u2013 which is possible following improved reviews for its women\u2019s clothing \u2013 won\u2019t disguise a shop empire in decline. M&amp;S bosses are still planning to close 30 stores, among them prominent outlets in Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington, Wokingham and Worksop. This trend poses a huge problem for town councils and the government, and yet there remains a head-in-the-sand attitude that could condemn hundreds of towns to a long slow death. If profit margins \u2013 or profits of any kind \u2013 are in jeopardy, then the value of commercial town centre land becomes a fraction of what it once was. So rents will need to come down, and business rates \u2013 which account for \u00a327bn of government income \u2013 will have to fall. Former prime minister David Cameron acknowledged the danger when he commissioned the Portas review of Britain\u2019s high streets in 2011. Mary Portas, known as the queen of shops following her popular retail-makeover TV programmes, was deeply concerned that some 25,000 stores had closed since the turn of the century. At the time she said: \u201cMany [high streets] are sickly, others are on the critical list and some now are dead. They have reached a crisis point. Unless urgent action is taken much of Britain will lose, irretrievably, something that is fundamental to our society.\u201d But the Portas review and the recommendations that it spawned were based on an approach that deemed shops to be the heart of a town. Bring back the shops with a mixture of tax cuts and a spruced-up environment, went the argument, and the town should be saved. Town councillors, landlords and HMRC tax collectors would be thrilled if that were true. The hundreds of millions of pounds spent tarting up dilapidated shops and watering hanging baskets wouldn\u2019t have been wasted. Unfortunately, a town\u2019s success is really based on something else: jobs, access to amenities and transport links. Contrast Newbury and Coventry. Newbury spent millions giving its high street a facelift and tackling parking problems. The aim was to keep shoppers from heading to nearby Reading and Swindon (or, more likely, the brand-tastic retail phenomenon that is Bicester Village). Yet the town thrives more because of its transport links to London than the council\u2019s spending, however much the townspeople appreciate the sensitive upgrade. As with so many commuter towns, a reliable train service is the key to prosperity; the shops follow. Coventry has done things the right way around. It saw that its newly thriving university presented the city with an opportunity. Rather than have students based on a campus near the outskirts, it invited expansion on the city\u2019s central square, knocking down its own worn-out buildings to make way for new university towers. Students are a shock to any town not used to them, but they bring employment and spending that generates private-sector investment, including revamped shops \u2013 saving council cash. Bradford has pinned its hopes on the new Westfield Broadway shopping centre, when the magnificent arcades in Leeds town centre are only a stone\u2019s throw away. Other councils have borrowed vast sums to spend on ageing retail parks in the forlorn hope that they can maintain or even increase their value. Andrew Carter, from the thinktank Centre for Cities, said when the Broadway opened that shopping could not save any city, \u201ceven those cities which have a really thriving, bustling retail offer like Manchester, Leeds or London\u201d. Retailing is not the draw that councillors believe it to be. Employment, cinemas, parks, libraries and swimming pools are a better bet. It\u2019s these things that draw people in \u2013 and then they go to shop, says Carter. An attractive town or city needs to invite people with safe streets (those that demote cars and accommodate cycle lanes) and offer space for the things people want \u2013 cultural events, markets or new parks. This is only possible when the value of land declines, making it available for a wider range of activities. It shouldn\u2019t need cities to be destroyed, like Detroit, for them to reinvent themselves. Yet that might be how it happens.",

      "bodyText": "The end-of-year sales figures have confirmed what had been becoming clear through 2017 for the UK\u2019s car industry: its austerity-defying, unique-in-Europe, five-year boom has well and truly ended. By December, a whopping 14% fewer cars were being sold than at the same time a year ago. As a barometer of economic and consumer confidence, as well as a pointer to the fortunes of one of the UK\u2019s major manufacturing industries, the dip in sales would be troubling news for any government \u2013 let alone one set on a Brexit course that the motor industry views as potentially calamitous. Furthermore, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) makes it clear that it also blames ministers for one particular trend: the 17% drop in diesel cars sold, 200,000 fewer in 2017 than the previous year. Yet neither the overall fall, nor diesel\u2019s accelerated plunge, should be laid at the door of government. The preceding boom owed much to cheap credit, with 90% of private car sales coming via the personal contract purchases (PCPs) that have caused concern at the Bank of England. If consumer confidence in such deals has been knocked by the prospect of higher interest rates, a dose of reality could avert the greater worry of growing, unsustainable debt sparking a second crash. Meanwhile, it is hard to play anything but the tiniest violin for the industry as it whinges about the \u201cdemonisation of diesel\u201d. The minor tax incentives announced by the chancellor in his November budget went only a small way to addressing a public health crisis in air quality. When tens of thousands of premature deaths are being directly attributed by health experts to burgeoning levels of NOx pollution from diesel cars, a little perspective is needed. The direct, deliberate cheating exposed in the Volkswagen scandal has led to prosecutions, massive corporate fines and jail sentences in the US, yet virtual inaction in Europe. The motor industry has still a long way to go to make the public believe its claims that new diesel engines are clean; indeed, independent tests have shown that even those manufactured to the latest Euro 6 standards continue to fall short. Instead of showing their determination to clean up, car bosses have preferred to finger-point at wood-burning stoves, and resist the mild nudges of the Treasury. Years of issuing lab test figures \u2013 whether for petrol consumption or NOx emissions \u2013 that bore little relation to the real world have earned the industry the public\u2019s distrust. Despite all that, and given the recent history of diesel, the SMMT should be heard when it talks about unintended consequences. It was, after all, the government\u2019s desire to cut CO2 emissions that saw tax breaks given to diesel over petrol, bringing diesel from the margins to become the most popular fuel for new cars in little over a decade from 2001. Now, the SMMT says, the government risks deterring people from buying cleaner, newer cars because consumers are reluctant to invest in diesel \u2013 even though diesel may, in certain circumstances, be the preferred environmental alternative. Potential buyers are sitting on their hands, the industry claims, rather than switching to alternative fuels; older engines chug on and spew out NOx rather than get replaced. This is all too plausible, if uncomfortable, territory for the motor industry, which can only ever hope to limit its negatives in the environmental debate: even if electric cars have zero emissions at the tailpipe, there is still the environmental cost of power generation and their batteries to consider. The SMMT praised Angela Merkel for backing diesel manufacture, as Germany pursues an awkward path between protecting industry and public health by simultaneously promoting clean air zones. If the British industry really believes in cleaner diesel, it needs to embrace transparency and push solutions to tackle the errors of the recent past and the highly polluting cars on our roads \u2013 and not simply denounce attempts to force change. Otherwise, the public will indeed see only demons in diesel. UK productivity is rising \u2013 but not always for the right reasons British workers are renowned for putting in extra hours at the office to no great effect while their counterparts in France, Germany and the US clock off at 5pm with the job done. The relative productivity of workers across the developed world is a matter of huge debate, but if the figures from the OECD are taken as a guide, a US worker produces $68 each hour worked, compared with the $52 that a UK worker can generate. In France and Germany the figure is around $67 an hour. That means the average UK worker must slave away for a third more hours to achieve the same level of output as his or her rivals. So it is encouraging that the latest estimate of labour productivity by the Office for National Statistics shows a 0.9% increase in the three months to September 2017. Britain needs to play catch-up. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the UK\u2019s average output per hour worked has remained flat. If, as most economists believe, productivity is the key that unlocks more generous pay, then it is easy to see why some number-crunchers believe pay rises are about to become more generous. Almost zero productivity gains over the past 10 years has restricted pay rises to an average between 2% and 2.5%. Before 2008 the average increase in productivity was 2%, with wage rises of between 3% and 4%. Sadly, the jump in productivity is not due only to expansion by the manufacturing industry. Weaker jobs growth in the services and construction sectors is another reason why, since the Brexit vote, the UK economy has generated broadly the same amount of output for fewer hours worked. Producing the same output with fewer workers is not most people\u2019s idea of a healthy rise in productivity. But if higher investment in machinery and technology is the knock-on effect as EU workers become more scarce, that at least will rebalance the economy away from unskilled jobs to higher-paying roles. Dark side for Disney if Star Wars fails to take off in China Star Wars: The Last Jedi has been a force to be reckoned with at the global box office since its release, comfortably reaching $1.1bn (\u00a3810m) before its arrival in China this weekend. But there are early signs that it has been unable to clone its success in the world\u2019s second-largest film market, with domestic comedy The Ex-File 3 outperforming the sci-fi epic, according to preliminary figures. If The Last Jedi fails to replicate its stellar worldwide performance in China, it represents a further cautionary tale for a Hollywood studio system that is grappling with waning powers. Successive Star Wars films have struggled in the Middle Kingdom but there were hopes that Walt Disney Studios, the all-conquering Disney division behind the franchise, would reverse that with a big marketing campaign. Hollywood needs success in China to shore up its long-term future. If Star Wars fails to crack that market, it does not bode well for the US film industry.",
