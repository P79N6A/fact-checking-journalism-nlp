It appeared that the 27 commissioners \u2013 one from each EU member state \u2013 would struggle to reach a consensus on the highly political verdict on budgetary and fiscal policy and macro-economic imbalances.

      "bodyText": "A former senior executive at bailed-out Spanish bank Bankia is to receive a \u20ac14m (\u00a311.2m) payoff in a move that will cause controversy beyond the country's borders if Europe is asked to help rescue Spain's banks. As the government seeks to raise the \u20ac19bn needed by Bankia, the news that Aurelio Izquierdo would walk away with such a large payoff raised questions about what Spain's troubled banks have been doing with their money. Another former senior Bankia executive, Mat\u00edas Amat, received \u20ac6.2m for taking early retirement, aged just 58, in September. News of the payoffs came amid growing uproar over the multimillion euro deals handed out to executives at Spain's cajas, or savings banks, during the boom years when they helped inflate a housing bubble that burst four years ago. Many have since been forced out of the banks they ruined, taking millions more euros in payoffs. The toxic real estate assets they left behind are at the root of growing worries that Spanish banks will need a European-funded bailout on top of the Bankia rescue. Spanish government sources, who at the weekend said they would likely give Bankia government debt as collateral to raise \u20ac19bn from the European Central Bank, backtracked on Tuesday. Now they claim that, despite Spain's high borrowing costs, the country can raise the money itself on the markets. \"There is a clear preference to tap the market. The other option is marginal,\" a government source told Reuters. Bankia's parent company BFA on Monday reported a \u20ac3.3bn loss for 2011 \u2013 one hundred times larger than previously stated. Bankia said on Tuesday that bailout money would not be used for the multimillion euro executive payoffs as the sums were already accounted for. In Izquierdo's case, they said, the money was owed by one of the seven cajas that merged to form Bankia, and which remain shareholders, rather than by the new bank. Izquierdo was the number two at Bancaja, the second largest of the cajas that were merged two years ago. He went on to take a senior position at Bankia before leaving to run the Banco de Valencia, which has since had to be rescued. He then returned to Bancaja and will get the \u20ac14m when he leaves. Bancaja brought large amounts of toxic real estate to the merger. Bankia's parent company BFA now recognises \u20ac40bn of such assets. Bancaja operated in eastern Valencia, a coastal region that became a byword for both voracious construction and political corruption. With control of individual cajas in the hands of local politicians, their presidents were largely political appointees. A study by economists Luis Garicano and Vicente Cu\u00f1at in 2009 found a close relationship between political caja bosses and bad loans. These increased by 50% where the president was a politician with no banking experience. Bankia's executive chairman until he was forced to resign three weeks ago was Rodrigo Rato, a former finance minister for the governing People's party (PP) of prime minister Mariano Rajoy. Mat\u00edas was originally employed by Caja Madrid, the biggest of the seven savings banks \u2013 whose president was Rato. Rato and his predecessor at Caja Madrid, Miguel Blesa, were named in a private writ lodged at a Madrid court house on Tuesday which blames the two men and other executives for the fall of Spain's fourth largest bank. Anti-corruption prosecutors are also reportedly investigating senior executives at other failed cajas. PP-run Valencia is one of the Spain's biggest regional government overspenders, contributing heavily to the national deficit. Its government has been handed junk status by credit ratings agencies. Rajoy's government is expected later this week to announce plans to issue bonds to fund regional governments like Valencia, adding further to the national debt. Borrowing costs are near to euro-era records, however, amid worries about when Spain will recover from its second recession in three years and start cutting its 24% unemployment rate. Retail sales fell 9.8% in the year to April, underlining the impact of government austerity measures. Rajoy's government, which came to power in December, has passed a law severely limiting executive pay at nationalised banks.",

A string of inflation-linked salary rises among major employers is behind the jump in incomes, many of them based on two- and three-year deals. But IDS said it detected a worsening in wage conditions after the number of deals at or above 3% fell to 48% of the total from 58% in the previous month. The median pay settlement for the whole economy dropped to 2.8% after another round of public sector pay freezes took effect in April. Lower pay rises in the service sectors such as retail, finance and leisure dragged down the average, while awards in manufacturing held up. Around 20% of settlements resulted in a pay freeze, said IDS, up from 8% in the previous month. A weighted average of all settlements reported a 0.6% annual pay rise in April after IDS included the 1.3m NHS workers affected by a pay freeze. Official figures show pay rises running at 1.8% including bonuses and 1.1% without bonuses. Inflation in April fell to 3% after breaching 5% last year. Labour Research said inflation-linked pay deals were a key factor in keeping private sector deals buoyant. \"These deals have been based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation figures, not the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure. RPI inflation has been consistently higher than CPI inflation since the start of 2010,\" it said. The transport sector had seen several inflation-linked deals. United Airlines paid a 4.2% rise from 1 April, based on the February RPI plus 0.5% in the final year of a three-year agreement. Southeastern, a train operator owned by the Go-Ahead Group, entered into the final year of a two-year deal on 1 April that paid white collar staff in the TSSA union 4.2%. According to IDS 12% of deals were above 4%.",

What's more, it seems likely that the reward for Davis, chief executive of Xstrata, is only part of the story: Glencore wants to retain the bulk of Xstrata's management and so will also shower rewards on others there. Are we talking \u00a3100m all in? \u00a3200m? More? Much more? All will be revealed when the prospectus is published this week. But we know already that no performance conditions will be attached to the payments. Davis &amp; co will simply have to turn up for work for three years and get on with their job of running 150 mines around the world. Just in case Xstrata shareholders are minded to protest about this arrangement, the retention payments will be wrapped up with the vote on the all-share takeover itself. In other words, if they want to kill Big Mick's payday, then they will have to kill the deal itself. The chances of that happening are judged to be tiny, since the Qatar Investment Authority has discovered a large appetite for Xstrata shares and has emerged, in the last couple of months, with the largest stake besides Glencore's 35%. The QIA is said to be a big fan of the deal and its promised savings of $500m. The would-be refuseniks in the ranks of Xstrata's shareholders appear resigned.

Yes, it is true that everyone knew Glasenberg's intention in floating Glencore last year was to get a transparently valued acquisition currency so as to pursue his long-held ambition of buying the rest of Xstrata. Nor can anyone be surprised that the terms (2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share) look less than generous. But Xstrata's shareholders had the right to expect an insistence on the part of their independent directors, led by the chairman, Sir John Bond, that any retention payments had performance conditions attached. The principle is straightforward: align management's interests with shareholders. What if, post-takeover, Glencore's commodity traders lose their magic touch and Glenstrata shares disappoint?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover, a business that was battling for survival three years ago, has reported record annual sales and a 35% increase in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.5bn on the back of booming business in China. JLR's Indian owner, the Tata conglomerate, sought a government-guaranteed loan in 2009 and was considering the closure of a plant with the loss of thousands of jobs. However, those plans were abandoned as demand from emerging economies led by China and Russia saw the business come roaring back to health. JLR revealed on Tuesday that it sold 314,433 cars in the year to 31 March \u2013 an increase of 29% on last year \u2013 with the Range Rover Sport its biggest seller, followed by the recently launched Range Rover Evoque. The best-selling Jaguar model was the Jaguar XF. Ralf Speth, JLR's chief executive, said: \"The announcement of JLR's financial results is a positive reflection of the continued level of consumer confidence in both of our brands. These record earnings, driven by strong product demand and operating efficiencies, give JLR the financial impetus to sustain its ongoing investment programme.\" The results crown another successful month for a UK car manufacturing industry that is overwhelmingly foreign-owned and undergoing an investment boom. On top of production announcements by Nissan, Toyota, BMW and JLR, General Motors announced a fortnight ago it would preserve the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, saving 2,100 jobs and adding 700 more. Boosted by demand from emerging economies for luxury brands, the British car industry produced 1.34m vehicles last year \u2013 an increase of nearly 6% on 2010. While sales of Bentleys, Minis and Ranger Rovers have grown, so has demand for mass-market vehicles such as the Nissan Qashqai, made at Britain's largest car factory in Sunderland. China remains a source of exponential growth for JLR, recording a 76% leap in sales to more than 50,000 vehicles, JLR's third largest market. Russia was its fourth biggest, growing by 38% to more than 16,000 vehicles. The UK is still JLR's biggest market, but was the slowest grower among the top five countries, increasing sales by 3% to 60,000 vehicles, followed by a resurgent US which recorded a 15% increase to 58,000. Mark Fulthorpe, an analyst at IHS, said the Range Rover and Land Rover brands were outperforming competitors in old and new markets. \"These are positive signs because they are growing their presence in emerging markets and they are proving to have a sustainable business for their vehicles in some of their mature markets.\" Tata bought JLR from Ford in 2008 for a reported $2.3bn and was soon locked in negotiations with the Labour government over a AAA-rated loan guarantee as the credit crunch hit western Europe. At one stage the company considered closing one of its production sites in Solihull or Castle Bromwich in Birmingham, but abandoned those plans and also stepped back from seeking state assistance. Since then it has announced a series of hefty investments in the UK, including plans to build the new F-type Jaguar convertible at Castle Bromwich, constructing a new engine plant in Wolverhampton with 750 staff and adding 1,000 jobs at the Solihull factory, where it produces the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and the Land Rover Discovery and Defender. The Evoque is produced at JLR's Halewood plant in Liverpool, which recently confirmed plans to hire a further 1,000 workers. Jaguar employs 20,000 people in the UK. Roger Maddison, national officer of the Unite union, said JLR's success was \"a testament to the hard work and sacrifices of its UK workforce\". He added: \"During the 2008 credit crunch the workers agreed to \u00a370 million of savings to support the company through the downturn.\"",

      "body": "<p>With analysts expecting the hotel industry to see further consolidation, <strong>InterContinental Hotels</strong> has been tipped as a possible \u00a35.5bn target for US peer Marriott.</p> <p>In a buy note on InterContinental, Numis said the strategic rationale for such a merger was compelling. Both have similar growth plans, including reducing hotel ownership in favour of management and franchise contracts. Indeed InterContinental currently has one of its trophy hotels, the Barclay in New York, up for sale.</p> <p>Both are also seeking global growth, including expansion in key emerging markets such as China. Numis analyst Wyn Ellis said:</p> <blockquote> We believe that hotel industry consolidation is inevitable at some stage. InterContinental, trading at an apparently perpetual discount to its US peers, looks like a possible consolidatee. There are a number of possible consolidators, but we consider Marriott the most likely and...we believe the case is compelling. A merger would create a dominant player in the global hotel market with over 9% of global room supply (19% in the US) and over 20% of the global pipeline. <br> InterContinental, Marriott is, we believe, just one of the potential tie-ups. In our opinion, a potential for takeover will put a floor under the InterContinental share price which, combined with its standalone investment attractions confirms [it] as one of our top picks. </blockquote> <p>Numis suggested any bid could be at a premium of around 30%, putting a valuation of around $8.66bn on InterContinental. In the market the hotel group's shares added 33p - or 2.3% - to \u00a314.65.</p> <p>Overall, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 34.80 points higher at 5391.14 , helped by talk that China planned further stimulus measures to boost its economy, although this was later played down. Even so, it was enough to outweigh continuing concerns about the eurozone, with the focus now firmly on Spain's creaking banking system and possible recapitalisation of its banks. An opening rise on Wall Street after a long weekend also gave some encouragement to investors, despite disappointing US house price, consumer confidence and Dallas manufacturing figures. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> With the possibility that Spain might be able to rely on the ECB to save its struggling banking sector, investors today seemed to think there's a buying opportunity to be had. Whether they are correct or not remains to be seen as at the moment investors are fire fighting day by day in this survival of the fittest. </blockquote> <p>Mining groups were among the leading risers in the wake of the China speculation, with <strong>Kazakhmys </strong>climbing 20p to 710.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 64.5p to \u00a329.22.</p> <p><strong>BG</strong> was 20.5p better at 1283.5p after the gases group signed a binding agreement to sell its 60.1% stake in Brazil's Comgas to Cosan for $1.7bn.</p> <p>But banks suffered fallout from the Spanish worries, with <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> down 0.34p at 20.62p and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> 0.14p lower at 25.9p</p> <p>And building materials group <strong>Wolseley</strong> fell 23p to \u00a322.77 after it reported a poor performance in Europe thanks to the current crisis.</p> <p>Elsewhere, news of the UK government's U-turn on its pasty tax saw <strong>Greggs</strong> jump 37.9p to 504.5p, but banknote printer <strong>De La Rue</strong> dropped 32.5p to 976.5p on profit taking after a 73% rise in full year earnings.</p> <p><strong>FirstGroup</strong> fell 5.7p to 215.4p. After a meeting with the transport company's management on Monday, Shore Capital repeated its hold rating but said the investment case remained difficult. Analyst Karl Burns said:</p> <blockquote> Despite no further deterioration operationally, our concerns with FirstGroup persist, mainly the prospect of 2014 bank covenants being tested, if the group fails to retain either Great Western and/or Capital Connect [rail franchises]. Given the loss of earnings, in addition to working capital outflow and continued dividend payments, we believe at the seasonal high point of net debt, covenant headroom would be minimal. In our view, the group could require capital to increase headroom. Post the meeting with management, we retain our 2013 forecasts, with FirstGroup trading on a PE of just 7.6 times. Whilst FirstGroup appears inexpensive, we believe this reflects not only the uncertainty over rail but over the group's balance sheet. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Serviced Office Group</strong> fell 4% to 2.75p after the group revealed an \u00a38.8m loss for the year. This included revaluation losses of \u00a37.9m. Meanwhile the company is in talks to retire a \u00a323.5m loan due to Royal Bank of Scotland, after the interest rate cover covenant was breached in August.</p> <p>In current trading, the company said it generated revenues of \u00a33.4m for the first quarter and earnings of \u00a3427,000.</p> <p><strong>Ithaca Energy</strong> lost 54.25p to 121.75p as the oil and gas producer called off takeover discussions with a number of potential bidders, as none of the proposals reflected the board's estimate of the company's value.</p> <p>Finally <strong>ValiRx</strong>, a life sciences group, soared nearly 40% to 0.545p, after studies showed positive results from one of its prostrate cancer compounds. The trials indicated Val201 significantly inhibited the proliferation of aggressive tumours and decreased development of secondary tumours. The company said the findings were a major step forward since they independently confirmed earlier studies it had undertaken itself. The compound will now go into clinical trials.</p>",

A merger would create a dominant player in the global hotel market with over 9% of global room supply (19% in the US) and over 20% of the global pipeline. InterContinental, Marriott is, we believe, just one of the potential tie-ups. In our opinion, a potential for takeover will put a floor under the InterContinental share price which, combined with its standalone investment attractions confirms [it] as one of our top picks. Numis suggested any bid could be at a premium of around 30%, putting a valuation of around $8.66bn on InterContinental. In the market the hotel group's shares added 33p - or 2.3% - to \u00a314.65. Overall, the FTSE 100 finished 34.80 points higher at 5391.14 , helped by talk that China planned further stimulus measures to boost its economy, although this was later played down. Even so, it was enough to outweigh continuing concerns about the eurozone, with the focus now firmly on Spain's creaking banking system and possible recapitalisation of its banks. An opening rise on Wall Street after a long weekend also gave some encouragement to investors, despite disappointing US house price, consumer confidence and Dallas manufacturing figures. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: With the possibility that Spain might be able to rely on the ECB to save its struggling banking sector, investors today seemed to think there's a buying opportunity to be had. Whether they are correct or not remains to be seen as at the moment investors are fire fighting day by day in this survival of the fittest. Mining groups were among the leading risers in the wake of the China speculation, with Kazakhmys climbing 20p to 710.5p and Rio Tinto rising 64.5p to \u00a329.22. BG was 20.5p better at 1283.5p after the gases group signed a binding agreement to sell its 60.1% stake in Brazil's Comgas to Cosan for $1.7bn. But banks suffered fallout from the Spanish worries, with Royal Bank of Scotland down 0.34p at 20.62p and Lloyds Banking Group 0.14p lower at 25.9p And building materials group Wolseley fell 23p to \u00a322.77 after it reported a poor performance in Europe thanks to the current crisis. Elsewhere, news of the UK government's U-turn on its pasty tax saw Greggs jump 37.9p to 504.5p, but banknote printer De La Rue dropped 32.5p to 976.5p on profit taking after a 73% rise in full year earnings. FirstGroup fell 5.7p to 215.4p. After a meeting with the transport company's management on Monday, Shore Capital repeated its hold rating but said the investment case remained difficult. Analyst Karl Burns said: Despite no further deterioration operationally, our concerns with FirstGroup persist, mainly the prospect of 2014 bank covenants being tested, if the group fails to retain either Great Western and/or Capital Connect [rail franchises]. Given the loss of earnings, in addition to working capital outflow and continued dividend payments, we believe at the seasonal high point of net debt, covenant headroom would be minimal. In our view, the group could require capital to increase headroom. Post the meeting with management, we retain our 2013 forecasts, with FirstGroup trading on a PE of just 7.6 times. Whilst FirstGroup appears inexpensive, we believe this reflects not only the uncertainty over rail but over the group's balance sheet. Lower down the market Serviced Office Group fell 4% to 2.75p after the group revealed an \u00a38.8m loss for the year. This included revaluation losses of \u00a37.9m. Meanwhile the company is in talks to retire a \u00a323.5m loan due to Royal Bank of Scotland, after the interest rate cover covenant was breached in August. In current trading, the company said it generated revenues of \u00a33.4m for the first quarter and earnings of \u00a3427,000. Ithaca Energy lost 54.25p to 121.75p as the oil and gas producer called off takeover discussions with a number of potential bidders, as none of the proposals reflected the board's estimate of the company's value. Finally ValiRx, a life sciences group, soared nearly 40% to 0.545p, after studies showed positive results from one of its prostrate cancer compounds. The trials indicated Val201 significantly inhibited the proliferation of aggressive tumours and decreased development of secondary tumours. The company said the findings were a major step forward since they independently confirmed earlier studies it had undertaken itself. The compound will now go into clinical trials.",

At least that is the strongly held view in Madrid, where Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is considering yet another rescue, this time involving a possible merger of Ibercaja with rivals Liberbank and Caja3. It follows a longstanding policy, established by the previous socialist administration, that smashing together almost all the troubled cajas, which operate much like building societies, into larger clusters is the way out of the crisis. No amount of argument has dissuaded Rajoy, despite the most high profile victim of the financial crash turning out to be Bankia, which is the result of a seven cajas coming together. A bigger banking group means a bigger balance sheet to bear the heavy load of debt \u2013 that's the thinking. But a bigger balance sheet is matched by bigger debts. So in Bankia's case, instead of some heavily indebted cajas and other well financed groups, Spain finds itself with one unstable institution housed in the bank's Madrid HQ. Government officials need only to look to the UK to observe the folly of merging distressed banks into larger groups. Gordon Brown's approval of the merger of Halifax and Lloyds TSB wrecked what remained of Lloyds' balance sheet. The regulator, the FSA, waved through Royal Bank of Scotland's merger with ABN Amro on the basis that bigger is best in a financial crisis, not looking to see whether ABN was a repository for toxic debt itself, which it was. Brown also gave the nod to Nationwide as it swallowed some of its bust rivals, a decision that pushed the UK's largest building society into deep financial trouble. Instead of using better-off financial groups as rescue vehicles, the government should have nationalised all the weaklings. Such a policy rewards the conservatism and prudence of the better financed groups and punishes those that have lent too much. It also maintains the plurality of the banking system. Instead we have mergers that store up problems for the future. If it carries on Spain will soon have the same banking oligopoly that the UK suffers from and will need to think about breaking up the groups it has painstakingly put together or, as the UK is attempting, encourage new entrants. Rajoy appears to have set his course, despite being under pressure from the ratings agencies, which dislike mergers of good banks with bad ones. The boards of Ibercaja, Liberbank and Caja3 could agree as early as Tuesday to go ahead with a tie-up that creates a lender with \u20ac120bn of assets. In theory, Ibercaja would be rescuing Liberbank and Caja3, both of which were formed from at least three cajas. But in reality, Rajoy is just sanctioning another Bankia \u2013 and look at where that has got him.",

As an official of an international institution, her salary of $467,940 (\u00a3298,675) a year plus $83,760 additional allowance a year is not subject to any taxes. The former French finance minister took over as managing director of the IMF last year when she succeeded her disgraced compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was forced to resign after he faced charges \u2013 later dropped \u2013 of sexually attacking a New York hotel maid. Lagarde, 56, receives a pay and benefits package worth more than American president Barack Obama earns from the United States government, and he pays taxes on it. The same applies to nearly all United Nations employees \u2013 article 34 of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations of 1961, which has been signed by 187 states, declares: \"A diplomatic agent shall be exempt from all dues and taxes, personal or real, national, regional or municipal.\" According to Lagarde's contract she is also entitled to a pay rise on 1 July every year during her five-year contract. Base salaries range from $46,000 to $80,521. Senior salaries range between $95,394 and $123,033 but these are topped up with adjustments for the cost of living in different countries. A UN worker based in Geneva, for example, will see their base salary increased by 106%, in Bonn by 50.6%, Paris 62% and Peshawar 38.6%. Even in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, one of the poorest areas of the world, a UN employee's salary will be increased by 53.2%. Other benefits include rent subsidies, dependency allowances for spouses and children, education grants for school-age children and travel and shipping expenses, as well as subsidised medical insurance. For many years critics have complained that IMF, World Bank, and United Nations employees are able to live large at international taxpayers' expense. During the 1944 economic conference at Bretton Woods, where the IMF was created, American and British politicians disagreed over salaries for the bureaucrats. British delegates, including the economist John Maynard Keynes, considered the American proposals for salaries to be \"monstrous\", but lost the argument.

      "bodyText": "Utilities group Pennon has seen a strong performance at its South West Water business offset disappointing results from Viridor, its waste-management division. The company's full year profits rose 6.4% to \u00a3200.5m, with the water division up 9.8% but Viridor down 8.4%. Chairman Ken Harvey said South West Water was well placed to outperform the assumptions for its current regulatory period, and he was confident there would be no water restrictions this summer. But Viridor was hit by lower prices for recycled materials and higher bid costs. The company cut costs to mitigate some of the downturn but is cautious about any recovery in prices in the short term.

      "body": "<p>Spain cannot afford to let a single bank or regional government collapse as that would bring the entire country to its knees, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, warned on Monday.</p> <p>In a rare and unexpected appearance before the press, Rajoy failed to calm markets which had reacted nervously to Spain's biggest-ever bailout, the \u20ac23.5bn (\u00a318.8bn) rescue of Bankia announced on Friday.</p> <p>\"We are not going to let any region or financial entity fall, because otherwise the country would fall,\" he said.</p> <p>The cost of Bankia's bailout has spiralled over the past three weeks and a revision of its 2011 accounts over that period has seen losses at parent company BFA multiplied by 100. On Monday night the company reported the biggest loss in Spain's banking history \u2013 of somewhere above \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.6bn). It had originally declared just \u20ac30m in losses.</p> <p>Nervousness that other Spanish banks may be hiding similar-sized holes saw Spain's borrowing costs soar once more, with investors demanding 6.5% interest on future 10-year debt. That took the rate dangerously close to the unsustainable levels at which other eurozone countries such as Portugal had to request a bailout.</p> <p>Bankia, meanwhile, plummeted in value, losing 13% on the Madrid stock market. It has now lost two-thirds of its value since shares were floated last July.</p> <p>\"We took the bull by the horns because the alternative was collapse,\" said Rajoy, explaining why his government was pumping money into a bank created two years ago by the merger of seven troubled savings banks.</p> <p>Rajoy claimed pressure on Spain's borrowing costs had more to do with worries over Europe and Greece than Bankia. \"There are major doubts over the eurozone and that makes the risk premium for some countries very high,\" he said. \"That's why it would be a very good idea to deliver a clear message there's no going back for the euro.\"</p> <p>But as markets were buoyed by an opinion poll showing pro-bailout parties ahead in the runup to Greece's 17 June elections, reducing the risk of it abandoning the euro, the rise in Spain's borrowing costs showed the Bankia bailout was making investors nervous.</p> <p>Ten-year borrowing costs in Italy stayed a full percentage point below Spain's, while those in already bailed-out Portugal actually fell. Spanish yields, meanwhile, hit their highest level since the dramatic month of November. And while the London stock market rallied slightly, Spain's lost two points. The Ibex index is at a nine-year low.</p> <p>Rajoy dismissed growing rumours that, as French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has predicted, a swath of Spanish banks will need rescuing by Europe's bailout funds. \"There will be no rescue of the Spanish banking sector,\" he said.</p> <p>Spain's central bank estimates some \u20ac180bn of potentially loss-making toxic real estate assets left over from the 2008 housing bust are held by banks. Bankia holds some \u20ac32bn of that total.</p> <p>Rajoy said the government had not yet decided how to raise the \u20ac19bn needed to complete the Bankia bailout. Officials say it will probably give the bank a tranche of government debt instead of trying to borrow money itself.</p> <p>Bankia could then use that as collateral to receive cash from the European Central Bank, shifting part of the rescue burden outside Spain.

In a rare and unexpected appearance before the press, Rajoy failed to calm markets which had reacted nervously to Spain's biggest-ever bailout, the \u20ac23.5bn (\u00a318.8bn) rescue of Bankia announced on Friday. \"We are not going to let any region or financial entity fall, because otherwise the country would fall,\" he said. The cost of Bankia's bailout has spiralled over the past three weeks and a revision of its 2011 accounts over that period has seen losses at parent company BFA multiplied by 100. On Monday night the company reported the biggest loss in Spain's banking history \u2013 of somewhere above \u20ac3.3bn (\u00a32.6bn). It had originally declared just \u20ac30m in losses. Nervousness that other Spanish banks may be hiding similar-sized holes saw Spain's borrowing costs soar once more, with investors demanding 6.5% interest on future 10-year debt. That took the rate dangerously close to the unsustainable levels at which other eurozone countries such as Portugal had to request a bailout. Bankia, meanwhile, plummeted in value, losing 13% on the Madrid stock market. It has now lost two-thirds of its value since shares were floated last July. \"We took the bull by the horns because the alternative was collapse,\" said Rajoy, explaining why his government was pumping money into a bank created two years ago by the merger of seven troubled savings banks. Rajoy claimed pressure on Spain's borrowing costs had more to do with worries over Europe and Greece than Bankia. \"There are major doubts over the eurozone and that makes the risk premium for some countries very high,\" he said. \"That's why it would be a very good idea to deliver a clear message there's no going back for the euro.\" But as markets were buoyed by an opinion poll showing pro-bailout parties ahead in the runup to Greece's 17 June elections, reducing the risk of it abandoning the euro, the rise in Spain's borrowing costs showed the Bankia bailout was making investors nervous. Ten-year borrowing costs in Italy stayed a full percentage point below Spain's, while those in already bailed-out Portugal actually fell. Spanish yields, meanwhile, hit their highest level since the dramatic month of November. And while the London stock market rallied slightly, Spain's lost two points. The Ibex index is at a nine-year low. Rajoy dismissed growing rumours that, as French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has predicted, a swath of Spanish banks will need rescuing by Europe's bailout funds. \"There will be no rescue of the Spanish banking sector,\" he said. Spain's central bank estimates some \u20ac180bn of potentially loss-making toxic real estate assets left over from the 2008 housing bust are held by banks. Bankia holds some \u20ac32bn of that total. Rajoy said the government had not yet decided how to raise the \u20ac19bn needed to complete the Bankia bailout. Officials say it will probably give the bank a tranche of government debt instead of trying to borrow money itself. Bankia could then use that as collateral to receive cash from the European Central Bank, shifting part of the rescue burden outside Spain. Government sources say both Germany and Ireland have used a similar system in the past. Analysts warned, however, that this would make investors even more reluctant to buy Spanish debt. \"It sends a signal of a lack of confidence,\" said Mark Miller of Capital Economics. A wider audit of Spain's banking system should reveal by June what capital gap other banks will need to fill. \"Events at Bankia will reinforce the view that the upcoming external review should identify a significant recapitalisation need,\" said analysts at Nomura, who put a sector-wide recapitalisation at more than \u20ac50bn. A recent poll showed that 62% of Spaniards think the country will eventually need some sort of financial rescue package.",
