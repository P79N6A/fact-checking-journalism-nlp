      "bodyText": "Monsoon has been named and shamed by the government for failing to pay more than 1,400 workers the minimum wage. The privately owned fashion retailer is one of 115 companies caught in the latest swoop by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which oversees implementation of the pay regulations. The government introduced the practice of naming firms in October 2013 to raise pressure on companies to stick to the rules entitling workers to a minimum of \u00a36.70 an hour. The latest list reveals that Monsoon short-changed 1,438 workers \u2013 more than a quarter of its UK store staff \u2013 a total of \u00a3104,507.83. The company has been forced to reimburse staff and pay a fine of \u00a328,147.81. The retailer previously required all staff to wear Monsoon clothes on duty, after buying them at a discount. The compulsory expense meant in effect many staff were taking home less than the minimum wage. Monsoon has since started paying a clothing allowance and raised wages. The company said: \u201cMonsoon Accessorize has recently been working with HMRC in a wide-ranging review of its payroll practices in relation to the national minimum wage. This review has revealed an historic, unintentional breach of the regulations in respect of its staff discount policies for Monsoon clothing. Monsoon is pleased that this issue has been identified and has already taken prompt action to remedy it.\u201d The company is listed by the government alongside a number of hair salons, car repair shops and a riding centre for disabled people. Workers at the 115 companies were owed more than \u00a3389,000 in arrears. Monsoon is the second major fashion chain to be targeted by the government this year. In January, H&amp;M was revealed to have underpaid 540 workers a total of \u00a32,605. Employers that pay workers less than the minimum wage not only have to pay back arrears at current rates, but also face financial penalties of up to \u00a320,000. The business minister, Nick Boles, said: \u201cEmployers that fail to pay the minimum wage hurt the living standards of the lowest-paid and their families.\u201d Retailers are under pressure to increase remuneration for their lowest-paid workers before a rise in the national minimum wage for over-25s \u2013 the so-called \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 due to be implemented in April. Last month, Morrisons increased pay for 90,000 shop floor staff to \u00a38.20 an hour \u2013 \u00a31 an hour more than the new national rate. That came after German discounter Lidl said it would pay \u00a38.20 an hour and Sainsbury\u2019s gave staff a 4% pay rise to \u00a37.36 an hour, although unlike the other retailers, that includes paid breaks. After years of falling real wages since the financial crisis, campaigners have piled pressure on employers this year by highlighting that the government was topping up low pay through the benefit system. They targeted the annual shareholder meetings of major retailers, including Morrisons, Next, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, with protests to demand the adoption of the full living wage, which is set by independent analysts and is \u00a37.85 an hour, or \u00a39.15 in London.",

      "bodyText": "Police are investigating a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d cyber-attack on the website of TalkTalk which could have compromised customers\u2019 credit card and other personal details. The telecoms provider has 4 million customers in the UK. It is the second time in the past 12 months that TalkTalk customers have been affected by data breaches. \u201cWe are continuing to work with leading cybercrime specialists and the Metropolitan police to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed,\u201d the company said on Thursday night after revealing the attack, which took place on Wednesday. Its chief executive, Dido Harding, said: \u201cWe take any threat to the security of our customers\u2019 data extremely seriously, and we are taking all the necessary steps to understand what has happened here.\u201d TalkTalk was informing its customers immediately about the attack as a precaution, she added. Customers criticised the firm on Twitter over the announcement. Katie Jonas, who has been a TalkTalk customer for three years, said she was \u201cfuming\u201d after being on hold to TalkTalk customer services for more than an hour. She said: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that my bank details may have been taken but didn\u2019t want to have to change all bank details. It\u2019s a lot of hassle doing so but now it looks like I will have to after the disgusting customer service. \u201cI was angry enough being on hold that long but to then be cut off is terrible.\u201d She added her family each had mobile phone contracts with the company and usually got a \u201cgreat service\u201d but added the timing of the announcement was \u201cnot really acceptable\u201d. She said: \u201cThe late announcement is not really acceptable either but even worse is the communications. By the time people are informed who knows how much could have been stolen.\u201d One customer said his computer had come under attack on Thursday night. In December 2014 the company said it was investigating whether its customer database had been leaked after more than 100 customers said they had received calls from Indian-based scammers quoting their names, addresses and account details. Dozens of customers have since been tricked out of thousands of pounds by fraudsters who called them pretending to be TalkTalk staff. After receiving such a fraudulent call, Graeme Smith, from Chester-le-Street in Co Durham, lost \u00a32,815 from his Santander account. TalkTalk has refused to accept any liability in his case, and Smith\u2019s bank has also declined to refund the sum. Santander said that he gave personal details to the fraudsters, \u201cthus validating and authorising the transfer of funds\u201d. The broadband and phone provider said in February that a third-party contractor that had legitimate access to its customer accounts was involved in the data breach. It took legal action against the supplier, thought to be based in India. TalkTalk contacted customers to warn them about the criminal activity and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was also informed. It was still investigating the breach. In August, Carphone Warehouse admitted that the details of up to 2.4 million customers may have been accessed in a \u201csophisticated cyber-attack\u201d. The incident also affected TalkTalk mobile customers who had bought phones or contracts through the high-street chain. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was also notified about the Carphone attack, along with Scotland Yard. What you need to know What data might have been exposed? TalkTalk said there was \u201ca chance\u201d data including credit card and bank account details may have been accessed. Other personal data could include names, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers. The company has admitted \u201cnot all of the data was encrypted\u201d but that \u201cwe believed our systems were as secure as they could be\u201d. What should customers do? The firm has advised customers to \u201ckeep an eye on your accounts over the next few months\u201d and report anything suspicious to their bank or Action Fraud, the UK\u2019s fraud reporting centre. People should also be vigilant to unsolicited calls asking for personal data or passwords, the firm said, adding it would never call to ask for bank details. What kind of attack was it, and when did it happen? The attack took place on Wednesday and the company said it took its website down when it noticed \u201cunusual activity\u201d on its website. The internet provider said it did so in an \u201ceffort to protect data\u201d. Digital security expert Benjamin Harris, from MWR InfoSecurity, suggested a denial of service attack, which sees hackers block access to a site, would not have led to personal data being compromised. Who\u2019s behind the breach? It is unclear at the moment. Scotland Yard\u2019s cyber crime unit has launched an investigation to establish what happened, how much data has been breached and the source of the attack. Why was TalkTalk targeted? As a broadband and mobile phone provider to four million customers, TalkTalk would be required to store large amounts of personal data. It is the third time this year they have fallen prey to a data breach. In August the company revealed its mobile sales site was hit by a \u201csophisticated and co-ordinated cyber attack\u201d in which personal data was breached by criminals, while in February customers were warned about scammers who managed to steal thousands of account numbers and names from the company\u2019s computers. But the company points out it is not the only victim, saying the latest attack \u201cis by no means an isolated incident\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "It'll take more than a tickle to push bank customers into switching", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had three options. The first was the radical one of breaking up the big banks on the grounds that nothing less would address the \u201cstriking\u201d stability in market shares over time. The second route was the imaginative idea of abolishing \u201cfree\u201d in-credit banking, thereby exposing the rotten rates for savers and, perhaps, encouraging punters to shop around. The third was a technocratic fiddle to try to tell customers what they\u2019re missing. To the surprise of almost nobody, the CMA chose the third \u2013 a tickle. It used different language, of course. Alasdair Smith, the panel chairman, thinks the measures will have \u201ca far-reaching impact on how banks operate and will empower account holders to search for and switch to the account that suits them best\u201d. Good luck with that. The evidence of a couple of decades suggests most bank customers require more than nudges and prompts before they move their custom. The CMA is placing a lot of faith in Midata, a government tool that allows people to compare accounts based on their own banking data. If Midata is the answer, it requires a serious upgrade. Smith confessed that none of his five-strong panel had heard of the service before they started their investigations. Would the other options have been better? Abolishing \u201cfree\u201d in-credit banking was a nonstarter. Parliament will never pass a law to make banks raise the price of their core product. The breakup option is the most attractive in theory. It is maddening, for example, to hear Lloyds Banking Group, the market leader, describe Halifax as its \u201cchallenger\u201d brand; a challenge from a business you own isn\u2019t real competition. Yet it is also true that the limited disposals undertaken on the orders of Brussels \u2013 the liberation of TSB from Lloyds, and Williams &amp; Glyn from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 have been expensive, time-consuming and not obviously desired by customers. The depressing truth is that past consolidation should never have happened. RBS\u2019s purchase of NatWest in 2000 was a mistake, as was Lloyds\u2019 acquisition of HBOS in 2009. For the latter, the last Labour government told us to hold our noses in the midst of the banking crisis and think of the national interest. We\u2019re still holding them. Lloyds, note, was firmly in the sinners\u2019 quadrant in an interesting graph in the CMA report \u2013 the one labelled \u201cabove-average prices and below-average quality\u201d. The CMA\u2019s suggestions won\u2019t do any harm and, at the margin, smarter use of online comparison sites might help. But the British Chambers of Commerce, whose members are more exposed than personal account customers to the banking oligopoly, had the right view on this underwhelming report: \u201cThe CMA is effectively endorsing a status quo that many businesses find unacceptable.\u201d \u2018Radical\u2019 Labour goes easy on banks Still on the CMA report, you might have thought the Labour party \u2013 the one under supposedly radical new leadership \u2013 could have summoned some blood and thunder. Remember, pressure from former leader Ed Miliband virtually prompted the inquiry, and former shadow chancellor Ed Balls was clear on what he wanted \u2013 two new challenger banks and a market share test.

Guy Hands brought the operator of onshore wind farms to the stock market in 2003 at 260p a share, retaining a 68% stake for his Terra Firma private equity outfit. Now he\u2019s taking it private again at 185p. Should outside investors feel minced in Hands\u2019s turbines? No. In fact, they\u2019re probably grateful for his generosity in paying a 40% premium to the share price on Wednesday. Infinis, sadly, has been hit by two factors beyond its control \u2013 low wholesale power prices and the government\u2019s withdrawal of subsidies from renewables. Its chairman, Ian Marchant, reckons the split is two-thirds/one-third, but he is right to rant about the government\u2019s \u201ccrass\u201d actions. The Tories\u2019 manifesto spoke of wind subsidies going over the lifetime of the parliament, but the process took about \u201cfive weeks rather than five years\u201d. Onshore wind is not to everybody\u2019s taste but it is cheaper than nuclear and ought to have a place within a sensible planning regime. Instead, Infinis is yet another promising British business crowded out by the government\u2019s baffling fanaticism for foreign-funded nuclear technology that only ever becomes more expensive.",

The second route was the imaginative idea of abolishing \u201cfree\u201d in-credit banking, thereby exposing the rotten rates for savers and, perhaps, encouraging punters to shop around. The third was a technocratic fiddle to try to tell customers what they\u2019re missing.</p> <p>To the surprise of almost nobody, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/high-street-banks-survive-competition-inquiry\">the CMA chose the third</a> \u2013 a tickle. It used different language, of course. Alasdair Smith, the panel chairman, thinks the measures will have \u201ca far-reaching impact on how banks operate and will empower account holders to search for and switch to the account that suits them best\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/high-street-banks-survive-competition-inquiry\">Banking watchdog's report under fire for 'pulling punches'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Good luck with that. The evidence of a couple of decades suggests most bank customers require more than nudges and prompts before they move their custom. The CMA is placing a lot of faith in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/mar/26/new-comparison-tool-to-offer-best-current-accounts-launched\">Midata, a government tool</a> that allows people to compare accounts based on their own banking data. If Midata is the answer, it requires a serious upgrade. Smith confessed that none of his five-strong panel had heard of the service before they started their investigations.</p> <p>Would the other options have been better? Abolishing \u201cfree\u201d in-credit banking was a nonstarter. Parliament will never pass a law to make banks raise the price of their core product.</p> <p>The breakup option is the most attractive in theory. It is maddening, for example, to hear Lloyds Banking Group, the market leader, describe Halifax as its \u201cchallenger\u201d brand; a challenge from a business you own isn\u2019t real competition. Yet it is also true that the limited disposals undertaken on the orders of Brussels \u2013 the liberation of TSB from Lloyds, and Williams &amp; Glyn from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 have been expensive, time-consuming and not obviously desired by customers.</p> <p>The depressing truth is that past consolidation should never have happened. RBS\u2019s purchase of NatWest in 2000 was a mistake, as was Lloyds\u2019 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.hbosbusiness\">acquisition of HBOS</a> in 2009. For the latter, the last Labour government told us to hold our noses in the midst of the banking crisis and think of the national interest. We\u2019re still holding them. Lloyds, note, was firmly in the sinners\u2019 quadrant in an interesting graph in the CMA report \u2013 the one labelled \u201cabove-average prices and below-average quality\u201d.</p> <p>The CMA\u2019s suggestions won\u2019t do any harm and, at the margin, smarter use of online comparison sites might help. But the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/\">British Chambers of Commerce</a>, whose members are more exposed than personal account customers to the banking oligopoly, had the right view on this underwhelming report: \u201cThe CMA is effectively endorsing a status quo that many businesses find unacceptable.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Radical\u2019 Labour goes easy on banks</h2> <p>Still on the CMA report, you might have thought the Labour party \u2013 the one under supposedly radical new leadership \u2013 could have summoned some blood and thunder.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s largest confectionery company has claimed that a levy on sweet food and drinks will not make people overhaul their diets. Mary Barnard, who heads the UK division of the parent company of Dairy Milk maker Cadbury, said Denmark had abandoned proposals for a sugar tax after consumers circumvented a similar tax on fatty foods by buying butter and ice cream abroad. \u201cDenmark withdrew the sugar tax as it didn\u2019t drive consumer change. I think the consumer has demonstrated the ability to make change [without a tax]. Can we do more on health? Yes, and we should do more, but there is also a role for treats in everyday life. I would hate to see food losing the joy that Cadbury has been about for decades,\u201d said Barnard, president of the northern European arm of US group Mondelez International. Barnard was speaking ahead of the publication of Thursday\u2019s report by Public Health England urging ministers to impose a sugar tax. It also called for action on the marketing of unhealthy products to children and two-for-one deals on sugary foods in supermarkets. A spokesman for the prime minister said David Cameron was not in favour of a tax, and believed there were other measures to drive down childhood obesity. \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s view remains that he doesn\u2019t see a need for a tax on sugar,\u201d the No 10 spokesman told reporters. The PHE report suggests a tax of up to 20% on sugary drinks and food would cut consumption. The report says a levy would tackle the obesity crisis by curbing demand for unhealthy food and drinks. Pressure for action has increased with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s Sugar Rush campaign for a tax on sugary drinks, which has garnered more than 130,000 signatures. Barnard said Mondelez had already taken steps to be more responsible \u2013 such as pledging that all its standard-sized \u201csingle-serving\u201d bars would contain less than 250 calories by the end of this year. \u201cWe have already demonstrated our responsiblity and continue to work with the government and other agencies to do more. But what I would like to see is a more level playing field \u2026 restaurants don\u2019t provide a lot of nutritional information on their menus,\u201d said Barnard. The company has said it wants to be a \u201cglobal leader in wellbeing snacks\u201d \u2013 with plans for half of its products to fit within that definition by 2020 \u2013 up from a third today. A Dairy Milk bar could fit within Mondelez\u2019s version of wellbeing \u2013 which includes products under a certain size or that use sustainably sourced ingredients such as Fairtrade chocolate. Stricter controls on sugary products and advertisements for them would be a blow to Mondelez. The two fingers of its bestselling Twirl \u2013 the UK\u2019s favourite chocolate bar \u2013 contain just over a quarter of the guideline daily amount of sugar. A Double Decker contains a third, not far behind one of the company\u2019s newest concoctions \u2013 the Marvellous Creations Banana Caramel crisp bar. Some of the company\u2019s newest products contain less sugar and calories than their forebears \u2013 by combining biscuits with chocolate. But one of the company\u2019s other methods of reducing calories and prices on its chocolate products \u2013 reducing the weight of Dairy Milk bars or Roses and Heroes pack sizes, for example \u2013 has brought heavy criticism. Barnard said it was an \u201curban myth\u201d that Cadbury reduced the size of its Creme Egg \u2013 a cause for mass public outcry earlier this year after it emerged that the sweet\u2019s outer casing was no longer made from Dairy Milk chocolate, but the \u201cstandard cocoa mix\u201d used to coat Double Decker and Crunchie bars. She has no regrets on the change of chocolate for Creme Egg. \u201cIn hindsight, we could have made sure we were more transparent. We tested it with consumers \u2013 going back to the chocolate we\u2019ve used most frequently over its history \u2013 and they told us it tasted better.\u201d Despite health concerns, Mondelez\u2019s chocolate sales continue to rise \u2013 by \u201clow single digits\u201d in the UK, even though Cadbury is market leader. Mondelez is clearly betting that the market will not be dramatically changed by government measures. Last year, the company ploughed \u00a375m into Bournville as it updated production lines for the first time in 30 years. That took Mondelez\u2019s investment in UK manufacturing and research facilities to \u00a3235m over the past five years. The company hopes its new facilities and retrained staff will help it take products that Brits enjoy \u2013 such as large Easter eggs \u2013 into new markets like Germany. Barnard said the company was trying to adapt to changing lifestyles. \u201cWe call it scrimp and splurge. If you are going to treat yourself, you want the best. The thing you really love may be small in terms of calories, but you want it to taste fabulous. We\u2019ll never lose that.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The City is cheering on Mario Draghi, but his QE weapon lacks firepower", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a strong argument for Mario Draghi to sit on his hands and do nothing. The boss of the European Central Bank (ECB) may have failed earlier this year to slay the dragon of deflation when he launched \u20ac60bn (\u00a343bn) a month of quantitative easing, but his policy worked to some degree and in any case, his weapons are ineffectual for now . The City loves cheap credit and is cheering on Draghi to cut interest rates or boost the QE programme, based on the time-honoured theory that central bankers with loose monetary policies can prevent their economies slipping into negative inflation. Such a move would increase the supply of money inside the single currency bloc and supposedly add to the pressure on prices. Inflation would stabilise. Deflation killed. When eurozone prices slipped back 0.1% last month, the clamour from investors intensified. And when it seemed as if Draghi was amenable, stock markets jumped. They obliged again on Thursday with the German Dax soaring by more than 250 points, or 2.5%. Except that the ECB has little firepower left. Inflation is low because oil prices have collapsed since last year. If anything, this is a good thing for consumers and businesses that have more disposable income. To a great extent, the direction of oil prices lies in the hands of US frackers.

As for pumping money into the eurozone economy, that task is being taken up by the Spanish and Italian governments. In the past few weeks, Rome and Madrid have submitted budgets to spend more than the EU commission considers prudent. It is this cash that will boost spending over the next year more than an extra \u20ac10bn from the ECB. And yet Draghi just might press the button. He might even push down the already negative deposit rate \u2013 the one that effectively charges banks to park money with the ECB \u2013 if only because he cares about the exchange rate, which is threatening to choke off the eurozone recovery. The euro has recently approached $1.15 compared with its near 12-year low of $1.0457 in March. That\u2019s a big burden for Italian and German exporting manufacturers to carry at a time when China is slowing and world trade contracting. Draghi will always deny the ECB has an exchange-rate target. Yet he did acknowledge the significance of the exchange rate to growth and the risk that, without further action, the euro will carry on rising.",

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has restated her commitment to ensure there is a future for steel manufacturing in Scotland after visiting the two Tata steel plants earmarked for closure, with the loss of 270 jobs. After talks with workers, union representatives and management at the Dalzell and Clydebridge sites in Motherwell and Cambuslang on Thursday, the first minister pledged to do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to help to find a buyer for the threatened plants. Sturgeon said: \u201cThe quality of the work done at these sites is outstanding and it is clear that all of the workers have a great deal of pride in what they do. During my visit, I was struck by the determination of everyone on site to keep these plants open and I was able to reassure them that the Scottish government will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to help them do that.\u201d She added: \u201cWe are delighted that we have been able to agree with the company today that they will support the Scottish government to try and find a buyer.\u201d Sturgeon also confirmed that the cross-party steel taskforce set up earlier in the week would consider wider support for the workforce as she announced that modern apprentices employed on site would have their off-the-job training guaranteed should there be a gap in their employment. Tata Steel has announced a 45-day consultation period on jobs. While union representatives welcomed Sturgeon\u2019s visit, they emphasised that the clock was ticking on the consultation process and that steel workers needed action as well as words. Ross Clark, Dalzell\u2019s multi-union representative, said: \u201cShe was very positive, but she didn\u2019t give us false hope, and she took time to speak to people and reassure them. Obviously the workforce are realistic, and they know it\u2019s a long shot.\u201d Labour MSP James Kelly, another member of the taskforce, urged the first minister to look at whether major infrastructure projects being undertaken by the Scottish government could support the steel industry through the procurement process. \u201cThe first minister has made a lot of promises to the steelworkers. It\u2019s now time to start delivering on those promises. Words of support are fine, but it\u2019s actions that really count.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vauxhall is to recall some of its Zafira models and is investigating more than 100 reports of its cars overheating, with some catching fire without warning while on the road. The British car company said it was taking the spontaneous combustion incidents, involving its Zafira B seven-seater model made between 2005 and 2014, \u201cvery seriously\u201d. The company has offered customers a free checkup with a Vauxhall dealer and confirmed it would take further action. More than 130 owners have reported overheating problems behind the glove-box area, including three mothers whose children were in the cars when the vehicles caught alight. Vauxhall said in a statement that it had carried out an investigation. It said: \u201cWhile the number of incidents is very low in proportion to the number of vehicles on the road, we take this issue very seriously and will take further action. \u201cThe safety of our customers is the No 1 priority. Our investigations have found that a number of incidents have occurred due to previous repairs being performed improperly or using certain non-genuine parts.\u201d The firm has asked Zafira B owners who have concerns to contact a Vauxhall dealer and arrange for their vehicle to be inspected at no cost. Jacqueline Young, head of group litigation at the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that \u2026 vehicles have burst into flames, putting their owners\u2019 lives at risk, and it\u2019s amazing there have been no fatalities. Vauxhall has serious questions to answer, as it is unclear whether this is a small part of a much greater problem.\u201d Young added that, depending on Vauxhall\u2019s response, all affected car owners could potentially launch legal action against the company to have their car checked and fixed. She said in her statement that those who had been victims of a burnoutmight \u201cbe able to claim for the losses arising from this\u201d. The General Motors-owned carmaker built 280,000 of the Zafira B models between 2005 and 2014. It said a previous A range and the new Zafira Tourer lineup were unaffected. A Vauxhall spokesman said around 225,000 of these had been sold in the UK. \u201cWhen we get to the root cause, then we will take the necessary action, which could mean a recall,\u201d said a spokesman, adding that the firm did not know how many models were still in use. Denis Chick, Vauxhall\u2019s director of communications, told the Guardian that some of the cars, around a decade old, may have clocked more than 100,000 miles. \u201cComponents wear out in 100,000 miles, clearly, and the car may be on their second, third or even fourth owners \u2013 so they\u2019ve certainly dropped out of warranty and the Vauxhall service network,\u201d he said. Vauxhall had never seen anything of this kind before, Chick said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to get a fire in a vehicle as a result of a manufacturing fault; people have problems with cars all the time, but not them catching fire, so it\u2019s quite a rare occurrence.\u201d In some cases, there was no advanced warning of the fires, said Chick. \u201cSmoke comes through the dashboard vents and within a few minutes the car\u2019s on fire. People, fortunately, have got time to pull over, stop and get out of the vehicle.\u201d He confirmed that the company was investigating the resistor that controls the speed, the fan motor and the pollen filter at the top of the heater system. \u201cWe have some evidence that resistors in some of the cars that have burned are not original Vauxhall parts,\u201d but copycats, the spokesman said. The company was made aware of the problem in August, when it learned of 25 cases of cars spontaneously combusting. Vauxhall said it was not aware of any human injuries so far. However, more cases emerged when worried Zafira drivers set up a Vauxhall Zafira car fires Facebook page where people can share information about fire incidents. The Facebook campaign to highlight drivers\u2019 concerns was led by mothers Sue Freemantle, 37, and Claire Wheatley, 36, and 26-year-old Jade Hellewell. The three women joined forces to call for action after their 2007 models were destroyed when they went up in flames while children were inside. In a post below a photo of the damaged interior of a car, showing molten upholstery and a tattered child-seat, Facebook user Neil Harvey said: \u201cI\u2019m so relieved my wife and little boy Logan are safe and well after the car burst into flames this morning as she was driving home.\u201d He added: \u201cShe was so shocked and upset by the whole thing.\u201d Another Zafira driver, Damien Walmsley, wrote: \u201cTook the heater resistor on the right out of a Zafira today. The blower was seized,\u201d alongside a photo of the burned-out object. Donna Fox posted an image of the interior of her vehicle, which appeared to have burned like charcoal, and said: \u201cI was told it was a one-off and bad luck when mine went up in flames \u2026 it was a complete shell inside after only a few minutes.\u201d She added: \u201cI did buy another one, but now I have seen it\u2019s happened to so many others I don\u2019t feel safe driving, so just want rid of it. Would never want to go through that again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets have enjoyed a buoyant day, after the European Central Bank stuck with its quantitative easing programme and hinted that it would consider whether further measures were necessary in December. The news pushed the euro lower and helped support European markets. US markets also put in a strong performance in early trading, helped by better than expected results from eBay and McDonalds, and strong housing figures and lower than expected weekly jobless claims, albeit with a 3000 rise to 259,000. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 27.86 points or 0.44% higher Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.48% to 10,491.97 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.28% higher at 4802.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2% to 22,616.9 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.05% at 10,365.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 710.22 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 234 points or 1.37%. On that positive note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Mario Draghi opened the door to a number of possible stimulus measures in December at today\u2019s ECB conference, said economist Chris Hare at Investec: Mr Draghi announced that alongside producing its updated forecasts for the December meeting, the ECB will also review \u2018a whole menu\u2019 of monetary stimulus options. QE remains part of that menu, with Mr Draghi re-iterating a commitment to adjust the \u2018size, composition and duration\u2019 of the programme if needed. But other options are possible. For example, it was revealed that the general council discussed the possibility of a further cut to the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.20%. Indeed, a whole array of options are bound to be discussed in the runup to the December meeting, with Mr Draghi highlighting that the ECB is currently in a state of \u2018work and assess\u2019 rather than \u2018wait and see\u2019. Beyond the hint of additional monetary stimulus options, we gleaned a couple of other dovish titbits from the press conference. First was the revelation that some general council members \u2018hinted\u2019 that they were disposed to adding more stimulus at this month\u2019s meeting. Second, Mr Draghi stated he wants to be \u2018vigilant, as people used to say in the old times\u2019. The word \u2018vigilant\u2019 has some significance in ECB policymaking \u2013 it used to be seen as the expression that ex-ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet employed soon before making policy changes. All told, this was a dovish press conference. Our central case is that the ECB will add more monetary stimulus in the next few months, and December seems increasingly like the most natural date. On the nature of that stimulus though, a QE boost is still perhaps the most likely, the list of possible instruments on the table has lengthened. The euro fell by over 1\u00bd cents against the dollar in response to today\u2019s comments, to as low as $1.116. Or current view is that the euro will fall further, to a trough of $1.06 at the turn of the year, as the ECB looks to stimulate while the Federal Reserve looks to start raising rates. Greece has reportedly sacked its top tax collection official in a row over alleged delays in collecting taxes, a move which could increase concern about the political independence of its tax authorities. It comes at a time when the country is still in the throes of tackling reforms to satisfy its bailout terms. Reuters reports: Katerina Savvaidou, head of the Public Revenues Authority, had denied any wrongdoing. She was charged by a Greek prosecutor with breach of duty for extending by about a year tax collection on revenues on TV advertising. Prosecutors alleged she acted in violation of existing regulations. Savvaidou, who earlier refused to resign, said all of her actions had been vetted by relevant legal authorities of the state. \u201cBy law, when someone is charged with a misdemeanour, the cabinet has the ability to take such a decision (of dismissal),\u201d a government source told Reuters. Judging by today\u2019s ECB conference, leading central banks will continue to head in opposite directions regarding policy: Over in the US, and existing home sales came in at a better than expected 5.55m in September. That compares to 5.3m in August and expectations of 5.38m, according to the National Association of Realtors. Unsold inventory fell back to a 4.8 month supply, down from 5.1 months in August. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist said: As we enter more softer demand months, we may not really feel the squeeze of tight inventory, but come spring of next year...we could be facing a very tight inventory situation. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The strong suspicion has to be that the ECB want the possibility of lower interest rates to push the euro down (it has recently tested $1.15 compared to its March near 12-year low of $1.0457). While Mario Draghi stated that the ECB does not have an exchange rate target for the euro he did acknowledge that it is significant to the growth and inflation outlook and is currently a downside risk. The ECB will undoubtedly be pleased to see that the euro fell markedly as the possibility of ECB interest rate cuts was revealed, and the bank will no doubt be hoping that this possibility continues to weigh down on the euro. More reaction to the Draghi hints at further easing in December at the ECB\u2019s meeting in Malta. Carsten Brzeski of ING Bank said: Back to back with one of Malta\u2019s biggest casinos, the ECB today clearly increased its bets, sending strong hints on new monetary stimulus at the December meeting. While no decision was taken today, the ECB\u2019s sounded more concerned about the growth outlook for the Eurozone and signaled its willingness to act. According to ECB president Draghi, some members of the Governing Council were already willing to act today.... All in all, Draghi has been more explicit than we had expected. The door for more monetary stimulus is wide open and does not necessarily have to be more QE. It could also be a lower deposit rate, maybe even foreign exchange interventions or purchases of other assets (previously excluded). Draghi\u2019s u-turn on the lower bound of interest rates has made him walk in the footsteps of former German chancellor Adenauer who once said \u201cwhy should I care about my chatter from yesterday\u201d. So everything is possible. In our view, the main triggers for more action in December will be the ECB\u2019s staff projections, particularly the headline and core inflation forecasts for 2017. Even though market participants should know from recent experiences with the Fed that crucial and groundbreaking decisions can be postponed more often than markets believe, it will be hard for the ECB not to deliver anything in December. Maybe inspired by the casino next door, the ECB today increased its bets. The ECB has to have strong cards, because it will have to show its hand in December. Eurozone consumer confidence has come in much lower than expected in October - perhaps partly due to the fallout from the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The confidence indicator in the eurozone came in at -7.7 compared to -7.1 in September and lower than the forecast -7.4. In the wider EU of 28 countries it fell by 0.2 points to -5.7 in October. Back to Draghi, and Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First said the European Central Bank dropped enough hints to suggest that some form of monetary policy weaponry would be unleashed at its next meeting on 3 December. But what? Cook said: Firstly, we have to be looking for an extension of the current plan beyond its current deadline of September 2016. Working on the basis that the European Central Bank remains a conservative institution and that the December publication of new economic forecasts does not show a dramatic decline in medium-term inflation expectations then we would look for an extension of 6 months i.e. until March 2017. A slight increase in the amount spent on a monthly basis [currently \u20ac60bn] would not go amiss either. The problem with this plan however is that it has been done before. Any student of central banks and their policy through the Global Financial Crisis knows that asset purchase plans have done little for the wider economy, particularly inflation metrics, except drive stock markets higher and bond yields into the ground. What is needed is an interest rate pressed evermore below zero. But so far the hints of further action have done enough to give the ECB some breathing space: Look at the performance of the euro in the aftermath of the press conference. Draghi and the Executive Council couldn\u2019t have been clearer that additional policy easing was coming if they\u2019d had the words \u201cSELL THE EURO\u201d tattooed on their faces. For now scaring the cattle is sensible. They\u2019ve bought time to gain a consensus and deal with internal European issues \u2013 the VW scandal and the migration situation in the east of the continent - and external global matters \u2013 a Federal Reserve that seems happy to procrastinate and a wobbling emerging market picture. We may have the answers to these questions by December. There are issues with this kind of cut especially given the Bank\u2019s insistence that the lower-bound of rates has been reached already. This could be avoided by gaming what kind of deposits this new, lower rate applies to as the Swiss and Danish Central Banks have done recently. For now the euro is lower and the bulls have been scurried away from the taking the single currency higher. We must now wait to see what kind of present Draghi delivers in December. US markets have made a strong start to trading, following positive results from McDonalds and eBay. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 139 points or 0.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 has added around 0.6%. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com said: The ECB are supposedly pleased with the early results from their stimulus plan, but now is not the time for back-slapping. The eurozone remains in a perilous state, especially with inflation falling back below zero. Mario Draghi now needs to concentrate on diverting a prolonged period of deflation, and the outlook for growth is far from positive. The slowdown in China and other emerging markets is a big threat to the long-term health of the eurozone. Consumer confidence needs to pick up quickly across Europe but, against a backdrop of poor global growth and an influx of refugees, that is going to be easier said than done. Alex Lydall, senior trader at Foenix Partners, has sent us his thoughts. Mario Draghi sent shockwaves through the chambers of the ECB and the euro-area this afternoon with a considerably dovish ECB statement. He noted that emerging markets were still a significant concern to the bloc state and that QE will run to September 2016, or beyond. Draghi\u2019s tone indicated that the ECB were certainly ready to expand the stimulus package, mentioning that the notion would be re-addressed in the December meeting. The ECB\u2019s concerns over inflation is clearly the driving force and such negative language from the ECB President would imply that it is just a matter of time before further easing was undertaken. With downside risks to growth and inflation prospects outlined once again, a cut in the deposit rate is now on the agenda and it seems the divergence between economic progress in the UK and the US as well as in the euro-area is growing wider as the year progresses.\u201d Final question in the ECB press conference. It\u2019s about Malta. Draghi has been asked about the impact of the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal on the eurozone economy. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very early to say.\u201d Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, said: It is looking increasingly likely the ECB is being taken down the road followed by other bond-buying central banks - which is if QE has not proved effective, the answer is to do more. Draghi\u2019s comments today indicate to us that the ECB has noted the stubbornly slow return of inflation to target and raises the possibility of further unconventional easing before the end of the year, pushing the euro lower today.\u201d Draghi: Today\u2019s discussion was \u201cwide open\u201d - when asked about possibility of rate cuts. A few members of the governing council hinted at acting today. Draghi has been asked about the impact of the Chinese economic slowdown, should it prove to be sharper than expected. He said the eurozone\u2019s exposure to China via the trade channel is \u201cnot very significant\u201d with 6% of eurozone exports going to China, although in some cases the figure is higher: 10%, for example for Germany. There is an indirect impact on oil and commodity prices, but he added that oil prices are low mainly due to supply rather than demand issues. Financial channel: the eurozone has no significant exposure In terms of the confidence channel: We think so far what has happened to growth in China hasn\u2019t affected the rest of the world - but if there is a big negative surprise there could be an impact. Earlier, the ECB president called on eurozone governments to support monetary policy. Monetary policy should not be the only game in town. All countries should strive for growth-friendly fiscal policies.\u201d Draghi: When we are at zero rates, the real rates are being driven by inflation expectations. When expectations of inflation become more negative, we have higher and higher real rates. But he stressed that nothing was decided on rate cuts and that there was an \u201copen discussion\u201d of this and other measures. You can read the full text of Draghi\u2019s opening remarks here. This is the key bit: While euro area domestic demand remains resilient, concerns over growth prospects in emerging markets and possible repercussions for the economy from developments in financial and commodity markets continue to signal downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. Most notably, the strength and persistence of the factors that are currently slowing the return of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term require thorough analysis. In this context, the degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December monetary policy meeting, when the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections will be available.\u201d The euro has fallen below $1.12 for the first time since early October, after Draghi revealed that the ECB\u2019s governing council discussed rate cuts. As a reminder, you can watch the ECB press conference here. Further lowering of the deposit rate was discussed this month, the ECB president said in response to a question from Claire Jones of the Financial Times. Draghi said: There was a very rich discussion about all monetary instruments that might be used... and the conclusion was: we are ready to act if needed. He said it was not a case of \u201cwait and see but a work and assess\u201d. Draghi has finished his opening remarks and is now taking questions. Draghi said: The asset purchase plans are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favourable impact.\u201d But he added that falling commodity prices and concerns about emerging markets meant that inflation pressures remained negative. As a result, he said the ECB would re-examine its bond-buying programme in December. The euro has lost ground following that comment, falling 1% against sterling to hit a one-month low of 72.70p. Draghi: The degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December monetary policy meeting Mario Draghi has kicked off his monthly press conference \u2013 on time. The ECB press conference will start in 10 minutes. You can watch it live here. Economists at JPMorgan said: We think the ECB will signal that it stands ready to act if needed, and that the door is open for further easing but more likely at the December or January meetings.\u201d Here\u2019s the ECB\u2019s brief statement: At today\u2019s meeting, which was held in Malta, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively.\u201d The ECB cut rates to record levels to kickstart the economy over a year ago. The main refinancing rate determines the cost of credit in the economy, while the marginal lending facility is the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks. The deposit facility is the rate on bank overnight deposits, which banks pay to park funds at the central bank. ECB president Mario Draghi will set out the central bank\u2019s thinking at a press conference at 1.30pm UK time, and whether the bank will make any adjustments to its \u20ac60bn a month bond-buying programme. The ECB has kept its key interest rates unchanged at record lows, as expected. However... Markets are steady ahead of the ECB\u2019s policy decision at 12.45 UK time. The FTSE is trading 0.1% lower at 6340.48 after a profit warning from building merchant Travis Perkins dragged down housing stocks. Germany\u2019s Dax has climbed 0.4% and France\u2019s CAC is 0.15% ahead. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at spread-betting firm IG, said: A steady battle of attrition continues in London, with the index still unable to establish a direction after four days of relentless grind. However, at least today we have a real reason for not moving too far \u2013 namely the ECB meeting. The general consensus is that Mario Draghi needs to do something to get things moving in the eurozone, but there is a sense that neither the ECB nor financial markets know exactly what that will be. We can hope for some indication that action is on its way, although the ECB president will be understandably keen to keep the details under wraps for now. Housebuilders are jittery this morning after building merchant Travis Perkins warned on earnings. Weaker demand of late has taken the shine off a steady rise in sales overall, raising concerns that such names as Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and others may be in line for a more sustained correction.\u201d Labour has responded to George Osborne\u2019s comment that he is \u201ccomfortable\u201d with his decision to cut tax credits. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: Once again we\u2019re seeing the true face of the Tory Party. It is shameful that David Cameron talked about his \u2018delight\u2019 at tax credit cuts and now George Osborne has said he is \u2018comfortable\u2019 with his decision to take \u00a31,300 a year away from working families. It\u2019s time for David Cameron and George Osborne to think again and reverse these tax credit cuts.\u201d Expectations that ECB policymakers will announce fresh stimulus measures have gradually faded since governing council member Ewald Nowotny said last week euro area inflation is \u2018clearly missing\u2019 the ECB\u2019s target, noted Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Christian Noyer\u2019s submission that the current QE is \u201cwell calibrated\u201d is probably a better reflection of opinion on the governing council. The ECB embarked on a scheme of sovereign bond purchases (quantitative easing) in March \u2013 more than \u20ac1 trillion in all at a rate of \u20ac60bn a month. Lawler has looked at the ECB\u2019s options: A change to QE can really take three forms; increasing the size of asset purchases, increasing the length of the program or adding new assets to the mix such as corporate bonds. It is ten months until the programme is scheduled to end so increasing the length of the program seems rather premature. Europe\u2019s corporate bond market is not as deep as in the US with most companies traditionally favouring bank lending. Adding corporate bonds to the mix would probably work more as a signal of dovish intent than for any real impact on yields or the euro. If the ECB decided to buy shares or ETFs like the Bank of Japan, that would be a game changer and we\u2019d be off to the races in European equities, but chances are slim. Increasing the size of the programme would probably put the most downward pressure on the euro of all the likely options. However, the ECB runs the risk of crowding out private bondholders with more purchases, and would add to exit risks once the program finishes.\u201d So what are we expecting from the European Central Bank today? As my colleague Graeme Wearden reported: Economists predict that ECB president Mario Draghi will repeat his pledge from September to add more stimulus if needed. However, few expect decisive action this week. \u201cThe ECB\u2019s October meeting is for watching. Draghi\u2019s message will be dovish, but it\u2019s not time to act yet\u201d, said Holger Sandte, chief European analyst at Nordea Bank. The ECB is currently committed to buying \u20ac60bn (\u00a340bn) of government and corporate bonds each month until September 2016, in an \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3810bn) attempt to stimulate growth, inflation and bank lending. Capital Economics\u2019s Jonathan Loynes expects the ECB to boost its QE firepower to \u20ac80bn a month in December, but does not totally rule out an announcement this week. George Osborne has welcomed the intervention of Mark Carney in the debate about Britain\u2019s future in the European Union, saying the Bank of England governor has set out the principles for renegotiation, Heather Stewart writes. Read the full story here. My colleague Heather Stewart, the Observer\u2019s economics editor, reports: George Osborne has defended his planned tax credit cuts to backbench MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee. The chancellor has come under growing pressure to soften the proposals; but he insisted: \u201cthis is fundamentally a judgment call, and I\u2019m comfortable with the judgment call that I have made, and that the House of Commons has supported this week.\u201d He urged the House of Lords not to overturn parliamentary convention by rejecting the tax credit cuts. The chair of the committee, Andrew Tyrie, also repeated his demand for the Treasury to provide more detailed analysis of how the proposed cuts will hit households at different points on the income scale. Earlier this morning, Lord Lawson, one of the leaders of the Conservative campaign to leave the EU, strongly criticised the Bank of England governor for wading into politics. But Osborne said the former chancellor was \u201cprobably a bit disappointed that Mark Carney didn\u2019t agree with him\u201d. Osborne argued, in front of MPs on the Treasury Committee: \u201cWhat Mark Carney\u2019s speech shows today is that there is a strong argument for reform.\u201d Alan Clarke of Scotiabank\u2019s reaction to the strong UK retail sales figures was: Wow! We know that the consumer has the wind in his / her sales: Solid employment growth of 1.25% y/y; Wage inflation over 3% y/y in the private sector; Zero inflation That all adds up to robust real income growth. With house price inflation picking up too, that is even more motivation for people to go shopping. Last but not least, with expectations for the timing of the first rate hike being pushed back to end-2016 / early 2017 then consumer spending is clearly well supported. In terms of the bigger picture, with Q3 GDP (1st estimate) scheduled for next week, I am all the more confident to go for 0.6% q/q rather than be cautious with 0.5.%. I\u2019m also starting to think about black eye Friday. Sure, it\u2019s a good scheme to get people into the shops, but with sales volumes like this, do I really need to cut my prices? Not convinced. Anyway - a great reading, and restores my faith that sooner rather than later is the right call on the first Bank Rate hike.\u201d The chancellor has been asked why the UK government has not clearly set out what it wants to achieve in its negotiations with the EU. Osborne said it\u2019s not sensible to turn up with a final list of demands on day one. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way to start a negotiation.\u201d Osborne told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the government is not looking for \u201cspecial deals or carve-outs for the City of London\u201d as it tries to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s EU membership, but wants a fair deal for all non-eurozone countries. He said the other EU members have accepted the principle of a renegotiation and that discussions are now moving into a technical phase. We are looking for a fair deal for non-euro members, including the United Kingdom. We don\u2019t want to be part of ever-closer union. We are getting into specific discussions, technical discussions with the EU Commission and the Council. He promised that this autumn more details will emerge as the EU talks move into a new phase. An important part of the renegotiation is the relationship between non-euro and euro members of the EU, Osborne said. You can watch the Treasury Committee hearing live here. George Osborne is being quizzed by the Treasury Committee. MPs are asking about Mark Carney\u2019s remarks on Britain\u2019s EU membership. The chancellor said: I agree with the speech the governor made. The analysis he outlined was that EU membership has helped create a more open and dynamic economy, but, and there\u2019s a crucial but, developments in the eurozone mean we do need safeguards for the UK.\u201d That\u2019s why the UK has embarked on negotiations to secure reforms of the European Union, he added. As the governor pointed out it\u2019s [EU membership] not an unalloyed good. It\u2019s presented challenges. The single market in financial services is on balance a good thing for the UK. The government\u2019s position is not that we are against immigration. We are for controlled migration. JPMorgan economist Allan Monks has taken a closer look at Mark Carney\u2019s Brexit speech, which said \u201censured there was more than just one liberal Canadian taking the headlines this week\u201d. The speech will be seen as another foray by Carney into a heated political debate, and its tone comes across as friendly to the campaign for keeping the UK within the European Union - ahead of a referendum which is to be held before the end of 2017. Accompanying the speech was a chunky 100 page BoE report discussing the impact of EU membership on the central bank\u2019s policy objectives. Despite Carney earlier this week having described the report as \u201ca bit of a yawner\u201d it will not prevent some from asking whether the BoE should be taking a more neutral stance on such a highly charged political issue (especially after similar interventions by Carney on Scottish independence and climate change). Carney emphasised the report is not a thorough quantitative review of the pros and cons of EU membership, but rather is designed to assess the impact of membership on the Bank\u2019s policy objectives. In doing so, however, Carney highlights the beneficial impact EU membership has likely had in lifting sustainable growth in the UK (through fostering greater competition, efficiency and openness in key markets). The flip side of this openness to Europe is the higher sensitivity to external shocks, although Carney believes policy makers in the UK have adequate capacity to deal with these challenges. A key concern for Carney looking forward is that UK policymakers retain adequate flexibility and control over policy, even as euro area countries go through a process of greater integration and risk sharing in the wake of the financial crisis. Carney\u2019s comments have clear parallels with the government\u2019s position in the debate. The assertion that EU membership is a net positive for the UK, with caveats that the terms of membership need to reflect UK domestic interests and flexibility, will go down well with the Prime Minister - who seeks to renegotiate the terms of membership ahead of the referendum vote, and remove a requirement for the UK to commit to \u2018ever closer union\u2019.\u201d What difference could the BoE\u2019s intervention make? The opinion polls suggest that the result of the referendum will be very close. Our view has been that opinion will shift as the campaign heats up, with polls indicating a comfortable lead for the campaign to remain within the EU. While a natural status quo bias is central to this view, it also reflects our belief that the \u201cin\u201d campaign will gain the backing of at least a majority in the business community. This week the CBI - which represents a broad cross section of small and large businesses - moved off the fence by coming out in support for the UK staying within the EU. The rhetoric behind Carney\u2019s remarks put the BoE in the same camp, even if the Governor stops short of offering an explicit endorsement. The impact of these interventions may not be visible in the opinion polls right away, but we would expect them to grow in significance as the referendum draws closer.\u201d The ONS said retail sales will add 0.1 percentage points to overall economic growth in the third quarter, boosted by beer sales during the Rugby World Cup. Tills are ringing on the high street: The breakdown of the retail sales figures showed that household goods retailers saw the biggest increase in sales last month, of 4.7%. Supermarkets and other food stores posted a 2.3% rise. Petrol sales were also strong, up 3.8%. However, clothes and shoe retailers did not have a good month, reporting a 0.9% drop. Excluding petrol, overall retail sales rose by 1.7% in September. The Rugby World Cup boosted retail sales last month, according to statisticians. Kate Davies, ONS head of retail sales statistics, said: Falling in-store prices and promotions around the Rugby World Cup are likely to be the main factors why the quantity bought in the retail sector increased in September at the fastest monthly rate seen since December 2013. The retail sector is continuing to grow with September seeing the 29th consecutive month of year-on-year increases.\u201d Average store prices (including petrol stations) fell by 3.6% in September from a year earlier, the 15th consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. It was the joint-lowest reading since the series began in 1988. Sterling has hit a one-month high of 72.95p against the euro on the strong retail sales figures, up 0.8% on the day. Against the dollar, the pound climbed to $1.5510, up 0.5% on the day. News flash: UK retail sales jumped 1.9% in September from the previous month \u2013 the biggest rise since December 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. A Bank of England paper on EU membership analyses the positive impact of migration, as Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, notes. Click on the link in his tweet to read the paper. It says: Openness to labour flows \u2013 via migration \u2013 can allow an inflow of skills not otherwise available in the domestic economy. Ortega and Peri (2014) find that migration boosts long-run GDP per capita, acting both through increased diversity of skills and a greater degree of patenting. At the firm level, several studies further find that migration has a positive impact on productivity by diversifying the high-skilled labour employed by firms.\u201d In other news, Britain\u2019s competition watchdog said highstreet banks will be forced to encourage their customers to switch to rivals. Switching could potentially save bank customers \u00a370 a year, it said. But consumer groups called on the Competition and Markets Authority to take tougher action to inject competition into banking, after it refrained from more radical measures to break up the biggest players. The market is dominated by the big four banks \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 which together control 77% of the current account market. The prime minister and the chancellor both welcomed the governor\u2019s comments last night. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: Despite Mark Carney\u2019s stressing that his speech and the BOE report is not a comprehensive view of the pros and cons of UK membership of the EU, our strong suspicion is that the pro-EU membership camp will find more to grab hold of and champion than the Out camp. Carney said Britain was possibly \u201cthe leading beneficiary\u201d of the EU\u2019s single market, and that being in the bloc had been one of the drivers of its strong economic performance in the four decades since it first joined. He made some positive remarks on the free movement of labour, observing that it \u201ccan help better match workers with firms, alleviating skill shortages and boosting the supply side of the potential growth rate of the economy.\u201d In addition, he noted that the UK has been the top recipient of foreign direct investment in the UK since the single market was established in 1992. However, Carney\u2019s intervention is also likely to be seen as strengthening David Cameron\u2019s hand in negotiations on reforms with Britain\u2019s EU partners. Carney urged the prime minister to demand \u201cclear principles\u201d to safeguard Britain\u2019s interests outside the euro, as he warned that botched European integration could threaten financial stability. But former chancellor Nigel Lawson slammed the Bank of England governor for wading into the debate on EU membership, saying his remarks were \u201cregrettable\u201d. The Spectator\u2019s Coffee House team agreed. Catherine Bearder MEP, chair of the Liberal Democrat EU referendum campaign, was quick to seize on Carney\u2019s comments: The Bank of England\u2019s intervention confirms what we already know: being in the EU brings huge benefits to the UK economy. Those calling for EU exit have failed to present a credible alternative that would protect the economy and secure jobs. Instead of retreating to the side-lines, Britain should stay and lead reform in Europe from within.\u201d More on Carney\u2019s speech on EU membership at St Peter\u2019s College in Oxford last night. The governor concluded: Overall, EU membership has increased the openness of the UK economy, facilitating dynamism but also creating some monetary and financial stability challenges for the Bank of England to manage. Thus far, we have been able to meet these challenges.\u201d You can read the speech on the Bank of England\u2019s website, and watch the webcast. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Policymakers from the European Central Bank have gathered in Valletta, Malta, for their monthly policy meeting (the governing council occasionally departs from its Frankfurt HQ to meet in other parts of the eurozone). The ECB is widely expected to keep its key interest rates unchanged along with its stimulus programme, despite fears over deflation. But ECB president Mario Draghi may well strike a dovish tone again, and hint at further action towards the end of the year. Falling consumer prices (they slipped by 0.1% in the eurozone in September) and fears over the world economy suggest the central bank will ease policy at some point, unless things improve. At the last press conference on 3 September, Draghi pointed to \u201crenewed downside risks\u201d to eurozone growth and inflation prospects, reflecting concerns about the outlook for emerging markets. He said that the ECB stood ready to adjust the size, composition or length of the QE programme if necessary. Investec economist Chris Hare said: Despite the QE teasers offered last month, our view is that Mr Draghi will not pull the trigger for now. In part, that is because developments since the then have seen a mixed bag, rather than an obvious worsening in conditions. We still think that additional QE will be appropriate at some point, given global growth risks and the weakness of eurozone inflation (we are fairly agnostic on whether it will come in terms of size, composition or duration). More natural trigger dates would be the December, or perhaps next March\u2019s, policy meeting. That would allow the ECB to announce the expansion alongside updated forecasts. December is also the month where we think the Federal Reserve will start raising rates: that, alongside a QE boost announcement, might give the euro a double kick down, offering a double whammy of stimulus to get inflation back on track.\u201d European stock markets are set to open lower ahead of the ECB\u2019s decision, which will be announced at 12.45pm UK time, followed by Draghi\u2019s press conference at 1.30pm. Over here, Bank of England governor Mark Carney gave his \u201cBrexit\u201d speech in Oxford last night. He said that EU membership opened up the UK economy and made it more dynamic, although he added that it also left it more exposed to financial shocks like the eurozone debt crisis.",

QE remains part of that menu, with Mr Draghi re-iterating a commitment to adjust the \u2018size, composition and duration\u2019 of the programme if needed. But other options are possible. For example, it was revealed that the general council discussed the possibility of a further cut to the deposit rate, which currently stands at -0.20%. Indeed, a whole array of options are bound to be discussed in the runup to the December meeting, with Mr Draghi highlighting that the ECB is currently in a state of \u2018work and assess\u2019 rather than \u2018wait and see\u2019. </li> <li><br></li> <li>Beyond the hint of additional monetary stimulus options, we gleaned a couple of other dovish titbits from the press conference. First was the revelation that some general council members \u2018hinted\u2019 that they were disposed to adding more stimulus at this month\u2019s meeting.</li> <li><br></li> <li>Second, Mr Draghi stated he wants to be \u2018vigilant, as people used to say in the old times\u2019. The word \u2018vigilant\u2019 has some significance in ECB policymaking \u2013 it used to be seen as the expression that ex-ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet employed soon before making policy changes.</li> <li><br></li> <li>All told, this was a dovish press conference. Our central case is that the ECB will add more monetary stimulus in the next few months, and December seems increasingly like the most natural date. On the nature of that stimulus though, a QE boost is still perhaps the most likely, the list of possible instruments on the table has lengthened. The euro fell by over 1\u00bd cents against the dollar in response to today\u2019s comments, to as low as $1.116. Or current view is that the euro will fall further, to a trough of $1.06 at the turn of the year, as the ECB looks to stimulate while the Federal Reserve looks to start raising rates.</li> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5628fbc0e4b09056b663c89a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-22T15:11:43.858Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greece has reportedly sacked its top tax collection official in a row over alleged delays in collecting taxes, a move which could increase concern about the political independence of its tax authorities.</strong> It comes at a time when the country is still in the throes of tackling reforms to satisfy its bailout terms.

Carsten Brzeski of ING Bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Back to back with one of Malta\u2019s biggest casinos, the ECB today clearly increased its bets, sending strong hints on new monetary stimulus at the December meeting. While no decision was taken today, the ECB\u2019s sounded more concerned about the growth outlook for the Eurozone and signaled its willingness to act. According to ECB president Draghi, some members of the Governing Council were already willing to act today....</p> <p>All in all, Draghi has been more explicit than we had expected. The door for more monetary stimulus is wide open and does not necessarily have to be more QE. It could also be a lower deposit rate, maybe even foreign exchange interventions or purchases of other assets (previously excluded). Draghi\u2019s u-turn on the lower bound of interest rates has made him walk in the footsteps of former German chancellor Adenauer who once said \u201cwhy should I care about my chatter from yesterday\u201d. So everything is possible. In our view, the main triggers for more action in December will be the ECB\u2019s staff projections, particularly the headline and core inflation forecasts for 2017.</p> <p>Even though market participants should know from recent experiences with the Fed that crucial and groundbreaking decisions can be postponed more often than markets believe, it will be hard for the ECB not to deliver anything in December. Maybe inspired by the casino next door, the ECB today increased its bets. The ECB has to have strong cards, because it will have to show its hand in December.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5628eb7ae4b0666540ca61b2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-22T14:03:32.402Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence weaker than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eurozone consumer confidence has come in much lower than expected in October - perhaps partly due to the fallout from the Volkswagen emissions scandal.</p> <p>The confidence indicator in the eurozone came in at -7.7 compared to -7.1 in September and lower than the forecast -7.4.</p> <p>In the wider EU of 28 countries it fell by 0.2 points to -5.7 in October.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5628e9d5e4b03e3b346f5c9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-22T13:56:46.810Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to Draghi, and Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First said the European Central Bank dropped enough hints to suggest that some form of monetary policy weaponry would be unleashed at its next meeting on 3 December.

Any student of central banks and their policy through the Global Financial Crisis knows that asset purchase plans have done little for the wider economy, particularly inflation metrics, except drive stock markets higher and bond yields into the ground.</p> <p>What is needed is an interest rate pressed evermore below zero.</p> </blockquote> <p>But so far the hints of further action have done enough to give the ECB some breathing space:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look at the performance of the euro in the aftermath of the press conference. Draghi and the Executive Council couldn\u2019t have been clearer that additional policy easing was coming if they\u2019d had the words \u201cSELL THE EURO\u201d tattooed on their faces. For now scaring the cattle is sensible.</p> <p>They\u2019ve bought time to gain a consensus and deal with internal European issues \u2013 the VW scandal and the migration situation in the east of the continent - and external global matters \u2013 a Federal Reserve that seems happy to procrastinate and a wobbling emerging market picture. We may have the answers to these questions by December.</p> <p>There are issues with this kind of cut especially given the Bank\u2019s insistence that the lower-bound of rates has been reached already. This could be avoided by gaming what kind of deposits this new, lower rate applies to as the Swiss and Danish Central Banks have done recently.</p> <p>For now the euro is lower and the bulls have been scurried away from the taking the single currency higher. We must now wait to see what kind of present Draghi delivers in December.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5628e891e4b0666540ca617a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-22T13:47:30.759Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have made a strong start to trading, following positive results from McDonalds and eBay.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 139 points or 0.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 has added around 0.6%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5628e64ae4b0666540ca6151\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-22T13:37:58.642Z\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ECB are supposedly pleased with the early results from their stimulus plan, but now is not the time for back-slapping.

Despite Carney earlier this week having described the report as \u201ca bit of a yawner\u201d it will not prevent some from asking whether the BoE should be taking a more neutral stance on such a highly charged political issue (especially after similar interventions by Carney on Scottish independence and climate change).</p> </blockquote> <p>Carney emphasised the report is not a thorough quantitative review of the pros and cons of EU membership, but rather is designed to assess the impact of membership on the Bank\u2019s policy objectives. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In doing so, however, Carney highlights the beneficial impact EU membership has likely had in lifting sustainable growth in the UK (through fostering greater competition, efficiency and openness in key markets). The flip side of this openness to Europe is the higher sensitivity to external shocks, although Carney believes policy makers in the UK have adequate capacity to deal with these challenges.</p> <p>A key concern for Carney looking forward is that UK policymakers retain adequate flexibility and control over policy, even as euro area countries go through a process of greater integration and risk sharing in the wake of the financial crisis. Carney\u2019s comments have clear parallels with the government\u2019s position in the debate. </p> <p>The assertion that EU membership is a net positive for the UK, with caveats that the terms of membership need to reflect UK domestic interests and flexibility, will go down well with the Prime Minister - who seeks to renegotiate the terms of membership ahead of the referendum vote, and remove a requirement for the UK to commit to \u2018ever closer union\u2019.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>What difference could the BoE\u2019s intervention make? The opinion polls suggest that the result of the referendum will be very close. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"https://markets.jpmorgan.com/research/email/-4pr8qc7/GtizvNHKt1SfrfGo3ckykA/GPS-1734206-0\">Our view</a> has been that opinion will shift as the campaign heats up, with polls indicating a comfortable lead for the campaign to remain within the EU. While a natural status quo bias is central to this view, it also reflects our belief that the \u201cin\u201d campaign will gain the backing of at least a majority in the business community. </p> <p>This week the CBI - which represents a broad cross section of small and large businesses - moved off the fence by coming out in support for the UK staying within the EU. The rhetoric behind Carney\u2019s remarks put the BoE in the same camp, even if the Governor stops short of offering an explicit endorsement.

The ECB is widely expected to keep its key interest rates unchanged along with its stimulus programme, despite fears over deflation.</p> <p>But ECB president Mario Draghi may well strike a dovish tone again, and hint at further action towards the end of the year. Falling consumer prices (they slipped by 0.1% in the eurozone in September) and fears over the world economy suggest the central bank will ease policy at some point, unless things improve. </p> <p>At the last press conference on 3 September, Draghi pointed to \u201crenewed downside risks\u201d to eurozone growth and inflation prospects, reflecting concerns about the outlook for emerging markets. He said that the ECB stood ready to adjust the size, composition or length of the QE programme if necessary.<br></p> <p>Investec economist Chris Hare said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the QE teasers offered last month, our view is that Mr Draghi will not pull the trigger for now. In part, that is because developments since the then have seen a mixed bag, rather than an obvious worsening in conditions.</p> <p>We still think that additional QE will be appropriate at some point, given global growth risks and the weakness of eurozone inflation (we are fairly agnostic on whether it will come in terms of size, composition or duration). More natural trigger dates would be the December, or perhaps next March\u2019s, policy meeting. That would allow the ECB to announce the expansion alongside updated forecasts. December is also the month where we think the Federal Reserve will start raising rates: that, alongside a QE boost announcement, might give the euro a double kick down, offering a double whammy of stimulus to get inflation back on track.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>European stock markets are set to open lower ahead of the ECB\u2019s decision, which will be announced at 12.45pm UK time, followed by Draghi\u2019s press conference at 1.30pm.</p> <p>Over here, Bank of England governor Mark Carney gave his \u201cBrexit\u201d speech in Oxford last night. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/21/eu-economy-more-dynamic-bank-of-england-chief-mark-carney-referendum\">He said that EU membership opened up the UK economy</a> and made it more dynamic, although he added that it also left it more exposed to financial shocks like the eurozone debt crisis.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-22T08:35:37.140Z\">at 9.35am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has stunned markets by signalling that he is prepared to cut interest rates and step up quantitative easing to stave off the risk of a renewed economic slump in the eurozone. The value of the single currency dropped sharply on foreign exchanges on Thursday as Draghi announced that the ECB\u2019s governing council had discussed expanding its \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3795bn) bond-buying programme and cutting the rate on reserves held at the central bank. This \u201cdiscount rate\u201d is already negative, at -0.2%, meaning banks effectively have to pay the ECB for holding their reserves \u2013 a measure aimed at keeping money flowing around the economy. Speaking after the ECB\u2019s latest policy meeting in Malta, Draghi revealed that some members of the governing council had favoured taking more action to stimulate the economy immediately. He blamed the slowdown in emerging markets, including China, for renewed weakness in the eurozone. \u201cWhile euro area domestic demand remains resilient, concerns over growth prospects in emerging markets and possible repercussions for the economy from developments in financial and commodity markets continue to signal downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation,\u201d he said in his opening statement. Draghi said the ECB could also step up the scale of QE. A decision is likely to be made at the December meeting of its governing council, when its latest economic forecasts will be available. As Draghi spoke, the euro dropped by 1.5 cents against the dollar, to $1.117. \u201cThe governing council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate, if warranted, in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation,\u201d Draghi said. He added that he and his ECB colleagues would not be in \u201cwait and see\u201d mode, but rather \u201cwait and assess\u201d mode, between now and their policy meeting on 3 December. \u201cThe ECB will almost certainly be delivering an early Christmas present this year,\u201d said Nick Kounis, the head of markets and macro research at investment bank ABN Amro. Draghi is an enthusiastic proponent of \u201cforward guidance\u201d, the strategy of sending strong verbal policy signals in order to shift financial markets \u2013 in this case, driving down the euro. His dramatic pledge in the summer of 2012 \u2013 in the middle of the Greek debt crisis \u2013 that the ECB would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the single currency helped to reassure panic-stricken investors. Jeremy Cook, the chief economist of international payments company World First, said ECB policymakers were likely to have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the strengthening of the currency, which makes eurozone goods less competitive on international markets. \u201cDraghi and the executive council couldn\u2019t have been clearer that additional policy easing was coming if they\u2019d had the words \u2018sell the euro\u2019 tattooed on their faces,\u201d he said. Euro area GDP rose 0.4% in the second quarter of 2015, a slight slowdown from 0.5% growth in the previous quarter. However, a stream of downbeat data from Germany, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, including the sharpest decline in exports in six years, has stoked fears about a downturn. There are also concerns that the repercussions of the emissions-fixing scandal at German carmaker Volkswagen, one of the pillars of its industrial sector, could undermine the strength of the economy. Asked about the potential impact of events at VW, Draghi said: \u201cIt\u2019s very, very early to say.\u201d Draghi\u2019s comments about the possibility of reducing the discount rate further below zero will also rekindle debate about whether borrowing costs could eventually be pushed lower in the UK, where the base rate has been at 0.5% since March 2009. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has argued that a rate cut might eventually be necessary, but other Bank insiders believe there is little to be gained when rates are already so close to zero. Jennifer McKeown of consultancy Capital Economics predicted that the ECB would step up the pace of bond purchases in December, perhaps to \u20ac80bn a month from \u20ac60bn currently, and could also extend the QE programme beyond its planned end date of September 2016. She argued that this could significantly weaken the value of the euro as the US Federal Reserve prepares to tighten monetary policy. \u201cWith US interest rates still set to increase next year, the prospect of a substantial divergence of monetary policy between the eurozone and the US implies downside risks for the euro versus the US dollar.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Foxtons and Travis Perkins have been hit after the companies raised fears over the strength of the housing market. Foxtons, the south-east-focused estate agent, warned that the market was taking time to recover, especially in central London, where property transaction levels remain at historically low levels owing to strong recent price growth and stamp-duty changes. Nick Budden, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe expect any recovery of the property sales market to be slow due to low current levels of stock.\u201d Although he said Foxtons remained broadly on track to meet full-year expectations, the shares still closed down more than 8%, at 203p. Changes to stamp duty, introduced by the chancellor, George Osborne, mean that although the majority of homebuyers will pay less in stamp duty, buyers of homes costing more than \u00a3937,500 now pay more, hitting the prime London market. But Foxtons added that sales commissions were up 12.8% to \u00a318.5m, reflecting gains in market share and new branch openings. The chain said in the year to date it opened seven branches, focusing on high-growth areas in outer London. It said it remained on track to open between five and 10 branches each year, and had a pipeline of new sites secured for the next 18 months. Budden said: \u201cWe are in a strong position to capitalise on market growth currently being seen in outer London areas through the organic expansion of our branch network.\u201d Travis Perkins, the FTSE 100 building supplies firm that owns the Wickes DIY chain, closed down 6% at \u00a318.45 after it warned that underlying earnings growth for the year would come in at the lower end of expectations. The chief executive, John Carter, said: \u201cWhile we planned for a modest reduction in renovate modernise and improvement markets through the summer, given the slowdown in secondary housing transactions towards the end of 2014 and early part of 2015, we saw weaker market demand than anticipated.\u201d A profits warning from the insulation specialist, SIG, added to the uncertainty over the outlook for the housing market. The company said problems in the UK and France meant profits would be between \u00a385m and \u00a390m rather than the \u00a3100m analysts had expected. It said market conditions were deteriorating in the second half, particularly in France. SIG has also been affected by a lower than anticipated level of demand in the UK renovations market. The company\u2019s share price ended the day at 141.5p, down more than 20%. House prices have been rising at about 5% in the UK, with some areas recording increases of twice that. However, Thursday\u2019s warnings added to fears that the rate of increase was unsustainable. Last week, the independent research firm Capital Economics warned: \u201cMost of the evidence suggests that prices have become worryingly dependent on record low levels of interest rates. So a period in which prices grow in line with, or preferably by less than, incomes now looks overdue. We expect house prices to rise by 5% this year, but by just 2% in both 2016 and 2017.\u201d",

The latest retail sales figures indicate that Britain is heading for a glittering Christmas, with toys high on the list of purchases. According to official data, the quantity of goods bought during September increased by 1.9%. That is a bumper rise in just one month and sets the UK on course for a bigger than expected Christmas season, kicking off with Black Friday on 27 November. Admittedly, as the consultancy Capital Economics pointed out, a punchy 2.3% rise in food sales was probably bolstered by one-off factors, such as the Rugby World Cup and the timing of the August bank holiday. The latter fell on 31 August this year and was therefore included in September\u2019s figures. Some other surveys also point to the possibility of yuletide consumer restraint. Earlier this week, the financial data provider Markit published its household finance index for September, showing a weakening in sentiment since August. The health check on the British consumer appeared to show households becoming wary of the government\u2019s tax credit cuts next year, which will put a brake on their spending power. The high street chain Argos also issued a profits warning, saying it was nervous about recouping all the money it had spent in preparation for Black Friday. The recurring theme throughout the current run of 29 consecutive months of year-on-year retail sales rises is that those sales have been dependent on consistent and heavy discounting, something Black Friday will only exacerbate. As the latest figures show, shop prices fell by 3.6% in September compared with 12 months ago, the joint-weakest inflation level on record. Even excluding petrol, the figure was -2.3%. So more shopping and bigger sales volumes do not necessarily help a retailer\u2019s bottom line. Argos now finds itself in a situation where it needs to invest more heavily just to stand still. Consumers, on the other hand, will continue to enjoy cheaper products. They might be holding off on purchasing big-ticket items, such as a new kitchen, but the Markit survey showed the bulk of households were enjoying bigger disposable incomes thanks to pay increases and inflation staying close to zero. They were happy to eat out, buy clothes and trade up to the latest smartphone. Capital Economics concluded: \u201cWhile consumer confidence slowed in September, it remains at an elevated level by past standards. Accordingly, with strong fundamentals still in place, we are optimistic that the consumer recovery will maintain a strong pace over the rest of the year.\u201d Over at Hamleys \u2013 which was sold for just \u00a360m only three years ago to its French owners \u2013 staff will be stacking Star Wars Lego kits from floor to ceiling.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Sharp, the chief executive of Debenhams, is to quit the department store group after pressure from institutional investors. Sharp, who first joined in 1997 and became chief executive in 2011, has been under fire following a string of poor results and profits warnings in recent years. Cenkos, the City broker, has been agitating recently for change at the group. Sharp has not formally resigned and will continue in his post through the crucial Christmas period. He said he wanted to leave in 2016 and will stay on until a successor has been appointed. News of his departure came as the group announced its first rise in annual pre-tax profits for four years. Profits were up 7% to \u00a3113.8m, following a 21% dive last year to \u00a3110.3m. Sharp said: \u201cI hope being transparent about my intentions will stop recent speculation becoming a distraction, allowing me and the Debenhams team to focus on delivering our strategy and on the important Christmas trading period.\u201d Sharp said he had always intended to serve a five-year term at the retailer. \u201cI\u2019m two months into my fifth year and this has always been my plan. We have a strong management team and our strategy is clearly working,\u201d he said. He added that his departure would not mark a change in strategy and that he was tempted to stay but had always made clear to the board that he only planned to do five years. \u201cThese jobs are very demanding and that needs to be taken into account when you embark on a role like this,\u201d Sharp said. He denied that shareholders had pressed him to quit. \u201cThis is all about me sticking to my original plan,\u201d he said. The outgoing chief executive said the succession plan would involve a full and transparent selection process for a replacement to run the group and that he would stay on to settle his successor into the role. Both internal and external candidates will be considered. Sharp said the group had delivered a good set of results that meant it was well positioned ahead of the run-up to Christmas. The company has cut out 42 promotional days over the past 18 months, as it tries to wean its customers off heavy discounts. It has invested in new own-brands and put in new cafe areas. Eight Sports Direct departments have also been installed as part of plans to redesign 1m sq ft of poorly performing space in Debenhams stores. Sharp said Debenhams hoped Black Friday would be a bigger sales day this year as it was a payday and fell within the retailer\u2019s annual Big Gift Event four-day promotion. \u201cLast year, we saw uplift across all categories, with beauty and gifting particularly strong. It kickstarted the Christmas gifting campaign and we expect to see a similar shape this year,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Hamleys, the 255-year-old toy retailer, is poised to be sold to a Chinese footwear company for an estimated \u00a3100m. C.banner International Holdings has confirmed that discussions to buy Hamleys from its French owner are at an \u201cadvanced stage\u201d. The company released a statement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon saying it was: \u201cin the process of negotiating and finalising the definitive documentation with a view to entering into a legally binding agreement in the near future.\u201d But it added that no definitive agreement had been entered into. The expected sale comes during the state visit to Britain by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that sealed \u00a340bn worth of trade deals, including an \u00a318bn investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear plant, controlled by EDF of France. Hamleys is best known for its seven-storey flagship store on Regent Street in London, where Father Christmas will soon greet youngsters. The expected move to Chinese ownership is the latest episode in the store\u2019s turbulent recent ownership history, which has seen it pass into Icelandic and then French hands. The store has become part of the London tourist trail and is seen as quintessentially British, despite its foreign ownership \u2013 a trait it shares with several other local landmarks. Harrods, one of the capital\u2019s other big historic retail brands, is owned by Qatar Holdings; Hong Kong-based Dickson Concepts owns Harvey Nichols; while Royal tailor Gieves &amp; Hawkes is part of Hong Kong-listed Trinity Ltd. C.banner International, which specialises in women\u2019s footwear under brands including MIO and Sundance, said it was interested in Hamleys\u2019 strong brand as part of a plan to diversify its business. It also wants to develop a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d to distribute toys and children\u2019s products via British department store House of Fraser \u2013 which was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower last year. Yuan Yafei, the billionaire chairman of Sanpower, is thought to have family links to C.banner International, which is led by chairman Chen Yixi. Yixi said: \u201cA strong brand is an outstanding resource. Acquisition of a world-renowned brand could greatly enhance the company\u2019s competitive advantages.\u201d Hamleys was launched as Noah\u2019s Ark in 1760 by William Hamley, a Cornishman from Bodmin, who stocked tin soldiers, wooden horses and rag dolls.In 1881, a new branch of the shop opened in Regent Street, although at a different location from its current spot. The company was once listed on the London Stock Exchange, but was snapped up by Icelandic retail investor Baugur for \u00a359m in 2003. Since then it has passed through a string of foreign owners. Icelandic bank Landsbanki took control of the store in 2009 after Baugur got into financial difficulties during the global financial crash. Four years later it was sold on to French retailer Groupe Ludendo, which operates hundreds of toy shops across France, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain. Under its series of owners, Hamleys has expanded across the UK \u2013 adding stores in cities including Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. In recent years it has also expanded overseas, including opening Europe\u2019s largest toystore in Moscow in March. It is said to be considering expansion into the US. The revolving door for owners in recent times reflects an uneasy history for the spectacular toy store. In 1931 Hamleys was forced to close. It reopened later that year after being bought out by Walter Lines, co-owner of Tri-ang Toys. Lines was rewarded with a royal warrant from Queen Mary in 1938. The Regent Street store was bombed five times during the second world war and staff are said to have served at the shop entrance wearing tin hats during the blitz. Hamleys was issued with a second royal warrant by Queen Elizabeth II, who bought toys there for her children in 1955.",

Four years later it was sold on to French retailer Groupe Ludendo, which operates hundreds of toy shops across France, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain.</p> <p>Under its series of owners, Hamleys has expanded across the UK \u2013 adding stores in cities including Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. In recent years it has also expanded overseas, including opening Europe\u2019s largest toystore in Moscow in March. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/28/hamleys-toystore-united-states-expansion-stores\">It is said to be considering expansion into the US.</a></p> <p>The revolving door for owners in recent times reflects an uneasy history for the spectacular toy store. In 1931 Hamleys was forced to close. It reopened later that year after being bought out by Walter Lines, co-owner of Tri-ang Toys. Lines was rewarded with a royal warrant from Queen Mary in 1938.</p> <p>The Regent Street store was bombed five times during the second world war and staff are said to have served at the shop entrance wearing tin hats during the blitz.</p> <p>Hamleys was issued with a second royal warrant by Queen Elizabeth II, who bought toys there for her children in 1955.</p>",

Insulation specialist SIG has slumped nearly 22% - down 38.6p to 139.9p - after it cut its full year profit forecasts after market conditions deteriorated in the second half of its financial year. It pointed to poor trading in France in particular, notably in September although October has also proved difficult. It also suffered - as did Travis Perkins - from lower than expected demand in the UK repair, maintenance and improvement market. In all it now expected full year profits to be between \u00a385m and \u00a390m, compared to consensus estimates of around \u00a3100m. It has been cutting costs, especially in its supply chain, and has accelerated this programme in the light of the poor market conditions. It expects at least \u00a320m of savings from this. Analysts at Jefferies said: SIG have today reduced guidance for 2015 pretax profit, setting a range of \u00a385-90m. This represents an 18% downgrade to our current forecast at the low end of guidance and a 13% downgrade at the high end. On the plus side, an additional \u00a320m of savings have been announced as part of the group\u2019s supply chain review. Our 2016 numbers remained unchanged currently, though we will review this following the group\u2019s Capital Markets Day on16 November. Clearly today\u2019s news will impact the share negatively. Despite this, we continue to believe that there is much good work going on at SIG and further potential to improve the underlying operational efficiency of the business. We note that management have over delivered on the cost savings outlined as part of the group\u2019s strategic initiatives and we would not be surprised to see further outperformance as part of the supply chain review. However, we also recognize that there is only so much management can do to offset deteriorating markets.",

So, on hearing that the big four banks have come through yet another inquiry, Lloyd made it clear that the Competition and Markets Authority has failed customers once again. The British Chambers of Commerce, which represents small businesses, is also disappointed. \u201cThe CMA\u2019s preliminary report pulls many of its punches \u2013 even if it acknowledges that some problems exist in the business banking market,\u201d said John Longworth, the BCC director general. In publishing 15 remedies intended to improve competition on the high street, the CMA has not used its toughest powers to demand a break-up of the incumbent players or impose new pricing measures on the market. Instead it wants the big banks to nudge their customers to move to rivals and make clear how much customers could save by doing so. In reality, the CMA was never going to please everyone. If it had concluded that free banking \u2013 for customers who do not use overdrafts \u2013 needed to end, there would equally have been uproar. As the CMA said, requiring banks to charge for current accounts \u201cwould effectively be to set a price floor \u2013 not normally considered to be a means of increasing competition\u201d. The CMA\u2019s own data shows the difficulty new entrants have had in taking market share from the big four: Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. Over the past 10 years, new entrants have sliced just a 5% market share, with the big four controlling three-quarters of current accounts. Consumers now need to hold out for technological advances. The CMA points to the arrival of new digital banks \u2013 such as the branchless bank Atom \u2013 to compete for customers. It also outlines hopes for the Midata project, the means by which customers can get tailored data about their own finances. Should it work, customers should be able to glean easier comparisons about the cost of banking across different providers. It will also cost the industry millions of pounds to create the system for an as-yet-undefined date in the future. Then, perhaps, the industry will discover if customers can overcome their apathy and start to make the savings outlined by the CMA \u2013 \u00a3260 for heavy overdraft users \u2013 by switching their accounts.",

Investors are hoping for a dovish tone from ECB president Mario Draghi, but few believe that an announcement of an extension to quantitive easing will be made. The biggest FTSE 100 faller is Travis Perkins, down 147p or more than 7% at \u00a318.16, as the building materials group and Wickes owner warned that profits would be at the lower end of market expectations. It blamed weaker than expected demand in the repair, maintenance and improvement market during the summer. The company reported 2.6% like for like sales growth in the third quarter, compared to a 5.7% increase in the first half. But it said the fourth quarter had started more encouragingly. Analyst Adrian Kearsey at Panmure Gordon said: As with others in the sector, Travis Perkins is finding the trading environment in the UK tough. It has warned that it experienced weaker summer demand. However, it is putting a brave face on things and claiming that lead indicators point to a recovery during the fourth quarter. Santa may bring an early Christmas present, but we are not holding our breath. We will be reviewing our (previously broadly consensus) forecasts following the conference call. But for now they are clearly under review. However, given the deterioration in trading we are maintaining our sell recommendation and reducing our target price from 1950p to 1650p. Rival Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, has also fallen back after the Travis comments, down 14.7p at 351.7p. Also heading lower is Anglo American, off 19.6p at 585p after a disappointing third quarter production report. The company is postponing major investment decisions in its platinum business and cutting diamond production due to weak demand. Educational publisher Pearson is down another 33.5p at 965p in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s profit warning. A number of companies have gone ex-dividend including Smiths Group, down 35.5p at 975.5p, Wolseley, 105p lower at \u00a336.97, and BAE Systems, 12p off at 441.1p. But GKN is up 6.3p at 284.2p after the company maintained its 2015 forecast despite a softening in demand from China and other markets in the fourth quarter. Overall, amid stronger than expected UK retail sales in September partly due to beer sales during the Rugby World Cup, the FTSE 100 is currently down 18.30 points at 6330.12.",

      "bodyText": "Proposals to make high-street banking work better for customers have come under fire after the competition watchdog concluded that breaking up the big banks would be too costly and would not end the dominance of the big four. Although the Competition and Markets Authority set out ideas to force banks to prompt customers to shop around, it faced questions about whether the measures went far enough. The 10th investigation in the sector in 15 years concluded that there was a competition problem in an industry where Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC have a 70% share of current accounts. Challenger banks such as Metro Bank have taken only a 5% share in 10 years, even though switching accounts could save consumers an average of \u00a370 a year. Those with an overdraft could save an average of \u00a3140, and those with larger overdrafts would save \u00a3260, the watchdog said. It concluded that carving out new banks \u2013 TSB from Lloyds and Williams &amp; Glyn from RBS - had not injected competition into the high street, despite costing billions of pounds. W&amp;G is due to appear on high streets next year, while TSB has been bought by Sabadell of Spain. The watchdog rejected calls from challenger banks to end free in-credit banking. Introducing monthly fees or demanding that interest was paid on savings would not solve competition concerns, the CMA said. Instead, the preliminary findings of the inquiry, which will be finalised next May, focused on ways to encourage customers to switch provider. Customers should be sent text messages to warn them if they were going overdrawn and prompt them to look for better offers. Banks that make mistakes \u2013 such as through IT shutdowns \u2013 could also be forced to suggest that customers seek better deals elsewhere. Some of these ideas are to be tested on account holders. Alasdair Smith, chairing the investigation, said: \u201cBanking is a sector of huge importance that affects every household and business in the country. We think customers need to be put in charge of their banking.\u201d But Richard Lloyd, executive director of the consumer body Which?, expressed disappointment. \u201cThe CMA inquiry has to bring about better banking, but these proposals don\u2019t go far enough,\u201d he said. The British Chambers of Commerce \u2013 representing the small businesses covered by the review \u2013 said the report pulled \u201cmany of its punches\u201d. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive at Virgin Money, who has argued that free banking hides the charges customers pay, said: \u201cIt is estimated that interest forgone cost customers over \u00a33bn in 2013, and we would like to see all banks being required to pay net credit interest on current account balances.\u201d Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, picked up on this point. \u201cFree in-credit banking is a con trick and it is disappointing that the CMA have decided that it should be allowed to continue,\u201d Tyrie said. The select committee will take evidence from the CMA on 4 November about its ongoing investigation, which is running with a \u00a34.5m budget and 25 staff. The CMA\u2019s research found that Lloyds was gaining customers despite charging above-average prices and delivering below-average quality. Its Bank of Scotland arm is also rated as offering below-average quality and above-average prices, along with RBS, its NatWest arm, and also Co-operative Bank. Smith rejected the idea that the CMA was not devising radical solutions. He pointed to the use of the government Midata scheme, which gives a breakdown of an individual\u2019s data that can be plugged into price-comparison websites, as \u201ca game-changing tool\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think customers will truly benefit from a more competitive marketplace until they can compare accounts more easily and feel confident that they can switch without risk, and that is why our provisional remedies are aimed at giving customers control,\u201d he said. Building the IT capability for Midata is likely to cost up to \u00a3200m, according to an industry source, while the government needs to provide a protocol for the system to work effectively. Lloyds presented an idea to the CMA to use Midata to create a service that would make it as easy to compare current accounts as savings or insurance products. The CMA also said there was a need for improvement to the seven-day switching service (CASS) introduced in 2013 in response to a previous investigation. Despite its introduction, only 3% of current account customers switched last year. The watchdog\u2019s investigation was launched amid heated political debate about the future of banking, with calls from the Labour leadership at that time for new challenger banks to be created and a market share test to be introduced. Harriett Baldwin, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s work complements the work the government has already undertaken, and continues to take, to increase competition in banking and create a fiercely competitive market which delivers for consumers and the wider economy.\u201d In a warning shot to the government, the CMA said it was still considering the implications of a new corporation surcharge being imposed on banks, which has been criticised by competitors to the big four. The extra eight percentage points on corporation tax was announced in the July budget.",

      "bodyText": "Joe Hockey in his time as treasurer certainly received his share of kicks \u2013 including by me (for example, here, here, here, here, here, here and here). He would have been within his rights to have concluded his final parliamentary speech on Wednesday by paraphrasing Richard Nixon and suggesting to the media that you won\u2019t have Joe Hockey to kick around anymore. Departing politicians usually go out in style with a speech full of dignity and magnanimity for all, but Hockey\u2019s speech contained so much partisan argument that it allows one final shove to his political funeral barge as it drifts over the Pacific towards his expected new role as ambassador to the US. His speech contained all the usual platitudes and gushiness about colleagues and staff that come with all such speeches. But having got through the usual guff, Hockey turned his speech into a partisan rant that attempted to defend his work as treasurer. Mostly, however, it served to remind listeners of all that was wrong with his time in charge of Australia\u2019s budget. The crux of Hockey\u2019s argument was that \u201cthe Abbott government was good at policy but struggled with politics\u201d. And he suggested that \u201cnothing illustrated this better than the 2014 budget where the government had more courage than the parliament\u201d. Hockey argued that the Abbott government \u201ccould have done more to win over the Australian people\u201d, and he bizarrely suggested the failure was because \u201cin modern politics it\u2019s far easier to demolish good policy proposals than to build and implement them\u201d. Actually good policy proposals are bloody hard to demolish because they come built on solid foundations of research, consultation and data, not the straw of slogans and glib half-baked ideology. Hockey\u2019s first budget \u2013 despite his belief that it was an attack on entitlement \u2013 was overwhelmingly an attack on the poorest. So unfairly targeted were the policies that the budget papers left out the usual tables which showed the impact of the budget on various family types. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling calculated the impact as overwhelmingly a hit to poorer couples with children, and single parents: This wasn\u2019t good policy sold poorly; it was terrible policy sold worse. But not content with declaring his first budget a winning policy document, Hockey on Wednesday also challenged \u201call and sundry to name a speech in the last 20 years that has influenced the national debate in the way that the end of the age of entitlement speech did\u201d. Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech? How about John Howard\u2019s \u201cWe will decide who comes to this country\u201d speech, which still shapes (for good or ill) immigration policy 14 years after the fact? Even on economic policy, Rudd\u2019s \u201cthis reckless spending must stop\u201d speech had more influence, given it caught Howard flat-footed and helped ensure an ALP win at the 2007 election. Hockey\u2019s speech, given in London in 2012, was a barely reheated 2008 Republican party stump speech that even Mitt Romney delivered with more plausibility, and was influential only for highlighting how resistant Hockey was to economic reality. But Wednesday\u2019s speech was almost worse. Railing like someone who had drunk too many glasses of red at an IPA Christmas party, Hockey related how disgusted he was that when his young son broke his leg it only cost \u201c$35 to cover the cost of a waterproof leg cast\u201d. I guess he could have argued that his tale showed how as a high income earner he paid a means-tested Medicare levy plus a high income rate of tax to fund a system that enabled all Australians to benefit regardless of wealth. He could have mentioned how it demonstrated the social contract in Australia, that wealthy people are less likely to begrudge their taxes going to fund public health because they too benefit. He could also have noted how this system has ensured public health is never viewed as just a poor person\u2019s health system, but rather one which provides an exemplary level of care. Instead, Hockey painted it as the reason Australia is in debt. He argued that \u201cwe borrow billions of dollars to pay for the health and hospital system, and he [his son] and his generation are going to end up paying for it\u201d. Hockey suggested it was \u201cunsustainable\u201d. \u201cIt is unfair and I will not be party to a generation that passes the buck. What we have to do is live within our means.\u201d What utter crap. First, why do we need to \u201clive within our means?\u201d Any major company that was not in some level of debt, nor taking advantage of record low borrowing rates that Australia has at the moment, to both fulfil its obligations or to invest, would see its board of directors sacked. But no, we have to treat our government with a $400bn budget and a Triple A credit rating as though it is a family with no capacity to borrow from a bank. Idiotic simple-mindedness. And moreover Australia\u2019s health spending is not increasing because of rich kids getting their broken legs fixed but because we have an ageing population. As Stephen Duckett noted in a paper for the Grattan Institute, Medicare is not unsustainable, nor is the issue a lack of means testing, but more (among other technical funding issues) that the changing demographics has seen a shift in primary care from acute to chronic illness. Not only is Australian public spending on health less than the OECD average, we are already one of the highest private funders of health: But our system is also one of the most efficient. Bloomberg last year ranked it 6th best in the world \u2013 ahead of all English speaking countries and miles in front of the much more privately funded USA system, which came in at 44th. This is really the heart of Hockey\u2019s age of entitlement manure. On the surface, it would seem he is all about ending cash welfare. For example, he noted in his speech that \u201cit is unconscionable in 2015 to have non-means-tested welfare. How someone in the top 1% of income earners can still qualify to receive welfare payments, free health care or free education is beyond me\u201d. The reality of course is that close to bugger all of the top 1% receive welfare payments. Australia has one of the most strictly means tested and targeted welfare systems in the world. In 2013-14, 90% of the richest 20% (let alone the top 1%) received zero to less than 1% of their income from government cash benefits of any kind: And when we break it down according to welfare type, in no category does the top 20% receive more on average than 0.6% of their disposable income from welfare: Hockey\u2019s railing against the richest getting welfare handouts is so loaded with fantasy he may as well be talking about the economy of Middle Earth. But it is his line about \u201cfree health care or free education\u201d that cuts to the chase. Again, he ignores that the value of benefits of education and health are also targeted according to income: It goes to Hockey\u2019s view of the world: one where public education and health are viewed not as essential services, but as welfare. He suggested that \u201cwe need co-payments in health, greater cost recovery in education, and universal means testing in welfare so that we have a sustainable and affordable social safety net for those most vulnerable in the community\u201d. Hockey\u2019s age of entitlement was not really about cash benefits; someone so dependent upon straw men knows it\u2019s the entitlement to free health and education, that the wealthy receive. His solution, the GP co-payment, was a typical Hockey fix. It failed to address the actual problem and was likely to see unintended consequences because a price signal is a poor way to influence people\u2019s health decisions. To top it off, it was so poorly designed that Hockey himself misunderstood crucial aspects of how it would work to the point that the AMA\u2019s spokesperson suggested, \u201cHe either doesn\u2019t understand or is misusing the statistic or is lying\u201d. In his final speech, Hockey sought to suggest he had a solution to long-term problems by bringing up the fact that he released the \u201cintergenerational report which detailed the challenges and opportunities Australia\u2019s ageing population brings\u201d. But the report symbolised almost perfectly all that was wrong with Hockey\u2019s treasurership. He turned what had always been a fairly apolitical document released under the Charter of Budget Honesty into a partisan attack on the ALP. His office constructed lame-brained spending forecasts out to 2055 based on their projections from the 2013-14 Wayne Swan budget. The projections laughably assumed no changes to taxation or spending over the next 40 years purely in order to come up with a pallid fear campaign about debt. Rather than make Australians \u201cfall off their chairs\u201d in shock at the numbers, his transparent motives had them rolling their eyes, and the Intergenerational Report was forgotten within a week. When he turned to industrial relations, the usual Liberal party lines were uttered: \u201cWorkChoices did go a little too far\u201d (just a little too far, mind) but that \u201cI\u2019m afraid Labor went too far the other way and we have a structural imbalance in our workplace relations system that does cost Australians jobs and better paying jobs at that\u201d. Funnily enough, this structural imbalance hasn\u2019t led to anything other than the Reserve Bank noting that, compared with previous periods of weak economic growth, \u201cincreased labour market flexibility may have provided firms with more scope to adjust wages in response to a given change in demand for their goods and services\u201d. But why should reality become part of a Hockey speech at such a late date? Hockey also took the chance to reveal what he really would have liked to do, were he not burdened by the most policy-lightweight prime minister since Billy McMahon. Hockey suggested on Wednesday that \u201cboth our superannuation system and our age pension entitlements must be calibrated for our changing demographics\u201d \u2013 and certainly he gave hints while treasurer that he wanted to change superannuation concessions even if Abbott didn\u2019t. But on Wednesday Hockey also suggested that \u201cnegative gearing should be skewed towards new housing\u201d and that currently it was \u201can incentive to speculate on existing property.\u201d This was rather a u-turn on his statement in March on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A when he put forward the furphy that \u201cif you abolish negative gearing on investment properties, there\u2019s a strong argument that rents would increase\u201d. Alas the evidence was that this didn\u2019t happen in the 1980s when negative gearing was briefly abolished: Even worse, just two months ago, Hockey told the Weekend Australian that there was \u201cno merit\u201d to changing negative gearing laws because it was \u201ca way for people on medium incomes to get into the property market\u201d. That was Hockey as treasurer: all talk that never held up to scrutiny, policy put forward for either baseless ideological purposes or because it might wedge the ALP or target people who were deemed not to be Liberal party voters. And the ever-present demand for brownie points for taking a \u201ctough\u201d stance. The problem for Hockey as treasurer wasn\u2019t that the policy was good and the politics poor, but that the policy was all about politics \u2013 and combined, both were dreadful.",

He would have been within his rights to have concluded his final parliamentary speech on Wednesday by paraphrasing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%2527s_last_press_conference\">Richard Nixon</a> and suggesting to the media that you won\u2019t have Joe Hockey to kick around anymore. Departing politicians usually go out in style with a speech full of dignity and magnanimity for all, but Hockey\u2019s speech contained so much partisan argument that it allows one final shove to his political funeral barge as it drifts over the Pacific towards his expected new role as ambassador to the US. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/21/joe-hockeys-tax-disclosure-wind-back-is-a-reform-nobody-asked-for\">Joe Hockey's tax disclosure wind-back is a 'reform' nobody asked for | Andrew Leigh</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His <a href=\"http://www.joehockey.com/media/speeches/details.aspx?s=186\">speech</a> contained all the usual platitudes and gushiness about colleagues and staff that come with all such speeches. But having got through the usual guff, Hockey turned his speech into a partisan rant that attempted to defend his work as treasurer. Mostly, however, it served to remind listeners of all that was wrong with his time in charge of Australia\u2019s budget. </p> <p>The crux of Hockey\u2019s argument was that \u201cthe Abbott government was good at policy but struggled with politics\u201d. And he suggested that \u201cnothing illustrated this better than the 2014 budget where the government had more courage than the parliament\u201d.</p> <p>Hockey argued that the Abbott government \u201ccould have done more to win over the Australian people\u201d, and he bizarrely suggested the failure was because \u201cin modern politics it\u2019s far easier to demolish good policy proposals than to build and implement them\u201d. </p> <p>Actually good policy proposals are bloody hard to demolish because they come built on solid foundations of research, consultation and data, not the straw of slogans and glib half-baked ideology.</p> <p>Hockey\u2019s first budget \u2013 despite his belief that it was an attack on entitlement \u2013 was overwhelmingly an attack on the poorest. </p> <p>So unfairly targeted were the policies that the budget papers left out <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/missing-figures-show-poor-are-hit-20140518-38i05.html\">the usual tables</a> which showed the impact of the budget on various family types. </p> <p>The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling calculated the impact as overwhelmingly a hit to poorer couples with children, and single parents:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of households worse off from 2014-15 budget by type and income quintile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5fpKi/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This wasn\u2019t good policy sold poorly; it was terrible policy sold worse.</p> <p>But not content with declaring his first budget a winning policy document, Hockey on Wednesday also challenged \u201call and sundry to name a speech in the last 20 years that has influenced the national debate in the way that the end of the age of entitlement speech did\u201d. </p> <p>Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech? How about John Howard\u2019s \u201cWe will decide who comes to this country\u201d speech, which still shapes (for good or ill) immigration policy 14 years after the fact? Even on economic policy, Rudd\u2019s \u201cthis reckless spending must stop\u201d speech had more influence, given it caught Howard flat-footed and helped ensure an ALP win at the 2007 election.</p> <p>Hockey\u2019s speech, given <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-end-of-the-age-of-entitlement-20120419-1x8vj.html\">in London in 2012</a>, was a barely reheated 2008 Republican party stump speech that even Mitt Romney delivered with more plausibility, and was influential only for highlighting how resistant Hockey was to economic reality.</p> <p>But Wednesday\u2019s speech was almost worse. Railing like someone who had drunk too many glasses of red at an IPA Christmas party, Hockey related how disgusted he was that when his young son broke his leg it only cost \u201c$35 to cover the cost of a waterproof leg cast\u201d. </p> <p>I guess he could have argued that his tale showed how as a high income earner he paid a means-tested Medicare levy plus a high income rate of tax to fund a system that enabled all Australians to benefit regardless of wealth. He could have mentioned how it demonstrated the social contract in Australia, that wealthy people are less likely to begrudge their taxes going to fund public health because they too benefit. </p> <p>He could also have noted how this system has ensured public health is never viewed as just a poor person\u2019s health system, but rather one which provides an exemplary level of care.</p> <p>Instead, Hockey painted it as the reason Australia is in debt. He argued that \u201cwe borrow billions of dollars to pay for the health and hospital system, and he [his son] and his generation are going to end up paying for it\u201d. Hockey suggested it was \u201cunsustainable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unfair and I will not be party to a generation that passes the buck. What we have to do is live within our means.\u201d</p> <p>What utter crap. First, why do we need to \u201clive within our means?\u201d</p> <p>Any major company that was not in some level of debt, nor taking advantage of record low borrowing rates that Australia has at the moment, to both fulfil its obligations or to invest, would see its board of directors sacked.</p> <p>But no, we have to treat our government with a $400bn budget and a Triple A credit rating as though it is a family with no capacity to borrow from a bank. Idiotic simple-mindedness.</p> <p>And moreover Australia\u2019s health spending is not increasing because of rich kids getting their broken legs fixed but because we have an ageing population.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://grattan.edu.au/news/medicare-at-middle-age-adapting-a-fundamentally-good-system/\">Stephen Duckett</a> noted in a paper for the Grattan Institute, Medicare is not unsustainable, nor is the issue a lack of means testing, but more (among other technical funding issues) that the changing demographics has seen a shift in primary care from acute to chronic illness. </p> <p>Not only is Australian public spending on health less than the OECD average, we are already one of the highest private funders of health:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"OECD health spending per capita.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/y4Quq/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But our system is also one of the most efficient. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-efficient-health-care-2014-countries\">Bloomberg last year</a> ranked it 6th best in the world \u2013 ahead of all English speaking countries and miles in front of the much more privately funded USA system, which came in at 44th.</p> <p>This is really the heart of Hockey\u2019s age of entitlement manure. On the surface, it would seem he is all about ending cash welfare. For example, he noted in his speech that \u201cit is unconscionable in 2015 to have non-means-tested welfare. How someone in the top 1% of income earners can still qualify to receive welfare payments, free health care or free education is beyond me\u201d.</p> <p>The reality of course is that close to bugger all of the top 1% receive welfare payments. Australia has one of the most strictly means tested and targeted welfare systems in the world.</p> <p>In 2013-14, 90% of the richest 20% (let alone the top 1%) received zero to less than 1% of their income from government cash benefits of any kind:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of government pensions and allowances to gross household income by income quintile.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/w2A8O/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And when we break it down according to welfare type, in no category does the top 20% receive more on average than 0.6% of their disposable income from welfare:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Welfare payments as a percentage of equivalised disposable income by income quintile.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rpdmV/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Hockey\u2019s railing against the richest getting welfare handouts is so loaded with fantasy he may as well be talking about the economy of Middle Earth. </p> <p>But it is his line about \u201cfree health care or free education\u201d that cuts to the chase. Again, he ignores that the value of benefits of education and health are also targeted according to income: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average weekly value of social benefits in kind by income quintile.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jrbaZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It goes to Hockey\u2019s view of the world: one where public education and health are viewed not as essential services, but as welfare. </p> <p>He suggested that \u201cwe need co-payments in health, greater cost recovery in education, and universal means testing in welfare so that we have a sustainable and affordable social safety net for those most vulnerable in the community\u201d.</p> <p>Hockey\u2019s age of entitlement was not really about cash benefits; someone so dependent upon straw men knows it\u2019s the entitlement to free health and education, that the wealthy receive. </p> <p>His solution, the GP co-payment, was a typical Hockey fix. It failed to address the actual problem and was likely to see unintended consequences because a price signal is a poor way to influence people\u2019s health decisions. To top it off, it was so poorly designed that Hockey himself misunderstood crucial aspects of how it would work to the point that the AMA\u2019s spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/who-pays-the-7-gp-fee-the-prime-minister-and-the-treasurer-dont-understand-their-own-policy/story-fncynjr2-1226926025926\">suggested</a>, \u201cHe either doesn\u2019t understand or is misusing the statistic or is lying\u201d.</p> <p>In his final speech, Hockey sought to suggest he had a solution to long-term problems by bringing up the fact that he released the \u201cintergenerational report which detailed the challenges and opportunities Australia\u2019s ageing population brings\u201d. </p> <p>But the report symbolised almost perfectly all that was wrong with Hockey\u2019s treasurership.</p> <p>He turned what had always been a fairly apolitical document released under the Charter of Budget Honesty into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/09/intergenerational-report-assumptions-about-government-spending-are-a-confusion-of-idiocy\">a partisan attack on the ALP</a>. His office constructed lame-brained spending forecasts out to 2055 based on their projections from the 2013-14 Wayne Swan budget. The projections laughably assumed no changes to taxation or spending over the next 40 years purely in order to come up with a pallid fear campaign about debt.</p> <p>Rather than make Australians \u201cfall off their chairs\u201d in shock at the numbers, his transparent motives had them rolling their eyes, and the Intergenerational Report was forgotten within a week.</p> <p>When he turned to industrial relations, the usual Liberal party lines were uttered: \u201cWorkChoices did go a little too far\u201d (just a <em>little</em> too far, mind) but that \u201cI\u2019m afraid Labor went too far the other way and we have a structural imbalance in our workplace relations system that does cost Australians jobs and better paying jobs at that\u201d. </p> <p>Funnily enough, this structural imbalance hasn\u2019t led to anything other than the <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2015/aug/html/05-price-and-wage-developments.html\">Reserve Bank</a> noting that, compared with previous periods of weak economic growth, \u201cincreased labour market flexibility may have provided firms with more scope to adjust wages in response to a given change in demand for their goods and services\u201d.</p> <p>But why should reality become part of a Hockey speech at such a late date?</p> <p>Hockey also took the chance to reveal what he really would have liked to do, were he not burdened by the most policy-lightweight prime minister since Billy McMahon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/12/big-spending-joe-hockey-delivers-a-federal-budget-that-will-please-no-one\">Big-spending Joe Hockey delivers a federal budget that will please no one</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hockey suggested on Wednesday that \u201cboth our superannuation system and our age pension entitlements must be calibrated for our changing demographics\u201d \u2013 and certainly he gave hints while treasurer that he wanted to change superannuation concessions even if Abbott didn\u2019t.</p> <p>But on Wednesday Hockey also suggested that \u201cnegative gearing should be skewed towards new housing\u201d and that currently it was \u201can incentive to speculate on existing property.\u201d</p> <p>This was rather a u-turn on his statement in March on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A when he put forward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/19/negative-gearing-a-legal-tax-rort-for-rich-investors-that-reduces-housing-affordability\">the furphy</a> that \u201cif you abolish negative gearing on investment properties, there\u2019s a strong argument that rents would increase\u201d.</p> <p>Alas the evidence was that this didn\u2019t happen in the 1980s when negative gearing was briefly abolished:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual 'real' rent price increases\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/lB2vH/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even worse, just two months ago, Hockey <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/latest/negative-gearing-embrace-strengthens/story-e6frg90f-1227465649146\">told the Weekend Australian</a> that there was \u201cno merit\u201d to changing negative gearing laws because it was \u201ca way for people on medium incomes to get into the property market\u201d.</p> <p>That was Hockey as treasurer: all talk that never held up to scrutiny, policy put forward for either baseless ideological purposes or because it might wedge the ALP or target people who were deemed not to be Liberal party voters. And the ever-present demand for brownie points for taking a \u201ctough\u201d stance. <br></p> <p>The problem for Hockey as treasurer wasn\u2019t that the policy was good and the politics poor, but that the policy was all about politics \u2013 and combined, both were dreadful. </p>",
