      "bodyText": "America's biggest bank, JP Morgan, made a loss in the third quarter of 2013 after legal expenses of $9.2bn (\u00a35.8bn) caused by a wave of regulatory investigations and potential lawsuits. The bank, thought until recently to have weathered the financial crisis well, has put aside $23bn for potential litigation since 2010 and admitted yesterday its legal bills could be $6.8bn more. Jamie Dimon, the bank's chairman and chief executive, described the loss \u2013 his first since taking charge in December 2005 and the first since 2004 \u2013 as painful. The third-quarter loss is a dramatic reversal for a bank that has survived the five years since the financial crisis without falling into the red and even reported record profits for the last three years. During the crisis, JP Morgan was regarded as strong enough to rescue fallen banks Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. Dimon, who ignored calls to split his management roles earlier this year, said: \"We are just trying to improve and move on. Remember these things are related to multiple year events. Remember we didn't lose any money during the crisis.\" But five years on from the crisis, the bank has been hit by more than $900m in fines for the London Whale trading incident and is locked in talks about the penalties it will incur for the sale of sub-prime mortgage-backed securities in the runup to the 2007 credit crunch. The settlement could cost a record $11bn. As a result of those discussions \u2013in which Dimon has been personally involved \u2013 the bank took a $7.2bn legal charge, or $9.2bn before tax, which caused a $400m loss for the quarter compared with a profit of $5.7bn the same time last year. Dimon would rather have focused on the bank's earnings before the one-off legal provisions \u2013 $5.8bn \u2013 after its revenue fell to $24bn, from $26bn in the same period last year. Last month, Dimon went to Washington to meet the attorney general, Eric Holder, in an attempt to reach an agreement that could include $4bn of payments to consumers and $7bn of penalties over sub-prime mortgage losses. But Dimon said on Friday that reaching a deal involved \"multiple agencies so you can imagine how complicated it is.\" The firm is facing more than a dozen investigations, including one about hiring the children of executives of Chinese state-owned companies. Dimon said an otherwise strong performance had been \"marred by large legal expense\". Marianne Lake, JP Morgan's chief financial officer, cautioned that the legal expenses were \"significantly larger than we could have anticipated even a short while ago\". \"We would love to reduce the uncertainty around this but it is really hard to do and it will probably be lumpy,\" Dimon told analysts. \"There are multiple agencies involved in every case now, we just have to deal with it and it will abate over time. One day it won't be a big number. Our preference is to resolve it and it is very hard to work with government and regulators. We want to do the right thing for our shareholders and hopefully over time we will make this a much smaller issue.\" Dimon made reference to the two firms JP Morgan rescued during the crisis \u2013 Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual \u2013 which were involved in the mortgage scandal. \"The board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues \u2013 and one that recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the US government,\" Dimon said. The settlement talks are taking place just after the bank has been fined $920m by regulators in the US and the UK for the London Whale trading incident last year, which cost the bank $6.2bn in losses and led to Dimon's bonus being cut in half.",

There's another big cost for consumers to carry.</p> <p>The long-standing political error may have been to underestimate the challenges. As Liberum Capital's Peter Atherton, who has long warned of a crisis in UK energy policy, warned in April: \"Moving from a largely fossil fuel-based power system to one dominated by renewables and nuclear in just a decade and a half, whilst keeping the lights on and consumer bills affordable, may simply be impossible.\"</p> <p>What's to be done? One step would to admit that the well-intentioned \"foot to the pedal\" approach to subsidising nuclear and wind will not succeed if consumers refuse to pay; in the end, the investments won't be made and the policy mess will become worse.

He wants to put Market Street on the virtual high street, as part of the supermarket's multimillion pound deal with Ocado, the online business which currently delivers groceries from Waitrose.</p> <p>Sir Ken, who stepped down in 2008 when Tesco was already established online, avoided such newfangled fancies. As a young man he delivered groceries, on his bike, he used to say, and he didn't intend to offer such a service ever again. He focused on keeping it simple: shops the same size selling the same stuff so that costs were low and profit margins high.</p> <p>Sir Ken's successor, Marc Bolland \u2013 now boss at Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 also failed to move Morrisons online. But Philips, who arrived in Bradford in 2010 from upmarket Canadian grocer Loblaw and, before that, Walmart's now defunct German chain, realised Morrisons was suffering because it was behind the times.</p> <p>\"This is a growing market and our customers expect us to be online,\" says Philips in his distinctive accent, originally Irish but mangled by hundreds of trips over the Atlantic. \"There has been a significant shift in the food market.\"</p> <p>Shoppers, he says, want to order their groceries over the internet because they are short on time, or want to save money by keeping a tight rein on their shopping list and avoiding paying for transport to a store.</p> <p>So in January, Morrisons will deliver its first online orders in the Midlands, close to the Warwickshire distribution warehouse Ocado will operate for the supermarket. Before the end of next year, the aim is to use \"spoke\" depots already owned by Ocado, or new ones set up by Morrisons, to venture further afield. London will be an early target.</p> <p>\"We are very ambitious. We want to go national. It will take a couple of years, but 70% of the population will have access quite quickly,\" says Philips.</p> <p>Still, Morrisons is playing catch-up with Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's who have been expanding their internet presence since the late 1990s. Both Tesco and Sainsbury's have recently revealed strong online growth. How can Morrisons stand out from the crowd and win over shoppers?</p> <p>\"We will have the freshest proposition of anybody out there,\" says Philips. \"I think we are really going to surprise people.\"</p> <p>His idea is to combine the \"craft skills\" of Morrisons' butchers, bakers and fishmongers with the food production facilities it already owns to deliver food that will encourage people to buy more fresh items online.</p> <p>At present, most shoppers buy less fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and bread, for example, via the internet than they do in stores.</p> <p>Morrisons wants to change that by offering shoppers more guarantees of freshness with, for example, steak cut to a specific thickness and freshly baked bread. To achieve that, it is looking at delivering some breads from local stores, putting special butchery teams into its existing meat processing plants or, perhaps, setting up kitchens within Ocado's distribution warehouse.</p> <p>Doing that profitably will be tricky, but Philips is confident Morrisons can deliver. \"The maths add up,\" he says. \"People think that if you are going to do fresh food well it will cost you money, but it doesn't have to.\"</p> <p>Still, the idea will add fuel to concerns about rising costs and falling profits.</p> <p>Some City analysts questioned the \u00a3216m cost of Morrisons' tie-up with Ocado which came after earlier investments \u2013 in the toy and clothing business Kiddicare and a 10% stake in the New York online grocer Fresh Direct \u2013 which were intended to teach Morrisons how to set up its own online grocery service. Instead it has written off the \u00a327m cost of its attempts to build a service in-house, including IT costs and putting fact-finding teams into the US and Kiddicare.</p> <p>Philips says Morrisons still has \"one of the best profit margins in Europe\", but the retailer has also been forced to spend \u00a3300m on new IT systems after Sir Ken's penny-pinching ways left stores without time-saving technology. More cash is being poured into the new M Local convenience store chain \u2013 another growth business which previous management had rejected. So far there are 50 of the small local shops, there should be 100 by the end of the year, and 100 more in 2014.</p> <p>But there's also a fear that management are so distracted by online and M Local, that they have lost focus on the basics. With its low prices and emphasis on British produce, Morrisons should be cleaning up as shoppers tighten their belts during the economic downturn and look for reassurance on food's provenance after the horsemeat scandal. But instead it is losing market share and underlying sales are down. Morrisons, however, insists it is only held back by its lack of online and convenience stores.</p> <p>\"There are always things we could improve, but you have to look at sales in the context of the market. We know competitors are talking about [declining] like-for-like sales in bricks and mortar stores. We are no different,\" says Philips.</p> <p>But other retailers, from Primark to Aldi, have continued to grow strongly without any online presence by offering shoppers something really compelling. Being able to order individually cut fillet steak online may be tempting, but will it deliver more for Morrisons than its old-fashioned Yorkshire bargains once did?</p>",

At present, most shoppers buy less fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and bread, for example, via the internet than they do in stores. Morrisons wants to change that by offering shoppers more guarantees of freshness with, for example, steak cut to a specific thickness and freshly baked bread. To achieve that, it is looking at delivering some breads from local stores, putting special butchery teams into its existing meat processing plants or, perhaps, setting up kitchens within Ocado's distribution warehouse. Doing that profitably will be tricky, but Philips is confident Morrisons can deliver. \"The maths add up,\" he says. \"People think that if you are going to do fresh food well it will cost you money, but it doesn't have to.\" Still, the idea will add fuel to concerns about rising costs and falling profits. Some City analysts questioned the \u00a3216m cost of Morrisons' tie-up with Ocado which came after earlier investments \u2013 in the toy and clothing business Kiddicare and a 10% stake in the New York online grocer Fresh Direct \u2013 which were intended to teach Morrisons how to set up its own online grocery service. Instead it has written off the \u00a327m cost of its attempts to build a service in-house, including IT costs and putting fact-finding teams into the US and Kiddicare. Philips says Morrisons still has \"one of the best profit margins in Europe\", but the retailer has also been forced to spend \u00a3300m on new IT systems after Sir Ken's penny-pinching ways left stores without time-saving technology. More cash is being poured into the new M Local convenience store chain \u2013 another growth business which previous management had rejected. So far there are 50 of the small local shops, there should be 100 by the end of the year, and 100 more in 2014. But there's also a fear that management are so distracted by online and M Local, that they have lost focus on the basics. With its low prices and emphasis on British produce, Morrisons should be cleaning up as shoppers tighten their belts during the economic downturn and look for reassurance on food's provenance after the horsemeat scandal. But instead it is losing market share and underlying sales are down. Morrisons, however, insists it is only held back by its lack of online and convenience stores. \"There are always things we could improve, but you have to look at sales in the context of the market. We know competitors are talking about [declining] like-for-like sales in bricks and mortar stores. We are no different,\" says Philips. But other retailers, from Primark to Aldi, have continued to grow strongly without any online presence by offering shoppers something really compelling. Being able to order individually cut fillet steak online may be tempting, but will it deliver more for Morrisons than its old-fashioned Yorkshire bargains once did?",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail shares soar 38% as Labour complains of knockdown price", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has been accused of shortchanging taxpayers by selling off Royal Mail at a knockdown price after shares in the privatised postal service rose by 38% on their debut on Friday. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the jump in the share price \u2013 which made an immediate \u00a3284 paper profit for almost 700,000 Royal Mail investors \u2013 showed that the privatisation was a \"fire sale of a great British institution\". Royal Mail stock, which the government sold at 330p, leapt to 455p\u2013 the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the steep rise showed the government had \"massively shortchanged\" taxpayers by significantly undervaluing the institution. Royal Mail's market value rose by \u00a31bn to \u00a34.3bn \u2013 confirming that it will join the FTSE 100 list of Britain's biggest companies. The government had valued Royal Mail at a maximum of \u00a33.3bn, and had attacked analysts' valuation of \u00a34.5bn as \"way out\". If the government had sold the shares at 450p, rather than 330p, it would have made an extra \u00a3600m for the taxpayer on top of the \u00a31.7bn it made from the 52% stake in Royal Mail. But sources close to the transaction said institutions would not have bid at that price. Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents more than 100,000 postal workers, said: \"Privatisation is about greed. I think Vince Cable is one of the cleverest men in the government, but he's made one of the stupidest mistakes in politics on privatising Royal Mail.\" Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, tweeted: \"Privatising #RoyalMail has become little different from selling five pound notes for four quid.\" George Osborne said the privatisation had been a huge success. Speaking in Washington, the chancellor said: \"This is something both Labour and Conservative governments have tried to do and failed.\" Asked whether the shares had been sold too cheaply, the chancellor said: \"All privatisations are done at a discount. The sensible thing to do is not to make judgments on the price the day after but wait for things to settle down, and look at it in three to six months' time.\" The chair of the Conservative thinktank, the Bow Group, added to the criticism. Ben Harris-Quinney said: \"It should now be clear to even the staunchest supporters of the government's flotation of Royal Mail that the company has been significantly undervalued. The government has clamped down on investors to try to mitigate profiteering, but it has delivered the worst of both worlds: a company placed at a fraction of its value, and a sale too restricted to realise that value.\" The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, will investigate the pricing of the float, but Cable dismissed the huge share price rise \u2013 which was bigger than that experienced on the 1980s flotation of BT and British Gas \u2013 as \"froth and speculation\" and said \"what matters is where the price eventually settles\". Ian Murray, the shadow minister for postal affairs, tweeted: \"Looking forward to Vince Cable's next Lib Dem Focus leaflet bearing the headline '\u00a3600m loss to taxpayer just froth'.\" The stockbrokers Peel Hunt said: \"This is not 'froth'; it's real people buying, selling.\" More than 100m shares were traded within the first hour on the London Stock Exchange. The stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdowne buckled under the pressure from sellers for a period. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, described the share price surge as a \"dazzling stock market debut\". Private investors who bought their shares directly from the government will have to wait until at least Tuesday if they want to sell. About 690,000 people were granted 227 Royal Mail shares worth \u00a3749.10 (at the 330p float price) following overwhelming public demand for the shares. The public applied for more than seven times the number of shares available to them, which meant nearly everyone did not get as many shares as they had asked for. More than 36,000 people who applied for more than \u00a310,000 worth of shares were prevented from buying any at all. About 40 people applied for shares worth \u00a31m or more. Cable said the government told the \"very big wealthy investors \u2026 you wanted a big chuck, we can't give it to you\". City investors, hedge funds and pension funds applied for more than 20 times the number of shares available to them. More than 800 City investors applied for shares, with 500 being left empty-handed. Sources said 90% of the shares reserved for the City went to \"responsible institutional investors\" such as pension funds. Investors include Threadneedle, Fidelity, Blackrock and Standard Life. However, the remaining 10% of shares have been granted to \"other investors\", including hedge funds. Cable had said the government would prevent the shares from going to \"spivs and speculators\". It is understood that about 20% of the shares available have gone to sovereign wealth funds \u2013 including those of Kuwait, Norway and Singapore \u2013 and other foreign funds. Royal Mail's 150,000 employees collected 10% of the shares free of charge, worth about \u00a32,200 each at the flotation price and now worth \u00a32,900. Employees were also allowed to buy a further \u00a310,000 worth, but are not allowed to sell for three years. Hayes said the share price rise would not make \"one scintilla of difference\" to employees' widely expected intention to vote for strike action on Wednesday. Days of nationwide industrial action could start as soon as 23 October. The way we were There was said to have been \"pandemonium\" on the floor of the London Stock Exchange on the day shares in BT started trading in November 1983. The price rose 35% by the end of the first daybut it paid to hold on to them. Fidelity, the fund manager, believes BT shares have risen 280% since then. The most memorable sell-off \u2013 the \"Tell Sid\" advertising campaign to float British Gas three years later \u2013 attracted more than 1.5 million \"Sids\". The shares were priced at 135p, before ending the first day 9% higher. Again it paid to sit tight. Fidelity calculates they have since risen 1,822%. In October 1987, the sale of the last tranche of shares in BP showed what can go wrong. It collided with the stock market crash and shares ended the day 20% below the 330p price at which they been sold to investors. Another sell-off that started promisingly, Railtrack, ended in misery for investors who bought the shares at 380p in May 1996. They got 250p in compensation after the rail operator went to administration in 2001.",

Fidelity calculates they have since risen 1,822%.</p> <p>In October 1987, the sale of the last tranche of shares in BP showed what can go wrong. It collided with the stock market crash and shares ended the day 20% below the 330p price at which they been sold to investors.</p> <p>Another sell-off that started promisingly, Railtrack, ended in misery for investors who bought the shares at 380p in May 1996. They got 250p in compensation after the rail operator went to administration in 2001.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Serco, the private contractor that falsified its NHS data in Cornwall, is looking to pass on its troubled GP out-of-hours service in the county to a subcontractor. The Guardian has learned that Serco has been in talks with the NHS to hand delivery of the service to Devon Doctors, a not-for-profit enterprise run by GPs in neighbouring Devon. Margaret Hodge, chair of the parliamentary accounts committee (PAC), which held an inquiry into Serco's performance in Cornwall earlier this year, described the move to offload the contract as outrageous. \"It's absurd that the government contracts with one company, which can't cope and misleads us all, and the company then just hands the job over to another. How on earth can you have proper accountability like this?\" she said. Serco's negotiations over subcontracting follow a Guardian investigation which revealed it had falsified its performance data when reporting to the local NHS trust so that it appeared to meet targets in the contract that it failed to achieve. It had originally won the contract with a bid that undercut the local GP co-operative by \u00a31.5m. Whistleblowers later raised the alarm over safety, highlighting an occasion when only one GP had been on duty for the whole county for the night. The revelations triggered an inquiry by Hodge's committee and an audit by the National Audit Office. The committee concluded that the Serco service was substandard and was highly critical of its management, condemning as disgraceful the way it had treated whistleblowers who raised safety concerns. Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said subcontracting NHS contracts would lead to a fragmentation of service, which could damage patients' interests. \"Serco hugely underestimated the complexity of out-of-hours provision in bidding for the contract,\" she said. \"Now commissioners are tied up in a contractual and competition nightmare, when the most sensible thing would be to break the contract and invite local doctors to provide the service, which is what they were doing before the existing co-op was dismantled for this contract.\" The contract was originally awarded to Serco by the NHS primary care trust for Cornwall. The PAC ruled it had been deeply ineffective in writing and managing the contract and did not impose any penalties when Serco's failings were discovered, instead making bonus payments to the company. Serco was given a further five-year contract in 2012, which has four years still to run. When the PAC reported, the company volunteered to pay back the bonus payments to the new Kernow clinical commissioning group (CCG), which took over responsibility for Cornwall's services as part of the government's NHS restructuring earlier this year. Under competition rules, the CCG cannot end the contract without re-tendering it, a costly process that could take up to a year. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"The PAC report into the failure of out-of-hours care in Cornwall raised serious concerns about the operation and transparency of contracts with non-NHS providers throughout the NHS. \"Subcontracting out-of-hours services is not the solution and carries with it further risks.\" If the subcontracting goes ahead, Serco will remain legally responsible for making sure the terms of the contract are met, and is likely to charge a management fee, although a new provider will be invited to deliver the service. Neither Serco nor the CCG would comment on proposals for the contract, although both confirmed that they have been in talks. \"We have been working with our NHS customer to improve integration of our service with other providers in the region and the NHS is considering a number of options, including the possibility of the clinical elements of Serco's service being delivered by a suitable specialist subcontractor,\" said Serco's director in Cornwall, Dr Louis Warren. Devon Doctors also declined to comment. It is a social enterprise providing out-of-hours GP services to Devon, with the majority of its shifts covered by GPs who work for Devon practices. It originally bid for the Cornwall contract and although it beat Serco on other criteria, it lost out on price.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A week dominated by US debt problems and, latterly, the Royal Mail flotation, ended in optimistic fashion. The FTSE 100 finished at a two week high of 6487.19 on Friday, up 56.70 points on the day and 34 points on the week. There were some bumps along the way, notably the continuing brinkmanship in America between Republicans and Democrats over the US budget deficit and the looming debt ceiling deadline of 17 October, when the country will be unable to pay its bills. The lack of any resolution on the budget impasse saw the US government shut down for the second week. A downgrade of the global economy from 3.2% to 2.9% by the International Monetary Fund as it met in Washington also unsettled investors. But news that President Obama had nominated the dovish Janet Yellen to replace Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was taken positively, prompting hopes that the central bank's measures to support the economy would continue smoothly under the new regime. By the end of the week there were even signs of progress in the US political deadlock, with talk of a possible six week extension to the debt ceiling deadline. But with the government still shut down, companies trading in the US began to feel the pinch, particularly in the defence sector. Chemring warned on Friday its full year profits would be \u00a38m lower than expected, partly due to the US problems. It said: The full impact of the US government shutdown is not yet known but it will impact the October order intake and deliveries to the US Department of Defense in the remaining few weeks of the financial year. On top of that the company has been hit by production and quality problems at its decoy making plant in Kilgore, Tennessee, and adverse movements in the dollar exchange rate. Chris Dyett at Investec said: Chemring's update is a disappointment, but more widely reflects the extremely difficult conditions in the US market, which are unlikely to be fully resolved any time soon, and the shorter cycle structure of the group. We downgrade 2013 and 2014 materially and reduce our sector PE-based price target to 260p (from 340p). With share price weakness expected today, we move to hold (from add). Chemring shares lost 64.4p or 23% to 220p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250 index. Fellow defence business BAE Systems - which said on Thursday that 1,200 of its US staff had been told not to come into work because of the shutdown - was also under pressure, down 14.4p at 436.3p. Aerospace and defence group Meggitt lost 5p to 541p. Closer to home, the building sector was boosted by the launch of the next stage of the governments Help to Buy scheme, as well as positive notes from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Persimmon added 2p to \u00a311.87 on Friday but over the week the housebuilder put on 110p. Barratt Developments was 5.2p better at 331.8p on Friday, while Taylor Wimpey rose 1.9p to 109p. Builders merchant Travis Perkins was caught up in the boom, up 53p to \u00a316.78 after analysts at Liberum Capital raised their target price from \u00a318.90 to \u00a319. Among retailers Marks &amp; Spencer came under pressure during the week as Credit Suisse, Bernstein and Deutsche Bank all issued downbeat notes ahead of its first half results on 5 November. The analysts - at Credit Suisse in particular - were concerned Marks' clothing sales were slower than expected in the second quarter, with the latest autumn and winter range unlikely to do much to transform its fortunes. Not everyone was negative, with Nomura saying: We are bullish on UK retail, with M&amp;S like for like sales highly correlated to consumer confidence, which has been rising sharply in recent months. We also believe M&amp;S is substantially under-earning in margin terms with GM gross margins 51% vs. 57\u201360% for peers. The current strategy to improve product availability and reduce markdown issues in our opinion will significantly narrow [the gap between Marks' clothing margins and those of its rivals). Marks' shares added 4.7p to 477.7p but lost 3% on the week. Elsewhere Ocado fell 12p to 434.9p as profit takers moved in after it hit an all time high of 469p on Tuesday. The impetus was a note from Goldman Sachs, one of the banks involved in the online grocer's flotation, which said the shares could reach 545p in two years, in the wake of its tie-up with Morrisons, up 0.6p at 275.6p. Ladbrokes, which came under pressure recently after yet another profit warning, added 5.7p to 190.7p on Friday on talk that a near 3% stake had changed hands, prompting renewed bid speculation. Broker recommendations had an effect. Standard Life added 9.1p to 355.5p after an upbeat note from JP Morgan Cazenove, but temporary power supply group Aggreko dropped 13p to \u00a314.77 after Canaccord Genuity advised clients to sell. Lloyds Banking Group ended 1.1p higher at 76.02p after yesterday's news it was selling its Australian operations to Westpac for more than \u00a3850m. Ian Gordon at Investec said: Australia was probably the worse example of \"adverse asset selection\" in the entire ill-fated HBOS international debacle, generating cumulative losses of over \u00a33bn despite Australia's generally resilient performance. We welcome today's exit. Finally, yesterday really belonged to the Royal Mail. Its shares made a stunning debut as conditional trading began, soaring from the 330p offer price to close at 455p with 229m shares traded.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And so the first day of Royal Mail's life as a stock market company has ended. Here's some facts and figures courtesy of Peel Hunt: \u2022 Shares closed at 455p, with the high of the day being 459.75. There was a 20p rally in the last hour. \u2022 Volume traded was 229m shares, roughly 30% of the float, value traded was \u00a31.06bn or more than the next highest value traded 11 FTSE stocks combined \u2022 Low of the day was 431p \u2022 Peel Hunt saw more than 200,000 quote requests. The sell to buy ratio was 6:1 sellers \u2022 But the broker thought less than 5% of the 690,000 individuals allocated stock sold today. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back with the business blog on Monday. Oops. It appears British Airways rose 66% on its first day, so Royal Mail comes in second. Still a strong performance all round, though. And it's there. Royal Mail has closed at 455p, a near 38% which by our calculations makes it the biggest first day premium for any UK privatisation. It also means a near \u00a3284 profit before dealing costs for anyone who sold at that price. Meanwhile the Royal Mail is on course for the biggest first day rise of any UK privatisation. BT and British Airways both rose around 35%. As things stand Royal Mail is up 37%. We'll know in a few minutes.... Labour leader Ed Miliband has chipped in with his condemnation of the Royal Mail sale. He said: This is a fire-sale of a great British institution at a knock-down price. It says it all about this government: bad value for taxpayers and bad value for customers of Royal Mail as well. It is an ideological, dogmatic privatisation by this government, made it even worse by under-valuing Royal Mail. Royal Mail shares meanwhile have seen another surge and are now at a new peak of 459.75p. Perhaps Paddy Power are on to something... It could take years to work out if Royal Mail was sold on the cheap, reckons market strategist Mike Ingram at BGC Brokers: So here we are with RMG trading at 440p and the government finds itself in the awkward position of effectively talking down today\u2019s floatation. On BBC Radio 4 this morning, Business Secretary Vince Cable played down the significance of RMG\u2019s surging share price. \u2018You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO (Initial Public Offering) of this kind. It\u2019s of absolutely no significance whatever. What matters is where the price eventually settles\u2019 he said. Well not quite Vince. Looking back at the 600-plus IPOs launched worldwide over the last twelve months, there\u2019s a pretty strong correlation between first day returns and subsequent returns over the following month. The companies that have a strong first day tend to continue doing well. The first rule of investment is to buy at the right price. Perhaps Doctor Cable hopes that by the time \u2018eventually\u2019 arrives the press will have moved on to new pastures. In this, at least, he is probably correct. Of course the broader issue, completely obscured in today\u2019s RMG drama, is that it\u2019s actually very tricky to value companies for the very long term. For instance, consider two former UK privatisation stocks, BT Group (ex-British Telecom) and BG Group (ex-British Gas). Ingram says analysts think BT is worth anywhere between 405p and 175p per share, with the goalposts at BG even wider: apparently these shares are worth anywhere between 1770p and 736p. He adds: How much wider could the goalposts be at RMG? Until today it had no share price at all as a reference point and very little track-record. Three years ago, RMG was loss-making. Today\u2019s enthusiasm is based upon the turnaround at RMG continuing \u2013 indeed RMG\u2019s access to the equity market is intended to help ensure it \u2013 but this is by no means guaranteed. There can be no doubt that the government could have extracted more money from today\u2019s float, but it might have as easily torpedoed the deal if it had been too greedy. The success or failure of RMG\u2019s privatisation can only truly be judged with any objectivity in years hence. It will be interesting to see how RMG\u2019s share price holds up next week, as all the retails shareholdings become tradable. Has the RMG privatisation been flawless? Far from it: pricing could have been keener, better information on the float made available earlier to private investors and all investors should have had an equal opportunity to trade the shares from today. Is it a vast rip-off of the UK tax payer? Probably wrong also. RMG falls into the vast swathe of financial deals that fill the grey of uncertainty in between. This may make for very dull press, but it is the bread and butter of stock markets. Back with the Royal Mail, and Paddy Power are looking ahead to next Tuesday when unconditional dealings begin. According the bookies, the favourite peak price at 15/8 is 501p to 550p and the favourite closing price at 7/4 is 401p to 450p. Here's the full Paddy Power odds, including for the first dividend payment: Closing share price on Tuesday 300p or less 10/1 301p to 350p 5/1 351p to 400p 2/1 401p to 450p 7/4 451p to 500p 4/1 More than 500p 6/1 Peak price reached on Tuesday 400p or less 12/1 401p to 450p 9/2 451p to 500p 5/2 501p to 550p 15/8 551p to 600p 3/1 More than 600p 5/1 First dividend paid Less than 8p 7/1 8.0p to 9.9p 3/1 10.0p to 11.9p 6/5 12.0p to 13.9p 9/4 14.0p to 15.9p 11/1 16p or more 12/1 Coming out of the IMF: After years of strong performance, emerging economies are experiencing a slowdown, and a new round of reforms will be necessary if growth is to be sustained in the face of a more challenging external environment, panelists told a seminar at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings. Full report here. In the US the budget deadlock continues but with there are growing hopes that a deal to extend the debt ceiling deadline of 17 October can be agreed. With that background it is not surprising US consumer confidence has dipped, but the fall is not dramatic by any means. The University of Michigan index slipped to 75.2 from 77.5 in September, pretty much in line with expectations. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: From a market perspective, this is a mildly encouraging data release, given that it could have been considerably worse. And together with some apparent movement in the debt crisis talks, this release may lift spirits for risk assets, though there is little direct relevance for bonds in this data. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The overall confidence indicator held up relatively well in early October, given the exceptionally uncertain scenario. That said, a downward correction cannot be ruled out at the end of the month, especially if the government agencies shutdown continues. Markets are rational, and the rise in Royal Mail shares was entirely explicable due to a long behind-the-scenes marketing campaign to institutions, a good dividend yield and the growing expectation of success as the offer progressed. That is the view of Lex in the Financial Times (\u00a3). But the column also warns the shares now look a little overpriced: At 440p, the shares trade on an enterprise value to 2012 earnings after transformation costs of almost eight. The implied yield falls to 4.5%, below that at Vodafone. This looks pricey relative to postal peers, even though Royal Mail has good scope for margin improvements. Labour unrest looms, and revenue growth is likely to be modest. We reported earlier that Hargreaves Lansdown's website was crashing on and off due to the amount of investor demand, and now the broker has issued an apology. Chief executive Ian Gorham said: As some people will be aware, we have experienced unprecedented Royal Mail share trading demand this morning. Whilst clearly we predicted and prepared for substantial activity in Royal Mail shares, the volumes involved have gone off any conventional scale. As a consequence of this quite unprecedented demand for trading, a number of brokers have experienced service issues and Hargreaves Lansdown has been no different. We have processed many thousands of trades on behalf of our clients, and continue to do so, but some clients will have had difficulty getting through on the telephone and experienced intermittent website issues. We have six times the normal number of dealing staff working today, and continue to work hard to deal with the demand. We will keep working flat out until our normal fluent service is restored. We'd like to apologise to our clients for any issues they have experienced this morning. That hasn't stopped Hargreaves' own shares rising. No Royal Mail, of course, but they are currently up 3p at 997.5p. We flagged this up in yesterday's blog but here's some video of the Communication Workers Union protesting against the Royal Mail sell-off this morning: Whether you received shares or not, the government gets a short term benefit from your cash: One City expert points out that once short selling in Royal Mail is allowed in the coming days, its shares could lose some of their early gains, given the threat of strike action. Nick Lewis, head of market trading and risk at Capital Spreads, said: Today we have seen substantial client volumes buying into Royal Mail. Due to stock borrowing restrictions, we cannot allow short selling until the first official public market trading day on Tuesday, so it remains to be seen whether the current buying appetite will swing sharply in favour of short positions. Given all the talk of underpricing, it would not be unreasonable to expect this eventuality. As a consequence we would expect the price to remain around these levels till the full trading is in action, despite the persistent strike rumours which have followed this stock since early discussions of the float. Optimism from both sides of the Atlantic seems to be dominating the price action through to the weekend. However, a postmen\u2019s protest could change investor sentiment at a stroke and, once shorting is permitted, a strike could more than undo the early gains. Elsewhere, David Cameron has challenged foreign investors today to set up business in Northern Ireland. (Presumably when they're not buying up Royal Mail shares). Henry McDonald writes: The Prime Minister also said that outside of the City of London, the province is the second top destination for inward investment into the UK. He was speaking at the opening of an international investment conference in Belfast aimed at attracting more foreign business into Northern Ireland. In a message to investors and large multi national corporations, the prime minister said: \"Put your money in Northern Ireland and be part of this incredible success story\". \"Some people say it's a bit undignified for a prime minster to make a sales pitch, I say nonsense. \"I'm passionate about the power of business to create jobs and growth and I'm passionate about what Northern Ireland has to offer, and so I'm here today with a very simple message.\" He added: \"With over 800 foreign investors, Northern Ireland is second only to London in the UK as the top destination for inward investment, with almost 8,000 jobs from foreign investment in the last three years alone.\" The prime minister said the success of the G8 in Fermanagh back in June had showcased what Northern Ireland could offer to the world. Henry continues: First minister Peter Robinson said \"many of the building blocks were in place\" to take its economy to a \"higher level\" such as a highly educated workforce. Deputy first minister McGuinness said people in Northern Ireland had a \"strong work ethic\" and more than 60% of school leavers continued their studies by taking either further or higher education courses. McGuinness also highlighted the quality of life in Northern Ireland as an attractive feature to foreign business. He told investors that they would never be more than an hour's drive from either the sea or the mountains, and could enjoy first class golfing and fishing facilities. The conference is the first of its kind to be held in the province since the 2008 global economic crash. Here's some video of Vince Cable defending the Royal Mail pricing as the shares soared (currently at 436.5p): And back with the Royal Mail, more than 800 institutions applied for shares, according to my colleague Rupert Neate. Of these 500 were rejected. Of the 67% reserved for City investors, 90% went to pension funds and institutions. 10% went to hedge funds. Successful investors included Threadneedle, Fidelity, Blackrock and Standard Life. Some 20% went to sovereign wealth funds including Kuwait and Singapore. Meanwhile a few investors went punting for slightly more than the minimum: Breaking away from the Royal Mail, JP Morgan just surprised the City by reporting a loss for the last quarter. The Wall Street bank reported a net loss of $400m for the third quarter of 2013. The cause, legal expenses of $9.2bn, or $7.2bn after tax. The bank, which last month agreed to pay $920m in charges over the London Whale scandal, is still in talks with US authorities over allegations it mis-sold mortgage securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. CEO Jamie Dimon said the quarter had been marred by \"large legal expense\". More to follow... Nick Fletcher's taking over the blog now, too. The UK economy could get a small spending boost from the Royal Mail float, if large numbers of investors sell their shares in the coming days. Philip Shaw of Investec explains: The current market price is 440p, a 33% increase on the flotation price of 330p. Bearing in mind that over 650,000 individuals received an allocation of 227 shares, we estimate that small investors made an aggregate profit of close to \u00a3160m (after subtracting dealing costs). For illustrative purposes, if all the profit were spent in the high street this would add 0.6% to retail sales. A total of 154 million Royal Mail shares have been traded this morning, outstripping any other shares on the FTSE 100. That means roughly one in four of all shares floated have changed hands in the first four hour's trading. The Financial Times reports that Jupiter Fund Management has purchased a sizeable amount of Royal Mail\u2019s shares through the IPO. Alastair Gunn, manager of the Jupiter high income fund, struck a cautious tone having seen the shares jump by a third this morning: Investors have made some good money. At \u00a33.30, the shares are very good value, but it\u2019s not so clear they are at \u00a34.40. The parcel business needs to be automated and the management will need to take the unions with them on that process. The continued costs of restructuring will hit profits, so the reason for buying this shares is not quite as clear at \u00a34.40 as it was at \u00a33.30. Vince Cable said this morning the government had tried to ensure that responsible long-term investors, such as pension funds and insurance groups, were well-represented on the Royal Mail shareholder base. Worth remembering that the UK government still owns a minority stake in Royal Mail. It held around 38% of Royal Mail shares after giving 10% to staff, and selling 52% to investors through the IPO. It could still whittle this 38% down to 30% through what City types call the \"overallotment option\". So if Royal Mail shares are really worth upwards of four quid each, rather than 330p, that minority stake is also worth more than we thought (Eamonn Butler explains more here, in a piece arguing Royal Mail wouldn't prove undervalued.) If you bought Royal Mail shares in the float, you may be wondering whether to hold onto them or sell up. . Our Money team have looked at the issue here: What should you do with your Royal Mail shares? They flag up that those who applied through the government's own website, rather than a City broker, shouldn't be able to sell shares until next week when full trading begins: The official notices to shareholders will go out on Tuesday 15 October, and after that shareholders can choose to sell or hold on for the dividends \u2013 or buy more in the market, should they wish. If you applied at gov.uk/royalmailshares, you will hear about your allocation within 48 hours of 15 October, and you cannot deal in the shares until you have received your formal \"share account statement\". Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, has criticised the government for not admitting that it undervalued Royal Mail. He said: Royal Mail is being sold off on the cheap with taxpayers being shortchanged to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds. Yet out of touch ministers have ploughed on regardless and claimed this is a 'triumph'. Heads-up: I mentioned at 8.21 that Vince Cable criticised his 'predecessor' -- Labour kindly flags up that this, of course, was Alan Johnson rather than Chuka Umunna. Royal Mail unions are still hoping for a strong vote in favour of strike action next week. Billy Hayes, general Secretary of the Communications Workers Union , told Reuters: We're confident next week we'll have a big 'yes' vote for strike action. Hayes said that the jump in Royal Mail's share price this morning showed that the company had been undervalued by a billion pounds, adding: It's outrageous what's happening today. OK, let's recap on this morning's events. \u2022 Royal Mail has made a spectacular debut on the London Stock Market. Shares in the privatised postal operator surged by 35% the instant trading began, hitting 456p before settling around 445p. \u2022 This means an instant profit of around \u00a3250 for hundreds of thousands of people who bought \u00a3750 of shares in the hugely oversubscribed application process. \u2022 Had the government sold at 450p, not 330p, it would have raised more than \u00a3700m more for the taxpayer. \u2022 At this morning's share price, Royal Mail is worth around \u00a34.5bn, not the \u00a33.3bn the government's advisors estimated. This puts it on track to enter the FTSE 100 index. \u2022 Business secretary Vince Cable has already faced accusations that the government mishandled the IPO by selling shares far too cheaply. Cable told the Today Programme that the price should settle down, and insisted: This is a very good deal for shareholders, the government and the country, he insists. He later told Sky News that \"spivs and speculators\" shouldn't distract from the important job of putting Royal Mail on a sound commercial footing. \u2022 Over 100 million shares in Royal Mail changed hands in the first couple of hours, as investors raced to take a stake. Many trades were for 227 shares, the amount bought by small investors in the float. \u2022 One brokers website crashed under the demand. My colleague Rupert Neate's news story on the Royal Mail's stock market debut is live: Royal Mail share buyers make instant \u00a3250 profit as price soars Share price rise of 36% will fuel accusations that the government undervalued Royal Mail and shortchanged the taxpayer The BBC's Robert Peston reports that around 15,000 Royal Mail staff bought shares out of their own money - on top of their \u00a32,000 allocation of free shares. Their investment of \u00a352m has already swelled to \u00a370m this morning. Hargreaves Lansdown's website keeps crashing under the weight of small investors trying to trade in Royal Mail shares. Its blames \"unprecedented demand\" and asks shareholders to be patient. The shares appear to have stabilised at around 445p. Vince Cable also tells Sky News that the government's aim is to get good value for the taypayer, which he claims the government has done, and putting the company on a better footing Business secretary Vince Cable is up on Sky News, being challenged over the 35% surge in Royal Mail shares this morning. Cable again denies that the government and its City advisors have botched the job What really matter is what the shares are worth in three and six-month time. \"Spivs and speculators are of no consequence\" to the long-term future of Royal Mail. Dharshini David challenges Cable over the \u00a3700m which the government missed out on by not selling shares at 450p each, rather than the 330p float price. Absolute nonsense, huffs Cable. We need to think about this institution over years and decades ahead, rather than get worried about the 24-hour new cycle. One hour in, and a hefty 100 million shares on Royal Mail have already been traded this morning. Joshua Raymond, chief marketing strategist at City Index, calls the 36% jump on Royal Mail shares \"staggering\" The open will immediately raise questions as to whether the government have fundamentally undervalued the UK institution and this will no doubt be the tone of attacks to the coalition from Labour. Raymond cautioned, though, that shares in newly-floated companies are \"notoriously volatile\". There is always the temptation that given the very public cries that the offering was undervalued, some investors may want to cash in early, especially if prices start to fall back below the 400p level. Plenty of the Royal Mail trades flashing through on my Reuters machine are for exactly 227 shares -- which will be individual shareholders taking a profit of around \u00a3270 each. There are also much large orders, though, as institutional shareholders buy and sell. If Royal Mail shares stay at this level, the company should enter the FTSE 100 at the next \"reshuffle\" (the London Stock Market adjusts the blue chip index every three months to ensure it includes the 100 most valuable companies). Getting into the Footsie 100 could give Royal Mail shares another boost, as tracker funds would have to buy into it. There's about 20 buyers for every seller of Royal Mail shares, reports the BBC's Simon Jack. Royal Mail staff, who were given \u00a32,000 worth of free shares each, are now sitting on a \u00a33,000 stake in the company. But not every postal worker took up the offer. Hundreds declined, such as postman Paul Firmage who told us that it was simply a bribe. Just to clarify, 87 million Royal Mail shares have changed hands so far today, Nick Fletcher reports. At Peel Hunt, traders reject Vince Cable's claim that today's share price spike is merely 'froth'. They claim it's 'real people' buying and selling shares in the company. While Vince Cable was defending the Royal Mail floatation (see 8.15am), shares in the company continued to change hands at a huge premium to the 330p float price. They're currently trading at 447p each. The interview then moves onto energy pricing (Cable says people can switch supplier,but admits he hasn't actually done it himself). They also touch on the row over Edward Snowden's revelations about US surveillance). Cable says that \"The Guardian has done a very considerable public service\" over this issue. Evan Davis suggests that the Kuwaiti Royal Family will have more influence on the Royal Mail than the British monarchy, as its sovereign wealth fund is taking a stake in Royal Mail. Vince Cable replies that the Kuwaiti investors are in it for the long terms. They're \"very good investors not fly by night\" ones. Vince Cable denies again that this flotation has been botched, explaining that in the long-term Royal Mail will be a better company. This is a very good deal for shareholders, the government and the country, he insists. Royal Mail staff are still planning to strike next week, even though it is too late to stop the privatisation. Cable replies that he's keen to give workers a firm stake in the company (they got \u00a32,000 of free shares each). Small shareholders who heard Vince Cable say the Royal Mail share price will settle down soon might decide it's best to sell up now, Evan Davis suggests. The business secretary replies that he's not about to give investment advice, and criticises \"my Labour predecessor\" for going around saying the Royal Mail was too cheap. He may find himself in the middle of a mis-selling scandal in a few months time Update: Labour flag up that Cable was referring to Alan Johnson... Who got the shares? Vince Cable explains that the government rejected many large bids for from many large investors, to concentrate Royal Mail's ownership among responsible investors, such as \"Pension funds and institutions\" who are managing the public's money, Vince Cable is on the Today Programme now. He denies that the government has sold the Royal Mail too cheaply, despite shares rocketing up to 450p from the 330p float price This short-term froth is \"Absolutely no significance whatsoever\", Cable claims. My colleague Rupert Neate has calculated that the UK government could have raised an extra \u00a3720m if had sold at 450p, not 330p each. Those who sold their \u00a3750 shares at 459p each has made an instant profit of \u00a3293, before deducting trading costs. Make that 459p. Someone just traded Royal Mail shares at 456p each... There's a flurry of trading in Royal Mail shares on the trading floor of the City, as investors scrabble to get a stake in the company. On Peel Hunt's trading floor, Nick Fletcher confirms that millions of shares are being traded as high as 450p each. SHARES IN ROYAL MAIL OPEN AT 450p, my Reuters machine is flashing. That's a whopping 36% over the offer price. We need to wait a few minutes for trading to calm down.... Trading is officially underway in the City..... There could be so much demand that Royal Mail is immediately put in an 'auction process', Nick adds, to give the City trading systems time to cope with the flood of orders.... Royal Mail shares look likely to spike over 400p, from the 330p it was floated at, according to traders at Peel Hunt in the City. Nick Fletcher reports: Here's a flavour of the Guardian's editorial today, on fears that Royal Mail is being sold too cheaply. The row rumbling through today concerned the caps on large investments, and reserved shares for small investors. This is a great distraction. If the experience of the 1980s are any guide, the great bulk of the equity will soon be sold on to giant City funds. Every investor has at least \u00a3750 to play with, and if the government hands them a windfall then \u2013 in current circumstances \u2013 that is a disgrace. Britain cannot, apparently, afford to keep disabled people in their homes, or maintain the dole in line with inflation. And yet, it seems, the resources are still there to parcel up a gift \u2013 for those with money to spare. A reminder of what was announced last night: \u2022 People who applied for the minimum allocation of \u00a3750 of Royal mail shares has got the lot, at 330p each (well, \u00a3749.10 to be precise) \u2022 those who tried to buy up to \u00a310,000 is also getting just under \u00a3750 worth \u2022 Anyone who wanted a bigger slice of the Royal Mail is left empty-handed. The allocation was handled this way because of the sheer demand for Royal Mail shares - the privatisation is seven-times over-subscribed. Vince Cable, business secretary, argued that this was the fairest way to allocate shares. Here's our story from last night: Royal Mail shares: thousands fail in applications for larger stake Technically speaking, Royal Mail shares can only be 'conditionally' traded today -- any orders agreed won't actually be fulfilled until Tuesday. This creates a window for the shares to find their true value (assuming the government's advisors didn't get this important task right). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. After 497 years, Royal Mail starts a new life as a private company this morning when conditional trading in its shares begins at 8am BST. Shares are expected to leap -- which good news for the hundreds of thousands of people who secured \u00a3750 of shares in the scramble for a piece of the action official allocation process. However, that would also fuel fears that Britain's venerable postal delivery service has been flogged off on the cheap. We learned last night that the shares will float at 330p each, despite many analysts speculating that they could 'pop' to as much as 400p this morning. The Great Royal Mail sell-off is the biggest UK privatisation since RailTrack was shunted off the public books in 1996, so there's plenty of interest in how it performs. Market reporter Nick Fletcher is heading to the Square Mile to watch the action on Peel Hunt's trading floor. The government picked a good day for Royal Mail's selloff. World stock markets are rallying on optimism that America's politicians could agree a deal to raise its debt ceiling in before next week's deadline. They didn't manage it last night though. The world's top finance ministers are demanding progress, as they meet in Washington for the G20 meeting today. We'll be tracking all the action through the day...",

On BBC Radio 4 this morning, Business Secretary Vince Cable played down the significance of RMG\u2019s surging share price. \u2018You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO (Initial Public Offering) of this kind. It\u2019s of absolutely no significance whatever. What matters is where the price eventually settles\u2019 he said.</p> <p>Well not quite Vince. Looking back at the 600-plus IPOs launched worldwide over the last twelve months, there\u2019s a pretty strong correlation between first day returns and subsequent returns over the following month. The companies that have a strong first day tend to continue doing well. The first rule of investment is to buy at the right price. Perhaps Doctor Cable hopes that by the time \u2018eventually\u2019 arrives the press will have moved on to new pastures. In this, at least, he is probably correct.</p> <p>Of course the broader issue, completely obscured in today\u2019s RMG drama, is that it\u2019s actually very tricky to value companies for the <em>very</em> long term. For instance, consider two former UK privatisation stocks, BT Group (ex-British Telecom) and BG Group (ex-British Gas).</p> </blockquote> <p>Ingram says analysts think BT is worth anywhere between 405p and 175p per share, with the goalposts at BG even wider: apparently these shares are worth anywhere between 1770p and 736p. He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How much wider could the goalposts be at RMG? Until today it had no share price at all as a reference point and very little track-record. Three years ago, RMG was loss-making. Today\u2019s enthusiasm is based upon the turnaround at RMG continuing \u2013 indeed RMG\u2019s access to the equity market is intended to help ensure it \u2013 but this is by no means guaranteed.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that the government could have extracted more money from today\u2019s float, but it might have as easily torpedoed the deal if it had been too greedy. The success or failure of RMG\u2019s privatisation can only truly be judged with any objectivity in years hence.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how RMG\u2019s share price holds up next week, as all the retails shareholdings become tradable.</p> <p>Has the RMG privatisation been flawless? Far from it: pricing could have been keener, better information on the float made available earlier to private investors and all investors should have had an equal opportunity to trade the shares from today.</p> <p>Is it a vast rip-off of the UK tax payer? Probably wrong also. RMG falls into the vast swathe of financial deals that fill the grey of uncertainty in between. This may make for very dull press, but it is the bread and butter of stock markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525811e7e4b001f379831180\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T15:04:49.503Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the Royal Mail, and Paddy Power are looking ahead to next Tuesday when unconditional dealings begin.</p> <p>According the bookies, the favourite peak price at 15/8 is 501p to 550p and the favourite closing price at 7/4 is 401p to 450p.

Nick Lewis, head of market trading and risk at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today we have seen substantial client volumes buying into Royal Mail. Due to stock borrowing restrictions, we cannot allow short selling until the first official public market trading day on Tuesday, so it remains to be seen whether the current buying appetite will swing sharply in favour of short positions. Given all the talk of underpricing, it would not be unreasonable to expect this eventuality. As a consequence we would expect the price to remain around these levels till the full trading is in action, despite the persistent strike rumours which have followed this stock since early discussions of the float. Optimism from both sides of the Atlantic seems to be dominating the price action through to the weekend. However, a postmen\u2019s protest could change investor sentiment at a stroke and, once shorting is permitted, a strike could more than undo the early gains.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5257e5e8e4b0f49d54fe28c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T11:55:39.846Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Elsewhere, <strong>David Cameron has challenged foreign investors today to set up business in Northern Ireland.</strong> (Presumably when they're not buying up Royal Mail shares).

Many of the traders awaiting the first day of dealings in Royal Mail shares were too young to have been working on 9/11, let alone during the Thatcherite privatisation boom of the 1980s. This was their first experience of a government sell-off, but they could tell a bargain when they saw it. \"There is a bit more of a buzz here than usual,\" said Steven Fine, managing partner at Peel Hunt. \"A lot of people have never seen a big privatisation before.\" Even before the official start of trading, orders were coming in. \"25 at 4 [2,500 shares at 400p each], print that quickly,\" shouts one trader. Seconds later, impatiently: \"Where's that fucking ticket?\" On the whole though, there is not much yelling but much tapping of keyboards. In contrast to the days when dealers would surge around the British Telecom pitch on the stock exchange floor, waving their hands, thrusting pieces of paper forward and trying to drown out competitors by shouting buy or sell orders as loudly as possible, the trading these days is superficially calmer, mostly done electronically, with just the odd phone call. At Peel Hunt the traders were dealing with private investor brokers through their screens and handling institutions via the phone. The opening price of 450p \u2013 an immediate 36% premium \u2013 clearly impressed the traders. In the first five minutes 32m shares changed hands, and within an hour that figure had soared to 100m before things began to calm down. \"Thirty-two million shares is worth about \u00a3120m \u2013 to put that in context, on a good day for a big FTSE 100 company like Vodafone, there would be \u00a3150m to \u00a3300m in the whole day,\" said Fine. With thousands of trades of 227 shares streaming across the screen, it was clear many private investors were immediately selling their \u00a3750 allocation. Early on, a Peel Hunt trader said: \"So far we've seen 2,000 sellers and 600 buyers.\" Fine said: \"I've never seen so much volume traded so quickly since screens came in. This is probably the highest ever number of price requests we've had.\" Regarding the criticism that the government is selling the company off on the cheap, Fine says: \"It was priced to go. Some are making a quick buck, yes, but for every seller there is a buyer. \"People may moan it's been sold too cheaply but if you believe retail investors are the backbone of the market, you want to create a culture of equity investment which we haven't seen for decades.\" As for the comments from the business secretary, Vince Cable, that the first few day's dealings would be \"froth\", Fine said: \"This is genuine, this is real, people are buying and selling.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2013 to remove the photograph and references to the Postman Pat character at the request of Woodland Animation Limited.",

But he has clearly succeeded in putting the wind up the energy firms. SSE's price rises on Thursday were accompanied by an extended explanation and how and where costs have risen. As a modest contribution to greater transparency, SSE did okay. Of the \u00a393 increase on a typical annual bill, about \u00a370 comes from the combination of higher wholesale prices, higher network charges, what it calls \"government-imposed levies\", plus VAT \u2013 in other words, stuff it cannot avoid. The other \u00a323 is essentially profit. And, as SSE says it will record a loss in supplying energy in the first half of this year, it was bound to put up prices sooner or later because its declared aim is to try to achieve a 5% profit margin. All that seems reasonably clear, even if a proper inquiry is needed to establish once and for all if integrated suppliers shuffle profits between their generation and supply divisions. The interesting sub-plot, though,is what SSE et al would do if a Labour victory seems likely in May 2015. Ahead of a price freeze, would they seek to buy energy further forward? If so, they would probably incur extra costs since there is usually a price to be paid for certainty. Would those costs then be put on bills and labelled \"price freeze expenses\"? It would be a provocative move, but the industry seems to be in a mood for a fight. Royal Mail sell-off: flexibility should have been key to share pricing Well, it's a simple formula: retail applicants will get \u00a3750-worth of Royal Mail shares. But if they applied for more than \u00a310,000-worth, they'll get none. So tough luck if you're too rich or too greedy. It's an elegant solution of sorts, and follows the practice set in the popular privatisations of the 1980s.
