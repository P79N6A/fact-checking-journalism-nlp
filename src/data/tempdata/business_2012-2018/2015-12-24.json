      "bodyText": "Roll out the brandy butter and put on the party hats. The London stock market has closed, and won\u2019t reopen until Tuesday 28th. It was a fairly subdued day\u2019s trading, in truth. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed 13 points higher at 6254, a gain of 0.2%. Investors didn\u2019t have much more to give, after driving shares up strongly yesterday. Trading volumes were thin - with just 110 million shares bought and sold, compared to almost 600m yesterday. But that\u2019s still the highest close on the FTSE 100 since December 3rd. Not an epic Santa Rally, but better than a cold snowball in the face. International packaging firm Mondi topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard \u2013 which rather sums up the humdrum nature of today\u2019s trading session. It was followed by BP, boosted by the recent recovery in the oil price, and mining firm Anglo American, which announced the sale of a coal mine in Australia to bolster its cash reserves. London outperformed the rest of Europe - at least those parts where stock markets were still open. Over in Paris, the CAC 40 closed down 0.3%, or 15 points, at 4659. Germany\u2019s Frankfurt bourse remained closed - a sensible decision, it turns out. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, sums up the mood: Volumes are thin across Europe today, with some markets already shut for the holidays. However, in London the session has seen the FTSE 100 add some small gains to its tally for the week, having seen a decent bounce over the last two days. Even now, miners are in the news, having dominated the agenda so much of late. Anglo American has managed to add some small change to its dwindling cash pile as it sells off a coal mine in Australia \u2013 disposals were a key theme for miners in recent months, and the fire sale will continue into the New Year. It has not been a great year for the FTSE 100, which is currently down almost 5% since January, with the FTSE 250 coming out with an 8% gain so far. And with that, dear readers, I have an appointment with Oxford Street. Hope you have a super Christmas. See you again soon. GW Love him or hate him, Yanis Varoufakis was undoubtedly one of the key figures of this year. Some see the former Greek finance minister as a valiant champion of anti-austerity polities, others blame him for driving Greece back into recession, capital controls and a tough third bailout. As the man himself tells the Guardian: \u201cI regret that we were a failure. A heroic failure, but a failure nonetheless.\u201d And with Varoufakis planning to launch a new political movement soon, we\u2019ll surely hear more from him in 2016. Here\u2019s our profile: Marks &amp; Spencer is feeling the pre-Christmas love.... its shares are now up 1.1%. They have fallen more than 10% this month, pushed down by fears that it might struggle this Christmas. So much for the oil price rebounding.... Brent crude is now down 1%, as its early gains evaporate. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says the markets look rather weary today, after posting a 2% jump on Wednesday Heading into the Christmas break with all the enthusiasm of someone who has received the ugliest jumper imaginable, the markets are failing to capitalise on yesterday\u2019s super surge. Trading volumes in the City are exceptionally light. Just 73 million shares have changed hands so far - compared to an average of 588 million over the last few days. You\u2019d almost think investors were busy getting ready for Christmas.... Raindrops are now slouching their way down the windows of City offices, helping to dampen festive spirits among traders who made the trip into work. European markets are generally under a cloud too, with the Stoxx 600 index (which tracks the 600 biggest companies in Europe) now down 0.2%. Rather like a festive reveller*, the London stock market is stumbling as it enters the final lap before Christmas. The FTSE 100 is now up a measly 1 point, with one hour to go until the early Christmas finish. And oil\u2019s early rally is fizzling out too.... * - or so I hear.... Rather like the Ghost of Christmas Past, former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has made a festive appearance.....and dished out some rather unfestive comments. Speaking to Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant, Varoufakis claimed that Greece\u2019s eurozone partners had deliberately forced the country into a third bailout by refusing to engage with the reforms he proposed. As Varoufakis put it: \u201cIt was a pure coup, one big coup. And that has succeeded As regular readers know all too well, the Greek saga played out at a series of crunch meetings in Brussels between Yanis and his fellow finance ministers. And he tells de Volkskrant that Germany\u2019s representative, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, was to blame. He\u2019s the puppet master who pulls all the strings. All the other ministers are marionettes. Sch\u00e4uble is the grandmaster of the Eurogroup. He decides who becomes the president, he determines the agenda, he controls everything.\u201d In contrast, eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem is dismissed as \u201ca soldier, a puppet \u2026 He can\u2019t make any decisions without calling Sch\u00e4uble.\u201d Here\u2019s the full piece (in Dutch). Politico has pulled out some highlights. And lo, there appeared some economic news.... The number of UK mortgages approved in November has jumped by a fifth year-on-year, to 44,960. That\u2019s a slight slowdown on October\u2019s 45,463, but suggests demand for housing remains robust. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, says there\u2019s no sign of the mortgage market slowing down: It\u2019s been a busy year for many brokers as borrowers take advantage of exceptionally low mortgage rates and seek guidance through the more complicated application process created by the Mortgage Market Review. \u2018Remortgaging numbers in particular are rising, as borrowers wonder whether 2016 will finally bring that first interest rate rise for several years. While we are not convinced it will, those who would struggle to pay their mortgage if rates rise should consider a fixed rate. There are still some excellent deals to tempt borrowers although we may have seen the back of the very cheapest products. Despite today\u2019s rally, Brent crude is still almost 50% lower than in May when it traded hands at $69 per barrel. This chart, via CMC\u2019s Jasper Lawler, shows how the amount of oil in storage climbed this year, forcing producers to cut the number of rigs in use: It all started 13 months ago, when the Opec cartel decided to leave production levels unchanged in an apparent attempt to drive rivals out of business. As Jasper points out, this cunning wheeze hasn\u2019t really worked yet: OPEC\u2019s wily plan to keep supplying the market with oil, drive prices to a level that will bankrupt the competition, which will in turn reduce output and lead to price recovery is taking a little longer than first imagined. Just like its meeting over a year ago, the latest meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Counties (OPEC) in December sent the oil price to new multi-year lows. This time OPEC failed to even agree on a quota. An apparent row between Saudi Arabia and Iran has led to the removal of any kind of production ceiling, which previously stood at 30m bpd. So at least until the next OPEC meeting in the summer, oil prices must reflect no production ceiling. Oil plummeted 40% after OPEC\u2019s decision in November 2014; an equivalent percentage plunge from the time of the December 2015 meeting would take it to around $25 per barrel. The Russian government will be pleased to see the oil price rallying this morning, given its reliance on crude exports. The Russian currency has now dipped below 70 rubles to the US dollar, having hit a record low of 71.17 earlier this week. As this chart shows, the ruble has been through a torrid year, matching the slumping in the oil price: Russia\u2019s latest budget is based on an oil price of $50 per barrel, which looks rather optimistic given the current prices. Analysts believe Moscow can cope, unless the rouble weakens by another third or so.... Sergey Narkevich, an analyst at Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow, told Bloomberg that: \u201cIt would take more than 90 rubles per dollar to provoke significant repercussions.\u201d Shares in UK retailers are mainly down this morning, reflecting concerns that the festive period may not have been as merry as they\u2019d like. Kingfisher, the parent company of Argos and Homebase, was leading the FTSE 100 fallers in early trading, down 1.3%. Tesco has lost 1%. And in the FTSE 250 index of smaller companies, online retailer AO World are down 2%, followed by fashion chain Ted Baker (-1.4%) and cars-to-bikes firm Halfords (-1.4%). The retail sector was rocked by yesterday\u2019s profits warning from Game Digital. Its shares are down 4% today, having slumped by 40% on Wednesday after it admitted that demand for new console games was disappointing. Retailers will now be hoping that the prospect of bargains will get people shopping. As analyst Nick Bubb says: Apart from the wild-eyed men traditionally spotted in the perfume halls of the big department stores today, few people will need to pay full price for anything in the shops today and Online shoppers will be able to get stuck into the John Lewis Clearance Sale from 5pm onwards... Europe\u2019s stock markets have opened rather cautiously today. After surging by more than 150 points on Wednesday, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained an extra 12 points at the open to 6253, a rise of 0.2% Oil companies are among the risers, with BP and Royal Dutch Shell both up around 1%. The French stock market has dipped by 0.2%, on what already feels like a quiet trading session. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reckons that \u201cpre-Christmas party fatigue\u201d is kicking in.... Volumes are expected to be thin over the next few hours, whilst data that might actually deliver any meaningful direction is also going to be hard to come by. A mince pie for Augustin Eden of Accendo Markets, who says that traders are \u201cgetting into the petroleum spirit of Christmas\u201d today as they push oil higher. The rising oil price has helped push shares higher in Australia, where the stock market enjoyed a pre-Christmas bounce. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index jumped by 1.2%, its seventh consecutive day of gains. Energy shares led the rally, on relief that oil prices were bouncing back from their 11-year lows: The oil price is also benefitting from the news that US oil drillers reined in production last week. There were just 538 oil rigs in active service this week, three fewer than the previous week, according to the latest Baker Hughes rig count. A year ago, there were 961 - before the slump in oil prices forced many producers to cut back. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predicts that output will fall in 2016: The current rig count is... pointing to U.S. production declining sequentially between 2Q15 and 4Q15 by 320,000 barrels per day.\u201d After hitting eleven-year lows this week, the oil price is staging a rally this morning. Crude prices are up in early trading, after new data showed fewer barrels are sitting in storage than expected. Brent crude is leading the charge - a barrel of North Sea oil has jumped by 1.1%, or 44 cents, to $37.87. US crude is up almost 1% at $37.83. Angus Nicholson of IG says: Judging by the moves in oil overnight, one could be forgiven for thinking that Santa\u2019s sleigh runs on Light-Sweet Cushing, Oklahoma Crude. But that\u2019s not the real reason, kids. Instead the rally has been sparked by America\u2019s Energy Information Administration, which reported yesterday that oil inventories fell by 5.9 million barrels last week. The market had expected a rise of 1.1 million, so investors are revising their concerns about oversupply problems. But there are still 484.78 million barrels in storage, according to the EIA, which is nearly a record high.... Good morning, and a Merry Christmas to you. After a dramatic year, we\u2019ve finally reached the last trading day before the festive break. Some hardy traders are heading to their desks in the City, where the stock market will shut down at lunchtime. But there may be more drama on the high streets, with retailers expecting plenty of shoppers ahead of tomorrow\u2019s festivities. They\u2019ll also be catching their breath after Wednesday -- which was the busiest shopping day of the year: Last night, European markets staged a strong rally - with the FTSE 100 surging by 2.6%. Today will probably be quieter, with shares likely to be little changed in London, Paris and Madrid. It\u2019s going to be particularly quiet in Frankfurt or Milan too; the German and Italian markets are closed. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson predicts.... ....a fairly lacklustre start to today\u2019s holiday shortened European session, while on the data front it is expected to be a fairly light day. But we can\u2019t rule out some last minute ructions in the markets. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the morning (and trying not to fret about finding a last-minute gift for Mrs W....)",

The early arrival of the sales comes after some retailers have already spent weeks slashing prices as they try to tempt consumers put off by one of the warmest Decembers in more than 50 years. While many will be looking for early discounts, some shoppers will still be organising very last-minute gifts, with sales of printable gift cards expected to peak on Amazon at 10pm tonight.

This would make it the fifth biggest internet shopping day of the year behind Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Boxing Day and Manic Monday. Amazon said it was expecting its busiest Christmas Day yet, as sales on the 25 December have grown more than sixfold in the past five years. It expects orders to peak at 8.52pm when people settle down with their newly opened mobile devices to pick up a bargain or download digital books, films and music. The company is expecting to set new records in daily download sales, after Christmas Day last year was the busiest day of 2014 for digital sales as shoppers downloaded Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. \u201cDigital streaming and downloads are extremely popular on Christmas Day because of the number of new devices that are given as gifts,\u201d said Jay Marine, vice-president of Amazon Video in the EU.",

    "webTitle": "Guns top Christmas wish lists and the industry seems to be booming", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This year, among the socks and sweaters, bottles of wine, a large number of Americans will find another present: guns. Gun shop owners across the US have reported a marked increase in interest in their products over the holidays. In November, the FBI ran more than 2.2m gun background checks, a 24% increase from last year. Gun background checks hit a new record on Black Friday, when 185,345 were processed by the FBI. FBI background checks, which are processed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check system, are not the most accurate indicator of actual gun sales. The checks are conducted for federally licensed gun purchases and for permits to carry guns. A background check does not mean that a gun was purchased. Shoppers can also purchase multiple guns with one sale, which requires just one background check. However, manufacturers rely on the background check statistics to measure how the industry is doing. This holiday season, the industry seems to be booming. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, many shoppers looked to purchase a gun on Black Friday. Belinda Gallegos, who is a co-owner of ABQ Guns, told KOAT Action 7 News that most of those people were shopping for guns as Christmas gifts. \u201cThey\u2019ll come in, then they\u2019ll be looking and they\u2019ll leave, then I\u2019ll get a call: \u2018Hey, remember that gun we were looking at? Well, she really liked it so I am going to come get it. Don\u2019t tell her.\u2019 Five minutes later, \u2018Hey, remember that gun he really liked?\u2019\u201d said Gallegos. Kelly Womack, who is a co-owner of Fort Chaffee Outfitters in Arkansas, said her store sold 40 guns on Black Friday and \u201ca lot of those were gifts\u201d. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t sell in guns, we sold in accessories, which were gifts,\u201d Womack told KFSM, a local TV station. According to Womack, purchasing guns as Christmas presents is legal as long as it is for someone in the same state and all of the appropriate paperwork is filled out. It is illegal to purchase a gun for someone who is not legally allowed to have one. Those receiving the gun also should not be paying for the gun that\u2019s intended as a gift. \u201cIf Mr Smith asked Mr Jones to purchase a firearm for Mr Smith, and Mr Smith gives Mr Jones the money for the firearm, that\u2019s clearly not a gift,\u201d explained Womack. In North Carolina, the New Hanover County sheriff is urging those planning to give someone a gun for Christmas to do their research. \u201cKnow that they can possess that gun,\u201d Lieutenant Jerry Brewer told the local TV station, WECT. \u201cIf there\u2019s any outlying issues in terms of being a felon, there\u2019s some other issues there, some other laws. Make sure they can possess that gun, if they can\u2019t, there\u2019s no point in buying it.\u201d The sheriff\u2019s office also encouraged everyone giving and receiving guns for Christmas to learn how to take caution with their newly purchased firearm. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you want to purchase, stick in a closet and never use,\u201d explained Brewer. \u201cYou need to know how to break it down you need to know how to clean it, you need to know how to use it. Whether that\u2019s going with a family member to practice shooting, we have multiple shooting ranges here.\u201d In Kingsport, Tennessee, among those hoping to get a gun for Christmas were 27-year-old Cory Edson, who was looking for his first gun, and eight-year-old Curtis Childress, who has been shooting since he was four. \u201cGun sales are up, especially this month for us. We have probably doubled last month\u2019s sales,\u201d Gary Wells, owner of Freedom Firearms where the two were shopping, told WCYB. \u201cIt is Christmas time. It is a good time to shop,\u201d Edson said. Louis Cole was browsing the shelves at Adventure Outdoors in Smyrna, Georgia when he was approached by Gabe Gutierrez, a reporter with Today show. Cole already owns a gun. He was there, shopping for his wife. \u201cLike any good husband, I asked for the list of Christmas items that you\u2019d like to have and one of the items was a firearm,\u2019\u2019 Cole said. \u201cAbove jewelry was a firearm.\u201d",

The checks are conducted for federally licensed gun purchases and for permits to carry guns. A background check does not mean that a gun was purchased. Shoppers can also purchase multiple guns with one sale, which requires just one background check. However, manufacturers rely on the background check statistics to measure how the industry is doing. <br></p> <p>This holiday season, the industry seems to be booming. </p> <p>In Albuquerque, New Mexico, many shoppers looked to purchase a gun on Black Friday.

      "bodyText": "Haydn Swidenbank points towards a rickety yellow cabin, perched 10ft up on a metal gantry that overlooks the hot strip mill. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t trust someone on their own up there in the pulpits [monitoring points] until they have been doing it for two or three years,\u201d says the operations director of Liberty Steel Newport. Inside the cabin, two men peer through scratched plexiglass at a 15-tonne slab of volcanic steel that rattles along the 300m-long conveyor below, which rolls and stretches the hot metal. Data on a computer screen helps them to monitor the temperature of the orange slab and the pressure of the water jets that cool the hissing strip as it moves along the line. Britain\u2019s steel industry is in meltdown after being hit by a toxic combination of slowing demand, high energy costs, green taxes and a deluge of cheap Chinese product that has halved the global price of steel. It has been a brutal autumn, with thousands of job losses announced by Thai group SSI, which shutdown its plant in Redcar; Lord Paul\u2019s Caparo Industries, which fell into administration; and Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that owns the rump of the former British Steel, has put 1,200 jobs in doubt at its long-products arm, based mainly at its Scunthorpe mill \u2013 although this week a potential saviour emerged in the form of investors Greybull Capital, who could come to a deal to buy the division. Nevertheless, the extent of the cuts show the way British steel has been affected by the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. Demand in China is weakening as policymakers seek to steer Asia\u2019s biggest economy away from investment-led growth to one driven by consumer demand and services. As its domestic growth cools, Beijing has aggressively grabbed whatever foreign currency it can for its products. Rather than taking their foot off the pedal, Chinese mills have maintained production rates and flooded the world with steel exports. Analysts at UBS reckon China will this year produce 441m tonnes more than it will consume. The excess of cheaply made Chinese steel on the market has halved prices, making British steel unprofitable. China produces half the world\u2019s steel output, giving it a huge influence on pricing. It churned out 822.7m tonnes in 2014, compared with a global output of 1,670m tonnes. Exports of Chinese steel climbed 22% to 102m tonnes in the first 11 months of 2015, according to customs data. That was almost as much as Japan, the world\u2019s second-biggest producer, made in the whole of last year, according to World Steel Association data. Chinese exports alone are now 50% larger than the entire US domestic production of steel, according to Macquarie. The bank forecasts China will continue to export more than 100m tonnes a year until the end of the decade. It does not see the steel price recovering until then. The forecasts paint a pretty grim picture for British steelmakers. However, there are a few encouraging signs of life springing from this industrial tundra. While the likes of SSI, Tata and Caparo have suffered, Liberty has prospered. In October, at the height of the steel crisis, it re-opened the hot strip mill in Newport, south Wales, after idling it for two years. A month later, Liberty snapped up Caparo\u2019s tubes business, saving 350 jobs. This month, it grabbed the advanced engineering arm of Caparo, preserving a further 600 jobs. What gives Liberty the confidence to invest so heavily in British steel when others are running for cover? Sanjeev Gupta, chief executive of parent company Liberty House Group, noted it can take advantage of the low steel price because it does not produce steel. Liberty imports steel slabs from producers such as Severstal in Russia to its hot strip mill in Newport. It then heats the huge slabs to 1,300C and rolls and stretches them into long sheets before they are wound into 6ft-high coils. These coils are sold to manufacturers to make crash barriers, fencing, lorry chassis, office furniture or tooling. The UK market for steel coil is 1.1m tonnes, split between Liberty and Tata. Gupta believes that with costs kept in check, there can be a bright future for British steel. \u201cThe best way to make steel for domestic consumption is domestically,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are costs associated with moving steel around. It should be regionalised and localised as much as possible. Also, if you don\u2019t make steel, you don\u2019t make anything. \u201cI totally endorse the fact that there is a serious crisis in the global steel industry. We believe there is a way of tackling that \u2026 by having an entrepreneurial approach, to make decisions quickly and act quickly. But the steel industry is not traditionally about agility and speed.\u201d Gupta founded Liberty as a metals trading company from his student flat at the University of Cambridge in 1992. It now has a turnover of about $6bn and operates from four financial hubs in London, Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong. The businessman bought the former Alphasteel mill in Newport out of administration in 2013 and immediately mothballed it. Rather than axing the 150 staff, Gupta put them on gardening leave on half pay. Swidenbank said the Liberty chief did not want to risk losing good, experienced staff because he knew he would need them when the time was right. Two years later, they are all back at the plant and ready to push forward with Gupta\u2019s blueprint to breathe new life into the mill. At its peak, in 2007, the plant employed 650 people. Gupta and his team have their work cut out if they want to drag the site back to those lofty heights. The challenge does not seem to faze Swidenbank. \u201cI have ambitions,\u201d he says. \u201cSanjeev would like higher levels of productivity, so it [staff numbers] will go up. He wants to expand in the UK market in a big way.\u201d The Newport mill is on course to churn out half a million tonnes of steel coil a year and the plan is to quickly double that to 1m tonnes. Gupta acknowledges it may also be possible in future to restart one of the electric arc furnaces on site, which would enable Liberty to make its own slab by melting down domestic scrap. \u201cWe can produce slab even cheaper if we make it ourself,\u201d he says, noting that Britain is currently a net exporter of scrap steel. However, Gupta said he would need to be reassured that there was action and support from the government to assist with energy costs before deciding to press ahead with investment to restart the arc furnace. \u201cThere\u2019s more to be done but the energy intensive industries initiative is now under way. It will help, it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll take our time, but in a couple of years we could be melting.\u201d Not content with reviving one casualty of Britain\u2019s post-industrial wasteland, Gupta turned his attention to Lord Paul\u2019s ailing Caparo steel empire. A grab for its tubular business was a no-brainer. \u201cIt makes pipes and tubes for the automotive and aerospace sectors and its principle material is hot rolled coil, which we produce. So that\u2019s a big advantage for us,\u201d says Swidenbank. Gupta admits he has been drawn to Britain\u2019s steelmaking industry despite the global headwinds faced by the sector. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s my calling at the moment. I believe we can do it.\u201d The entrepreneur reckons it is time to tackle the industry \u201cin a fresh, young way\u201d. The businessman also indicated he may be keeping a close eye on developments at Tata\u2019s Scunthorpe plant. \u201cI won\u2019t speculate about the future, but Redcar was difficult,\u201d Gupta said, adding: \u201cI believe in the UK steel industry and we will evaluate every option.\u201d",

Data on a computer screen helps them to monitor the temperature of the orange slab and the pressure of the water jets that cool the hissing strip as it moves along the line.<br></p> <p>Britain\u2019s steel industry is in meltdown after being hit by a toxic combination of slowing demand, high energy costs, green taxes and a deluge of cheap Chinese product that has halved the global price of steel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/uk-government-slow-save-steel-industry-mps\">UK government too slow to save steel industry, MPs conclude</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been a brutal autumn, with thousands of job losses announced by Thai group SSI, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/ssi-redcar-steel-workers-80m-lifeline\">which shutdown its plant in Redcar</a>; Lord Paul\u2019s Caparo Industries, which fell into administration; and Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate that owns the rump of the former British Steel, has put 1,200 jobs in doubt at its long-products arm, based mainly at its Scunthorpe mill \u2013 although this week a potential saviour emerged in the form of investors Greybull Capital, who could come to a deal to buy the division.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the extent of the cuts show the way British steel has been affected by the slowdown in China\u2019s economy. Demand in China is weakening as policymakers seek to steer Asia\u2019s biggest economy away from investment-led growth to one driven by consumer demand and services. </p> <p>As its domestic growth cools, Beijing has aggressively grabbed whatever foreign currency it can for its products. Rather than taking their foot off the pedal, Chinese mills have maintained production rates and flooded the world with steel exports.</p> <p>Analysts at UBS reckon China will this year produce 441m tonnes more than it will consume. The excess of cheaply made Chinese steel on the market has halved prices, making British steel unprofitable.</p> <p>China produces half the world\u2019s steel output, giving it a huge influence on pricing. It churned out 822.7m tonnes in 2014, compared with a global output of 1,670m tonnes. Exports of Chinese steel climbed 22% to 102m tonnes in the first 11 months of 2015, according to customs data. That was almost as much as Japan, the world\u2019s second-biggest producer, made in the whole of last year, according to World Steel Association data.</p> <p>Chinese exports alone are now 50% larger than the entire US domestic production of steel, according to Macquarie. The bank forecasts China will continue to export more than 100m tonnes a year until the end of the decade. It does not see the steel price recovering until then.</p> <p>The forecasts paint a pretty grim picture for British steelmakers. However, there are a few encouraging signs of life springing from this industrial tundra.</p> <p>While the likes of SSI, Tata and Caparo have suffered, Liberty has prospered. In October, at the height of the steel crisis, it re-opened the hot strip mill in Newport, south Wales, after idling it for two years. A month later, Liberty snapped up Caparo\u2019s tubes business, saving 350 jobs. This month, it grabbed the advanced engineering arm of Caparo, preserving a further 600 jobs.</p> <p>What gives Liberty the confidence to invest so heavily in British steel when others are running for cover? Sanjeev Gupta, chief executive of parent company Liberty House Group, noted it can take advantage of the low steel price because it does not produce steel.</p> <p>Liberty imports steel slabs from producers such as Severstal in Russia to its hot strip mill in Newport. It then heats the huge slabs to 1,300C and rolls and stretches them into long sheets before they are wound into 6ft-high coils. These coils are sold to manufacturers to make crash barriers, fencing, lorry chassis, office furniture or tooling.</p> <p>The UK market for steel coil is 1.1m tonnes, split between Liberty and Tata. Gupta believes that with costs kept in check, there can be a bright future for British steel. \u201cThe best way to make steel for domestic consumption is domestically,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are costs associated with moving steel around. It should be regionalised and localised as much as possible. Also, if you don\u2019t make steel, you don\u2019t make anything.</p> <p>\u201cI totally endorse the fact that there is a serious crisis in the global steel industry. We believe there is a way of tackling that \u2026 by having an entrepreneurial approach, to make decisions quickly and act quickly. But the steel industry is not traditionally about agility and speed.\u201d</p> <p>Gupta founded Liberty as a metals trading company from his student flat at the University of Cambridge in 1992. It now has a turnover of about $6bn and operates from four financial hubs in London, Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/22/tata-steel-eyes-sale-long-products-business-investment-group\">Tata Steel eyes sale of long products business to investment group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The businessman bought the former Alphasteel mill in Newport out of administration in 2013 and immediately mothballed it. Rather than axing the 150 staff, Gupta put them on gardening leave on half pay. </p> <p>Swidenbank said the Liberty chief did not want to risk losing good, experienced staff because he knew he would need them when the time was right. Two years later, they are all back at the plant and ready to push forward with Gupta\u2019s blueprint to breathe new life into the mill.</p> <p>At its peak, in 2007, the plant employed 650 people. Gupta and his team have their work cut out if they want to drag the site back to those lofty heights. The challenge does not seem to faze Swidenbank. \u201cI have ambitions,\u201d he says. \u201cSanjeev would like higher levels of productivity, so it [staff numbers] will go up.
