      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has pledged to raise \u00a325m for mental health, heart and cancer charities, and halve food waste across its operations by 2025, as it steps up its ethical commitments under its new chief executive, Steve Rowe. Rowe, who took charge of M&amp;S just over a year ago, said the fashion, food and homewares retailer was also \u201cdetermined to play a leading role\u201d in social change by supporting community projects in 10 cities, including Rochdale, Glasgow, Liverpool and Middlesbrough. M&amp;S\u2019s initiatives include cutting carbon emissions and giving grants of up to \u00a350,000 for community businesses, careers advice to young people, and 10,000 pairs of plimsolls to children starting school. Sir Jonathon Porritt, a former director of Friends of the Earth, who chairs the advisory board for M&amp;S\u2019s ethical scheme, known as Plan A, said: \u201cOn all the big challenges \u2013 supply chain, climate, food waste, living wage, human rights, packaging, community investment and so on \u2013 the pressure is intensifying and expectations rising. It\u2019s great to see M&amp;S leading the way here.\u201d Rowe said the latest scheme, launched 10 years after the first Plan A, was worth investing in, despite M&amp;S\u2019s financial woes, as strong ethical credentials were \u201cin the DNA of our business that goes back 130 years\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that makes us special.\u201d But there was disappointment from campaigners that the latest plan, which runs up to 2025, stops short of promising an independently verified living wage to UK workers or those involved in the M&amp;S supply chain. In the UK, the retailer already pays to shop-floor workers a sum that is just above the living wage \u2013 \u00a38.45 \u2013 for workers outside London, as endorsed by the Living Wage Foundation. However, M&amp;S is not accredited by the scheme because some workers are not paid that much. M&amp;S\u2019s latest Plan A says: \u201cBy 2025 we\u2019ll aim for a living wage for all our direct employees as set by us and reviewed by credible stakeholders in a way that is sustainable for M&amp;S.\u201d Rowe said: \u201cOur customer assistants already earn above the national figure set by the Living Wage Foundation, but it\u2019s important that, as a plc, we make decisions concerning our future cost base and they are not set by a third party.\u201d Gill Owen, of the Living Wage Foundation, said the pledge was not good enough. \u201cWe welcome any pay rise, but we would encourage M&amp;S to accredit to the living wage scheme and to use that benchmark instead of creating their own. The public recognises that accreditation means agency workers such as cleaners and security staff are covered.\u201d M&amp;S previously promised to \u201csupport the payment of a fair wage to workers in [its] supply chain\u201d and ensure that clothing suppliers were able to pay a \u201cfair living wage\u201d. It now says it will \u201cencourage\u201d franchise partners and \u201cdirect supply chains\u201d to pay a living wage as defined by M&amp;S. Nicola Round, of the fair pay group Labour Behind the Label, said: \u201cWe would like to see a stronger, clearer commitment from M&amp;S on paying a living wage. We know that workers producing for M&amp;S in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are not paid enough to live on, and their wages often fall far short of a living wage.\u201d The plan also rows back on efforts to encourage the recycling of clothing. M&amp;S admits it will not reach its former target of helping customers give a second life to 50m garments by 2020. That pledge would have seen an average of 4m garments a year recycled compared to the new target of 3m a year. Rowe said 3m garments was \u201cstill a fantastic number\u201d and that the so-called Shwopping initiative was a great scheme. M&amp;S will also promote reuse of clothing by launching repair services and ensuring that its clothing and homewares are made to last and can be reused and recycled as effectively as possible. It has also promised to use at least 25% recycled material in at least a quarter of the clothing it sells by 2025.",

      "bodyText": "Mick Galvin, a 30-year veteran of the Scunthorpe steelworks, is feeling chipper. Along with more than 4,000 colleagues, he is celebrating the end of a year-long agreement to give up 3% of their wages to help secure the future of British Steel. The restoration of their pay coincides with a return to the black \u2013 a \u00a347m underlying profit capping a dramatic turnaround since the plant slumped to a \u00a379m loss in its final year under the stewardship of former owner Tata Steel UK. Employees have also been given a 5% stake in the company, meaning they will share in any dividends, if and when there are any to be handed out. \u201cIt shows the company has stuck to its word,\u201d says Galvin, a shift manager in the plant\u2019s rod mill. \u201cWe showed faith in them and they\u2019ve shown faith in us. The mood is positive and that\u2019s good for the town and particularly for the young people.\u201d Behind him, a four-tonne length of steel, heated to 1,080C, glows incandescent orange as it rolls through the mill to be made into wire coil, which is used in items ranging from paperclips to the metal ropes that support the Humber Bridge. The intense light and heat given off by this industrial process seemed at risk of being snuffed out just 18 months ago as the once sturdy UK steel industry looked doomed. Overcapacity in Europe, slow demand and competition from Chinese steel producers that were flooding the global markets with cheap subsidised product made for a bleak future. From Port Talbot to Teesside, Britain\u2019s once-proud steelmaking industry appeared destined for the scrapyard. Some steelworks, such as the Redcar plant near Middlesbrough, did not survive. \u201cIt got to the stage where you were worrying about your job,\u201d says Galvin. \u201cIt was doom and gloom.\u201d Colleague Ian Strickland, one of the operators, already knew how it felt to see a steel mill go cold. He came to Scunthorpe 12 years ago after the mill he worked on in Rotherham closed down. \u201cIt was pretty bad,\u201d he remembers. \u201cMy daughter was only three or four and I thought that was it, you\u2019re on the scrapheap.\u201d Scunthorpe offered him a lifeline, although more than a decade later he has not stopped ribbing colleagues about the sleepier atmosphere in his new home town. But, like Galvin, he feels the mood at the plant has been turned on its head, just 18 months after its survival appeared uncertain. Scunthorpe sorely needed a saviour after Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owned the remnants of British Steel, declared it could see no way forward for its UK operations and planned to pull out. While national attention focused around the uncertain future of Port Talbot in south Wales, Scunthorpe was in just as dire straits. But last summer, it quietly found a buyer in Greybull Capital, an investment firm run by the little-known Meyohas brothers, Marc and Nathaniel, two London-based French investors who specialise in reviving distressed companies. Tata was willing to sell its \u201clong products\u201d division, including Scunthorpe, for just \u00a31 as it beat a relieved retreat from a heavily loss-making operation. The rapid recovery has been founded on cost cuts and efficiency measures that, according to hints that hang heavy in the air here, were long overdue. The takeover saved 4,000 jobs and, according to some estimates, up to four times that many in sectors reliant on the steel industry. Greybull will invest a further \u00a340m this year in a bid to accelerate the resurgence. The new owner even revived the defunct British Steel brand, a symbolic declaration that this industry was, if not back to its heyday, at least in recovery mode. It was a smart move, given the mixed publicity that Greybull had encountered following previous UK deals. The investment firm enjoyed some success with its rescue of Monarch airlines. Staff had to accept pay cuts to keep the business afloat but Greybull has since poured \u00a3165m into the company to breathe new life into it. But its previous foray into the public eye was more painful. Greybull was one of the investors in a controversial deal, led by private investment group OpCapita, for doomed electricals retailer Comet in 2011. The takeover attracted bitter opprobrium and political scrutiny, with investors accused of taking millions out of the company even as it went bust and staff lost their jobs. So far, however, the picture for British Steel has been more Monarch than Comet. The plant was back in the black within 100 days of its acquisition from Tata in June 2016. And the \u00a347m underlying profit declared for the full financial year is just a starting point, according to the executive chairman, Roland Junck. He talked of a \u00a3240m turnaround from Tata\u2019s valedictory \u00a379m loss, indicating \u00a3120m of annual earnings is within reach. So powerful is the reflected glory of Scunthorpe\u2019s phoenix-like resurgence that Theresa May chose to bask in it during the early days of the election campaign. In a tightly controlled photo call, she boasted of the support provided by government and declared UK steel to be \u201cat the heart of our modern industrial strategy\u201d. Junck now wants May to make good on the rhetoric by offering British firms a \u201clevel playing field\u201d \u2013 code for cheaper energy bills and lower business rates. He also wants more government contracts, having supplied 35 miles of track for the Crossrail project from British Steel\u2019s sizeable rail business. And Junck has a stark warning for anyone prepared to let the UK fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs rather than sign a trade deal on EU terms. He thinks the outcome unlikely but warns: \u201cIf for one second we believed that scenario would happen, we would not make investment, because it would make no sense.\u201d That\u2019s a robust counterpoint to the notion, put forward by May, that no Brexit deal at all is better than a bad one. If she returns as prime minister after the election, steelworkers must hope that trade negotiations do not once more cast a shadow over the UK steel industry. Otherwise, it seems unlikely that May will be welcome at the Scunthorpe steelworks ever again.",

The takeover attracted bitter opprobrium and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/18/vince-cable-orders-inquiry-comet-failure\">political scrutiny</a>, with investors accused of taking millions out of the company even as it went bust and staff lost their jobs.</p> <p>So far, however, the picture for British Steel has been more Monarch than Comet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"068393bcab0b38157a1d1fd00e6851162c2f95c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/068393bcab0b38157a1d1fd00e6851162c2f95c5/0_239_4188_2512/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May visiting British Steel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May visiting British Steel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plant was back in the black within 100 days of its acquisition from Tata in June 2016. And the \u00a347m underlying profit declared for the full financial year is just a starting point, according to the executive chairman, Roland Junck. He talked of a \u00a3240m turnaround from Tata\u2019s valedictory \u00a379m loss, indicating \u00a3120m of annual earnings is within reach.</p> <p>So powerful is the reflected glory of Scunthorpe\u2019s phoenix-like resurgence that Theresa May chose to bask in it during the early days of the election campaign. In a tightly controlled photo call, she boasted of the support provided by government and declared UK steel to be \u201cat the heart of our modern industrial strategy\u201d.</p> <p>Junck now wants May to make good on the rhetoric by offering British firms a \u201clevel playing field\u201d \u2013 code for cheaper energy bills and lower business rates. He also wants more government contracts, having supplied 35 miles of track for the Crossrail project from British Steel\u2019s sizeable rail business.</p> <p>And Junck has a stark warning for anyone prepared to let the UK fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs rather than sign a trade deal on EU terms. He thinks the outcome unlikely but warns: \u201cIf for one second we believed that scenario would happen, we would not make investment, because it would make no sense.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a robust counterpoint to the notion, put forward by May, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/30/brexit-weekly-briefing-no-deal-bad-deal-theresa-may\">no Brexit deal at all is better than a bad one</a>.</p> <p>If she returns as prime minister after the election, steelworkers must hope that trade negotiations do not once more cast a shadow over the UK steel industry. Otherwise, it seems unlikely that May will be welcome at the Scunthorpe steelworks ever again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The construction firm Mears has banned its workers from having beards, citing health and safety grounds. Staff were told of the decision at a \u201ctool box talk\u201d in Tower Hamlets, east London, that beards were now banned so that workers could \u201cwear appropriate dust masks effectively\u201d. Mears has said workers need to be clean-shaven in order to be safely fitted with a tight-fitting face mask when working in dusty environments, and exceptions are only made if a worker can\u2019t shave or a mask cannot be worn for medical or religious reasons. But for the company to allow this either a medical certificate or a letter from a place of worship must be presented. The decision was immediately criticised by Britain\u2019s biggest union, Unite, as \u201cpenny-pinching stupidity\u201d. The union has obtained a letter from the company confirming that \u201cthis is now a Mears nationwide policy for the entire company\u201d. The letter adds that a goatee \u201cmay be acceptable so long as it does not hinder the correct fitting of said dust masks\u201d. Unite regional official for London Mark Soave said: \u201cThe arrogance of Mears is hair-raising. This is a highly delicate issue, which has huge cultural, religious and personal issues and where sensitivity should be the watchword. Instead members have been handed a decree from on high. \u201cThis is clearly a case of Mears going for the cheapest option and amounts to penny-pinching stupidity. Other forms of masks are available and these should be offered to existing workers. Unite will always put the safety of our members first and creating huge resentment and anger among your workforce is never the way forward. Mears needs to withdraw this decree and enter into a proper consultation with Unite and the workforce.\u201d Unite\u2019s national health and safety adviser, Susan Murray, said before any policy is introduced there should be full and proper consultation. \u201cIt is crucial that the policy recognises the diversity of the workforce and the principle that workers should be consulted and given a choice of several correctly specified types of RPE (respiratory protective equipment) so they can choose the one they like,\u201d she said. But Mears has stood by its position, and the company\u2019s group health and safety director, Mark Elkington accused Unite of not taking the safety of its members seriously \u201cin order to make a cheap point\u201d. \u201cWe are pretty surprised that Unite, who claim to have the safety of workers at heart have taken this disappointing stance,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cEvery employer in the UK has a legal responsibility to ensure that employees working in dusty or otherwise potentially hazardous environments are properly protected and in recent years employers have been prosecuted for failing to fulfil this duty. \u201cThe simple fact is that no dust mask can work effectively unless it forms a seal against the skin. That is not possible with a beard or even heavy stubble. If the Health and Safety Executive did a spot site visit and found workers wearing dust masks that were not sealed against the face then we would be liable to prosecution.\u201d",

The closely watched poll of factory sentiment came in just ahead of City economists\u2019 expectations and suggested firms were shrugging off any uncertainty created by the general election. However, the responses from about 600 companies were collected between 12 and 25 May \u2013 before opinion polls started to show a significant narrowing in the Conservatives\u2019 lead. There were still signs that the Brexit blow to the pound was ramping up manufacturers\u2019 costs in May, but the pace of price rises eased off recent highs. There was also further evidence that the pound\u2019s weakness was helping exports by making UK goods cheaper for overseas buyers. The headline factory activity index on the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI edged down to 56.7 in May from April\u2019s three-year high of 57.3. A reading above 50 signals expansion; below signals contraction. The index (pdf) briefly fell below that watermark after last June\u2019s EU referendum but has now been in growth territory for 10 months. \u201cThe strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year,\u201d said Rob Dobson, a senior economist at survey compiler IHS Markit. \u201cThe ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn. Growth of new export business played a lesser role in comparison, with the trend in foreign demand continuing to improve only in fits and starts, despite the assistance of a historically weak sterling exchange rate.\u201d The survey\u2019s forward-looking measures suggested that the manufacturing sector could maintain its relatively solid pace of expansion. Growth of new orders, backlogs of work and business optimism were all strong. Against that backdrop, manufacturers took on new workers at the fastest pace since mid-2014. The upbeat survey will provide some support to those commentators who believe a strong manufacturing sector can offset some of the economic pain from a consumer spending slowdown this year. Higher prices and slow wage growth have eroded household budgets, denting the main driving force for UK GDP growth. The consumer squeeze was a key factor in the sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter of 2017. Survey data has suggested the second quarter got off to a stronger start but economists warn that uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations could derail any upswing. They also advise against overplaying the importance of any strength in the manufacturing sector given it only makes up a 10th of the economy.",

      "bodyText": "A positive series of manufacturing figures have given European markets a bright start to the new month, while US shares have been lifted by better than expected private sector jobs figures ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u2019s ADP payrolls number has really grabbed investor attention, with the 253,000 reading providing yet more clues that we will see the Fed raise rates once more this month. Tomorrow\u2019s payrolls figure is undoubtedly the big release of the week, as this will largely provide confirmation of whether the Fed will actually act this month. However, with markets already pricing in a 100% chance of a rate rise, there is reason to believe we could see a lower degree of volatility than usual. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.82 points or 0.32% higher at 7543.77 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.4% to 12,664.92 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.66% higher at 5318.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 0.99% to 20,936.07 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.01% better at 10,881.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.85% to 781.85 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 54 points or 0.27% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. After a nervous opening, Wall Street has the wind in its sails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 46 points or 0.22% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both hit new highs. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude inventories are tanking if the latest data from the EIA is anything to go by, with today\u2019s reading providing the biggest weekly draw-down in 2017. The recent OPEC decision to extend production cuts was treated with disdain, yet there is reason to believe that their actions are gradually managing to reduce global crude inventories despite rising output in the likes of the US. More signs of growing demand for oil, with US crude stocks falling last week by the biggest amount so far this year. Crude supplies fell by 6.43m barrels to 509.91m, compared to expectations of a 2.5m decline. Gasoline stocks were also down by more than analysts had been forecasting, according to the Energy Information Administration. The news has pushed crude prices higher, with West Texas Intermediate up 0.56% to $48.59 a barrel and Brent crude 0.37% better at $50.95. Sterling is now moving higher against both the dollar and the euro, shrugging off worries about the latest election opinion polls and buoyed by the decent UK manufacturing data. It is now up 0.12% against the dollar at $1.2905 and 0.29% higher against the euro at \u20ac1.1490. More on the currency markets. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US dollar got a significant uplift after a bumper ADP payrolls report for May which showed that 253k new jobs were added, with most of them in the services sector. As a bellwether for tomorrow\u2019s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again: The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy. Another decent manufacturing report for the month of May saw decent gains in new orders as well as employment. Rising prices remained a concern but they also showed further signs of easing back. The latest election poll shows an 8 point lead for the Conservatives over Labour, down from 15 points on May 23. The ISM survey adds more impetus for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this months, says ING Bank economist James Knightley: The key manufacturing survey suggests strong order books will keep output robust with employment picking up nicely. The US ISM manufacturing index for May has barely changed from April\u2019s reading \u2013 rising to 54.9 from 54.8. The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting. Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April. With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise. But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%. In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip. The ISM manufacturing activity index has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts. Timothy Fiore, ISM chair, said: Comments from the panel generally reflect stable to growing business conditions, with new orders, employment and inventories of raw materials all growing in May compared to April. The slowing of pricing pressure, especially in basic commodities, should have a positive impact on margins and buying policies as this moderation moves up the value chain. And here are some comments from the survey\u2019s respondents: \u201cSales have picked up compared to the last two months. Customer demand has increased.\u201d (Plastics &amp; Rubber Products) \u201cEconomy is still strong, but [the] political climate can change things very quickly.\u201d (Transportation Equipment) \u201cGlobal price increases for commodities.\u201d (Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components) \u201cBusiness (sales/production) is steady. Pricing pressures on raw materials. Skilled labor in short supply.\u201d (Furniture &amp; Related Products) \u201cAgricultural demand very strong.\u201d (Chemical Products) \u201cOur business is definitely paying attention to developments with the Canadian lumber tariff announcement. The final outcome could change our fiber pricing.\u201d (Paper Products) \u201cOEM longer lead parts possibly longer lead time due to more orders.\u201d (Nonmetallic Mineral Products) \u201cBusiness conditions are steady, and with competition increasing, it\u2019s making negotiations even more intense to reduce costs.\u201d (Machinery) \u201cBusiness is booming, and getting direct employees is increasingly difficult.\u201d (Fabricated Metal Products) \u201cDifficult to find qualified labor for factory positions.\u201d (Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products) Commenting on the US PMI, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: Manufacturing growth momentum continued to ebb in May, down to its weakest since just before the presidential election. Manufacturing output, order books and employment all grew at only modest rates as sluggish sales prompted firms to scale back hiring. Exports sales remained especially lacklustre, hampered in part by the relatively strong dollar. The survey also brought signs of companies becoming more cautious about holding inventory. Factories\u2019 raw material prices meanwhile rose at a sharply reduced rate, which should at least help take pressure off profit margins and also feed through to weaker pressure on consumer price inflation. The rival ISM survey is due shortly, and is also expected to show a slight dip from the April figure. The first of the two US manufacturing surveys has come in better than the initial reading but has shown a very slight dip from the previous month. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index has slipped from 52.8 in April to 52.7 last month, compared to a first estimate of 52.5. While this is still in expansion territory it is the lowest reading since September. US markets have made a tentative start to the new month, despite the strong private sector jobs data and ahead of two rival manufacturing surveys for May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 9 points while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have edged marginally higher at the open. The dollar is rallying after the stronger than expected private sector jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payrolls due on Friday. The US currency is up 0.5% against the yen and 0.2% better against the euro. And the pound is currently 0.13% lower at $1.2874. We\u2019ve seen plenty of encouraging economic news this morning, with factory output rising in the UK and also in the eurozone, strong job creation in America, and an upgrade to Italy\u2019s GDP. But this is no time for complacency. The chief executive of the World Bank has just warned governments to \u2018buckle up\u2019, ready for the next crisis. Kristalina Georgieva warned an audience at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum that the rise in financial, economic and terror-related emergencies is becoming the \u201cnew normal\u201d. She explained: \u201cI\u2019m asking myself what has changed in this decade and my conclusion is what has changed probably can be summed up with \u2018buckle up\u2019. \u201cWe are now at the point when shocks are more frequent. Unexpected crises are maybe not more dramatic than they used to be before, but they are very impolite, they don\u2019t wait their turn.\u201d In the past, Georgieva argued, governments would be faced with one \u201cmassive\u201d crisis at a time. Now, they come in battalions. \u201cIf you just look at the last years, we had financial crisis, economic crisis, eurozone crisis, terrorism, geopolitical crises, and neither institutions or businesses are well tuned to deal with more than one shock at a time. \u201cWe have to really figure out - if this is the new normal, and I happen to think this is the new normal - how we can have more resilient , more agile and more adaptable government policies, (and) private sector behaviour so that (work) security can be put on a sound foundation.\u201d Thanks to the Press Association for the quotes. More American employment data just landed. And it shows that the number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit has risen to 248,000, from 235,000 a week ago. That\u2019s more than expected, but remains low by historical standards. America\u2019s private sector created 253,000 new jobs in May, substantially more than expected. Economists had predicted that the monthly ADP payroll would rise by 185,000, and these blow-out figure suggest tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll could also be impressive. More than 200,000 jobs were created in the service sector, including 88,000 in the \u2018professional and business\u2019 sector. There were also small gains in manufacturing and mining, and 37,000 new hires in construction. Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Portfolios, says the report shows that the US economy is motoring along quite nicely. But economists are also looking for signs that wage growth is picking up. International Airlines Group CEO Willie Walsh has broken his silence over the disruption that grounded over a thousand British Airways flights last weekend. Speaking to the BBC, Walsh said he was pleased that BA has recovered from the \u201csignificant disruption\u201d that it faced on Saturday. And he insist that the IT meltdown was caused by a power outage, rather than a problem with BA\u2019s technology, saying: We clearly apologise to any customers who were disrupted. It was not an IT failure. It was a problem caused by the failure of electrical power to our IT systems. We understand what happened, we\u2019re still investigating why it happened, and that investigation will take some time. It\u2019s worth noting that IT experts have told us that a power surge could not cause such a catastrophic outage. Walsh added that the team at BA did \u201ceverything they could\u201d to recover the situation. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that passengers suffered, he concludes. We\u2019ve got bad news for wine lovers out there. The average price of a bottle in the UK has risen over \u00a35.50 for the first time ever. That\u2019a according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, which blames the fall in sterling following last June\u2019s EU referendum. Miles Beale, WSTA\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cLast year the WSTA predicted that Brexit and the fall in the value of the pound, compounded by rising inflation, would force the UK wine industry to up their prices. Sadly this is now a reality as an average priced bottle of wine in the UK is at an all-time high. Unfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise. What is even more concerning is that this does not take into account the inflationary duty rise \u2013 at a painful 3.9% - on alcohol inflicted by the Chancellor in the March Budget. Billionaire-turned-philanthropist George Soros has weighed in on Brexit this morning, saying the European Union needs to be radically re-invented. Soros also argued that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU will take much longer than the two-year window set under the Lisbon Treaty. He says: \u201cNegotiating the separation with Britain will divert the EU\u2019s attention from its own existential crisis, and the talks are bound to last longer than the two years allotted to them. Five years seems more likely.\u201d Our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin has more details: There\u2019s unrest at the Bank of England this morning. Workers at Britain\u2019s central bank are to be balloted on strike action, after being offered a pay rise of just 1%. Unite regional officer Mercedes Sanchez has blasted the BoE, calling it arrogant and out of touch: \u201cThe bank\u2019s disgraceful snub of low paid staff stinks of arrogance and represents an organisation thoroughly out of touch with the reality of the pressure staff face meeting their costs of living. \u201cIt is a source of shame that an iconic symbol of financial services in the UK is choosing to ride roughshod over the concerns of its dedicated and hardworking staff and impose this derisory pay deal. In effect, staff are facing a real terms pay cut. A 1% rise in wages won\u2019t keep pace with inflation, which has just jut a four-year high of 2.7%. That\u2019s ahead of the BoE\u2019s own target of 2%. Unite represent security, catering, legal, and human resource staff at the Bank. Update: Apparently Unite represent 2% of all BoE staff. Sky News has more details. Economists have welcomed the news that Britain\u2019s manufacturing PMI dipped to 56.7 in May, from 57 in April, showing solid growth. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says manufacturers are shrugging off political uncertainty: \u201cWhile not quite hitting the heights of April\u2019s rebound in activity, the manufacturing sector didn\u2019t disappoint with a sustained rise in purchasing activity, output and new orders, optimism at a 20- month high, and storming ahead unfazed by the looming election. \u201cThe domestic market persisted as the driving force, but the weak pound\u2019s continuing bounty meant levels of export orders also increased, for the thirteenth month, as export markets made use of the competitiveness of UK firms. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, agrees that UK manufacturing is in \u2018good shape\u2019: Output and orders expansion is being driven by resilient demand coming through UK supply chains and a better looking global economy than UK manufacturers have been used to for some time. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, says the weak pound is helping exporters, but could bite UK customers in the pocket: Exporters have continued to take advantage of a weak sterling, which has kept British exports competitive on a global stage, and at a time when the world economy is showing signs of improvement. However, rising cost pressures are still circling, not only from elevated import costs but also from the growing effect of domestic costs from sources such as energy and staffing which will all contribute to fuelling inflation. Although manufacturers have resisted passing on these costs to date, the expectation of price rises is becoming more apparent in the sector.\u201d Chris Leyland, analyst at investment firm True Potential, says factory bosses face some pressures: Today\u2019s figure is above 50, meaning expansion is still happening, it\u2019s just that the rate has slowed compared to last month. There are a number of reasons for that, mostly stemming from the weaker pound pushing up import cost for factories and therefore prices for the end consumer. It also means consumers have less disposable income, because their food and fuel bills have risen. The price of oil has also increased, leading to higher fuel costs for manufacturers. \u201cThe key will be exports, because the weaker pound means factories may receive more orders from abroad, which could offset some domestic pain.\u201d Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson flags up that export growth slowed a little in May: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has continued to shrug off Brexit, by posting \u201cfurther marked growth in May\u201d. That\u2019s according to today\u2019s PMI survey from Markit, which shows that UK factory growth was close to April\u2019s three-year high. Here\u2019s the topline: UK factory bosses reported that they benefitted from domestic demand, and a \u201csolid increase\u201d in new export business. Optimism regarding the outlook for production levels in one year\u2019s time rose to a 20-month high. This is also feeding into the jobs market; factory employment rose for the tenth consecutive month in May, at the fastest rate since June 2014. In short, it all suggests that the manufacturing sector is holding up well. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cThe strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year. The ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn. Growth of new export business played a lesser role in comparison, with the trend in foreign demand continuing to improve only in fits and starts, despite the assistance of a historically weak sterling exchange rate.

Italy\u2019s growth rate has been revised sharply higher, in another sign that Europe\u2019s recovery is strengthening. Italian GDP rose by 0.4% in January-to-March, new figures show. That\u2019s twice as fast as first estimated. It\u2019s also twice as fast as Britain managed in Q1, and confirms that the UK was the weakest-performing G7 member at the start of this year. Here\u2019s more details of the surge in manufacturing employment across the eurozone last month: Staffing levels rose at quicker rates in Germany (six- year high), Italy (just below October 1999\u2019s series- record), Spain (fastest in 19 years), Ireland (two-year peak) and Austria (two-month high). Slower increases were registered in France and the Netherlands, while Greece reported jobs growth for the first time in six months. Newsflash: Eurozone factories have just racked up their fastest growth in six years. The euro-area manufacturing PMI has come in at 57.0, up from 56.7 in April, thanks to faster growth in output and new orders. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector led the way, with growth at a 73-month high. Most other eurozone countries also posted growth, but Greece brought up the rear with another contraction. And the really good news is that Europe\u2019s factories have created more jobs in May than at any time since this survey began, 20 years ago. Markit says: The ongoing expansion of the eurozone manufacturing sector gathered further momentum in May. Growth in output and new orders accelerated to the best seen for around six years, to underpin the strongest job creation in the 20-year survey history. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the surveys show Europe\u2019s recovery is strengthening: \u201cThe eurozone upturn is developing deeper roots as factories enjoy a spring growth spurt. Demand for goods is growing at the steepest rate for six years, encouraging manufacturers to step up production and take on extra staff at a rate not previously seen in the two-decade history of the PMI survey. \u201cThe fact that the upturn is being accompanied by such strong jobs growth sends a signal that increasing numbers of companies are moving away from a focus on cost cutting towards investing in expansion, underscoring the elevated levels of business optimism seen across the region. The record hiring adds to the sense that the upturn is looking more and more robust as each month goes by. Germany\u2019s factories have expanded faster than their French rivals last month: Good news from Spain! Spanish factories are taking on new staff at the fastest rate since 1998, after posting another month of growth. The Spanish manufacturing PMI hit a four-month high of 55.4 in May, up from 54.5 in April. Firms reported a rise in output and new orders, encouraging them to take on extra workers to deal with the demand. Spain has suffered one of the worst unemployment crisis of any eurozone country since the financial crisis, so this is very encouraging. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cMay was an excellent month for workers in the Spanish manufacturing sector as firms took on staff at the strongest pace for 19 years. Moreover, with new work rising healthily again and further signs of capacity coming under pressure, the likelihood is that jobs will continue to be created at a decent clip over the near-term at least. The first eurozone manufacturing report of the day was quite a belter. Ireland\u2019s factory PMI jumped to 55.9 in May from 55.0 in April, signalling \u201ca marked improvement in business conditions\u201d. That\u2019s the highest level in 22 months. Investec, which produces the report, says: Respondents linked higher output to rising new orders and improving economic conditions. New business also rose at a faster pace in May amid reports of stronger client demand. We have fresh evidence that Britain\u2019s housing market is cooling. House prices fell by 0.2% in May, reports Nationwide, which is the third monthly fall in a row. That hasn\u2019t happened since 2009 - the dark days of the financial crisis. On an annual basis, prices are only 2.1% higher than a year ago - another sign that demand is cooling off. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, explains: \u201cHouse prices recorded their third consecutive monthly fall in May \u2013 the first time this has occurred since 2009. The annual rate of growth slowed to 2.1%, the weakest in almost four years. \u201cIt is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector, though data continues to send mixed signals in this regard. Worries over China\u2019s economy are intensifying this morning after new data showed its manufacturing sector is shrinking. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in May, from 50.1 in April. That signals that activity contracted last month, for the first time in nearly a year. Chinese firms reported that output grew at the weakest level in 11 months, due to \u2018muted\u2019 growth in new orders from domestic and overseas customers. Firms also slashed jobs again, at the fastest rate since last September. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, said there are signs that Chinese factories are struggling. The sub-index of stocks of purchases signalled a renewed decline, while the sub-index of stocks of finished goods rebounded, indicating that companies have stopped actively restocking as inventories began to stack up. China\u2019s manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory.\u201d Caixin\u2019s survey is weaker than the official Chinese PMIs.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, and that means a new flurry of economic data. June is kicking off with new surveys of the world\u2019s factories, from China to the US via Europe. The Purchasing Manager Indexes are expected to show that Europe\u2019s recovery continued last month, with eurozone manufacturing growth possibly hitting a six-year high. The UK data will also be closely scrutinised. Economists predict a small slowdown in growth last month. RBC Capital Markets say: Another set of robust numbers would make the Q1 slowdown seem potentially transitory, whereas softer data would instead leave the April upturn looking like a positive blip amidst mounting evidence of a slowing economy. Our economists\u2019 central expectation remains that the consumer-led slowdown will be more durable, so our bias is to look for a pullback in the PMIs to confirm this. The City has already woken up to some disappointing data from China, where factory activity contracted for the first time in 11 months (more on that shortly). The pound continues to bob around like a cork in a stormy sea, as the UK general election approaches. It\u2019s shed almost half a cent this morning, to $1.285, after a new YouGov poll showed a mere 3 point gap between the Conservatives and Labour. Other polls, though, have given Theresa May a larger lead, so traders are suitably cautious. Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.15am to 9am: Eurozone manufacturing PMIs are released 9.30am: UK manufacturing PMIs 1.15pm: US ADP payroll of private sector jobs 1.30pm: US weekly jobless figures 3pm: US manufacturing PMIs",

As a bellwether for tomorrow\u2019s official payrolls report it could well rubber stamp the prospect of a move in June, but also raise expectations of a further hike as soon as September. The main puzzle for a lot of people given the number of jobs being added is the weak nature of wage growth which still remains lacklustre. </p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the dollar strength, sterling has not been hit too hard. Hewson again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound has managed to hold up fairly well despite another poll showing a narrow lead for the Conservative party, as the focus returns to the UK economy.

The consensus had expected it to hold steady. Production slipped marginally to stand at 57.1 versus 58.6 previously, but new orders rose to 59.5 from 57.5 so it looks as though the pipeline for output remains very strong given both readings are well above the break-even 50 level. The employment component moved higher to 53.5 from 52.0, which offers encouragement for the jobs story as well. As such, the manufacturing sector is clearly a source of strength right now and the report boosts the case for a Fed rate hike at the June 14 FOMC meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301fede4b0be3ed1921cdb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:14:26.981Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Meanwhile US construction spending recorded its biggest drop in a year in April.</strong></p> <p>With slowing investment in both public and private projects, spending fell by 1.4% compared to expectations of a 0.5% rise.</p> <p>But the March figure was revised up from an initial 0.2% decline to a rise of 1.1%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59301e1ae4b0bdd87e2f22b8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-01T14:08:36.491Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US manufacturing edges higher - ISM</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In fact the second manufacturing survey has confounded expectations by showing a slight rise rather than a slight dip.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm?SSO=1\">ISM manufacturing activity index </a>has increased from 54.8 in April to 54.9 last month, better than the 54.5 forecast by analysts.

However, rising cost pressures are still circling, not only from elevated import costs but also from the growing effect of domestic costs from sources such as energy and staffing which will all contribute to fuelling inflation.</p> <p>Although manufacturers have resisted passing on these costs to date, the expectation of price rises is becoming more apparent in the sector.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Chris Leyland, </strong>analyst at<strong> </strong>investment firm<strong> True Potential, </strong>says factory bosses face some pressures:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s figure is above 50, meaning expansion is still happening, it\u2019s just that the rate has slowed compared to last month. There are a number of reasons for that, mostly stemming from the weaker pound pushing up import cost for factories and therefore prices for the end consumer.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways parent company IAG, has praised BA bosses for \u201cdoing everything possible\u201d after the IT meltdown that left 75,000 passengers stranded over the bank holiday weekend. Walsh\u2019s comments came as British Airways\u2019 board is reportedly demanding an external inquiry into the fiasco that caused almost all the airline\u2019s flights out of London to be cancelled on Saturday and is expected to land BA with a compensation bill of more than \u00a3100m. Walsh told the BBC and reporters in Spain on Thursday that the investigation into the unexplained \u201cpower surge\u201d said to have caused the chaos would take time. But he insisted that BA\u2019s management, led by Spanish chief executive Alex Cruz, \u201cdid everything they could in the circumstances\u201d. The airline has been criticised for not promising full compensation to all those affected, but Walsh pledged: \u201cOur focus will be on making sure that any of our customers who experienced disruption are satisfied with how we handled things. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that they suffered.\u201d However, customers have been further angered by BA\u2019s online claim forms, which instructs them to first seek compensation via their travel insurance \u2013 leaving many liable to pay an excess. The Association of British Insurers has complained to the airline that it is giving misleading information and that BA should be the first point of call. What level of compensation the airline intends to provide will be of intense interest to customers still waiting for their bags to be returned \u2013 even though they were unable to fly. Paul Sutherland, 44, a gym owner and Ultimate Fighting Championship official from Gloucester, spent 12 hours stuck at Heathrow instead of flying to Sweden, missing a bout where he was due to be a judge. He said that after five days he had received no response to numerous calls to BA, but was texted by the airline on Thursday afternoon to say his bags \u2013 containing his work laptop and business documents \u2013 could be collected from Stockholm tomorrow. Sutherland said: \u201cI\u2019ve got travel insurance but it doesn\u2019t cover me for this. Who\u2019s going to cover the compensation for the loss of earnings? I\u2019ve lost thousands this week. And I\u2019ve still had no response from BA.\u201d British Airways refused to confirm BBC reports that the board would be looking for external experts to lead an inquiry. A spokeswoman said: \u201cAs we have already said, there will be an in-depth investigation into what happened.\u201d The airline is still struggling to get to the root of the problem. Walsh said that they knew what caused the systems crash, but they did not know why it had happened. He explained: \u201cIt was not an IT failure. It was a failure of electrical power to our IT systems. We understand what happened. We\u2019re investigating why it happened. \u201d BA\u2019s explanations have been met with scepticism and more questions over how such a power outage could affect the IT systems, with unions pointing to costcutting and outsourcing at the airline. Experts said that companies would usually expect to have a functioning uninterruptible power supply \u2013 the equivalent of a big battery to take over if mains power fails \u2013 and better disaster recovery. In its latest explanation, the airline said: \u201cThere was a loss of power to the UK data centre which was compounded by the uncontrolled return of power which caused a power surge taking out our IT systems. So we know what happened, we just need to find out why. National Grid and power suppliers in the area including SSE have stated that there was no power surge, suggesting there was an internal problem at its data centre, Boadicea House, near Heathrow. BA\u2019s creaking IT infrastructure includes over 500 data cabinets across six halls around its Waterside base, northwest of Heathrow. A contractor with knowledge of Boadicea House said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very old facility, there are lots and lots of problems with it. We weren\u2019t particularly surprised, knowing the set-up there.\u201d He added that a number of senior managers at the data centre have retired or left in the past three years. The GMB union has pointed to more than 200 redundancies made in the IT department under ferocious costcutting plans, which included bringing in staff from India on work visas. The airline group\u2019s head of IT, Bill Francis, told investors in 2015 that he would find savings of about \u20ac90m (\u00a378m) per year from outsourcing IT operations, which followed cuts in pay and conditions for BA\u2019s cabin crew. Francis has emailed staff with more detail on the investigation to date, which has found that an uninterruptible power supply to a core data centre at Heathrow was over-ridden. He said: \u201cThis resulted in the total immediate loss of power to the facility, bypassing the backup generators and batteries \u2026 After a few minutes of this shutdown of power, it was turned back on in an unplanned and uncontrolled fashion, which created physical damage to the system, and significantly exacerbated the problem.\u201d The carrier restarted long-haul flights on Sunday but was unable to resume a full schedule until Tuesday.",

      "body": "<p>Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways parent company IAG, has praised BA bosses for \u201cdoing everything possible\u201d after the IT meltdown that left 75,000 passengers stranded over the bank holiday weekend.</p> <p>Walsh\u2019s comments came as British Airways\u2019 board is reportedly demanding an external inquiry into the fiasco that caused almost all the airline\u2019s flights out of London to be cancelled on Saturday and is expected to land BA with a compensation bill of more than \u00a3100m.</p> <p>Walsh told the BBC and reporters in Spain on Thursday that the investigation into the unexplained \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/ba-it-shutdown-caused-by-uncontrolled-return-of-power-after-outage\">power surge</a>\u201d said to have caused the chaos would take time. But he insisted that BA\u2019s management, led by Spanish chief executive Alex Cruz, \u201cdid everything they could in the circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>The airline has been criticised for not promising full compensation to all those affected, but Walsh pledged: \u201cOur focus will be on making sure that any of our customers who experienced disruption are satisfied with how we handled things. Clearly we will do everything we can to make up for the disruption that they suffered.\u201d</p> <p>However, customers have been further angered by BA\u2019s online claim forms, which instructs them to first seek compensation via their travel insurance \u2013 leaving many liable to pay an excess. The Association of British Insurers has complained to the airline that it is giving misleading information and that BA should be the first point of call.</p> <p>What level of compensation the airline intends to provide will be of intense interest to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/30/passengers-still-without-bags-after-british-airways-it-meltdown\">customers still waiting for their bags to be returned</a> \u2013 even though they were unable to fly. </p> <p>Paul Sutherland, 44, a gym owner and Ultimate Fighting Championship official from Gloucester, spent 12 hours stuck at Heathrow instead of flying to Sweden, missing a bout where he was due to be a judge. He said that after five days he had received no response to numerous calls to BA, but was texted by the airline on Thursday afternoon to say his bags \u2013 containing his work laptop and business documents \u2013 could be collected from Stockholm tomorrow. </p> <p>Sutherland said: \u201cI\u2019ve got travel insurance but it doesn\u2019t cover me for this. Who\u2019s going to cover the compensation for the loss of earnings? I\u2019ve lost thousands this week. And I\u2019ve still had no response from BA.\u201d</p> <p>British Airways refused to confirm BBC reports that the board would be looking for external experts to lead an inquiry. A spokeswoman said: \u201cAs we have already said, there will be an in-depth investigation into what happened.\u201d</p> <p>The airline is still struggling to get to the root of the problem. Walsh said that they knew what caused the systems crash, but they did not know why it had happened. He explained: \u201cIt was not an IT failure. It was a failure of electrical power to our IT systems. We understand what happened. We\u2019re investigating why it happened. \u201d</p> <p>BA\u2019s explanations have been met with scepticism and more questions over how such a power outage could affect the IT systems, with unions pointing to costcutting and outsourcing at the airline.</p> <p> Experts said that companies would usually expect to have a functioning uninterruptible power supply \u2013 the equivalent of a big battery to take over if mains power fails \u2013 and better disaster recovery.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of steelworkers have been granted a 5% stake in British Steel after the Scunthorpe steelworks, one of only two left in Britain, returned to profit. British Steel was re-formed last June when investment firm Greybull bought Tata Steel\u2019s long products business, which is primarily the Scunthorpe steelworks, for \u00a31 and renamed it. The British Steel name disappeared in 1999 when it merged with a Dutch rival to become Corus. The company was later bought by Tata Steel. British Steel said its operations had made a profit of \u00a347m for the year to 31 March, compared with a \u00a379m loss in the previous financial year when it was still owned by Tata Steel. Roland Junck, executive chairman, said the turnaround had been \u201cremarkable\u201d. The company employs 4,800 people. Employees were asked to take a 3% pay cut when Greybull bought the business but this has now been reversed. The workers will also receive a 5% stake in the business. Tata Steel offloaded the Scunthorpe site as it battled to stop mounting losses in its UK operations. The Indian company still owns the steelworks at Port Talbot, home to the only other blast furnaces in Britain. British Steel has supplied all the rail for the Crossrail project in London. It also supplies high-strength wire rods for deepwater mooring and steel for construction projects such as the new stand at Liverpool\u2019s football stadium, Anfield. The company said it sold 2.5m tonnes of steel compared with 2.6m tonnes in the previous year. The profit of \u00a347m was measured by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Junck said: \u201cThe transformation in this business is remarkable and that is down to our remarkable people who have embraced, engineered and led change. They are the reason we can today reveal the best financial performance in the long products business since 2007 and they are the reason I have great optimism for the future of British Steel. \u201cIn 12 months we have started transforming from an inward-looking production hub into a profitable, more agile business by controlling costs, improving our product range and quality, and through strategic investments.\u201d Unite, the trade union, welcomed the financial results but warned that the steel industry remains under pressure and called the government\u2019s lack of support \u201creprehensible\u201d. Harish Patel, Unite national officer for steel, said: \u201cBritish Steel now needs to build on its initial success by properly investing in its skilled workforce. \u201cHowever despite the positive results there remain serious challenges. The problem of China dumping cheap steel into the European market is a key issue. The failure of the EU to take action to tackle this problem is very worrying. \u201cOn a local and national level the government\u2019s failure to support the steel industry and its lack of an effective industrial strategy is absolutely reprehensible. The government should be investing in British Steel\u2019s future by providing relief on business rates, while also providing financial incentives to encourage research and development.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Chateau Brexit? Average price of bottle of wine reaches record high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wine lovers are suffering a Brexit-related hangover as the price of the average bottle has soared since the referendum to hit an all-time high of \u00a35.56. Prices have risen more in the first three months of the year than in the past two years, according to the drinks industry, which is warning of more increases ahead. The average 75cl bottle topped \u00a35.50 for the first time towards the end of last year, and hit \u00a35.56 in the first quarter of 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA). Miles Beale, its chief executive, said: \u201cUnfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one-off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise.\u201d The main culprit is the weak pound. The slide in sterling prompted by the shock referendum result has driven up the cost of imported goods, which has made food, drink and other everyday items more expensive. The pound has lost 11% against the euro since the Brexit vote. Despite a burgeoning domestic wine-growing industry, which produces about 5m bottles a year, almost all the wine sold in the UK is imported. The WSTA said Brexit\u2019s impact had led to a 3% increase in wine prices in the 12 weeks to 25 March, which compares with a 1% increase over the previous two years \u2013 2015 to 2017. For example, Bordeaux chateau owner Gavin Quinney has increased the price of his 2015 Trois Hectares Blanc to \u00a311 from \u00a39.95 last December. For UK wine lovers there is worse to come. The 3.9% rise in alcohol duty announced by the chancellor in the spring budget, which took effect on 13 March, adds a further 8p to the average bottle if passed on in full by wine retailers. The WSTA had lobbied for a 2% cut in duty to help the industry. Experts predict wine prices will continue to go up as the triple whammy of Brexit, rising inflation and duty increases take their toll. Champagne drinkers face even bigger price increases. The WSTA predicted in February that the cost of an average-priced bottle of champagne would go up by 5% or \u00a31 per bottle, while a bottle of prosecco would increase by 9%, adding a further 59p a bottle. An alternative to imported wine is English and Welsh still and sparkling wine, which has gained increasing acclaim at home and abroad, although it tends to be more expensive. The small producers do not benefit from economies of scale such as those in other countries and have smaller yields because of the colder climate. The industry body said the UK had done its best to absorb rising import costs after the referendum, but it was only a matter of time before any cushioning against a weaker pound ran out and they were forced to pass on costs to consumers. Specialist wine retailer Naked Wines, owned by Majestic, upped the price of half of its wines by 5% last autumn, adding about 50p to some of its most popular wines, due to the weaker pound. Its chief executive, Rowan Gormley, told customers he would not \u201cstart a war with suppliers over price\u201d or compromise on quality to hit profit margins. Some larger retailers such as supermarkets have put pressure on their suppliers to absorb rising costs. The weak pound has proved a boon to some UK-based merchants of fine wines, who have enjoyed rising demand from dollar buyers in Asia and the US, according to industry title Decanter. The WSTA has urged the government to ensure that Brexit does not turn UK ports into a \u201clorry park\u201d with severe delays and gridlocks, which could prompt a resurgence of alcohol smugglers. Britain imports 1.8bn bottles of wine every year worth \u00a32.8bn, including 1bn bottles from the EU (55%). Beale said: \u201cWe all know that Brexit will be complicated, but something has got to give and government must start showing its support for the UK wine industry and the 275,000 jobs that our industry supports by tackling our excessive duty rates at the autumn budget.\u201d The sector employs 172,000 people directly, in wine shops, production, bottling and trade, and supports a further 105,000 in the supply chain. More than half (56%) of what Brits paid for a bottle of wine in March, before the latest duty rise came into effect, went on alcohol duty (\u00a32.16) and VAT (93p). Duty is even more for a bottle of sparkling wine, at \u00a32.77. By contrast, 14 countries in the EU have zero rates for wine. Only 21% of the price of a bottle of wine sold in France or Spain goes on tax, mainly VAT, and 19% in Germany. But this has not put Brits off drinking wine. The UK accounts for nearly 15% of the world\u2019s wine imports; it is the second-largest importer by volume (behind Germany) and by value (behind the US). It is the sixth-biggest market by consumption. Wine critic David Williams offers some suggestions for bottles that will not break the bank Wine Atlas Minervois, Languedoc, France 2015 (\u00a35.48, Asda) \u2013 The supermarket\u2019s Wine Atlas range does a pretty good job at a price point that\u2019s tough to meet without cutting quality corners. Favourites include the peachy Italian white Fiano, the tangy Spanish red Bobal (both \u00a34.98), and a spicy, brambly jammy shiraz/grenache/carignan red blend from the Languedoc. Marks &amp; Spencer Gers, IGP Gers, France 2016 (\u00a35.50) \u2013 The Gers in Gascon south-west France was traditionally Armagnac country. But Plaimont, the dominant grape-growing co-operative in the area, now concentrates on making some of the best value wines around.

The slide in sterling prompted by the shock referendum result has driven up the cost of imported goods, which has made food, drink and other everyday items more expensive. The pound has lost 11% against the euro since the Brexit vote. Despite a burgeoning domestic wine-growing industry, which produces about 5m bottles a year, almost all the wine sold in the UK is imported.</p> <p>The WSTA said Brexit\u2019s impact had led to a 3% increase in wine prices in the 12 weeks to 25 March, which compares with a 1% increase over the previous two years \u2013 2015 to 2017. </p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/02/wine-post-brexit-price-rises-how-to-find-bargains-fiona-beckett\">Bordeaux chateau owner Gavin Quinney has increased the price</a> of his <a href=\"http://www.bauduc.com/les-trois-hectares-blanc-2015/\">2015 Trois Hectares Blanc</a> to \u00a311 from \u00a39.95 last December.</p> <p>For UK wine lovers there is worse to come. The 3.9% rise in alcohol duty announced by the chancellor in the spring budget, which took effect on 13 March, adds a further 8p to the average bottle if passed on in full by wine retailers. The WSTA had lobbied for a 2% cut in duty to help the industry.</p> <p>Experts predict wine prices will continue to go up as the triple whammy of Brexit, rising inflation and duty increases take their toll. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2017-06-01T09:09:59/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Wine price rise graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2017-06-01T09:09:59/embed.html\">Wine price rise graph</a> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/brexit-wine-champagne-prosecco-more-expensive-uk-trade-body\">Champagne drinkers face even bigger price increases</a>. The WSTA predicted in February that the cost of an average-priced bottle of champagne would go up by 5% or \u00a31 per bottle, while a bottle of prosecco would increase by 9%, adding a further 59p a bottle.</p> <p>An alternative to imported wine is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/30/the-vineyard-virgins-giving-english-wine-a-sparkle\">English and Welsh still and sparkling wine</a>, which has gained increasing acclaim at home and abroad, although it tends to be more expensive. The small producers do not benefit from economies of scale such as those in other countries and have smaller yields because of the colder climate.</p> <p>The industry body said the UK had done its best to absorb rising import costs after the referendum, but it was only a matter of time before any cushioning against a weaker pound ran out and they were forced to pass on costs to consumers.</p> <p>Specialist wine retailer Naked Wines, owned by Majestic,<a href=\"https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2016/10/naked-wines-to-raise-wine-prices-by-5/\"> upped the price of half of its wines by 5% last autumn</a>, adding about 50p to some of its most popular wines, due to the weaker pound. Its chief executive, Rowan Gormley, told customers he would not \u201cstart a war with suppliers over price\u201d or compromise on quality to hit profit margins.</p> <p>Some larger retailers such as supermarkets have put pressure on their suppliers to absorb rising costs. The weak pound has proved a boon to some UK-based merchants of fine wines, who have enjoyed rising demand from dollar buyers in Asia and the US, according to industry title Decanter.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wsta.co.uk/press/836-uk-trade-will-be-stopped-dead-if-goods-have-to-be-declared\">The WSTA has urged the government to ensure that Brexit does not turn UK ports into a \u201clorry park\u201d</a> with severe delays and gridlocks, which could prompt a resurgence of alcohol smugglers. Britain imports 1.8bn bottles of wine every year worth \u00a32.8bn, including 1bn bottles from the EU (55%).</p> <p>Beale said: \u201cWe all know that Brexit will be complicated, but something has got to give and government must start showing its support for the UK wine industry and the 275,000 jobs that our industry supports by tackling our excessive duty rates at the autumn budget.\u201d</p> <p>The sector employs 172,000 people directly, in wine shops, production, bottling and trade, and supports a further 105,000 in the supply chain.</p> <p>More than half (56%) of what Brits paid for a bottle of wine in March, before the latest duty rise came into effect, went on alcohol duty (\u00a32.16) and VAT (93p). Duty is even more for a bottle of sparkling wine, at \u00a32.77. </p> <p>By contrast, 14 countries in the EU have zero rates for wine. Only 21% of the price of a bottle of wine sold in France or Spain goes on tax, mainly VAT, and 19% in Germany.</p> <p>But this has not put Brits off drinking wine. The UK accounts for nearly 15% of the world\u2019s wine imports; it is the second-largest importer by volume (behind Germany) and by value (behind the US). It is the sixth-biggest market by consumption.<br></p> <h2><strong>Wine critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/david-williams-on-wine\">David Williams</a> offers some suggestions for bottles that will not break the bank</strong></h2> <ul> <li>Wine Atlas Minervois, Languedoc, France 2015 (\u00a35.48, Asda) \u2013 The supermarket\u2019s Wine Atlas range does a pretty good job at a price point that\u2019s tough to meet without cutting quality corners.

      "bodyText": "House prices in Britain have fallen for the third month in a row, for the first time since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. The fall further dragged down the annual growth rate in May, to 2.1%, the lowest in nearly four years, providing further evidence that the housing market is losing steam, according to Nationwide, the UK\u2019s biggest building society. Its closely watched monthly house price index showed that the average price of a home fell by 0.2% between April and May, to \u00a3208,711. This compares with monthly declines of 0.4% in April and 0.3% in March. The annual growth rate of 2.1% is the lowest since June 2013, and compares with 2.6% in April. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cIt is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector, though data continues to send mixed signals in this regard.\u201d He noted real incomes were under pressure as inflation had overtaken wage growth, although the number in work continued to rise at a healthy pace and the unemployment rate hit a 42-year low in the three months to March. The UK\u2019s other main house price index, from mortgage lender Halifax, is also on a downward trend. It showed a 0.1% fall in April, taking the average property price to \u00a3219,649 \u2013 nearly \u00a33,000 below the peak in December 2016. Gardner dismissed suggestions the slowdown was linked to the general election on 8 June. \u201cIf history is any guide, the slowdown is unlikely to be linked to election-related uncertainty. Housing market trends have not traditionally been impacted around the time of general elections. Rightly or wrongly, for most homebuyers, elections are not foremost in their minds while buying or selling their home.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed. \u201cPrices have been unaffected by previous elections and, unlike in 2015, none of the major parties plans to increase property taxation.\u201d Gardner said it was too early to say whether the slowdown was a blip, a reflection of the squeeze on household budgets or due to mounting affordability pressures in key areas of the country. However, Nationwide believes house prices will slow further and household spending is likely to weaken along with the wider economy, as rising inflation further squeezes household budgets. The building society is predicting a small increase in house prices of around 2% this year, as the housing shortage will provide some support for prices. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: \u201cThe slowdown is anything but uniform. Properties in some regions are seeing double-digit price reductions, yet at certain price points in the most in-demand areas, gazumping and intense competition between buyers are the order of the day. \u201cIf there is one universal it is the chronic shortage of supply. Where there are more buyers than homes for sale, prices will inevitably edge upwards.\u201d",
