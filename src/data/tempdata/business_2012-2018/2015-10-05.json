      "bodyText": "Renewed calls for tougher gun control laws sent gun stocks surging on Monday as investors expected an increase in gun sales. The value of Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s shares went up by 7.29% and Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co increased by 2.75%. It was another good day for gun stock investors. Overall this year, the value of Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s shares has increased by more than 80% and that of Sturm, Ruger increased by more than 60% \u2013 making them some of the best-performing stocks of 2015. Monday\u2019s rally in gun stocks came hours after Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and the Democratic candidate for the president, unveiled a plan calling for tougher background checks at gun shows and online than those currently in place. \u201cWe need universal background checks,\u201d Clinton said at the New Hampshire town hall. \u201cWe know that they will work.\u201d Obama also renewed his calls for tougher gun control laws on Thursday, after a deadly shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. \u201cIt cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun,\u201d Obama said during a press conference after the shooting that left 10 dead, including the gunman. He went on to point out that the states with most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. \u201cSo the notion that gun laws don\u2019t work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens, and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence.\u201d In the years since Obama took office, gun makers have had some of their most profitable years. Last year, Smith &amp; Wesson sales hit a record high of $626m, up 6.7% from $587.5m in 2013. Sturm, Ruger sales reached their record high in 2013. According to an analysis by CNN Money, over the last five years Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger have gained 320%, outperforming Apple and four times the returns of the S&amp;P 500 stock market. Smith &amp; Wesson reported record sales of $626m in 2014 but sales slid to $531m in 2015. James Debney, president and CEO of Smith &amp; Wesson, said he expected the decline as the sales returned to \u201cas the consumer market for firearms returns to a more normal environment\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The White House began lobbying Democrats to take a fresh look at a controversial free trade agreement on Monday after concessions aimed at appeasing some critics on the left risked fracturing fragile support among Republicans. Despite narrowly securing congressional approval to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with 11 other countries, Barack Obama still has to persuade a majority of US lawmakers to pass the final deal, which aims to remove thousands of import tariffs. The White House warned it would take several months before a vote on TPP but said officials had already begun to contact members of Congress to persuade them the deal walked a sensible line between critics on the left and right. \u201cOur goal here is to talk about the benefits of the agreement,\u201d spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. \u201cThere are well-known differences of opinion on this and I don\u2019t anticipate we are going to persuade every member of Congress.\u201d Republicans reacted coolly to the announcement that international negotiations had concluded on Monday, particularly news that measures favouring tobacco and pharmaceutical industries had been left out of the agreed text, making negotiations more difficult for Obama. \u201cWhile the details are still emerging \u2026 I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short,\u201d said Orrin Hatch, chair of the finance committee, which is responsible for trade, in the Senate. \u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the US should not settle for a mediocre deal that fails to set high-standard trade rules in the Asia-Pacific region for years to come,\u201d he added. \u201cClosing a deal is an achievement for our nation only if it works for the American people and can pass Congress.\u201d The deal was also slammed by critics on the left, particularly presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who called it \u201cdisastrous\u201d despite the minor concessions on tobacco and pharmaceuticals. \u201cI am disappointed but not surprised by the decision to move forward on the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that will hurt consumers and cost American jobs,\u201d said the Vermont senator in a statement. \u201cWall Street and other big corporations have won again. It is time for the rest of us to stop letting multinational corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense.\u201d Pro-trade analysts in Washington remain hopeful that most Republicans will welcome the overall liberalising effect of the deal despite their misgivings about specific industries, but the analysts acknowledge there may not be enough Democratic party converts to offset lost support on the right. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of whack-a-mole,\u201d said Daniel Ikenson, director of trade policy studies at the Cato Institute. \u201cThe administration has been touting this as the most progressive trade agreement in history, but every time they do that, the Republicans start to peel off.\u201d A key determining factor in whether TPP does pass Congress is likely to be Hillary Clinton, who was supportive of the talks while secretary of state but has sounded more cool as a presidential candidate, particularly under pressure from Sanders. \u201cShe could make this a lot easier for Obama,\u201d said Ikenson, who said her support would provide cover for wavering Democrats worried about opposition from labor unions. But another complication could be the possible entry of Vice-President Joe Biden into the race. As a close ally of Obama, he will have to campaign for the deal. That could encourage Clinton to take a more sceptical view on trade as a way to differentiate herself from the status quo. Among Republicans, the protectionist rhetoric of frontrunner Donald Trump may also make it harder for those seeking re-election in Congress to appear too favourable to White House trade policy. Top House Republican Paul Ryan was one of many keeping his cards close to his chest on Monday. \u201cI am reserving judgment until I am able to review the final text and consult with my colleagues and my constituents,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIn particular, I want to explore concerns surrounding the most recent aspects of the agreement.\u201d The support of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, may also be jeopardised by the fact that the tobacco industry in his home state of Kentucky has been exempted from controversial rules giving multinationals more legal authority over national regulators. \u201cIn the months ahead, the Senate will review TPP and determine if it meets the high standards Congress and the American people have demanded,\u201d said McConnell. Many sceptics in Washington believe the combination of opposition from the left and right together with the politics of an election year could make it an uphill struggle for the administration. \u201cIts fate in Congress is highly uncertain given the narrow margin by which trade authority passed this summer, the concessions made to get a deal, and growing congressional and public concerns about the TPP\u2019s threats to jobs, wages, safe food and affordable medicines and more,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch.",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds share sale is grubby and indefensible", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Flogging a few Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public will be \u201cthe biggest privatisation for more than 20 years,\u201d boasted chancellor George Osborne , trying to generate a warm glow around the grubby business of offering a \u00a3200-a-head bung to private investors to own \u00a32,000-worth of stock for 12 months. In the grand scheme of state-sponsored inducements (think Hinkley Point), the 10% loyalty bonus on offer at Lloyds counts as small change. The potential giveaway is up to \u00a3200m if \u00a32bn-worth of stock is sold in small bundles. But the principle is indefensible. Why should some citizens \u2013 those with a grand or two in cash and an appetite for filling in forms \u2013 receive a discount at the expense of other taxpayers? Buyers won\u2019t necessarily show a profit, but the odds are tilted in their favour. It\u2019s not as if Osborne needs to round up demand to complete Lloyds\u2019 exit from the state\u2019s books. The \u201cdrip feed\u201d trading plan devised by the Treasury and investment bank Morgan Stanley 18 months ago continues to work splendidly. The state\u2019s stake has been reduced to 12% with the shares sold to institutions at close to the market price, maximising proceeds. The trading plan could finish the job by next summer. Osborne\u2019s thin justification for pitching the last parcel of Lloyds shares to private punters is that he wants to build a \u201cshareholding democracy.\u201d This is a woolly political ambition on which nobody will hold him to account. In the next breath, he says the proceeds from the sale will be used \u201cto pay down the national debt\u201d. That, at least, is clear. But, when the country owes \u00a31.5 trillion, the priority should be securing the highest price possible for the Lloyds shares, not messing about with discounts, loyalty bonuses and advertising campaigns. A supposedly careful chancellor is letting up to \u00a3200m slip between the cracks needlessly. Capita strays Capita, traditionally, is a company that doesn\u2019t do big deals and doesn\u2019t stray far from the UK. Such conservative instincts may help to explain why, unlike outsourcing rivals Serco and G4S in recent years, Capita has not capitulated to management over-reach or skulduggery with contracts. It\u2019s been a terrific performer for investors over the years. But what\u2019s this? Capita is in a race with Apollo Global Management, a US buyout firm, to pay \u00a3400m-plus for Xchanging, a back-office administrator for the insurance industry that operates in 13 countries. Xchanging\u2019s business sounds like much of Capita\u2019s \u2013 dull work for private sector clients. But attempting to buy quoted rivals of this size is not Capita\u2019s normal style. Until a German call-centre firm arrived earlier this year for \u00a3157m, the biggest purchase had been a \u00a3100m add-on a decade and a half ago. Capita is a bigger business these days, so maybe is obliged to learn new tricks, including more foreign adventures. Certainly its shareholders seem unworried. There is a promise of \u00a335m of cost savings and returns above the cost of capital from the off. The share price joined the market rally despite the possibility of a placing of new shares. So, yes, Xchanging may be sufficiently attractive for Capita to break its old and successful habits. All the same, shareholders will hope chief executive Andy Parker makes two things clear. First, that Xchanging\u2019s operations in the US and Australia will be sold to retain Capita\u2019s status as a UK-focused company with a few tentacles in continental Europe.

Reading China Glencore\u2019s share price may have risen 21% (or 72% if you prefer the whacky world of Hong Kong trading) but take with a pinch of salt chief executive Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s grumble at an FT conference about hedge funds playing games to push down commodity prices. Glasenberg is a trader and will know that markets do not always behave as theories say they should. Copper stocks may well be at low levels, suggesting the price is due a rebound, but predicting the timing is a mug\u2019s game. The art is to keep your borrowings at sensible levels to cope with all weathers, which Glencore has not. After the recent rollercoaster ride in Glencore\u2019s shares, there is no harm in the boss talking about distortions in the market and the underlying strength of demand from China. But, remember, Glasenberg also said this in August, before the crisis erupted: \u201cAt the moment none of us can read China. None of us know what is going on there and I\u2019m yet to find the guy who can predict China correctly.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Flogging a few Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public will be \u201cthe biggest privatisation for more than 20 years,\u201d boasted chancellor George Osborne , trying to generate a warm glow around the grubby business of offering a \u00a3200-a-head bung to private investors to own \u00a32,000-worth of stock for 12 months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/05/lloyds-bank-shares-to-be-offered-cut-price-to-the-public\">Lloyds shares to be offered cut-price to the public</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the grand scheme of state-sponsored inducements (think Hinkley Point), the 10% loyalty bonus on offer at Lloyds counts as small change. The potential giveaway is up to \u00a3200m if \u00a32bn-worth of stock is sold in small bundles.</p> <p>But the principle is indefensible. Why should some citizens \u2013 those with a grand or two in cash and an appetite for filling in forms \u2013 receive a discount at the expense of other taxpayers? Buyers won\u2019t necessarily show a profit, but the odds are tilted in their favour.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if Osborne needs to round up demand to complete Lloyds\u2019 exit from the state\u2019s books. The \u201cdrip feed\u201d trading plan devised by the Treasury and investment bank Morgan Stanley 18 months ago continues to work splendidly. The state\u2019s stake has been reduced to 12% with the shares sold to institutions at close to the market price, maximising proceeds. The trading plan could finish the job by next summer.</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s thin justification for pitching the last parcel of Lloyds shares to private punters is that he wants to build a \u201cshareholding democracy.\u201d This is a woolly political ambition on which nobody will hold him to account.</p> <p>In the next breath, he says the proceeds from the sale will be used \u201cto pay down the national debt\u201d. That, at least, is clear. But, when the country owes \u00a31.5 trillion, the priority should be securing the highest price possible for the Lloyds shares, not messing about with discounts, loyalty bonuses and advertising campaigns. A supposedly careful chancellor is letting up to \u00a3200m slip between the cracks needlessly.</p> <h2>Capita strays</h2> <p>Capita, traditionally, is a company that doesn\u2019t do big deals and doesn\u2019t stray far from the UK. Such conservative instincts may help to explain why, unlike outsourcing rivals Serco and G4S in recent years, Capita has not capitulated to management over-reach or skulduggery with contracts. It\u2019s been a terrific performer for investors over the years.</p> <p>But what\u2019s this? Capita is in a race with Apollo Global Management, a US buyout firm, to pay \u00a3400m-plus for Xchanging, a back-office administrator for the insurance industry that operates in 13 countries. </p> <p>Xchanging\u2019s business sounds like much of Capita\u2019s \u2013 dull work for private sector clients. But attempting to buy quoted rivals of this size is not Capita\u2019s normal style. Until a German call-centre firm arrived earlier this year for \u00a3157m, the biggest purchase had been a \u00a3100m add-on a decade and a half ago.</p> <p>Capita is a bigger business these days, so maybe is obliged to learn new tricks, including more foreign adventures. Certainly its shareholders seem unworried. There is a promise of \u00a335m of cost savings and returns above the cost of capital from the off. The share price joined the market rally despite the possibility of a placing of new shares.</p> <p>So, yes, Xchanging may be sufficiently attractive for Capita to break its old and successful habits. All the same, shareholders will hope chief executive Andy Parker makes two things clear. First, that Xchanging\u2019s operations in the US and Australia will be sold to retain Capita\u2019s status as a UK-focused company with a few tentacles in continental Europe. Second, that small add-on deals, coupled with contracts won under its own steam, will remain the first choice.</p> <h2>Reading China</h2> <p>Glencore\u2019s share price may have risen 21% (or 72% if you prefer the whacky world of Hong Kong trading) but take with a pinch of salt chief executive Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s grumble at an FT conference about hedge funds playing games to push down commodity prices.</p> <p>Glasenberg is a trader and will know that markets do not always behave as theories say they should.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Before it became embroiled in lurid boardroom scandals, American Apparel used to be cool. Not only did it add a stylish twist to seemingly plain t-shirts and jeans, but it championed human rights through slogans on its products and won friends by basing manufacturing in America, rather than the far east. The company built an empire of 260 shops in 19 countries around the world, including the UK. However, the fashion brand is now trying to make a fresh start after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. American Apparel has agreed a deal with its lenders whereby they will write off roughly $200m (\u00a3132m) of bonds in exchange for equity in the company, reducing its $300m debt to no more than $135m and cutting annual interest payments by $20m. The agreement will wipe out existing shareholders, including the controversial Dov Charney, who founded the company in 1989. Charney has been at the centre of the downhill spiral that American Apparel has found itself in since Deloitte quit as auditors in 2010 after raising doubts about the reliability of the retailer\u2019s accounts. The American Apparel founder has faced a string of law suits over sexual harassment allegations, which include claims that he used a former employee as a \u201csex slave\u201d, masturbated in front of a female journalist, and sent explicit text messages to staff. Charney was suspended as chief executive last summer by the company\u2019s board for \u201calleged misconduct and violations of company policy\u201d. After an investigation, a special committee then ruled last December that \u201cit would not be appropriate\u201d for American Apparel\u2019s founder to return. However, this has sparked a bitter legal battle between Charney and American Apparel. Charney has denied the claims and is suing the company for $20m for defamation, while the company took out a restraining order that prevented Charney from criticising it in public and attempting to overhaul the board. A key aspect of the Chapter 11 filing, which needs to approved by a court in Delaware, is that it will temporarily block the legal claims against American Apparel. Not only has the controversy surrounding Charney led to significant upheaval in the boardroom and a string of costly legal claims, but it has damaged the American Apparel brand. Sexually explicit adverts featuring young models do not connect well with the public when the boss of the company faces harassment allegations. At the same time, American Apparel has faced growing competition in the US from cut-price overseas competitors such as H&amp;M, who have effectively replicated the brand\u2019s fashion for a lower price. The company\u2019s sales are down by almost a fifth compared to a year ago and it has recorded a loss for ten consecutive quarters, which was unsustainable given its debts. The downfall of the brand is not just a pivotal moment for fashion, but a setback to the entire US industry. American Apparel is the country\u2019s biggest manufacturer of clothing and it is based in downtown Los Angeles. The company claims to pay experienced factory works more than $30,000 a year, compared with $600 a year for workers in Bangladesh factories. Paula Schneider, an industry veteran who was parachuted in earlier this year as the new chief executive of American Apparel, said: \u201cThis process will ultimately benefit our employees, suppliers, customers and valued partners. \u201cAmerican Apparel is not only an iconic clothing brand but also the largest apparel manufacturer in North America, and we are taking this step to keep jobs in the US, and preserve the ideals for which the company stands.\u201d Schneider said that American Apparel will re-emerge as a \u201cstronger, more vibrant company\u201d by strengthening its finances. However, industry analysts are not so sure. Neil Saunders, chief executive on retail consultancy Conlumino, said: \u201cBig questions remain around both brand and product. On the former, it is still not clear what American Apparel is trying to change to. \u201cWe know that the company is looking to be more ethical in its marketing, relying far less on the sexual overtones it has used in the past. However, as welcome as this may be, it does mean that a fresh viewpoint is needed in order to give the company a clear and cohesive brand image. \u201cThe search for a point of view and a handwriting for its ranges is also a crucial one, and is something that American Apparel needs to sort out as quickly as possible. \u201cThis is especially so with competition intensifying, with the expansion of players like Forever 21, H&amp;M and now, albeit on a smaller scale, Primark. Without a distinct identity, we fear American Apparel will simply remain lost in the murkiness of the teen apparel market. \u201cChapter 11 buys only time. Whether the company and its management use that time to solve the deep seated issues remain to be seen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An unprecedented international collaboration on tax reform, led by the G20 nations and targeting many of the world\u2019s largest global corporations, will wipe out much of the tax avoidance industry, according to top OECD officials. The two-year reform programme, under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was prompted by a spate of revelations in recent years about the tax affairs of multinationals including Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Alongside the final batch of reforms, published on Monday, the OECD released what it called \u201cextremely conservative\u201d estimates suggesting large global businesses were shifting profits and eroding the tax receipts of economies around the world at a cost of $100bn-$240bn (\u00a365bn-160bn) a year \u2013 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues. In the face of increasingly aggressive corporate tax avoidance, countries have been forced to rely more heavily on other taxing options where there is less scope for shifting income abroad \u2013 including taxes on workers\u2019 pay and and sales taxes such as VAT. \u201c[The reforms will help] move away from an era when tax planning had become part of core business models,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD\u2019s tax director who has led the two-year reform programme, backed by 60 countries representing more than 90% of the world\u2019s economy. \u201cValue creation [should be] the core business of industry. Tax planning should just be some supportive, marginal activity \u2026 The tax world will not be the same.\u201d The rule changes are mainly designed to be incorporated into thousands of bilateral tax treaties that form the arteries of global trade. Most of the treaties are based on a standard OECD template which has hardly been updated in almost a century. In the last 30 years, however, tax accountants have become adept at finding mismatches between tax rules in different countries, helping multinationals relocate valuable assets internationally to minimise their tax. The digital economy \u2013 in which companies can do business in countries while having little or no physical presence there \u2013 has added further opportunities. Saint-Amans said companies including Amazon and Starbucks were already changing their behaviour in anticipation of the tax reforms. However, share prices around the world have shown little discernible reaction to details of the OECD reforms as they have emerged over the last two years. Investors appear to harbour doubts that the new rules represent a grave threat to the profitability of some of the largest stock market listed companies. The reform programme has attracted criticism from some politicians, especially in the US, prompting fears some aspects may not come to fruition. Key Republican-dominated Senate committee leaders have made clear their staunch opposition to the reforms. \u201c[The OECD reform programme] is attempting to basically grab a tax base of our [US] domestic corporations,\u201d Paul Ryan, chair of the US tax-setting ways and means committee, said this summer. \u201cSo we want to make sure that our Treasury has a united front against that direction.\u201d In a carefully stage-managed dinner of G20 finance ministers in Lima, Peru, on Thursday 8 October, the OECD\u2019s final report is expected to receive a warm welcome, but there have already been many compromises. Several hoped-for rules have been downgraded to recommendations of best practice \u2013 with no pressure on nations to comply. These include rules designed to regulate the tax deductions groups can secure if they use internal interest payments to shift around profits as part of their tax planning. Here it will be up to countries such as Luxembourg whether or not to apply the OECD\u2019s recommendations. Proposals on how to tax multinationals diverting profits overseas, to what tax experts call \u201ccontrolled foreign companies\u201d (CFC), will also be optional. The UK, which has very generous CFC tax rules, is understood to have lobbied hard against a prescriptive standard in this area. Campaign group Tax Justice Network said: \u201cThis has been the first serious global effort to combat widespread corporate tax cheating \u2013 and that in itself has been a huge step forward.\u201d However, it added, big business and tax lobbyists had put a check on the achievements. \u201cMany of the proposals are weak, and will still provide multinational companies with opportunities to move profits away from the countries where those profits are generated, and in doing so reduce tax revenues,\u201d the network said. Christian Aid said some nations that host many of the world\u2019s largest businesses, including the UK and the US, had \u201cfought hard at recent international talks to ensure that the power to set international tax rules stayed with rich countries\u201d. Tove Maria Ryding, tax justice co-ordinator at the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad), said tax reforms were too complex and likely to fail. \u201c[They] will create an even bigger Eldorado for tax lawyers and multinational corporations who want to circumvent the tax rules,\u201d she said. One of the biggest changes for multinationals will see them required to privately disclose to all tax offices an overview of country-by-country performance, including revenue, profits and employee numbers. \u201cI think it\u2019s already having a significant influence on businesses, which are already revising their tax planning,\u201d said Saint-Amans. Mike Devereux, a professor of business taxation at the Oxford University centre for business taxation, predicted the OECD\u2019s efforts would fail to hold back the tide of tax competition between countries as they strained to outdo one another in the race to attract inward investment. \u201cThe [continuing international tax] system invites governments to destabilise it by competing with each other for economic activity, tax revenue and possibly to try to advantage their own domestic companies,\u201d he said. \u201cFor at least 30 years this has led to gradual reductions in effective rates of taxation of profit \u2026 [This flaw] will continue to afflict the international tax system.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Spain Dijsselbloem said it was up to the Spanish government to act on the opinion it had been given about the country\u2019s budget, and to decide whether additional measures needed to be taken. The Eurogroup would take stock of the situation at an additional meeting about draft budgetary plans on 23 November. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Dijsselbloem sounded positive when asked whether the Greek plans could be agreed in such a short space of time: Meanwhile in Athens the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just begun unveiling his government\u2019s policy programme before parliament, reports Helena Smith. \u2018\u2019We all know that this road will not be easy,\u201d the leftist leader has told MPs saying the government will have to \u201cclench its teeth\u201d as it starts its new four-year mandate. The Eurogroup has welcomed Greece\u2019s commitment to its bailout programme, said the group\u2019s president Jeroen Dijsselbloem after the day\u2019s meeting ended. He say the most important thing was to conclude the first review as soon as possible. The first set of milestones had been agreed, and would have to be completed by the middle of October to unlock the next \u20ac2bn payment of the remaining \u20ac3bn. The next set of milestones will have to be worked on \u201cwith great urgency\u201d and agreed by the end of October. At the same time the ECB is assessing the Greek banks and recapitalisation will have to take place over November and December. Meanwhile on Spain, commissioner Pierre Moscovici says a warning will be issued tomorrow: Hopes that central banks will continue to support the global economy have sent stock markets soaring. The impetus seems to be the poor US jobs figures from Friday, which has convinced investors - for the moment - that the US Federal Reserve is now unlikely to raise interest rates this year. Weaker than expected US service sector data earlier has just added fuel to this particular fire. The optimism was helped by a revival in commodity prices, with vague talk of more Chinese central bank stimulus on the way, which has supported the mining sector. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: Commodity stocks are back in fashion as rumours of a Chinese stimulus package are doing the rounds. The mining industry has been battered and bruised recently, but the possibility of an easing policy from China has seen the buyers flood back in again. The last few times China tried to encourage economic activity by announcing a stimulus scheme it has backfired, and sent commodity related stocks crashing, but now there is the feeling that something drastic is needed. A rise in oil prices on hopes that producers might address the oversupply issues pushed energy companies higher. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 168.94 points or 2.76%, with Glencore climbing 21% on reports of possible takeovers or disposals Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 2.74% to 9814.79 France\u2019s Cac climbed 3.54% to 4616.90 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.73% to 21,980.08 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 3.83% higher at 9971.3 In Greece the Athens market added 4.07% to 667.09 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 213 points or 1.3% higher. The Eurogroup discussion on Greece was apparently fairly brief: Here\u2019s more about what\u2019s expected from Alexis Tsipras when he speaks to parliament later. Helena Smith reports: The leftist leader will open a three-day debate on his new government\u2019s policy plans arguing the corrosive effects of austerity will be softened by the implementation of a \u201cparallel program\u201d of social benefits. Tsipras, who was given a second chance when Greeks elected to renew his term in office with a second electoral victory in September, will be alone in addressing the 300-seat House tonight. Acutely aware of the damaging effect of successive rounds of punitive belt-tightening measures, the 41-year-old premier will emphazise the policies his two-party coalition will take to ameliorate the blow of yet more measures in the coming months. Tsipras has frequently said that while he has been forced to compromise with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat, he has not \u201cbeen compromised. Speaking to his Syriza party MPs this weekend, he insisted the leftists will differentiate themselves from previous governments by tending to the vulnerable. Athens University professor of law and economics Aristides Hatzis told us: \u201cTsipras is the only leader who could enforce such measures. He is a leftwing leader being asked to implement neo-liberal policies that no right-wing government could enforce.\u201d The three-day parliamentary debate will end with a midnight vote of confidence on Wednesday. As the Eurogroup meets in Luxembourg, Greece\u2019s creditors expressed hope the country could deliver on the pledges it made in return for a further bailout. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is submitting the country\u2019s budget to parliament this week, outlining the reforms needed under the country\u2019s three year \u20ac86bn bailout, and, as Associated Press reports, eurozone finance ministers arriving in Luxembourg seemed relatively upbeat about the prospects for agreement: Pierre Moscovici, the European Commission\u2019s top economy official, said he was encouraged by Tsipras\u2019 recent pledges that his government will meet its promises. \u201cI am confident there is a common will to avoid a new drama, a new tragedy with Greece, but at the same time we must also be vigilant,\u201d Moscovici said arriving for the meeting in Luxembourg. \u201cThere is a positive dynamic in relations between the eurozone and Greece.\u201d ....Finance ministers did not appear to be in a critical mood as they arrived for Monday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThere are one or two points which are delayed by the elections,\u201d said Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling. \u201cI believe Greece at the moment is on track, as far as the implementation goes.\u201d And Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister who suggested earlier this year that Greece should be given a temporary opt-out from the euro currency, appeared conciliatory on his arrival at Monday\u2019s meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a little early to talk about delays. Rather, we will naturally await the first report and then we\u2019ll see,\u201d Schaeuble said. BP will pay $4.9bn to settle claims from US states relating to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to court papers seen by Reuters. As a condition of the settlement, the US states involved have agreed not to sue BP. The company said in July it would pay up to $18.7bn in state and federal penalties, and more details are due later. Dennis de Jong, managing director at broker UFX.com said: With inconclusive economic data in recent weeks, the Fed is now split on the timing of an interest rate rise. That situation is unlikely to change in response to today\u2019s non-manufacturing figures, which aren\u2019t strong enough to sway Janet Yellen and Co towards a clear decision. A decline on last month puts a dampener on what is actually quite a robust set of numbers. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, however, as Yellen\u2019s reluctance to act may be seen as a positive move elsewhere. Wall Street, which has been quiet as it awaits consistency among the financial uncertainty, may now be prompted into increased activity before the end of 2016. Confirmation that the US services sector saw slowing growth in September comes from the Institute for Supply Management. The ISM services index fell to 56.9 from 59 in August, and lower than analysts\u2019 expectations of a reading of 57.5p. Both new orders and business activity slowed. But the employment component showed an increase: And shortly we will get the ISM indices... America\u2019s service sector is growing by less than expected, according to the first of two rival surveys. Markit\u2019s final purchasing managers index for the sector came in at 55.1 for September, down from an early reading of 55.6, which was also what analysts had been expecting for the final figure. That compares to 56.1 in August. Markit\u2019s final composite reading is 55 compared to 55.7 in August. Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said: The US economic growth slowed in the third quarter according the PMI surveys, down to around 2.2%. But this largely represents a payback after growth rebounded in the second quarter, suggesting that the economy is settling down to a moderate rate of growth in line with its long term average. Hiring also remains relatively robust, albeit down from earlier in the year, again suggesting that the economy has shifted down a gear but remains in good health. \u201cAt the moment it remains unclear as to whether growth will weaken further as wemove into the fourth quarter. However, with inflationary pressures waning, policymakers may have some breathing space to gauge the extent of any slowdown. Lower fuel costs helped push average prices charged for goods and services dropping at steepest rate for nearly five years. In tandem with other global markets, Wall Street is moving ahead strongly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 164 points or 12%, while the S&amp;P 500 has opened 0.5% higher. Markets are being driven by hopes that central banks will not pull the plug on financial support in the immediate future. Friday\u2019s poor US jobs numbers have convinced investors that the prospect of a Federal Reserve rate rise this year is looking less and less likely. Another factor supporting the market is a rising oil price, which is boosting energy shares. Brent crude is up 2% after reports that Russia wants to meet other producers to discuss the market, where oversupply and falling demand have sent oil prices sharply lower. That could, believe some, presage production cuts. Meanwhile Friday also saw a fall in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US. China can manage its economic slowdown but needs to communicate policy more effectively, says the International Monetary Fund. Ahead of its annual meeting the IMF said China\u2019s exchange rate was in line with medium term fundamentals after the recent devaluations, Reuters reports. Global corporations are avoiding tax to the tune of up to $240bn a year, according to a new report from the OECD, which has also announced reform measures to tackle the problem. Simon Bowers reports: An unprecedented international collaboration on tax reform, led by the G20 nations and targeting many of the world\u2019s largest global corporations, will wipe out much of the tax avoidance industry, it was claimed today. The two-year reform programme, under the auspices of the OECD, was prompted by a spate of revelations in recent years about the tax affairs of multinationals including Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Alongside the final batch of reforms, published today, the OECD released what it called \u201cextremely conservative\u201d estimates suggesting large global businesses were shifting profits and eroding the tax receipts of economies around the world at a cost of $100bn (\u00a365bn) to $240bn a year \u2014 equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporation tax revenues. In the face of increasingly aggressive tax avoidance, countries have been forced to rely more heavily on taxing income less able to be shifted abroad \u2014 such as workers\u2019 pay and VAT. \u201c[The reforms will help] move away from an era when tax planning had become part of core business models,\u201d said Pascal Saint-Amans, who has led the two-year OECD reform programme, backed by 60 countries representing more than 90% of the world\u2019s economy. \u201cValue creation [should be] the core business of industry. Tax planning should just be some supportive, marginal activity\u2026 The tax world will not be the same.\u201d Read more here: A quick recap: Britain\u2019s recovery slowed last month, according to the latest survey of its dominant service sector. Companies reported that activity grew at the slowest pace in two and a half years. Economists blame fears over China\u2019s economy, and predict that GDP could grow by just 0.4% in the last three month of this year. Expansion across the eurozone also eased back in September, data firm Markit reports. Firms in Germany, Spain and Ireland all said growth was slower, although France\u2019s bucked the trend. European stock markets are up. Shares are being driven by hopes that central banks will continue to stimulate the global economy, and resist early interest rate rises. The FTSE 100 is now at its highest point of the day, up 132 points at 6262. The French CAC has soared by over 3%. Two dozen Pacific-Rim countries are celebrating the creation of a major new trade partnership. Workers have stormed the boardroom of Air France today, as the airline announced plans to cut 2,900 jobs. Two senior executives were forced to flee with ripped shirts. The Greek government is preparing its new budget. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government must explain how it will implement tough tax rises and spending cuts demanded by lenders. Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos is meeting fellow eurozone finance ministers in Brussels today. They\u2019ll discuss the various prior actions Greece must deliver to receive its next aid tranche, and to open talks on debt relief. And in the UK, chancellor George Osborne has confirmed that he\u2019s selling off shares in Lloyds Banking Group to the public at a chunky discount. European commissioner Pierre Moscovici tweets from Brussels: The Trans-Pacific Partnership deal is \u201ca huge strategic and political win for US President Barack Obama and Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe,\u201d says the FT\u2019s Shawn Donnan. He writes: It represents the economic backbone of the Obama administration\u2019s strategic \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia and a response to the rise of the US\u2019s chief rival, China, and its growing regional and global influence. It is also a key component of the \u201cthird arrow\u201d of economic reforms that Mr Abe has been pursuing in Japan since taking office in 2012. Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s take (\u00a3): Negotiators strike Pacific trade deal Over in Atlanta, a dozen Pacific Rim nations have reached the most sweeping trade liberalization pact in a generation. After late hitches over drugs monopolies, and New Zealand\u2019s dairy market, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has been hammered out. It is meant to lower trader barriers in the region, and set common standards in around 40% of the world economy. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: The TPP aims to lower trade tariffs between the signatory nations and bring in wide-ranging new regulations for investment, agriculture, intellectual property, labour and the environment. This in turn could mean cheaper food, medicine and everyday household goods for millions of people. It will also help the 12 countries to counter China\u2019s rising economic influence in the region. More here: The Brussels press pack are assembling for today\u2019s meeting of finance ministers, where Greece\u2019s new bailout package will be discussed. But it\u2019s not as exciting as the eurogroup meetings we enjoyed (or was it endured?) this summer, so there\u2019s more space outside: The Greek parliament is back in full force today with prime minister Alexis Tsipras outlining his newly elected government\u2019s policy programme as the draft 2015 budget is also submitted. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens After a week of diplomacy abroad, the Greek prime minister must now face the music of applying what will be the most onerous financial rescue programme to date. It will not be easy. From months of often fraught negotiations just getting to the point of reaching agreement over the bailout deal, the debate has shifted from the abstract to the real with Greeks now being bombarded with news of what the latest accord will entail. The draft budget is expected to outline an array of hard hitting levies, including the much-hated property tax known as Enfia, as well as pension cuts and structural reforms \u2013 the price of being bailed out for a third time to the tune of \u20ac86bn. The measures will throw the debt-stricken economy into recession with the budget forecasting a return to growth in 2017 (for many a conservative estimate). The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, who is on his way to Luxembourg, will outline the savings and government priorities when he meets euro area counterparts attending tonight\u2019s Euro Group. One insider tells us: \u201cHe will present the prior actions lenders are demanding at the meeting,\u201d \u201cThese are the first package of measures we have agreed to apply [in exchange] for loans.\u201d The measures, which are expected to include deep cuts to monthly pensions over \u20ac1,000, have to be implemented in the coming weeks \u2013 before more than 60 others are enforced in November for international creditors to begin a review of the Greek economy. All of which is going to require nifty explanation when Tsipras (whose radical left Syriza party was first catapulted into office vowing to \u201ccancel\u201d such measures) takes to the podium to present the policies of his second term in office at 7:30pm this evening. Unions and leftists are already girding for battle. \u201cWe are organising the response of popular workers to the new wave of attack,\u201d the communist Pame announced this morning, calling on Greeks to participate in a mass rally on October 22 and a strike on November 12. Air France-KLM has criticised those responsible for today\u2019s violence, and insisted that most staff were protesting peacefully before a group burst into its boardroom. A spokesman said: \u201cThis violence was carried out by particularly violent, isolated individuals, whereas the protest by striking personnel was taking place calmly up until then.\u201d Associated Press has more details on the Air France protests this morning: Union activists protesting proposed layoffs at Air France stormed the headquarters during a meeting, zeroing in on two managers who had their shirts torn from their bodies, scaled a fence and fled under police protection. An Associated Press photographer saw about a hundred activists rush the building. The managers who fled included the head of human resources. Alexandre de Juniac, the CEO of Air France-KLM, announced Friday the company would have to cut jobs after failing to reach an agreement with pilots. French media reported a proposal to slash 2,900 jobs. De Juniac said the company was being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Monday\u2019s meeting was intended to detail the cuts, which he told Europe 1 radio would be \u201csignificant.\u201d Fortunately, Xavier Broseta and Pierre Plissonnier did manage to escape the demonstrators, sans chemises. Over in Paris, two Air France executives appear to have had their shirts ripped from their backs after the airline announced plans to cut up to 2,900 jobs. According to local media reports, several hundred workers stormed the airline\u2019s headquarters this morning, after it announced the cutbacks. Photos from the scene show Pierre Plissonnier, Air France\u2019s assistant director for long-haul flights, leaving the scene in a disheveled state. Human resources boss Xavier Broseta is pictured trying to climb a fence to flee. It\u2019s not clear exactly what happened. But the AFP newswire reports that CEO Frederic Gagey \u201cmade a hasty exit, according to two members of the committee\u201d, after workers broke into the meeting. Unions have also called a strike to protest at the job cuts, which were announced after pilots turned down a proposal to work 100 more hours per year for the same salary. It could see 300 pilots, 700 air hostesses and stewards, and 1,900 ground staff laid off by 2017. Le Figaro reports that Air France is planning to file a complaint of \u201caggravated violence\u201d. More here. European stock markets aren\u2019t panicking at today\u2019s service sector slowdown. Instead, they continue to rally \u2013\u2013 catching up with Wall Street\u2019s late jump on Friday night. France\u2019s CAC index is the best performer, following the news that its services firms actually caught up (a little) with the rest of the eurozone last month. But other markets are also gaining ground, with the FTSE 100 jumping over around 2%, despite warnings that the economy may be slowing down. So what\u2019s going on? Well, investors do seem confident that the US Federal Reserve won\u2019t raise rates this month, and probably not before 2016. That\u2019s bullish for shares, and also weakens the US dollar -- which has a positive effect on commodity prices and oil. And that\u2019s why mining shares are up today, while Royal Dutch Shell has gained 4%. Jasper Lawler of CMC says: UK and European markets were higher across the board on Monday, playing catch-up from the biggest turnaround on the Dow Jones Industrial Average in four years on Friday. The French CAC was higher by over 2.5% supported by positive French service sector data. Missed expectations for Germany\u2019s service sector took the edge off gains on the DAX, which was still higher by over 1.5%. A new survey of Britain\u2019s top finance chiefs confirms that the UK economy may be weakening. Our Katie Allen reports this morning: China\u2019s downturn, the prospect of rising interest rates and uncertainty about the global economic outlook have knocked confidence among bosses of the UK\u2019s biggest companies, according to a survey. Chief financial officers (CFOs) polled by the consultancy Deloitte reported a sharp rise in uncertainty facing their businesses and have scaled back their expectations for investment and hiring over the coming year. Almost three-quarters of the 122 CFOs, or 73%, said the level of financial and economic uncertainty was either above normal, high or very high. That was up from 55% in the second quarter of this year and is the highest proportion for more than two years. More here: Economist Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, fears UK economic growth could stumble in the last quarter of 2015: The slowdown across Britain\u2019s service sector is putting the recovery at risk, says David Noble CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He blames the knock-on effect of China, which sparked global market panic in August after Beijing devalued the yuan. Noble says: The further softening of growth in the services sector must now be causing some concern for the sustainability of the recent recovery in the UK economy.... It appears that when China sneezes, the world catches a cold as some companies cited the region as a cause for worldwide concern. Some instant reaction to the slowdown in Britain\u2019s services sector: Britain\u2019s service sector suffered a sharp slowdown last month, new data shows, raising fears that the economy may be faltering. Data firm Markit reports that activity across the sector grew at its slowest rate since April 2013 in September. Its service PMI fell to 53.3, from August\u2019s 55.6 (where 50=stagnation). Firms reported that new business slowed, with some clients unwilling to place new contracts in the current \u201cglobal economic uncertainty\u201d. More encouragingly, firms did keep hiring staff, but business investment is also under pressure. And with Germany, Ireland and Spain\u2019s service sectors also slowing (see last post), signs are building that the European economy may be faltering. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson fears that \u201cthe economy sank further into a soft patch at the end of the third quarter\u201d, and is only growing at 0.3% per quarter. Services makes up around three-quarter of the UK economy, so any slowdown has serious consequences. Williamson says: \u201cWeakness is spreading from the struggling manufacturing sector, hitting transport and other industrial-related services in particular. There are also signs that consumers have become more cautious and are pulling back on their leisure spending, such as on restaurants and hotels.\u201d Growth across Europe\u2019s private sector is slowing, according to the latest healthcheck of the region\u2019s service sector. Markit\u2019s Eurozone PMI, which measures activity at thousands of companies, dipped to a four-month low of 53.6 in September, down from 54.3 in August. That shows the sector kept growing, but at a slower rate. Growth in the service sector hit a seven-month low, with the Services PMI dropping to 53.7 from 54.0. Growth in Spain hit its lowest level since January, although France - usually a laggard in these surveys - clawed back some ground: Here\u2019s the detail: Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, reckons that the slowdown could raise the chances of fresh stimulus measures from the European Central Bank: \u201cThe final PMI reading came in slightly below the earlier flash estimate but still leaves a signal of the eurozone economy having expanded 0.4% in the third quarter. \u201cHowever, the failure of the economy to pick up speed over the summer will be a disappointment to the ECB, especially with job creation sliding to an eight-month low. \u201cThe weakening of the pace of expansion in September raises the risk of growth fading further in the fourth quarter, which would in turn boost the likelihood of the ECB opening the QE taps further. Mining stocks are packing the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard: That shows optimism that central banks will do more to stimulate the global economy, now that the US labor market appears to be weakening. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: Consensus is building that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t now be in a position to hike interest rates before the end of the year. This gives emerging markets a little more breathing room and it\u2019s the mining stocks that are forging their way to the top of the table. Shares are rallying across Europe this morning, fuelled by hopes that central banks keep topping up the punchbowl for longer. France\u2019s CAC index is the biggest riser, up nearly 2%, and Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 1.3%. The FTSE 100 is close behind, up almost 100 points, as traders shake off their disappointment over Saturday night\u2019s rugby. Investors have had a weekend to ponder Friday\u2019s disappointing US jobs report, and concluded that a weak labor market means the Federal Reserve will resist raising interest rates in 2015. And that\u2019s encouraging them back into the market. Kim Young-jun, a stock analyst at SK Securities in Seoul, explains (via Reuters) \u201cRisk aversion weakened today as the weak U.S. employment data supported expectations that the Fed would put off the timing of rate hikes.\u201d Glencore\u2019s shares have rallied by 8% in early trading in London, fuelled by that takeover talk and speculation that it could sell its agricultural business. They\u2019re up 7.8p at 108.6p, having briefly jumped 20% to 114.45p. That\u2019s quite a recovery, given they slumped to 66p last week. However, it\u2019s a weaker rally than in Asia, though, where they spiked 70% at one stage today. Glencore has just issued a statement to the City, saying it is: ...the Board confirms that it is not aware of any reasons for these price and volume movements or of any information which must be announced to avoid a false market in the Company\u2019s securities or of any inside information that needs to be disclosed... That could dampen some of the chatter that a big deal is close..... Seven long years after bailing out Lloyds Banking Group, the UK government is finally selling some of its remaining stake to the public. The Treasury has announced plans to sell \u00a32bn of Lloyds shares in a retail offering. Anyone taking part will get a 5% discount, plus a bonus shares for every 10 they hold for at least a year. The value of the bonus share incentive will be capped at \u00a3200 per investor. People applying for investments of less than \u00a31,000 will be prioritised. The move brings a bit of Thatcherite glamour (?!) to the Conservative Party conference, where delegates fondly remember the \u201cTell Sid\u201d privatisation fetish drive of the 1980s. But as the Economist\u2019s Stan Pignal points out, discounted share sales benefit some rather more than others.... Reports that Glencore is in talks to sell its entire agriculture business are helping to drive its shares higher. That would provide fresh resources to tackle its $30bn debt mountain, and to handle a further drop in commodity prices. Something is going on at Glencore, the troubled commodity trading and mining company. Shares in Glencore leapt by over 70% in Hong Kong overnight, and are currently up over 30%. This comes after the Daily Telegraph reported that Ivan Glencore is prepared to listen to takeover offers for the company he has created, following the recent slump in its value. Their commodity editor Andrew Critchlow wrote: Glencore would listen to offers for a takeover of the entire company but its management does not believe there are any buyers willing to pay a fair value for the business in the current market. That report appears to have sparked a wave of buying into Glencore, whose shares have lost around three-quarters of their value in the last year. Glencore itself, though, says it\u2019s \u201cunaware\u201d of the reason behind the surge, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Jonathan Ferro. Big news breaking in the retail sector -- American Apparel, supplier of ethical clothing and god-awful adverts, has filed for bankruptcy protection. The move follows a steady slide in sales, and ever-more disturbing antics by ex-chairman Dov Charney, who was forced out a year ago. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. A new week begins with investors digesting still last Friday\u2019s disappointing US jobs data. September\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll was a bit of a shocker, with just 142,000 new jobs created, and wages unchanged month-on-month. That suggests America\u2019s economy is being hit by the slowdown in emerging markets such as China, raising fears that a new downturn is looming. And that has actually pushed shares higher in Asia this morning on speculation that monetary policy is going to stay loose for even longer. Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 1.6%, while the Indian market is up around 1.5%: We\u2019ll get a fresh insight into the health of the global economy today, when new surveys of the world service sector are released. Those Purchasing Managers Surveys will show if growth speeded up or slowed down; we get the eurozone report at 9am BST and the UK at 9.30am BST. And over in Greece, Alexis Tsipras\u2019s new government will be presenting its new budget, ahead of a vote on Wednesday. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The impetus seems to be the poor US jobs figures from Friday, which has convinced investors - for the moment - that the US Federal Reserve is now unlikely to raise interest rates this year. Weaker than expected US service sector data earlier has just added fuel to this particular fire. </p> <p>The optimism was helped by a revival in commodity prices, with vague talk of more Chinese central bank stimulus on the way, which has supported the mining sector. David Madden, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Commodity stocks are back in fashion as rumours of a Chinese stimulus package are doing the rounds. The mining industry has been battered and bruised recently, but the possibility of an easing policy from China has seen the buyers flood back in again. The last few times China tried to encourage economic activity by announcing a stimulus scheme it has backfired, and sent commodity related stocks crashing, but now there is the feeling that something drastic is needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>A rise in oil prices on hopes that producers might address the oversupply issues pushed energy companies higher.

Tsipras, who was given a second chance when Greeks elected to renew his term in office with a second electoral victory in September, will be alone in addressing the 300-seat House tonight.</p> <p>Acutely aware of the damaging effect of successive rounds of punitive belt-tightening measures, the 41-year-old premier will emphazise the policies his two-party coalition will take to ameliorate the blow of yet more measures in the coming months. Tsipras has frequently said that while he has been forced to compromise with creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat, he has not \u201cbeen compromised.</p> <p>Speaking to his Syriza party MPs this weekend, he insisted the leftists will differentiate themselves from previous governments by tending to the vulnerable. Athens University professor of law and economics Aristides Hatzis told us: \u201cTsipras is the only leader who could enforce such measures. He is a leftwing leader being asked to implement neo-liberal policies that no right-wing government could enforce.\u201d </p> <p>The three-day parliamentary debate will end with a midnight vote of confidence on Wednesday. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd8c5a0fe47dd158d5d2f6070e47b9011c8252e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bd8c5a0fe47dd158d5d2f6070e47b9011c8252e/0_114_4194_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tsipras is set to unveil his budget later.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tsipras is set to unveil his budget later.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Koutsokostas/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-05T15:13:16.400Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56128dbfe4b04d4f86f72df1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-05T14:56:39.133Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As the Eurogroup meets in Luxembourg, Greece\u2019s creditors expressed hope the country could deliver on the pledges it made in return for a further bailout.</strong></p> <p>Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras i<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/oct/05/glencore-shares-surge-lloyds-retail-sale-stock-market-live#block-561263bae4b0380f181ef8c5\"><strong>s submitting the country\u2019s budget to parliament this week,</strong></a> outlining the reforms needed under the country\u2019s three year \u20ac86bn bailout, and, as Associated Press reports, eurozone finance ministers arriving in Luxembourg seemed relatively upbeat about the prospects for agreement:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pierre Moscovici, the European Commission\u2019s top economy official, said he was encouraged by Tsipras\u2019 recent pledges that his government will meet its promises.</p> <p>\u201cI am confident there is a common will to avoid a new drama, a new tragedy with Greece, but at the same time we must also be vigilant,\u201d Moscovici said arriving for the meeting in Luxembourg. \u201cThere is a positive dynamic in relations between the eurozone and Greece.\u201d</p> <p>....Finance ministers did not appear to be in a critical mood as they arrived for Monday\u2019s meeting.</p> <p>\u201cThere are one or two points which are delayed by the elections,\u201d said Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling. \u201cI believe Greece at the moment is on track, as far as the implementation goes.\u201d</p> <p>And Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister who suggested earlier this year that Greece should be given a temporary opt-out from the euro currency, appeared conciliatory on his arrival at Monday\u2019s meeting.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early to talk about delays.

      "bodyText": "Cut-price shares in Lloyds Banking Group are to be sold to the public next year in a move that will complete the sale of the taxpayer\u2019s stake in the bailed-out institution but risk exposing the government to a loss on the stock offering. About \u00a32bn shares \u2013 half the amount first signalled by prime minister David Cameron in April \u2013 are to be sold directly to retail investors, who could begin registering their interest on a government website launched on Monday. The sell-off was described by George Osborne, at the Conservative party conference, as the \u201cbiggest privatisation for 20 years\u201d and was announced even as City analysts warned Lloyds faced a further bill of at least \u00a31.5bn for mis-selling of payment protection insurance. While the public is already able to buy Lloyds shares on the stock market, the Treasury plans to sell the \u00a32bn stake at a discount of 5%. Investors who hold their shares for a year will be given a bonus share for every 10 held, with the bonus capped at \u00a3200 per investor. People applying for less than \u00a31,000 worth of shares will be given priority. A massive advertising campaign - hoping to repeat the success of the \u201ctell Sid\u201d British Gas advertising campaign almost 30 years ago - is promised. The chancellor said the proceeds would be used to pay down the national debt. Announcing the retail offering, which featured during the general election campaign, the Treasury said it expected Lloyds to be returned to private ownership next year. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s intention to fully exit from its Lloyds shareholding in the coming months, and as part of this at least \u00a32bn of shares will be sold to retail investors.\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Lloyds chief executive, has previously supported the strategy of dribbling out shares into the market to big City investors and hedge funds to reduce the government stake - which stood at 43% following the bank bailouts in 2008 and 2009 and has now fallen to 12%. A Lloyds spokesperson said: \u201cThe decision about any sale of the UK government\u2019s shares in Lloyds Banking Group is up to the government\u201d. That dribbling out of shares is expected to continue until the end of the year . The promise of a discount - the government breaks even on sale sales above 73.6p - could mean a loss on the retail offering depending on the share price next year. On Monday the shares closed up 1% at 77.3p. The rise in the shares in February mean that a bonus of 1m shares - worth around \u00a3800,000 - has already been triggered for Horta-Os\u00f3rio although he will not be able to sell the shares until 2020. The shares have been buoyed since the surprise announcement on Friday by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, that it is proposing a Spring 2018 deadline for PPI compensation claims. Consumer groups said the FCA move intended to help the Lloyds sale. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, also questioned the motivation last week. Lloyds has set aside more than \u00a313bn to tackle PPI claims - half the entire industry\u2019s bill of \u00a326bn - and Ian Gordon, analyst at investment bank Investec, estimated that Lloyds alone could face a further provision of at least \u00a31.5bn. \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to press ahead with a retail offer is a political one,\u201d said Gordon. Some estimates expect the industry to face a further \u00a333bn PPI bill because of a legal case involving a customer who was sold the insurance without knowing how much commission was being paid. .\u201d The sale is also being announced ahead of a Competition and Markets Authority review into competition in the banking sector, which could signal a breakup of the big banks. Lloyds has a 25% market share of current accounts, more than any other bank. The CMA is due to publish its preliminary findings in a fortnight. Lloyds already has more private investors \u2013 around 2.7 million \u2013 than any other listed company and the prospects of hefty dividend payments have already been attracting investors to the shares. But Darren Hepworth, director of global trading at share dealer TD Direct Investing, warned: \u201cIt is worth noting however that investors who have held onto the stock for over a decade will not have seen their stock return to its earlier valuation, with the share prices still a third of those in 2005. This perhaps serves as a reminder to investors that shares can go down as well as up\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Close to a decade in the making, the most important trade pact in a generation moved closer to becoming a reality on Monday. Thanks to the alphabet soup of acronyms and the byzantine path the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has taken, and the secrecy in which talks have been conducted, many people have ignored the pact. But as a deal gets closer to being sealed, tempers are fraying and the TPP is set to make its way up the news agenda. Here\u2019s your guide through the maze \u2013 what we can see of it anyway. So we have a deal. Yes, at least the beginning of a deal. In a final round of negotiations, Pacific trade ministers from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam reached the widest-ranging trade deal in a generation, covering everything from pharmaceuticals and banking to milk. The terms of the agreement will now have to be approved by each of the TPP countries. Who is missing? The notable exception is China. In part, the deal is meant to tackle China\u2019s dominance in the region. China has its own trade plans under discussion but could one day be part of the TPP. Will the US sign off? It should do \u2013 although the effort won\u2019t be without friction. Hoping to avoid a long, drawn-out fight over the TPP, Obama asked the US Congress to give him Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to negotiate the trade agreement. TPA gives Congress the ability to review and vote for or against a final trade agreement, but they are not able to amend it or filibuster. Getting the TPA through Congress wasn\u2019t easy, but after weeks of back and forth the bill was finally passed in late June. Who is against this trade deal? Among those speaking out against the agreement are unions, workers\u2019 rights groups and environmentalists, all of whom have traditionally been Obama supporters. Many in the president\u2019s own party \u2013 including senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 oppose the trade deal. Free speech advocates and financial reformers are also worried about the deal. Warren is specifically afraid that if it is passed, a future president could use the TPP to change regulations like Dodd-Frank that are meant to safeguard US investors. In a statement issued on Monday, Sanders said that he is \u201cdisappointed but not surprised by the decision to move forward on the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that will hurt consumers and cost American jobs. \u201cWall Street and other big corporations have won again. It is time for the rest of us to stop letting multinational corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense,\u201d he said. He added that this agreement was akin to failed trade deals with Mexico and China which cost the US millions of jobs and vowed to do what he could to defeat the agreement in Congress. Who supports the agreement? Big businesses like Nike \u2013 from whose headquarters Obama controversially chose to shill for the deal \u2013 support the agreement because it would reduce the tariffs on the shoes they produce overseas and then ship to the US. (Right now 98% of shoes in the US are imported.) They also argue free trade will benefit US companies and create more jobs at home. The deal would clarify trade rules that currently ensnare businesses large and small in red tape and would arguably make trading in the Pacific rim far easier. Did the corporations lobby for passage of the deal? They sure did. An analysis of Federal Election Commission data showed that corporate members of the US Business Coalition for TPP donated more than $1m to members of US Senate campaigns between January and March of this year, when fast-tracking the TPP was being debated. Here is what that analysis found: Out of the total $1,148,971 given, an average of $17,676.48 was donated to each of the 65 \u201cyea\u201d votes. The average Republican member received $19,673.28 from corporate TPP supporters. The average Democrat received $9,689.23 from those same donors. Wasn\u2019t there another agreement that promised much the same but cost the US jobs? Yes. That was Nafta \u2013 the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 signed in 1994 between the US, Canada and Mexico. As Sanders points out, post-Nafta the US lost nearly 700,000 jobs, and over 60% of the lost jobs were in manufacturing. Obama is really tired of people making the Nafta comparison. While speaking at Nike HQ in May, he told the audience that Nafta was a different agreement, passed 20 years ago. \u201cIn fact, this agreement fixes some of what was wrong with Nafta by making labor and environmental provisions actually enforceable,\u201d he said. He argued the agreement will not cost US jobs and will raise standards for workers in countries like Vietnam, where many large US companies currently outsource work. So who is right, and what does the agreement actually say? Well, that\u2019s the thing: we don\u2019t know. The agreement is secret. The most detail we have had so far comes from WikiLeaks, which leaked chapters on intellectual property proposals that have caused consternation online. \u201cIf you read, write, publish, think, listen, dance, sing or invent; if you farm or consume food; if you\u2019re ill now or might one day be ill, the TPP has you in its crosshairs,\u201d said the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Meanwhile, Obama insisted that the deal is not secret at all. \u2026 how? Well, he says that people will get to see it before he officially signs off on it. This is what he said in May: [Y]ou\u2019ve got some critics saying that any deal would be rushed through; it\u2019s a secret deal, people don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it. This is not true. Any agreement that we finalize with the other 11 countries will have to be posted online for at least 60 days before I even sign it. Then it would go to Congress \u2013 and you know they\u2019re not going to do anything fast. So there will be months of review. Every T crossed, every I dotted. Everybody is going to be able to see exactly what\u2019s in it. So what now? Now, we wait for the 30 chapters of the agreement to be posted. Everyone \u2013 from lawmakers to unions to lobbyists \u2013 is eager to get their hands on a copy of the deal to see what exactly it contains. \u201cWe ask the administration to release the text immediately, and urge legislators to exercise great caution in evaluating the TPP,\u201d Richard Trumka, president of the largest labor union federation in the US, AFL-CIO, said on Monday. After it receives the text of the agreement, Congress will have 90 days to review it before a straight yes-or-no vote. Thanks to the TPA, there will be no amendments and no filibusters. Wait, so this is not over yet? Nope. Let\u2019s get together in another three months and see how it\u2019s going then.",

The most detail we have had so far comes from WikiLeaks, which leaked chapters on intellectual property proposals that have <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/13/wikileaks-trans-pacific-partnership-chapter-secret\">caused consternation</a> online. \u201cIf you read, write, publish, think, listen, dance, sing or invent; if you farm or consume food; if you\u2019re ill now or might one day be ill, the TPP has you in its crosshairs,\u201d said the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama insisted that the deal is not secret at all.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><strong>\u2026 how?</strong></p> <p>Well, he says that people will get to see it before he officially signs off on it. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/08/remarks-president-trade\">This is what he said in May</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Y]ou\u2019ve got some critics saying that any deal would be rushed through; it\u2019s a secret deal, people don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it. This is not true. Any agreement that we finalize with the other 11 countries will have to be posted online for at least 60 days before I even sign it. Then it would go to Congress \u2013 and you know they\u2019re not going to do anything fast. So there will be months of review. Every T crossed, every I dotted. Everybody is going to be able to see exactly what\u2019s in it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So what now?</strong></p> <p>Now, we wait for the 30 chapters of the agreement to be posted. Everyone \u2013 from lawmakers to unions to lobbyists \u2013 is eager to get their hands on a copy of the deal to see what exactly it contains.</p> <p>\u201cWe ask the administration to release the text immediately, and urge legislators to exercise great caution in evaluating the TPP,\u201d Richard Trumka, president of the largest labor union federation in the US, AFL-CIO, said on Monday.</p> <p>After it receives the text of the agreement, Congress will have 90 days to review it before a straight yes-or-no vote. Thanks to the TPA, there will be no amendments and no filibusters.</p> <p><strong>Wait, so this is not over yet? </strong></p> <p>Nope. Let\u2019s get together in another three months and see how it\u2019s going then.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why announce the sale of Lloyds Banking Group shares now? During the election campaign David Cameron pledged a discounted retail offering for the shares, although the amount being earmarked for the sell off \u2013 \u00a32bn \u2013 is half that promised. The timing of the announcement, ahead of the speech by George Osborne at the Conservative party conference, was regarded as political by City analysts. It also became easier after the Financial Conduct Authority announced on Friday it was considering a spring 2018 deadline for payment protection insurance claims, which would allow Lloyds to estimate its eventual claims bill. At \u00a313.6bn so far, it already has the biggest tally of any PPI seller. Are the shares good value for money? According to Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown \u201cwild horses couldn\u2019t drag investors away from this share sale\u201d. He said the terms were very generous. The shares will be sold at a 5% discount to the market price and investors who hold them for a year will get a bonus share for every 10 held, up to a maximum value of \u00a3200. But prospective investors will need to consider whether Lloyds can live up to expectations about its ability to resume dividend payments, a key part of its sales pitch to shareholders. Analysts at AJ Bell, an investment firm, warned: \u201cGrowth is likely to be limited, as the UK is a mature and tightly regulated market, and cost-cutting can only take the bank so far.\u201d Whether, on the other hand, the taxpayer is getting a good deal on the last chunk of Lloyds shares to be sold, will be a matter for the National Audit Office. The discount, however, means it will raise less for the exchequer than the sale of the rest of the shares, which are going to stock market investors without special inducements. How do I get shares? Anyone desperate for shares in Lloyds can buy them on the stock market now. But those wishing to participate in the discounted offer can register on a government website ahead of the offering, which is expected to take place next spring. Can I get shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland too? The sale of the government\u2019s stake in RBS is proving slower than that of Lloyds, where the shareholding has fallen from 42% at the height of crisis to just under 12% now. Taxpayers still own around 73% of RBS shares after the first sell-off in August, when major City investors and hedge funds were offered the shares. In his Mansion House speech in June, Osborne said he expected members of the public would participate \u201cin due course\u201d. But that moment may not come until dividend payments resume, having been halted since the 2008 bailout. The management is currently playing down the chance of any such payouts until 2017. How does this compare with other privatisations? The chancellor told the Conservative party conference it was the biggest privatisation for 20 years. His comparison appears to be the sale of British Telecom in 1993 (the third tranche of shares in a process which began in 1984) when around \u00a33bn of the \u00a35bn of shares sold off went to retail investors. More sales are coming. Osborne has said he intends to raise \u00a332bn this financial year through share sales \u2013 even more than in 1987, the last bumper year for state sell-offs.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy is losing momentum, knocked by weaker household spending and worries about the global outlook, according to the latest in a string of downbeat business surveys. Business activity grew at the slowest pace for more than two years in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector last month, according to the closely watched Markit CIPS PMI report. The authors said it looked as if GDP growth had slowed in recent months and was entering the final quarter of the year at a pace of just 0.3% \u2013 less than half the 0.7% seen in the second quarter, according to the most recent official data. The report\u2019s headline activity index was far weaker than City economists had been expecting. It was 53.3 in September, down from 55.6 in August, the weakest reading since April 2013 and much lower than a consensus forecast for 56.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. \u201cWeakness is spreading from the struggling manufacturing sector, hitting transport and other industrial-related services in particular. There are also signs that consumers have become more cautious and are pulling back on their leisure spending, such as on restaurants and hotels,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit. \u201cWider business service sector confidence has meanwhile also been knocked by global economic worries and financial market jitters.\u201d The pound weakened against the euro and the dollar after the report, which economists saw as providing further reason for the Bank of England to hold off raising interest rates from 0.5%. Borrowing costs have been at a record low for more than six years. While the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney had recently warned mortgage holders to prepare for a rise in interest rates, economic news since than has pointed to a slowdown in the domestic and global economies. Markit, which compiles the services report, said taken together with indicators from the smaller manufacturing and construction sector, it suggested GDP growth slowed to 0.5% in the third quarter of this year. Financial markets will get some insight into the Bank\u2019s latest thinking on the outlook when the monetary policy committee (MPC) announces this month\u2019s decision on interest rates on Thursday alongside minutes from its meeting. Economists expect only one of the nine committee members will vote for a hike, with the rest choosing to keep rates at 0.5%. Referring to the latest PMI reports, Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said: \u201cThese surveys suggest that growth remains comfortably positive, but is no better than average. Given all this, the MPC\u2019s statement on Thursday is likely to show a further drift to a softer outlook for both growth and inflation. New business growth slows The poll of companies in the service sector, which spans finance to restaurants, showed new business was also coming in at the slowest pace since April 2013. At the same time, services businesses had to contend with rising costs, mainly down to salary pressures, but the prices they charged their customers rose only \u201cmarginally\u201d, the report said. Hiring picked up to grow at the fastest pace for three months. The news comes against the backdrop of growing concerns about the global economy losing momentum, hurt by a downturn in China and volatility on financial markets. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s boss, Christine Lagarde, warned last week that a slowdown in big emerging market countries will cut global growth to its lowest level since the deep recession of 2009. In a separate survey overnight, the chief financial officers (CFOs) of some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies reported a sharp rise in uncertainty facing their businesses and said that they had scaled back their expectations for investment and hiring over the coming year. The poll by consultancy Deloitte found 60% of CFOs believed the Chinese downturn would hurt their business.",

As a result, Ebitda comes down from \u20ac261.3m to \u20ac256.5m, driving earnings per share down from 64.6c to 63.3c, a 2% downgrade. We still assume a full contribution from Ava Trade for 2016 (we are forecasting a \u20ac20.1m Ebitda contribution). If the Ava Trade deal was blocked, it would knock 6% off our 2016 earnings forecasts.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has announced up to 400 job cuts at its marine division, taking the number of redundancies at the struggling business to about 1,000 in the past five months. The engine-maker said cutting mainly corporate and administrative jobs would free money for greater investment in research and development. The marine operation, which makes and maintains power and propulsion systems, has been hit by falling orders caused by the slump in the oil price. More than half the marine division\u2019s revenues come from the oil and gas industry, which has cancelled orders for specialist boats that Rolls-Royce designs or that use the company\u2019s propulsion systems and other products. Rolls-Royce said the cuts would save \u00a340m a year. It left its guidance unchanged for profit and revenue at the marine business, which employs about 5,800 people in 34 countries. Mikael Makinen, the president of the marine business, said: \u201cAfter many years of strong performance through to 2013, led by good growth in the oil and gas sector, our order book and profitability have been adversely impacted by the sharp and subsequently prolonged drop in the price of oil. \u201cReducing our workforce is never an easy decision, but the continued weak oil price, and the need to become more competitive, means it is necessary, if we are to build a strong base from which we can successfully grow this business in the future.\u201d The Derby-based company is cutting more than 3,000 jobs in its aerospace and marine arms as it adapts to a slowdown in demand across its business. This includes closing factories in Ansty in Warwickshire and East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Annual profit more than halved when Rolls-Royce announced its results in July. Profit at the marine unit slumped to \u00a34m from \u00a340m while at its main civil aerospace division profit dropped to \u00a3248m from \u00a3405m. After a decade of rising sales, Rolls-Royce published a series of profit warnings starting early last year. Former chief executive John Rishton was replaced by Warren East, the former boss of microchip maker Arm Holdings, who issued a profit warning in July, two days after taking the helm.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are moving higher in tandem with other global markets, after Friday\u2019s disappointing US job numbers convinced investors that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates this year after all. Commodity companies are among the main gainers, with emerging markets likely to benefit if the Fed does keep borrowing costs on hold. Glencore has surged 6% to 100.8p on talk it could be subject to a takeover or might sell its agribusiness. But the shares are off their best levels, and are nowhere near as high as the increase in Hong Kong, as the company said it knew of no reason for the rise. Elsewhere BHP Billiton is up 20.5p at 1062.5p while Rio Tinto has risen 57p to \u00a322.99. ITV is shrugging off England\u2019s premature departure from the Rugby World Cup despite weekend talk the broadcaster could lose out on \u00a31m of revenue per match as advertisers cut back spending with the host\u2019s early exit. Its shares are up 2.7p at 250.5p, and analyst Ian Whittaker at Liberum listed a number of reasons why ITV should not be hit too badly: (1) TV advertising slots tend to be booked 4-6 weeks in advance so virtually all the slots for October would already have been booked (there might be a bit of lack of late money but that is at the margins) so advertising revenues unlikely to be significantly impacted (especially as sponsorship revenues have also already been booked); (2) a more credible issue is the impact on audience share - however, again, likely to be minimal especially if the other Home Nations stay in - as October is 1 month out of 12 and the Rugby World Cup is turning out to be an attractive spectacle; (3) The fourth quarter programming schedule is likely to be strong regardless (Downton, X-Factor, new dramas). Buy on any weakness. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 116.10 points at 6246.08, despite disappointing UK services data which adds to the expectation that the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise UK rates. Standard Chartered has added 23.5p to 690.2p, benefiting from the more positive mood about emerging markets while Lloyds Banking Group is up 1.21p at 77.76p as the government unveiled plans to sell \u00a32bn worth of the bank\u2019s shares to the public. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: The 5% discount is equivalent to just 3.8p per share, whilst the sale overall is light even of the Royal Mail IPO, which weighed in at around \u00a33.3bn. Nonetheless, it does provide a welcome opportunity for smaller investors to at least participate in a fraction of the sell-off, in what is currently a well-regarded bank, seen as something of a barometer for the UK economy. With a projected dividend yield which could nudge 4% and interest rates remaining in the doldrums, you can see this being of interest to income seeking investors in the current environment. The market consensus of Lloyds is a buy could comfort those looking to pick up some shares. Tesco has added 7.25p to 187.10p ahead of half year results later in the week.",

The shares jumped by as much as 20% and were up more than 9% at 104p when the market settled. The rise followed a surge of more than 70% by the company\u2019s shares traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The Telegraph reported on Sunday that Glencore\u2019s board was open to offers for the whole of the company but that management thought a bid was unlikely to value the company highly enough in the current market. In response to the extraordinary rise in the company\u2019s shares, the Hong Kong stock exchange told Glencore to clear up the matter in a statement. The company said it was not aware of any information that would support such a rise. Glencore said: \u201cThe board of directors of Glencore plc has noted [Monday\u2019s] increases in the price and trading volume of the shares of the company. Having made such enquiry with respect to the company as is reasonable in the circumstances, the board confirms that it is not aware of any reasons for these price and volume movements or of any information which must be announced to avoid a false market in the company\u2019s securities or of any inside information that needs to be disclosed under ... the laws of Hong Kong.\u201d Glencore\u2019s shares have fallen by more than two-thirds this year as concerns grow about its large debt \u2013 slowing Chinese growth has hammered the prices of commodities that the company both trades and mines.

The company\u2019s chairman, Tony Hayward, and John Mack, a non-executive director, bought Glencore shares last week in an attempt to display confidence in the company.

      "bodyText": "What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? The TPP is a free trade agreement being negotiated between Australia, New Zealand, the US, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Canada, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Japan. Talks began five years ago and are attempting to build on the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement, established in 2006 between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. What is it for? The TPP aims to lower trade tariffs between the signatory nations and bring in wide-ranging new regulations for investment, agriculture, intellectual property, labour and the environment. This in turn could mean cheaper food, medicine and everyday household goods for millions of people. It will also help the 12 countries to counter China\u2019s rising economic influence in the region. Why does it matter? The countries have a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of US$28,136bn on 2012 figures, which represents almost 40% of the world\u2019s GDP. The emerging countries of the Pacific rim promise to provide billions of new middle-class consumers over the coming decades, providing huge new markets for the goods and services of developed nations. In return, bigger economies will be expected to relax restrictions on cheaper imports. Barack Obama has made strengthening US ties with the region a foreign policy priority. In his State of the Union address in January, Obama asked for the authority to fast-track the TPP agreement, arguing that the US needed to sell more products overseas: \u201cToday, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages,\u201d he said in his speech, asking Congress to give him authority \u201cto protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\u2019t just free, but fair\u201d. That\u2019s the US view. But what about other countries? Other countries have much to gain from free trade with the US. Japan, the second biggest partner in the grouping after the US, has pushed hard to force the US to lower the duty threshold for automotive parts sold in North America from 62% locally made to more like 30%. This deal, which also involves Canada and Mexico whose industries are closely tied to the US, would help Japanese companies such as Toyota source cheaper parts from Asia for its factories in the Americas. Despite fears that the local auto industry could suffer from a flood of imports, Japan is understood to have won a concession lowering the rate to 45%. New Zealand is keen to get the agreement over the line so that it can cement the concessions it has negotiated on access to the US for its world-beating agricultural produce. New Zealand trade minister Tim Groser said on Sunday: \u201cWe want this deal now because the dangers of unravelling on things that have been advanced here are so extreme.\u201d For example, Fonterra, New Zealand\u2019s biggest company, is responsible for 30% of the world\u2019s dairy exports. Australian trade within the TPP countries is worth billions of dollars. It also wants to open up new markets for its low-cost agricultural produce as the economy adjusts to the end of the mining boom. But it is wary of giving away too much access in return, particularly to multinational companies eyeing the growth potential of the Australian market. What has held things up until now? When the last round of talks collapsed in Hawaii in August, Australian trade minister Andrew Robb said a deal was \u201c98% done\u201d. But although he said the big nations such as the US, Canada, Japan and Mexico were involved in the last sticking points, the main issue seems to have been in the area of medicines and health. Specifically, this involves how long monopoly pharmaceutical companies\u2013 mainly American ones \u2013 should be given on new biotech drugs. The issue has pitted the US, which has argued for longer protections, against Australia and five others who say such measures would strain national healthcare budgets and keep life-saving medicines from patients who cannot afford them. For example, the US provides 12 years of exclusivity for drugs like cancer therapy Avastin, developed by Genentech, a US-based firm which is owned by the Swiss pharma company Roche. Australia insisted on five years of protection to control health care costs. A possible two-track compromise would set a minimum threshold of five years during which drug makers would have exclusive rights to clinical data behind new drugs while adding an additional protection of several more years as applications for competing drugs are reviewed. Under a second track, pharmaceutical companies would have eight years of exclusive rights to a new product outright in some countries. What happens if there is no deal? They\u2019ll have to try again at another set of talks in the Philippines in November, but that might be the last chance before Obama leaves office in 2016. Without his administration\u2019s strong backing for an agreement the talks might be scuppered. Despite his enthusiasm, many Democrats and labour groups are concerned about what the TPP would mean for jobs in manufacturing and environmental protections. Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, have urged the administration to hold the line on intellectual property protections, especially on the pharma issue. Are these the longest trade talks ever? They\u2019re not. The world trade talks which began in Doha in 2001 have still not been concluded. Disagreements over a complex range of issues, including the usual suspects of food security and intellectual property, have dogged the negotiations from the outset. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel. With the very future of the World Trade Organisation hanging in the balance, India bowed to pressure in November 2014 and struck a deal with the US over agriculture issues.",
