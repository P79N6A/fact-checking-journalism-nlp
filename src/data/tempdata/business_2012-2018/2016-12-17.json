      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, likes to shake things up and, in recent days, he has reverted to form. After 16 months of faithfully toeing the line, the leader rebelled, cautiously at first and then almost jubilantly, casting off the fiscal straightjacket that has encased his government with thinly veiled glee. First came the announcement that low-income pensioners, forced to survive in tax-heavy post-crisis Greece on \u20ac800 or less a month, would receive a one-off, pre-Christmas bonus. Then came the news that Greeks living on Aegean isles which have borne the brunt of refugee flows would not be subject to a sales tax enforced at the behest of creditors keeping the debt-stricken country afloat. Finally, another announcement both antagonising and pointed: 30,000 children living in poverty-stricken areas of northern Greece will henceforth be entitled to free meals in schools. The reaction wasn\u2019t instant but, when it came, it was delivered with force. The European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s financing arm, announced that short-term relief measures, agreed only a week before to ease Greece\u2019s debt pile, would be frozen with immediate effect. It did not take long before the German finance ministry, under the unwavering stewardship of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, followed suit, requesting that creditor institutions assess whether Tsipras had acted in flagrant violation of Athens\u2019 bailout commitments with his unilateral moves. The leftist insisted that the aid \u2013 \u20ac61m in supplementary support for pensions and \u20ac11.5m for the school meals \u2013 would be taken from the primary surplus his government, unexpectedly, had managed to achieve. The assistance would help \u201cheal the wounds of crisis\u201d. \u201cWe want to ... alleviate all those who have over these difficult years made huge sacrifices in the name of Europe,\u201d he announced before holding talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel late Friday. Those who live in Athens know that while the Greek crisis may ebb and flow, it never goes away. Everyone involved \u2013 Europe\u2019s paymaster, Germany, the 19-member euro group of eurozone finance ministers, the ESM and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 are acutely aware that almost any move could reignite the problems. \u201cLet us not play shadowy games with Greece\u2019s future,\u201d wrote EU economic affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici in the pages of the Financial Times, urging that decisions be made \u201cin the common interest\u201d. But, inexorably, the next act has already begun. Seven years after the scale of its deficit was revealed, prompting the first of three bailouts to avert bankruptcy, Greece is nowhere near economic recovery. Despite rosy prognostications by the country\u2019s central bank \u2013 on Friday, it predicted that the economy, which grew by a mere 0.1% in 2016, would expand by 2.5% next year and 3% in 2018 \u2013 the nation has lost a third of its economic output. The byproducts of the crisis, starting with an unemployment rate of 27% \u2013 and 52% among the young \u2013 are the backdrop against which the drama is played. Tsipras has seen his support haemorrhage as fury has grown over his embrace of the very austerity measures his Syriza party once pledged to overthrow. If elections were held tomorrow, he would lose outright to the conservative New Democracy party shown to be leading by as many as 15 percentage points in a recent poll. But that also makes the leftist leader unpredictable. Demands for further tax increases, wage and pension cuts \u2013 reforms Athens says it is under immense pressure to apply by the International Monetary Fund if it is to come anywhere close to achieving a projected primary budget surplus of 3.5% by 2018 \u2013 have created a tinderbox situation. And that, say analysts, is one that at 42, with much of his political career still before him, Tsipras may well elect to exploit. \u201cAll scenarios are open, including fresh elections,\u201d says professor Dimitris Keridis, who teaches political scientist at Athens\u2019 Pandeion University. \u201cHe\u2019s playing the resistance fighter on the one hand and the leader who wants resolution and Greece to remain in the euro on the other,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cBut the reality is very hard and he is also hostage to his rhetoric. That means he could go either way.\u201d Which way depends to great degree on how the lender institutions also react. A report looking into the impact of the social benefits \u2013 passed into law on Thursday \u2013 will be evaluated next week. The appetite for more Greek drama when Europe is dealing with crises on so many other fronts is limited. But there are rules \u2013 and uncompromising positions \u2013 that have a force of their own and may well propel the drama forward. This time around, away from Greece, the main actors are in open conflict. Speculation is rife that the IMF may not decide until the spring whether it should support the latest bailout, with officials in Washington not only making the case for more debt relief, but citing deep-seated disagreement over Germany\u2019s demand that Athens achieve such a high primary surplus in the years ahead. Without the IMF on board, it is doubtful whether Berlin can muster the legislative backing to keep disbursing funds from the \u20ac86bn programme agreed last summer.",

      "bodyText": "The Brexit blow to the pound coupled with commodity price hikes is squeezing Britons\u2019 Christmas spending power this year. A typical household spends an extra \u00a3500 in December but the pound\u2019s dramatic tumble since the 23 June referendum means the festive fund is being stretched as the price of everything from Christmas puddings to selection boxes and the latest tech comes under pressure. British firms are having to pay a lot more for imports, from food ingredients to fuel, with manufacturers\u2019 costs up 13% over the last year \u2013 the steepest rise for five years. Some of those higher costs are already being passed on to consumers, and experts have warned households to expect a brisker pace of inflation next year. \u201cGenerally the drivers of food inflation are what\u2019s happening in global commodity markets and recent movements in sterling,\u201d said the Retail Economics analyst Richard Lim. \u201cThis side of Christmas retailers are holding back some of the inflationary pressure they are feeling from suppliers and manufacturers because it is a fiercely competitive environment. Next year we expect food inflation to rise fairly steeply because of sterling.\u201d For now it seems importers and retailers are taking a hit to their own margins rather than choosing to charge more in the shops, but according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis Christmas will give shoppers a taste of higher inflation ahead. Not everything is more expensive \u2013 official figures show food prices in shops are still lower overall than a year ago. A supermarket price war and the rise of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi have helped keep grocery prices low. There is also good news for those who like a Christmas tipple. Wine, beer and spirits are all cheaper than a year ago. But shoppers should beware of hidden inflation. Manufacturers have been shrinking their products and charging the same price. In other words, you pay the same but get less \u2013 a phenomenon known as shrinkflation. A recent example was the storm over the new Toblerone, which has bigger gaps between its chunky chocolate peaks after its manufacturer decided to cut the bar\u2019s weight rather than increase its price. The rising cost of Christmas Christmas pudding: +21% compared with December 2015 Stir-up Sunday got a lot more expensive this year as raisins, butter and flour all increased in price. Artificial trees: +46% increase in steel price You get more than one Christmas out of them but the price of artificial trees is being affected by a 46% increase in European steel prices after China slashed production. Christmas jumper: +0.9% Official figures showed clothing prices this November were up almost 1% from a year ago, making them one of the main factors behind a rise in the UK\u2019s overall inflation rate to 1.2%. Nip of whisky: +4% While the headline price of spirits is down about 2% from a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics, a breakdown of the official figures shows whisky has been getting pricier. A nip will cost you \u00a32.73 this year, up from \u00a32.62 a year ago. Pigs in blankets: +21% Analysts are reporting a 21% rise in the wholesale price of pork, with the surge expected to push up the price of bacon and sausages sold in supermarkets. Toblerone: +13% per bite Chocolate prices would be higher if the bars weren\u2019t getting smaller as manufacturers shrink pack sizes rather than raise prices. Mondel\u0113z International reduced the size of the 170g Toblerone bars to 150g \u2013 equating to a 13% rise in the price per gram. iPad: +10% The Brexit vote has pushed up the prices of laptops, desktop computers and tablets as technology companies seek to adjust to the weaker pound. Apple has hiked the prices of its products in the UK, including Christmas list favourite the iPad. Price rises in September, for example, pushed up the 9.7-inch model of the iPad Pro to \u00a3549 from \u00a3499. Furby: +43% The Furby Connect has a recommended retail price of \u00a399.99 versus the older Boom version\u2019s \u00a369.99 price tag. However, the Furby Connect is a jazzed up version of the furry critter with a Bluetooth connection and coloured LED eyes \u2013 and most retailers are discounting the toy anyway. Lump of coal: +2% A lump of coal in the Christmas stocking is now a more expensive way to scold a naughty child. A 50kg sack of coal now costs \u00a317.62, 29p more than a year ago",
