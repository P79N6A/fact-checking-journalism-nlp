      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has closed a little higher tonight. Shares were helped by the Fed\u2019s upbeat view of the US economy, and its decision not to hike borrowing costs. The blowout ADP jobs figures, released earlier today, also boosted the mood among traders. The strong manufacturing data from January provided another lift. That\u2019s all for today. Goodnight! GW There\u2019s not much market reaction to the Fed decision. The Dow Jones industrial average has turned positive. up a modest 24 points at 19,888 points. Wall Street traders are encouraged that the Fed had an upbeat view of the US economy. \u201cConfidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic statement with regard to inflation,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas (via Reuters) The next US interest rate hike might not come until June, argues Lee Ferridge, head of multi-asset strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets. The market is currently attaching around a 25 percent probability to a hike in March and that is unlikely to change substantially following the broadly neutral statement. Although recent Fed commenters have taken a more hawkish tone it seems that the uncertainty surrounding likely policy moves in the coming months means that the FOMC remains in wait and see mode. While a March move is still possible should headline inflation and inflation expectations rise materially in the coming weeks, it seems that the June meeting is now the most likely time for the next hike in the cycle. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics agrees, saying the Fed is obviously in \u2018wait and see mode\u2019. At the conclusion of its two-day FOMC meeting, the Fed issued a near-identical statement to the one released in December, which strongly suggests it has no intention of raising interest rates again at the upcoming March meeting. We love a sporting metaphor in this blog, but Matt Weller, Senior Market Analyst at Faraday Research, may baffle UK readers with this quote.... Ahead of today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, some analysts were comparing the central banker confab to this weekend\u2019s NFL Pro Bowl, an event that even diehard football fans struggled to watch given the lack of effort by the so-called stars. As it turns out, watching a replay of the Pro Bowl (or even watching paint dry) may have been more exciting. The Fed will be reluctant to raise borrowing costs until it has a better idea of Donald Trump\u2019s policy plans, argues Tanweer Akram of Thrivent Financial, a financial services group. Akram says: Higher tariffs, restrictive immigration policies, and protectionism could have some harmful effects, though increased infrastructure spending and lower taxes could be beneficially. It remains to be seen what economic policies will enacted and how these will be implemented. Tighter labor markets could lead to an increase in inflation, but so far inflationary pressures have been restrained. The Fed will resume tighten in the coming months if economic conditions continue to show signs of improvement and there is evidence of inflationary pressures mounting. Kully Samra, UK Managing Director of Charles Schwab, says the Fed was in no rush to hike borrowing costs today: \u201cThis is only the first FOMC meeting of eight in 2017 so there are still plenty of opportunities for the Fed to raise interest rates throughout the year and it is likely that we will see a rate rise in March or June. In our view, two rate hikes this year would be sufficient to stave off inflation concerns and would not negatively impact economic growth. Samra argues that the US stock market will keep rallying in the months ahead: \u201cInflation is picking up and the Fed is becoming more hawkish, but the conditions supporting those moves can also be seen as positive news for US stocks. We continue to see encouraging economic data and earnings reports which, combined with a healthy job market, wage growth and increased consumer confidence, is good news for US equities and the wider economy. \u201cWe stand by our view that U.S. stocks will outperform developed international stocks in the coming months. Although rising inflation and investor nerves could lead to bouts of volatility and some pullbacks, the bull market shows little sign of slowing in the near future.\u201d No-one\u2019s surprised that the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged today -- it\u2019s only two months since their last hike, after all. Here\u2019s some reaction: The US Federal Reserve has flagged up that the US economy is strengthening (but not enough to encourage it to raise borrowing costs today). In a statement, it says: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained soft. On inflation, the Fed says that the cost of living has picked up, but remains below its target of 2% in the \u201clonger run\u201d. The Fed\u2019s policymakers also see economic growth continuing, even as it tightens monetary policy in the months ahead. They say: The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. Newsflash: America\u2019s central bank has decided to leave interest rates unchanged, at their current level of 0.5%-0.75%. European stock markets closed higher tonight, helped by the news that factory output across the eurozone rose last month. France\u2019s CAC gained 0.96%, while Germany\u2019s DAX ended 1.1% higher. In London, though, the FTSE 100 lost its early gains to finish just 8 points higher, or +0.1%. It was dragged back by a strengthening pound. Sterling gained 1% against the euro to \u20ac1.175, and 0.5% against the US dollar to $1.264. Some traders are wondering if the Bank of England will hint at raising interest rates soon, at its quarterly inflation report tomorrow. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank says: With some words of Brexit-related caution, the Bank of England (BoE) may surprise with a more hawkish tone at tomorrow\u2019s Inflation Report as it revises up its near-term growth forecast and highlights growing underlying inflationary risks. The shift could come either in the form of more hawkish forward guidance or some MPC members voting in favour of bringing an end to the planned corporate bond purchase program sooner than planned. I\u2019ll be back in a few hours to catch the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision (at 7pm GMT, or 2pm East Coast time). In the meantime, here\u2019s a brisk summary. The world\u2019s factory sectors made a decent start to 2017, according to a flurry of manufacturing surveys from across the globe. The data show that China\u2019s factories kept growing, Japan\u2019s picked up too, while the eurozone enjoyed its strongest month in almost seven years. France, Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands all did well. In the UK, too, factories recorded strong increases in output. But that was overshadowed by a huge leap in the cost of raw materials, partly due to the weak pound. Economists warned that firms will pass these costs onto consumers, driving British inflation higher. Figures just released from the US painted a similar pattern of solid growth, and rising input prices. Elsewhere today... A leaked report has shown that Brussels is worried that Europe will suffer if the City is hurt by Brexit. UK house price inflation has slowed again: And supermarket chain founder Sir Ken Morrison has died. Here\u2019s some of his best quotes: ISM has just released its rival survey of US manufacturing -- and it also shows growth picking up last month. Just in: America\u2019s manufacturing sector has grown at the fastest pace in almost two years. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s monthly report on the US factory sector. Its US manufacturing PMI has jumped to 55.0 in January, up from 54.3 in December, showing stronger growth. Firms reported that output and new business orders rose last month, while input price pressures also increased (something we\u2019ve also seen in Europe and the UK today) Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says the US manufacturing sector has started 2017 with \u201cstrong momentum\u201d. Despite exports being subdued by the strong dollar, order books are growing at the fastest pace for over two years on the back of improved domestic demand. \u201cWith optimism about the year ahead at the highest since last March, the outlook has also brightened. \u201cProduction is consequently growing at the strongest rate for almost two years and inventories are rising at a rate not seen for nearly a decade as firms respond to higher demand, suggesting the goods-producing sector will make a decent contribution to first quarter GDP. \u201cWith input costs also rising at the steepest rate for over two years, and hiring sustained at an encouragingly solid pace as firms expand capacity, all of the survey indicators point to the Fed hiking interest rates again soon.\u201d European stock markets are continuing to rally today, as traders welcome this morning\u2019s strong factory data. The Stoxx 600 index is up 1.3%, on track for its biggest one-day gain since 9th November (the date of the US election) Over in Greece....there\u2019s no sign of a breakthrough in the stalled review of the country\u2019s bailout. Helena Smith reports: Mounting signs of friction between Greece and foreign lenders show no sign of abate this morning with MPs in the ruling Syriza party saying there is no way they will bow to demands to implement more austerity once the country\u2019s current bailout ends in mid 2018. Signalling the leftist-led government\u2019s resolve to stick to its guns, the leading Syriza MP Sia Agnastopoulou ruled out signing up to further cost-cutting reforms beyond those Athens has already committed to saying to do so would be totally undemocratic. Europe, she said, would be \u201cundermining itself\u201d and its values if it continued to demand the prior legislation of measures that will take effect in 2019 - the single biggest obstacle to completing a bailout review on which further rescue funds now depend. \u201cGrexit is not on our agenda,\u201d the former alternate minister for European affairs told Skai TV brushing off renewed speculation of euro exit. \u201cIt is on the agenda of those who want the break-up of Europe and that is what [the German finance minister] Mr Schauble wants. We want to close this negotiation without prior legislation of measures,\u201d she added, arguing that further measures would be catastrophic for the country\u2019s development. \u201cEurope will be undermining itself, undermining democracy, if it insists.\u201d Prime minister Alexis Tsipras is facing mounting pressure from his own MPs not to sign up to additional austerity amid growing signs of a mutiny if it does. Interior Minister Panos Skourletis, a senior figure in Syriza, has repeatedly said there have to be \u201climits to negotiations\u201d after seven years of austerity-driven recession and poverty. Greece faces major debt repayments in July which has once again reignited fears of the country being at the forefront of another euro zone crisis this summer. Breaking! American companies created tens of thousands more jobs than expected last month. The latest ADP survey of US company payrolls has absolutely smashed forecasts, showing an increase of 246,000 workers last month. Economists had expected an increase of 165,000. This suggests that Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll (the principle US jobs report) could also be pretty strong. Traders are pushing the dollar higher: Our Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey, has a great story -- a leaked report has shown that the EU is worried that a poor Brexit deal could hurt the City of London, and rebound badly on Europe\u2019s economy. He writes: The European commission\u2019s Brexit negotiators must strike a \u201cworkable\u201d deal with Theresa May\u2019s government to protect the City of London or the economies of the remaining member states will be damaged, a leaked EU report warns. The document \u2013 which has been seen by the Guardian \u2013 describes it as critical for the economic health of the remaining member states that the current financial eco-system is not hit in the coming Brexit negotiations. The paper, drawn up by officials working for the European parliament\u2019s powerful committee on economic and monetary affairs (Econ), warns that UK-based financial services account for 40% of Europe\u2019s assets under management and 60% of its capital markets business. \u201cAnd UK-based banks provide more than \u00a31.1tn of loans to the other EU member states,\u201d the Econ secretariat\u2019s paper notes. \u201cIf financial services companies choose to leave the UK as a result of Brexit, the consequences should be carefully evaluated. \u201cA badly designed final deal would damage both the UK and the other 27 EU member states. \u201cThe exclusion of the main European financial centre from the internal market could have consequences in terms of jobs and growth in the EU. It is in the interest of EU 27 and the UK to have an open discussion on this point.\u201d.... Here\u2019s the full tale: Morrisons have issued a statement to the City, confirming that Sir Ken Morrison has died, and explaining his major contribution to the company over more than 50 years: Sir Ken Morrison CBE The company has been informed by the Morrison family of the very sad news of the passing of Life President, and former Chairman, Sir Ken Morrison CBE. Sir Ken was an inspirational retailer who led Morrisons for more than half a century, transforming the company from a small family business into the UK\u2019s fourth largest food retailer.At his retirement in 2008, Morrisons had 375 stores, serving over nine million customers a week. Sir Ken will be greatly missed by many thousands of his current and former colleagues, a large number of whom became close personal friends over the years. Sir Ken was Morrisons Chairman until 2008. He was awarded the CBE in 1990 and knighted in the Millennium New Year\u2019s Honours list for his services to the food retailing industry. Widely considered one of Britain\u2019s finest retailers, Sir Ken developed the culture, values and clear direction for the business which remain the bedrock of the firm today. His legacy includes many enduring innovations, such as Market Street and Morrisons unique vertical integration model. Andrew Higginson, the current Chairman of Morrisons, said: \u201cI know that I speak for the whole company when I say how profoundly sad we were to hear of Sir Ken\u2019s death. He was an inspirational leader and the driving force behind Morrisons for over half a century. Although he retired several years ago, his legacy is evident every day and in every aspect of our business. \u201cTaking Morrisons from a small Bradford-based family business to a major UK grocery retailing chain is an outstanding achievement in the history of UK business. On a personal level, Ken was an enormous help to me as we made some significant changes to set the business on a new course; his knowledge of retail and his strategic insights have remained as relevant and intuitive as they were when he first built the business. \u201cKen will be remembered by us all for his leadership, his passion for retailing and for his great love of Morrisons. To honour his memory in the most appropriate way we can, we will continue to develop the company that he built and loved. \u201cWe will miss his friendship and his wise counsel very deeply, and our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\u201d Sir Ken Morrison, one of Britain\u2019s most successful businessmen, has died at the age of 85. Sir Ken took over his father\u2019s egg-and-butter grocery business in Bradford in the 1950s, and grew the company into one of the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chains on the back of \u201cno nonsense\u201d low-price offerings. More than a decade ago, we wrote: Sir Ken is regarded as a grandee of the British grocery business. Even at 71, he still walks the shop floors and is regarded as a hard task master by his 43,000 employees. He is fiercely protective of the company\u2019s northern heritage and his forays south are few and far between. When he does venture to the capital he ensconces himself in the foyer of a hotel and grants audiences to those who wish to see him. But former Asda chief executive Allan Leighton described him as \u201cstreets ahead of everybody in terms of retailing\u201d. In 2004, Wm Morrison swooped on southern rival Safeway in a \u00a33.3bn deal, after decades of steady profit growth. That deal had its problems, leading to profit warnings and boardroom rows -- but Morrison\u2019s turned it around, and Sir Ken was the longest-serving chairman of a blue chip company when he stepped down to become Life President in 2008. Here\u2019s some early tributes: There are also signs today that the UK housing market is running out of steam, as economic uncertainty and rising inflation hit confidence. Nationwide, the building society, reported earlier this morning that annual house price inflation slowed to 4.3% in January, from 4.5% in December. Chief economist Robert Gardner warns that the housing market outlook \u201cremains clouded, especially as earnings growth is slowing. \u201cWith inflation set to rise further in the months ahead as a result of the weaker pound, real wages are likely to come under further pressure. Employment growth is also likely to continue to moderate, should the economy slow as most forecasters expect.\u201d More here: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that this will be a tough year for UK manufacturers:, even though output was strong in January. \u201cThe makers appear to have begun 2017 on a similarly strong note as they ended 2016. Granted, January\u2019s PMI dipped slightly to 55.9 from the 56.1 seen in the previous month. But this was well above both the average of 52.4 recorded in 2016 and even further above the survey\u2019s long-run norm of 51.5. \u201cMany of the details of January\u2019s survey were also reassuring. Output rose at the fastest rate since May 2014 and new orders and employment were also up. The domestic market accounted for the bulk of growth \u2013 while export orders continued to rise, the pace of expansion saw a noticeable slowdown. \u201cBut there were some ominous developments amongst signs of a sector in good fettle. The survey\u2019s measure of input price inflation rose to the highest since CIPS began collecting responses in 1992. Firms attributed this to the weak pound and rising commodity prices. January\u2019s pick-up in output prices was also close to a record. The acceleration in consumer price inflation presaged by these moves suggests that manufacturers will face an increasingly tough year as 2017 progresses.\u201d Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, also believes consumers are going to be hit in the pocket by this jump in raw material costs. With mounting evidence of pricing pressures across the industrial sector, the pass through to consumers is certainly on its way. This does present some risks to the resilience of the UK market later this year, in addition to the risks from further sharp swings in exchange rates and a shift in gears in global growth.\u201d How worried should consumers be about this record jump in factory input costs? Capital Economics reckon that firms are managing to absorb some of the impact, rather than simply passing everything on through higher prices in the shops: But David Noble, Group CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says people will be worried: Input costs rose at their fastest rate in 25 years and higher commodity prices made an impact on margins along with the weaker pound. With these ongoing cost burdens, manufacturers were no longer able to absorb these costs themselves as output prices grew at one of the fastest rates since records began. Consumers must soon be wondering whether these rising costs will impact on their daily life.\u201d Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, is encouraged that UK factory growth hit a 32-month high last month, despite the pressure from surging raw materials costs. \u201cToday\u2019s figures provide further evidence that manufacturers were quickly off the blocks in 2017 with strong growth in output and order books looking healthy, driven largely by domestic demand. Although the growing prospect of inflationary pressure looms large and the impact of Brexit continues to cause much uncertainty, it is encouraging to see that the manufacturing sector is just getting on with business as usual.\u201d This chart shows how the UK factories expanded in January: Dave Atkinson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, fears that factories will face further cost inflation in the coming months. There will be challenges ahead as import prices continue to rise, affecting bottom line profitability, while the impact of some companies\u2019 historical long-term currency hedging coming to an end may expose them to the devaluation of sterling that they have managed against to date. Worryingly, the export boost enjoyed by UK factories after the pound tumbled appears to be fading. Today\u2019s report from Markit says: The domestic market was the prime source of new business wins in January. There was also a modest increase in new export orders, although the pace of expansion was noticeably slower than during the prior survey month. Where an increase in new work from overseas was reported, this was linked to improving global market conditions and the weak sterling exchange rate. Oh. My. Goodness. The costs paid by British factories for raw materials jumped at a record rate last month, as the weak pound bites. Data firm Markit says that the input costs paid by UK manufacturers surged in January, sending its input prices index to a jaw-dropping 88.3, up from 77.7 in December. That\u2019s the highest level since this survey began in 1992 [any reading over 50 shows prices going up]. Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI report also shows that Britain\u2019s factory sector kept growing strongly last month, with output accelerating to a 32-month high. More than half the firms surveyed by Markit blamed the fall in sterling since last June\u2019s referendum for the jump in input costs. The recent rally in the oil price is also a factor, as it drives up energy prices and the cost of plastic. There are also signs that factories are passing these costs onto consumers; Markit\u2019s output prices index posted one of its biggest jumps ever. Brace for higher inflation. Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cUK manufacturers have reported a bumper start to 2017, but are also seeing prices rise at an unprecedented rate. Factory output growth accelerated to a 32-month high in January, as solid domestic demand continued to drive production volumes higher. There were signs that the boost to export orders from the weak exchange rate was waning, as growth of new business from abroad slowed sharply. \u201cThe big numbers coming out of the January survey were for the price measures. Input cost inflation spiked to the highest seen since data were first collected in 1992. Over 55% of companies link rising costs to the exchange rate. However, we\u2019re also seeing more companies reporting domestic supplier price hikes resulting from the rising cost of commodities such as fuel, oil, plastics and steel. With cost pressures increasingly feeding though to higher selling prices at factories, it looks inevitable that consumer price inflation will rise further in coming months. \u201cThe question is whether increased cost inflationary pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward. Companies seem fairly sanguine on this front, as a new index tracking business confidence signals optimism climbed to an eight- month high. Taken alongside robust output growth, rising new order inflows and job creation, all signs are pointing to a solid contribution to UK GDP from manufacturing during the opening quarter of 2017.\u201d Greek factories struggled in January due to particularly wintery weather, Markit reports: Greek manufacturers felt the effects of unexpected heavy snowfall in the opening month of the new year, with the health of the sector deteriorating at the sharpest pace since September 2015. The downturn was driven by marked declines in both output and new orders, subsequently leading firms to reduce their headcounts further. On the price front, input cost inflation accelerated to a 70-month high, however, firms lowered their selling prices. That led to the sharpest contraction in factory growth since autumn 2015. New orders fell, with new business from abroad shrinking for the fifth month running. Boom! Eurozone factories have posted their best month in almost six years, thanks to the strong growth in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. Markit\u2019s eurozone factory PMI, which tracks output and job creation across the sector, has risen to 55.2 in January, up from 54.9 in December. That\u2019s the best reading in 69 months, before the eurozone debt crisis exploded in 2011. Firms say they enjoyed the strongest rise in new business since the first half of 2011, leading to a surge in job creation. New exports grew at their fastest pace in three years, helping production levels to rise for the 43th month in a row. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the weak euro is helping eurozone companies boost their exports (something that has upset the Trump administration, of course). Williamson explains: \u201cEurozone manufacturing is off to a strong start to the year, enjoying the fastest rate of expansion for almost six years in January. \u201cRates of growth of new orders, exports and employment have all hit multi-year highs, with the depreciation of the euro playing a key role in helping drive new sales in export markets. \u201cOptimism about the year ahead has risen to the highest since the region\u2019s debt crisis, suggesting companies are maintaining a buoyant mood despite the heightened political uncertainty caused by Brexit and looming general elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany. \u201cInflationary pressures are also picking up. Much of the increase in costs and prices can be linked to the weakened exchange rate and higher global commodity prices. However, there are also signs of demand running ahead of supply, which hints at a tentative build-up of core inflationary pressures. \u201cIf current growth of manufacturing activity and the associated rise in prices is sustained, rhetoric at the ECB is likely to become more hawkish, albeit tempered with caution over the potential for political developments to cloud the outlook.\u201d Germany has also had a good month - with factory growth hitting the highest level in three years. Zut alors! France\u2019s factory sector has posted its best month in almost six years. The French manufacturing PMI jumped to 53.6 in January, the highest level in 68 months. Growth was driven by increases in output, new orders and employment, Markit says, Yesterday we learned that France\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the last three months of 2016 - today\u2019s report suggests growth remained solid this year. Alex Gill, Economist at IHS Markit, says: \u201cOperating conditions in the French goods-producing sector continued to improve at the start of 2017. Underlying sector growth was the sharpest round of job creation in over five-and-a-half years, with firms buoyed by further marked expansions in both output and new orders. These are encouraging signs given the broad desire in France to reduce its level of unemployment. However, uncertainty surrounding the political environment, including May\u2019s presidential elections, may serve to dampen demand in coming months and provide a headwind to the resurgent labour market.\u201d Italy\u2019s factory sector has made a \u2018solid start\u2019 to 2017, says Markit. Its manufacturing PMI has come in at 53, showing slightly slower growth than December when it hit 53.2. Markit explains: Rates of growth in output and total new orders were slightly slower than in December, but the pace of job creation in the sector picked up to the highest for nine months. European stock markets are rallying in early trading, thanks to this flurry of good factory data from Europe and Asia. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 51 points, to 0.75%, back to 7151. Other markets are also a sea of green, as traders put their worries about Donald Trump behind them. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Decent manufacturing figures from China and Japan lifted the European indices ahead of their own PMIs this Wednesday morning. Poland\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose to a two-year high last month, up to 54.8 from 54.3. Dutch factories also recorded robust growth, but at a slightly slower rate -- the Netherlands\u2019 PMI dipped to 56.5 from 57.3. Now it\u2019s Spain\u2019s turn to report factory data....and it looks good, with business sentiment rising and firms hiring more staff. That drove Spain\u2019s manufacturing PMI to its highest level since May 2015, rising to 55.6 last month from 55.3. Markit says: The Spanish manufacturing sector started 2017 in a similar fashion to how it ended 2016, with sharp rises in output and new orders recorded. The key highlight from the latest survey was the sharpest rise in employment since July 1998, while business sentiment picked up. Ireland\u2019s factories have reported the fastest rise in manufacturing output for 18 months. Russian factories have grown at their fastest pace in 70 months, says Markit, thanks to a boost in new orders. The Russian factory PMI rose to 54.7 in January, up from 53.7. That\u2019s the best reading since March 2011. Firms reported that they took on new staff to cope with a rise in new orders, which also led to a further build-up of backlogs of work. Samuel Agass, who compiled the survey, says: \u201cRussian manufacturers carried the momentum they built up during the closing stages of 2016 through to the new year, as firms recorded the sharpest improvement in operating conditions for nearly six years. \u201cThe sector continues to go from strength to strength, supported by robust demand for goods from domestic clients. Sweden\u2019s manufacturing sector had a stellar January - growing at the fastest pace in over six years. Asian stock markets gained ground today, as traders digested the solid economic data from Japan and China. Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.5%, while Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX200 rose by 0.8%. India\u2019s Sensex index is up almost 1%, after Markit reported that its factories returned to growth in January thanks to rising order books. In another encouraging sign, Japan\u2019s factory sector is growing at its fastest pace in almost three years. Markit reports that Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI rose to 52.7 in January, up from 52.4 - the highest reading since March 2014. Firms reported that output, new orders and employment all rose last month, Markit says: January data pointed to the sharpest increase in new work inflows since December 2015. Firms linked this to greater domestic and international demand as well as improved advertising. Reports of an increase in foreign demand was also backed by the survey data, with new export orders rising at the quickest rate in one year. Resulting from improved manufacturing conditions, manufacturers continued to hire additional workers in January. In fact, the rate of job-creation was little- changed from December\u2019s 32-month high. China got PMI Day off to a good start by reporting that factory growth was near a two-year high in January. The official Chinese PMI came in at 51.3, slightly below December\u2019s 51.4, but still showing growth [anything over 50 points indicates the sector expanded]. Economists were relieved that the PMI came close to November\u2019s two-year high of 51.7, suggesting that China is still avoiding a \u2018hard landing\u2019: China\u2019s official non-manufacturing PMI, which tracks the services sector, rose to 54.6 in January from 54.5 in December. That indicates that growth picked up. Capital Economics\u2019 China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard says that China\u2019s services firms are helping to cushion problems in the building sector: \u201cThe breakdown suggests that an acceleration in service sector activity offset a slowdown in the construction sector, which has been hit by the cooling property market and a reduction in fiscal support. The upshot is that China\u2019s recent recovery appears to remain largely intact for now.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a new month, which means a flood of economic surveys showing how the world\u2019s factories performed in January. Data firm Markit is reporting how manufacturing sectors across the the globe fared last month; this should help us see if the world economy began 2017 on the front foot. Overnight, the latest data from Asia has been quite encouraging (more in a moment). Here\u2019s the key timings. 8.15am GMT: Spain 8.45am GMT: Italy 8.50am GMT: France 8.55am GMT: Germany 9am GMT: The eurozone 9.30am GMT: The UK 2.45pm GMT: The United States Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: In the euro area, the day\u2019s main release is Spanish and Italian manufacturing PMIs for January. Both strengthened in December to recent highs; an 11-month high for Spain and a six month high for Italy. The readings in both look set to hold broadly at those levels in the January survey and we see no change this month as the manufacturing sector continues to benefit from buoyant euro area exports growth. Traders will also be waiting for the US Federal Reserve to announce its decision on monetary policy, at 7pm tonight. The Fed isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates, but it might drop hints about the chances of a hike in March. We\u2019ll also be watching the currency markets closely, after one of Donald Trump\u2019s advisers claimed the euro was \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d yesterday. And there\u2019s probably going to be more ructions in Greece, where the latest bailout review is mired in the sand again. Greek bond prices have been falling in recent days, on fears that talks with creditors are going nowhere, and some government MPs have begun speculating about a return to the drachma. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Factory output growth accelerated to a 32-month high in January, as solid domestic demand continued to drive production volumes higher. There were signs that the boost to export orders from the weak exchange rate was waning, as growth of new business from abroad slowed sharply. </p> <p>\u201cThe big numbers coming out of the January survey were for the price measures. Input cost inflation spiked to the highest seen since data were first collected in 1992. Over 55% of companies link rising costs to the exchange rate. However, we\u2019re also seeing more companies reporting domestic supplier price hikes resulting from the rising cost of commodities such as fuel, oil, plastics and steel. With cost pressures increasingly feeding though to higher selling prices at factories, it looks inevitable that consumer price inflation will rise further in coming months. </p> <p>\u201cThe question is whether increased cost inflationary pressure will act as a drag on manufacturing growth going forward. Companies seem fairly sanguine on this front, as a new index tracking business confidence signals optimism climbed to an eight- month high. Taken alongside robust output growth, rising new order inflows and job creation, all signs are pointing to a solid contribution to UK GDP from manufacturing during the opening quarter of 2017.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-01T11:01:17.619Z\">at 11.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5891a8f1e4b0e481c6e4979a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-01T09:26:54.900Z\">9.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greek factories struggled in January due to particularly wintery weather, Markit reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greek manufacturers felt the effects of unexpected heavy snowfall in the opening month of the new year, with the health of the sector deteriorating at the sharpest pace since September 2015.</p> <p>The downturn was driven by marked declines in both output and new orders, subsequently leading firms to reduce their headcounts further.

      "bodyText": "You can understand why Sir Charles Dunstone might think it a good idea to drop the non-executive lark and get busy as chairman of TalkTalk. In May 2015, his 31% stake was worth \u00a31.17bn but now, after the plunge in the share price from 400p to 168p, the value has fallen to \u00a3500m. That is a strong incentive to spend less time on the yacht. There is no suggestion that the departing chief executive, Dido Harding, is being pushed out against her will. She has done seven years in the post since TalkTalk demerged from Carphone Warehouse (total shareholder return for TalkTalk in that time, including dividends, has been 79%) and the pair were singing in harmony on Wednesday. Dunstone was lavish in his praise. The question for other investors is whether the return of a hands-on Dunstone heralds a rapid revival. TalkTalk occupies a tricky position, selling a cheap and cheerful \u201cvalue\u201d telecoms offer in an attempt to duck and weave between big beasts such as BT, Vodafone and Sky. An optimist would make two points. First, TalkTalk seems more stable after last October\u2019s \u201csimpler\u201d tariffs and rejig of contracts: the third quarter update said full-year operating profits will be as previously advertised, meaning around the \u00a3320m mark. Second, life in the value lane could become easier if BT and Sky press the pedal on prices to pay for their expensive football rights. Yet progress rarely runs so smoothly. If TalkTalk finds it needs to ShoutShout about its price credentials, more financial ammunition may be required. Half the City expects the dividend to be cut, which is why the yield has hit 9%, because of the hefty load of debt. A divi cut is indeed the way to bet. It is the safe thing to do, and Dunstone can afford to take some upfront financial pain for greater long-term gain. Sir Ken Morrison\u2019s plain speaking was much admired In the 1980s and 1990s, the retail industry\u2019s golden years, Sir Ken Morrison, who has died aged 85, was king. Morrisons was never the biggest supermarket chain in the land, but its chairman and driving force would have collected the \u201cmost admired\u201d gong in most years. The admiration of his peers flowed not only from the Bradford-based group\u2019s rigorous attention to detail. It was also because Morrison was gloriously immune to City diktats and fashions. Success, and the family\u2019s shareholding, meant he could do things his way. He didn\u2019t bother with PR folk and management consultants. Non-executive directors were a luxury he didn\u2019t require \u2013 he could hire two shop assistants for the same money and they would be more useful, he used to say. In 2004, on the day after the \u00a33bn purchase of Safeway, he strode into his new acquisition\u2019s head office and ignored standard pleasantries. \u201cThis is not a merger, it\u2019s a takeover,\u201d he declared. The Safeway deal, a disaster in its first few years, forced him to change some of his ways. Non-executives arrived (quite right, too) and Morrison, with his shareholding diluted, was obliged to explain himself to the City. But the plain-speaking remained, most famously after retirement when he turned up at the annual meeting in 2014 to take a pop at the then chief executive Dalton Philips. \u201cI have something like 1,000 bullocks and, having listened to your presentation, Dalton, you\u2019ve got a lot more bullshit than me,\u201d he said. The chairman at the time, Sir Ian Gibson, thought Morrison\u2019s intervention was \u201cill-judged, rude and unnecessary\u201d. Perhaps it was. But, as an example of clear communication, it was infinitely better than the robotic utterances one gets from most of today\u2019s corporate crowd. Is the EU softening its approach to the City? Michel Barnier, the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, gave a sniffy (semi) denial when this paper revealed minutes of a meeting that recorded him saying he wants the bloc to have \u201ca special relationship\u201d with the City of London after the UK\u2019s departure. But here comes another indication that the EU\u2019s stance on the City may not be as hardline as feared. The European commission\u2019s Brexit negotiators think a \u201cworkable\u201d deal with the City is needed. \u201cA badly designed final deal would damage both the UK and the other 27 EU member states,\u201d says a paper drawn up by officials. It is only a working paper, but it is also a statement of common sense. Several thousand City jobs will inevitably move, but upending the City at the moment of departure is not in either side\u2019s interests. The governor of the Bank of England was right when he said the UK is \u201cthe investment banker for Europe\u201d. A sensible agreement ought to be possible.",

Perhaps it was. But, as an example of clear communication, it was infinitely better than the robotic utterances one gets from most of today\u2019s corporate crowd.</p> <h2>Is the EU softening its approach to the City?</h2> <p>Michel Barnier, the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, gave a sniffy (semi) denial when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/13/eu-negotiator-wants-special-deal-over-access-to-city-post-brexit\">this paper revealed minutes of a meeting</a> that recorded him saying he wants the bloc to have \u201ca special relationship\u201d with the City of London after the UK\u2019s departure.</p> <p>But here comes another indication that the EU\u2019s stance on the City may not be as hardline as feared. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/01/eu-brexit-deal-city-leaked-report-european-parliament-article-50\">The European commission\u2019s Brexit negotiators think a \u201cworkable\u201d deal with the City is needed</a>. \u201cA badly designed final deal would damage both the UK and the other 27 EU member states,\u201d says a paper drawn up by officials.</p> <p>It is only a working paper, but it is also a statement of common sense. Several thousand City jobs will inevitably move, but upending the City at the moment of departure is not in either side\u2019s interests. The governor of the Bank of England was right when he said the UK is \u201cthe investment banker for Europe\u201d. A sensible agreement ought to be possible.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the City\u2019s biggest investors has put top company bosses on notice that excessive pay rises will be not be tolerated. Standard Life Investments \u2013 which is also putting Sports Direct under renewed investor pressure over its failure to address executive pay and governance \u2013 has signalled it is prepared to vote against pay rises for chief executives unless there is a convincing reason for them. With Imperial Brands having to abandon a resolution before its annual general meeting on Wednesday that would have led to a multimillion-pound a pay rise for its chief executive, Alison Cooper, major City investors appear ready to block huge renumeration deals during this year\u2019s AGM season. Euan Stirling, head of stewardship at the Edinburgh-based fund manager, said: \u201cThe remuneration committee will have to be very persuasive, that all other things being equal, the chief executive should be paid more.\u201d The government is consulting on reforms to executive pay and Theresa May also put boardroom pay on the agenda during her campaign to become prime minister. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest fund manager, has also seized the issue. Last month it wrote to the 350 biggest companies on the stock market to urge them to rein in excessive boardroom pay. Standard Life Investments published its stewardship update for 2016 in which it said it would continue to press for change on a number of issues at Sports Direct, including the excessive influence and dominance of founder Mike Ashley. \u201cWe have been concerned for some time about governance arrangements at Sports Direct,\u201d the annual governance report said. \u201cThe board lacks independence and the non-executive directors lack the appropriate skills and experience to enable robust challenge of the executive team, particularly the founder and major shareholder Mike Ashley. \u201cWe also have major concerns regarding its remuneration policy. We have engaged with senior executives and non-executives over many years on these issues, but to little effect. We will monitor future developments and expect to engage further over the coming year.\u201d Standard Life Investments (SLI) welcomed Ashley\u2019s appointment as chief executive last September, saying it was a role that better reflected his influence as majority shareholder and founder than his former \u201cill-defined\u201d position of executive deputy chairman. The fund management arm of insure Standard Life, which looks after \u00a3270bn of investments for savers and pensioners, welcomed Sports Direct\u2019s decision to allow an independent party to review governance but said it had concerns \u201cabout their ability to deliver\u201d. The report highlighted Sports Direct\u2019s treatment of its workers, which has been widely criticised after a Guardian investigation. Volkswagen was also singled out by the asset manager as an \u201cescalation candidate\u201d, suggesting SLI will put more pressure on the German car manufacturer to change its ways after the emissions scandal that rocked the VW group in 2015. \u201cWe continue to believe that increased board independence is crucial to rebuilding trust at Volkswagen and will continue to engage on this basis,\u201d SLI said. Stirling said investors had loudly voiced their anger about excessive boardroom pay deals last year when shareholder revolts shook some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, including BP and the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew. Stirling said: \u201cThe original shareholder spring of 2012 was replayed in 2016, with widespread dissent in shareholder ranks against excessive pay for management. We place particular emphasis on corporate culture and the impact of excessive remuneration and the responsibility of shareholders to hold boards to account. \u201cThe serious implications of failure in these areas suggest that further remedies are likely to be sought.\u201d Standard Life had voted against the \u00a370m pay deal for Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising group WPP, and \u201cescalated our action by voting against the members of the compensation committee\u201d, the fund manager said in its report. It abstained on pay at BP and against the pay deals at Shire pharmaceuticals, which also faced a shareholder revolt last year.",

    "webTitle": "Record rise in import costs dents growth in UK manufacturing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A record rise in the cost of imports in January has taken the shine off a strong performance by the manufacturing sector, which has rebounded since the Brexit vote to record its sixth consecutive months of expanding output. Manufacturers were forced to hike the cost of their goods by one of the widest margins in one month after the slump in the pound triggered a record rise in the cost of imports, according to the Markit/Cips purchasing managers survey. The rising cost of imports is expected to push up the price of UK-made goods over the coming year and send inflation from 1.6% to nearer 4%. Bank of England policymakers are expected to highlight in their quarterly inflation report on Thursday that price pressures in the economy are growing, especially in the manufacturing industry because the sector relies heavily on raw materials and components brought in from overseas. Car firms have warned the government that the fall in sterling against the dollar and the euro might not be enough to persuade them to continue investing in the UK if they face tariffs and higher regulatory costs on imports and exports to the European Union. Other industries with overseas suppliers are also known to be lobbying to stay inside the single market and maintain access to EU markets tariff free. Nevertheless, UK manufacturing enjoyed an increase in new orders and the fastest rise in activity since May 2014. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) slipped below December\u2019s two-and-a-half-year high of 56.1, but the small dip still left overall figure, at 55.9. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it was worrying that manufacturers were increasingly reliant on domestic demand, which could fade away once price rises feed into the supply chain. \u201cThe recovery in the manufacturing sector lost a little pace and narrowed to become almost exclusively dependent on domestic demand in January,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new export orders balance collapsed to 50.9 in January \u2013 its lowest level since May \u2013 from 58.5 in December. This emphatically shows that the benefits to manufacturers from sterling\u2019s depreciation remain far too modest to outweigh the costs for the rest of the economy in terms of high inflation.\u201d Tombs warned that the recent strong figures could prove to be a high watermark. \u201cDomestic demand faltered the last time producers increased prices this quickly in 2011, and we doubt that this time will be different,\u201d he said. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the survey told \u201ca positive story about the sector\u201d, with the all the important output and orders components remaining firmly in positive territory. She said inflationary pressures represented a cloud on the horizon and \u201cpresented some risks to the resilience of the UK market later this year\u201d. But Hopley was more upbeat about the industry\u2019s immediate prospects. \u201cRather than this being a case of the PMI defying gravity, the expansion in activity is being driven by more upbeat conditions at home and [by] demand in global markets [being] on a more stable footing than businesses have seen for some time. Additionally, there\u2019s some extra help fromsterling\u2019s depreciation,\u201d she said.",

Additionally, there\u2019s some extra help fromsterling\u2019s depreciation,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Ken Morrison, the man who took his father\u2019s small grocery chain and turned it into one of the UK\u2019s biggest retailers, has died aged 85. Morrison\u2019s family said he died peacefully at home in north Yorkshire after a short illness. A proud Yorkshireman, Morrison was highly respected in the retail world for his no-nonsense approach to shopkeeping. Known for his stinging wit, he told former boss Dalton Philips, who stalled the business even as he modernised it by moving into convenience stores and the internet, that his strategy was \u201cbullshit\u201d. Morrison had no time for modern fancies such as online retailing, but bought up abattoirs, vegetable packing sheds and pie-making factories as a way of keeping waste to a minimum. From when the company floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1967, it enjoyed almost four decades of unbroken sales and profit growth. The business was seen as a reliable, if rather dull, regional player which grew almost entirely under its own steam until Morrison did the deal of his life and bought the rival Safeway chain in 2004. It took Morrisons into the south of England and made it the UK\u2019s fourth largest grocer. It marked the beginning of a period of turmoil at the company, as it struggled to integrate two very different businesses, leading to a boardroom battles that finally led to Morrison\u2019s retirement in 2008. By that point it had 375 stores, serving over 9 million customers a week. Andrew Higginson, the current chairman of Morrisons, said: \u201cI know that I speak for the whole company when I say how profoundly sad we were to hear of Sir Ken\u2019s death. He was an inspirational leader and the driving force behind Morrisons for over half a century. Although he retired several years ago, his legacy is evident every day and in every aspect of our business. \u201cKen will be remembered by us all for his leadership, his passion for retailing and for his great love of Morrisons. To honour his memory in the most appropriate way we can, we will continue to develop the company that he built and loved.\u201d Morrison\u2019s family said: \u201cSir Ken was, of course, a unique figure in the history of grocery retailing in the UK, for more than half a century being the driving force at the heart of Morrisons as it grew from two market stalls to become one of the UK\u2019s largest retailers. \u201cBut to us he was a greatly committed and loving family man, as inspirational and central to us in our daily lives as he was in the business. His drive and ambition, quick intelligence and encyclopaedic knowledge were matched with a real curiosity in his fellow man. \u201cHe had a gentle humour and kindness about him and he could, and would, talk with genuine interest to anyone. He showed us all the importance of aiming high but never forgetting the practicalities of life and the humanity of those we deal with. \u201cA proud Yorkshireman, he never forgot his roots and had a real love for, and commitment to, the people and city of Bradford.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Southern rail commuters have launched a legal claim in an attempt to force the government to take action over the failing train service. An application for a judicial review of the Department for Transport\u2019s handling of the crisis was filed on Wednesday by lawyers for the Association of British Commuters. A spokeswoman for the group said: \u201cOur final grounds, submitted to court today, are the result of five months\u2019 hard work, and the extensive research of dozens of volunteers; who have supported our campaign by contributing their time and professional skills. Our donors, volunteers and supporters are the people who have been hit the hardest by the Southern rail crisis, and they deserve to play a part in finally bringing the government to account.\u201d The initial legal costs of \u00a326,000 have been crowdfunded by passengers, who have suffered widespread cancellations and delays on Southern since it became part of Govia Thameslink Railway\u2019s operation in 2015. The commuters are seeking a ruling on whether the DfT has failed to hold GTR to account for the long-term breakdown of Southern\u2019s service, and whether the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has indirectly discriminated against disabled passengers. Judges will be asked to consider a claim on four grounds. The first argues that the DfT has not properly enforced the management contract, with GTR having clearly breached performance benchmarks. The firm has claimed \u201cforce majeure\u201d, arguing that high rates of sickness and industrial action constituted factors outside its control, but the DfT has delayed its response for months. Three other grounds relate to the effects of Southern\u2019s service on disabled passengers, who have been unable to board crowded trains or travel without booking ahead in many cases. The claim argues this breaches the Equality Act, and that Grayling has committed further breaches by failing to act. The commuter group hit out at the DfT for its \u201cresistance to transparency\u201d, which it said meant it was impossible for them to clarify the true causes of the crisis. Emily Yates, a founder of the group, said: \u201cThere has long ceased to be any justification for the transport secretary\u2019s hands-off approach to a company that is his department\u2019s direct contractor.\u201d She added: \u201cWe began this process back in September, at a time when we felt we\u2019d already reached our last resort. That it has got so much worse, and the DfT have still not acted, now staggers belief. Commuters have long since passed the point of exhaustion, and it is a matter of shame on the department that we have had to go to such great lengths to ask them to finally take action on this failed company.\u201d The court must make an initial decision on whether the case will proceed. The commuters will launch a further crowdfunding campaign if it can pursue its legal challenge. The Campaign for Better Transport said it was a \u201cstep forward for passenger power\u201d. Spokeswoman Lianna Etkind said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely right that the government is held to account for the failings of the Southern franchise, which has made people\u2019s lives a misery. Fundamentally, the running of a train service is down to the contract between government and train operator, so the government\u2019s role in setting and enforcing the standards in the contract with Govia must be properly scrutinised.\u201d She said passengers\u2019 voices had been ignored in the tussle between Southern and the unions and that passenger representation should be written into future franchises. Faryal Velmi, the director of Transport for All, said Southern had been \u201callowed to treat disabled passengers as second-class citizens\u201d. She said: \u201cTransport for All has heard time and again from disabled transport users who feel Southern rail\u2019s network is now a no-go zone; impacting on people\u2019s ability to work and often leaving them increasingly isolated. The Department for Transport and rail industry must act urgently to prevent the basic rights of disabled passengers being flouted in this way.\u201d Talks are continuing this week between GTR and Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, to resolve the dispute that has intensified problems on Southern. A six-day strike in late January was suspended but little progress is understood to have been made in the row over the changing roles and responsibilities of drivers and on-board crew. A DfT spokesman declined to comment on ongoing legal proceedings. A GTR spokeswoman said: \u201cThe subject of a judicial review is a matter for the Department for Transport.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The European commission\u2019s Brexit negotiators must strike a \u201cworkable\u201d deal with Theresa May\u2019s government to protect the City of London or the economies of the remaining member states will be damaged, a leaked EU report warns. The document \u2013 which has been seen by the Guardian \u2013 describes it as critical for the economic health of the remaining member states that the current financial eco-system is not hit in the coming Brexit negotiations. The paper, drawn up by officials working for the European parliament\u2019s powerful committee on economic and monetary affairs (Econ), warns that UK-based financial services account for 40% of Europe\u2019s assets under management and 60% of its capital markets business. \u201cAnd UK-based banks provide more than \u00a31.1tn of loans to the other EU member states,\u201d the Econ secretariat\u2019s paper notes. \u201cIf financial services companies choose to leave the UK as a result of Brexit, the consequences should be carefully evaluated. \u201cA badly designed final deal would damage both the UK and the other 27 EU member states. \u201cThe exclusion of the main European financial centre from the internal market could have consequences in terms of jobs and growth in the EU. It is in the interest of EU 27 and the UK to have an open discussion on this point.\u201d The warning echoes recent comments from the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, when he claimed there are \u201cgreater short-term risks on the continent in the transition than there are in the UK\u201d. Last month, the European commission Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier was also reported to have told MEPs that with the City \u201cthere will be a special/specific relationship. There will need to be work outside of the negotiation box \u2026 in order to avoid financial instability.\u201d Barnier later denied making the remarks. \u201cWhen asked on equivalence I said: EU would need special vigilance on financial stability risk, not special deal to access the City,\u201d he tweeted. Equivalence is the mechanism whereby the UK\u2019s regulations and the EU\u2019s are to be regarded as of being of equal standing, allowing British-based financial institutions to continue to operate across the EU post-Brexit. However, the 26-page document, titled Impact of the UK withdrawal on Econ areas of competence, and dated 13 December, notes that an analysis of offering equivalence status to the UK has been designated as a priority by \u201cEcon coordinators\u201d. It says: \u201cGiven the considerable interdependence between the UK and the EU economy and financial systems, it is critical that a workable agreement is achieved that not only maintains high regulatory standards but also delivers growth and jobs across the EU ... \u201cAs an overriding principle, one can assume that after Brexit, the closer the UK remains to established EU regulatory standards, the greater the degree of access the UK can have to the single market \u2013 and vice versa, without prejudice to other considerations (eg the principle of the unity of the four freedoms). \u201cIf the UK does leave the single market and thereby resigns from the four freedoms and the jurisdiction of the court, then consideration could be given to tools such as third country/equivalence passporting regime, and this should be taken into account on existing regimes as well as future pieces of financial legislation: eg on securitisation.\u201d The revelation will provide some reassurance to the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, David Davis, as Britain prepares to trigger article 50 negotiations on 9 March. His claims in recent months that the EU has more to lose than the UK from the City\u2019s sudden departure from the EU\u2019s regulatory framework had been scoffed at by European diplomats. It will also provide the government with some firepower as the UK parliament debates the bill that will give Theresa May the power to trigger Brexit talks. Along with the risks the Econ committee sees in Brexit, the report does also foresees some positives for the EU\u2019s policy agenda in the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European institutions. The commission has recently proposed a single set of rules for the calculation of companies\u2019 taxable profits in the EU. The common consolidated corporate tax base would ensure that profits are shared between the EU member states in which a company is active. The report notes: \u201cWhile it is expected that the UK would oppose the CCCTB proposal (as was the case for the 2011 CCCTB proposal), the UK\u2019s departure from the EU may increase chances of reaching the required unanimity in council \u2013 although the UK is not the only member state to have opposed the CCCTB, and opposition from other member tates is likely to remain.\u201d It also suggests that the UK would have opposed a commission proposal for a \u201cdouble taxation dispute resolution mechanism\u201d, whereby companies and individuals would have recourse to a pan-European body if they were being taxed on the same profits by multiple national revenue bodies. \u201cWhile the UK may support the proposal in principle, it is rather unlikely that the UK would agree to a binding mediation and a decision-making body at EU level,\u201d the document says. \u201cAgain, the UK\u2019s departure from the EU may therefore increase chances of the proposal reaching the required unanimity in council.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK house prices grew at their weakest annual rate in more than a year in January, in an early sign of the property market slowdown predicted for 2017. Annual growth edged down from 4.5% in December to 4.3%, according to the mortgage lender Nationwide. It was the weakest since November 2015. On a monthly basis, the average price of a UK home edged up 0.2%, to \u00a3205,240, following a 0.8% rise in December. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said there were indications the housing market would soften in 2017, as household budgets come under pressure from higher consumer inflation at a time of weaker jobs and wage growth. \u201cThe outlook for the housing market remains clouded, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding economic prospects more broadly,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cOn the one hand, there are grounds for optimism. The economy has remained far stronger than expected in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there are tentative signs that conditions may be about to soften. \u201cThe economy is likely to slow through 2017 as the squeeze on household budgets intensifies and heightened uncertainty weighs on business investment and hiring.\u201d Nationwide predicts that growth in house prices will more than halve in 2017 to 2% from 4.5% in 2016. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said conditions for house buyers were likely to deteriorate progressively during 2017. Inflation has already started to rise as the impact of the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum feeds through to prices. A weaker pound makes imports from abroad more expensive. The headline rate UK inflation jumped to a two-and-a-half-year high of 1.6% in December from 1.2% in November, and is expected to rise to about 3% in the coming months. Looking back at trends over the last 60 years, Nationwide said the biggest gains in real house prices \u2013 comparing how much faster house prices have increased compared with goods and services more generally \u2013 were made in the 2000s. \u201cThese increases were spurred by a combination of strong and stable economic growth, a structural decline in interest rates and the further liberalisation of the financial system,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIn the decades ahead, real house price trends will continue to depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, though there is an even greater degree of uncertainty around this than usual.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dido Harding, the chief executive of TalkTalk, is to stand down 18 months after the company was hit by a cyber-attack affecting tens of thousands of customers. Harding, who said she wanted to focus on \u201cmore activities in public service\u201d, will leave the company in May. \u201cI\u2019m a really big believer in chief executives not staying forever,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter seven extraordinary and fulfilling years, during which we have transformed TalkTalk\u2019s customer experience and laid the foundations for long-term growth, I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time for me to start handing over the reins at TalkTalk and focus more on my activities in public service.\u201d She said that her decision to leave had nothing to do with the cyber-attack, which she said was \u201cancient history, [there is] no connection at all\u201d. The company\u2019s share price is down almost 30% on a year ago but Harding said she did not feel like she was departing a business that was not in good shape. \u201cIt is never \u2018job done\u2019 in a challenger telco [company] ever,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the view that two-term presidency rule is a pretty good one and CEOs shouldn\u2019t overstay their welcome. It is time to start the process of transitioning. I am enormously proud of how we have transformed the TalkTalk customer experience.\u201d Harding is a member of the House of Lords, a trustee of digital inclusion charity Doteveryone and a non-executive director of the Bank of England. She was paid \u00a32.81m in 2015 despite the cyber-attack costing the company \u00a360m and 101,000 customers. Her total remuneration was more than double the \u00a31.05m she had received in 2014, as her \u00a3550,000 salary was bolstered by a \u00a31.97m payout under TalkTalk\u2019s long-term incentive plan. The company cut her cash bonus in half, from \u00a3432,000 to \u00a3220,000, as a result of the cyber-attack. She donated the bonus to the charity Ambitious about Autism in recognition of the problems caused by the attack. Harding will work just two months of TalkTalk\u2019s next financial year starting in April, but will be paid her full \u00a3550,000 annual salary. In addition, she will receive a payout of about \u00a3350,000 relating to TalkTalk\u2019s long-term incentive plan (LTIP), on the basis of the company\u2019s share price on Wednesday. The actual payout level will be determined when TalkTalk reports its full results for 2016 in May. Harding also holds a personal shareholding of more than 4.4m shares, just under 2% of TalkTalk, which at Wednesday\u2019s share price was worth almost \u00a37.5m. Tristia Harrison, currently the managing director of TalkTalk\u2019s consumer operation, will take over from Harding as chief executive. Harrison, who has been on the TalkTalk board since 2014, has worked at the company for seven years. Charles Dunstone, the non-executive chairman of TalkTalk, will move into the role of executive chairman after he steps down as the chair of Dixons Carphone on 1 May. Dunstone said that leaving the Carphone Warehouse business he founded 27 years ago showed his commitment to TalkTalk\u2019s future. \u201cIt really is the end of an era. It is very emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cTake that as a reflection of my dedication to TalkTalk and belief in what we can do with it. This is [now] my main focus. I\u2019m excited at the prospect of spending more time on TalkTalk, beginning with delivering another successful performance this year.\u201d He said he is taking the executive chairman role because the team taking over from Harding, which includes TalkTalk Business chief Charles Bligh stepping up to chief operating officer, needed time to bed in. \u201cWe have a great new team here but they haven\u2019t run a public company before so I really need to step up and help them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could never say I was a non-executive could you, having founded the business. It\u2019s about putting more time and effort into TalkTalk. There is such a role for a challenger brand and it has so much more to do.\u201d He will remain as a senior adviser to Dixons Carphone, which has appointed Lord Livingston, a former chief executive of BT, as its new chairman. Dunstone, who created TalkTalk in 2002, said that Harding had been a \u201ctireless, energetic and effective force for good from the day she joined\u201d. \u201cShe has helped transform TalkTalk into a much stronger business,\u201d he said. \u201cShe leaves with our thanks and very best wishes for the future.\u201d In October, TalkTalk was hit with a record \u00a3400,000 fine for the security failings that led to the company being hacked in October 2015. The hack resulted in the attacker accessing the personal information of more than 150,000 customers of the internet service provider, including sensitive financial data for more than 15,000 people. The previous highest fine ever issued by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was \u00a3350,000, against Prodial, a spam-calling company responsible for more than 46m automated nuisance calls. TalkTalk\u2019s results for the third quarter of its financial year, the three months to the end of December, were in line with analyst expectations. The company lost 42,000 broadband customers and 31,000 TV customers as revenues fell from \u00a3459m to \u00a3435m year on year for the period. However, the company said that the launch of fixed low-price plans in October, as well as more service improvements, is starting to pay off with a return to customer growth expected in the first three months of the year and a lowering in the rate of customers leaving to rivals. TalkTalk\u2019s share price rose by 7% to 167p.",

      "bodyText": "The surprising resilience of consumer spending in the months since the Brexit vote has forced one of the UK\u2019s leading economic thinktanks to revise up its growth forecasts for the second time since the referendum. In its quarterly health check of the economy, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said it now expected growth of 1.7% this year \u2013 only slightly down on the 2% recorded in 2016. It predicted that only the US \u2013 at 2.1% \u2013 would have faster growth among the G7 major industrialised nations than the UK this year. Next year, Britain is expected to grow by 1.9%, behind the US and Canada at 2.2%, but above Japan, Germany, France and Italy. NIESR, along with most other forecasters, had expected a more rapid slowdown in the economy after the vote on 23 June to leave the EU, and in its first post-Brexit report in August 2016 predicted that growth would be 1% in 2017. The thinktank revised its 2017 forecast up to 1.4% in November after official figures showed the economy bouncing back rapidly from the immediate shock of the referendum. Following a second quarterly 0.6% expansion in output, the thinktank said it was upgrading its estimate for a second time. NIESR said it remained convinced that the economy would slow this year as higher inflation reduced consumer spending power. \u201cWe expect the composition of growth to rebalance towards net trade, as the headwinds facing households from the erosion of their real incomes weigh on consumer spending while the depreciation of sterling supports net trade,\u201d said Simon Kirby, NIESR\u2019s head of macroeconomic forecasting. Kirby added that even after the latest upgrade, UK growth in the current year would still be slower than the 2.7% that had been pencilled in for 2017 before the Brexit vote. He said he expected inflation to peak at close to 4% by late 2017. NIESR\u2019s new forecast comes ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s quarterly inflation report tomorrow, which will also include a growth upgrade for 2017. The thinktank said its economic modelling showed that the benefits of the free-trade deals the government hopes to sign with the US, Canada and leading emerging economies would be dwarfed by the damage caused to exports of both goods and services to the EU. Monique Ebell, an NIESR research fellow, said that even if the UK succeeded in its objective of striking a bespoke deal with its former EU partners, trade would still fall by 22% over time. By contrast, free trade deals with the so-called Brics \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 would increase trade by 2.2% and similar deals with Anglo-Saxon countries such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand would boost trade by 2.6%. Ebell said it would take time for the impact of changing trade patterns to be felt, but predicted that after 15 years the economy would be just over 2% smaller than if it stayed in the EU. Spending on essentials jumps as inflation bites The NIESR report comes amid fresh signs that households are having to spend a growing chunk of their monthly budgets on essentials such as food and fuel, which will fan fears that consumer spending is set to slow this year. Against the backdrop of rising inflation, spending on groceries grew at its fastest pace since mid-2013 in December, jumping by 2.9% from a year earlier, according to a monthly report into household outlays by Lloyds Bank. Overall, spending on essentials rose for the fourth month running in December, up by 1.8%. Spending on petrol and diesel, which had declined consecutively for almost three years until rising in September 2016, rose sharply by 9% year-on-year in December. That was the biggest year-on-year increase since the bank started compiling its spending report in February 2013. The bank also found further evidence that households were growing more worried about rising prices as the weak pound makes imports to the UK more expensive and that gets passed on to consumers. In Lloyds\u2019s latest consumer survey, conducted with pollsters Ipsos Mori, the percentage of people with a negative view of inflation rose to 51% in December compared with 49% in November. More than half of the 2,000 account holders polled, or 56%, said they planned to cut back on non-essential spending in January. Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds Bank, said: \u201cThe surge in essential spending over the last few months shows no sign of abating. With a majority of people expressing concern around current levels of inflation, it\u2019s no surprise that most consumers plan to cut back on luxury items. A squeeze on household budgets now looks ever more certain as we move through 2017.\u201d",
