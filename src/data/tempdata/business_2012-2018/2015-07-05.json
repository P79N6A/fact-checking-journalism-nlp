      "bodyText": "Greece delivered a landslide no vote to the eurozone\u2019s terms for the country remaining in the single currency on Sunday night, unleashing a seismic political shift that could derail the European project. The verdict confronts the EU\u2019s leadership with one of its most severe crises of confidence and leaves Greece facing potential financial collapse and exit from the euro. In a polarising referendum called by the radical leftist government of Alexis Tsipras at only eight days\u2019 notice, Greeks voted by more than 60% to 40% in support of the prime minister, spurning the extra austerity demanded \u2013 mainly by Germany and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 in return for an extension of bailout funds. Five years of failed austerity policies in Greece and a total breakdown in trust between the leftwing Syriza alliance and the political leaders of its creditors climaxed in a national vote in which Greeks said no to the spending cuts and tax increases demanded by its lenders. Tsipras said that Greece \u201chas proved that democracy cannot be blackmailed; Greece has made a brave choice and one which will change the debate in Europe. \u201cI understand that voters have not given me a mandate against Europe, but a mandate for a sustainable future.\u201d He warned, though, that there would be \u201cno easy solutions\u201d. Early on Monday morning, Tsipras met with the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, and asked him to convene a meeting of Greek political party leaders. \u201cWe must move forward immediately with negotiations \u2026 a strong national front must be created to seek an immediate solution,\u201d Tspiras told Pavlopoulos after the vote. As the magnitude of the result became clear, thousands of no voters began pouring into Syntagma square in front of the parliament in Athens to celebrate, waving Greek flags and chanting \u201cNo, no.\u201d As the no camp partied, the news came that Antonis Samaras, head of the opposition rightwing New Democracy party and former prime minister, who campaigned for a yes vote, had resigned, bringing more cheers from crowds in the square. In a televised address on Sunday night, Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, said the no vote was a rejection of the \u201ciron cage\u201d of the eurozone. \u201cToday\u2019s no is a big yes to democratic Europe. A no to a vision of the eurozone as a boundless iron cage for its people. From tomorrow, Europe, whose heart tonight beats in Greece, starts healing its wounds, our wounds.\u201d The sweeping victory for Tsipras, who challenged the might of Germany, France, Italy and the rest of the eurozone, represented a nightmare for the mainstream elites of the EU. With Greek banks closed, withdrawals limited, capital controls in place and the country rapidly running out of cash, emergency action will be needed almost immediately to stem the likelihood of a banking collapse. But it is not clear whether the European Central Bank will maintain a liquidity lifeline to Greece and whether the creditor governments of the eurozone will sanction instant moves to salvage Greece\u2019s crashing financial system. Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and social democratic leader, Sigmar Gabriel, said Tsipras had burned his bridges with the rest of the eurozone. But the Greek leader believes he has strengthened his negotiating hand. Tsipras campaigned for a no vote, arguing that this was the best way to secure a better deal, keeping Greece in the euro while obtaining debt relief from its creditors. The leaders of Germany, France and others stated the opposite: that a no vote meant the Greeks were deciding to become the first country to quit the currency, membership of which is supposed to be irreversible. It is not clear which view will prevail. The EU mainstream hoped for a yes vote, not only because it would have represented democratic assent to the euro and acceptance of austerity, but also because the Tsipras government would have come under strong pressure to stand down. Negotiations between the two sides have gone nowhere for five months and have become particularly rancorous in the past month as bailout and debt repayment deadlines came and went, with Athens missing a \u20ac1.5bn repayment to the IMF. The country now faces a \u20ac3.5bn payment to redeem bonds at the European Central Bank in two weeks. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the eurozone group of finance ministers, said the result was \u201cvery regrettable\u201d for the future of Greece. \u201cFor recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities,\u201d he said. Eurozone confidence in Tsipras is at rock bottom and there is virtually zero faith that he will implement the reforms needed to secure cash even if he agrees to them. For his part, the fiery Greek leader as recently as Friday accused his eurozone creditors of blackmail, extortion, and seeking to humiliate his country. Predicting what happens next in the five-year saga that has shaken the eurozone to its foundations is sheer guesswork. But the Greek vote is a huge blow to EU leaders, particularly the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has dominated the crisis management through her insistence on fiscal rigour and cuts despite a huge economic slump, soaring unemployment and the immiseration of most of Greek society. \u201cThe failure of the euro means the failure of Merkel\u2019s [10-year] chancellorship,\u201d said the cover of the latest issue of Der Spiegel, the German weekly. It depicted her sitting atop a Europe in ruins. As the austerity rejectionists partied into the night, key Greek officials said they believed the Syriza victory strengthened their hand for further negotiations with the creditors since opinion polls also consistently show that Greeks want to stay in the euro and because there is no legal avenue for kicking a country out. \u201cThe first thing is that the IMF report proves that the debt is not viable and secondly that there is a new popular mandate as it would seem from the apparent result of the referendum,\u201d said Euclid Tsakalotos, the chief Greek negotiator with creditors. The report he referred to was an internal document obtained by the Guardian last week, in the runup to the referendum, which supported Greek calls for writing down the country\u2019s unmanageable debt level, a proposal that is anathema to Berlin. Merkel agreed in a phone call with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Sunday night that a eurozone leaders\u2019 summit should be held on Tuesday, a German government spokesman said. The chancellor and president also agreed that the referendum result should be respected, said the spokesman. France\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace confirmed the leaders want a summit on Tuesday, and Merkel is due to travel to Paris for dinner with Hollande on Monday. Late Sunday night, European Council president Donald Tusk said he has called a eurozone summit for Tuesday to discuss the situation in Greece. Since Tsipras sprung his referendum on eurozone leaders just over a week ago, following an EU summit in Brussels, Merkel and Hollande have struck completely opposed positions. The chancellor has closed down any prospect of negotiations until after the vote took place while the president had insisted on a quick agreement with Greece. The referendum was highly contested. The no/yes question was complicated, relating to the acceptability of creditor terms for an extension of Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn of bailouts since 2010. Exactly what a no or a yes verdict signalled was also a point of much debate. The Council of Europe democracy watchdog complained that the referendum\u2019s organisation entailed a litany of how not to conduct such exercises. Besides, the bailout terms that voters were deciding on had already been withdrawn by the creditors when the scheme expired last Tuesday without an agreement. But Tsipras and his flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have been hugely vindicated following a big gamble which will resonate in Greece and Europe for years to come. And even though the terms which were voted on had already been withdrawn, they have now been so definitively rejected by democratic ballot that the eurozone\u2019s scope for negotiation is effectively narrowed. Kosmas Papadopoulos, who turned 18 in March, said: \u201cI am voting no because we have to say \u2018no\u2019 to the rotten system.\u201d Fiddling with a large silver earring in his left ear, he said: \u201cI have never known anything else. There must be something better out there.\u201d On Sunday night, voices were already being raised in German banking and trade circles that the scale of the no vote meant that Greece would need to exit the euro. Events rather than legal and political niceties may now determine that outcome, with Greek banks believed unable to reopen without a fresh infusion of cash via the ECB. Its governing council is also to confer today. If it decides not to supply more liquidity to the Greek banking system on the grounds it may be throwing good money after bad as a default looms, the Greek banks will not be able to stay afloat for long, despite claims from the Tsipras government that they will be open this week. In anticipation of a possible Greek collapse, there is expected to be turmoil when the financial markets open on Monday. Around the world, bankers and investors prepared to meet to discuss the implications of the outcome. The ECB, which last weekend capped the emergency lending it provides to Greece\u2019s banks, is also due to meet on Monday. The ECB\u2019s move triggered the imposition of a \u20ac60 restriction on daily cash withdrawals and there was concern that, with \u20ac20 notes running out, the limit might have to be reduced to \u20ac50. Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the result and that Greece\u2019s rejection of reforms \u201ccannot mean that they will get the money easier\u201d. \u201cWe will not go gently into this good night. We stand united and we need to respond to this situation as soon as possible,\u201d he said. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the executive board of the ECB, hinted at support. \u201cIn the current circumstances of great uncertainty in Europe and the world, our will to act in this matter should not be doubted,\u201d he said on Sunday. But that comment was viewed as an encouragement for a yes vote. According to Der Spiegel, Merkel concluded over the last three weeks of frantic and high-stakes negotiations with Tsipras that the Greek leader was a \u201chard and ideological\u201d gambler. He was \u201cdriving his country to the wall\u201d, \u201cplaying roulette with an entire country\u201d, she told a private meeting of her Christian Democrats over the last week, the news magazine reported. The no vote was supported by the hard left and the neo-fascist right in Greece, while the mainstream centre-left and centre-right campaigned for a yes vote. Tsipras appeared cool and relaxed casting his ballot. \u201cA day of celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy has defeated fear.\u201d",

It depicted her sitting atop a Europe in ruins.<br></p> <p> As the austerity rejectionists partied into the night, key Greek officials said they believed the Syriza victory strengthened their hand for further negotiations with the creditors since opinion polls also consistently show that Greeks want to stay in the euro and because there is no legal avenue for kicking a country out.<br></p> <p> \u201cThe first thing is that the IMF report proves that the debt is not viable and secondly that there is a new popular mandate as it would seem from the apparent result of the referendum,\u201d said Euclid Tsakalotos, the chief Greek negotiator with creditors. The report he referred to was an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed\">internal document obtained by the Guardian last week</a>, in the runup to the referendum, which supported Greek calls for writing down the country\u2019s unmanageable debt level, a proposal that is anathema to Berlin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed\">IMF: austerity measures would still leave Greece with unsustainable debt</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Merkel agreed in a phone call with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Sunday night that a eurozone leaders\u2019 summit should be held on Tuesday, a German government spokesman said. The chancellor and president also agreed that the referendum result should be respected, said the spokesman. France\u2019s \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace confirmed the leaders want a summit on Tuesday, and Merkel is due to travel to Paris for dinner with Hollande on Monday. Late Sunday night, European Council president Donald Tusk said he has called a eurozone summit for Tuesday to discuss the situation in Greece.</p> <p> Since Tsipras sprung his referendum on eurozone leaders just over a week ago, following an EU summit in Brussels, Merkel and Hollande have struck completely opposed positions. The chancellor has closed down any prospect of negotiations until after the vote took place while the president had insisted on a quick agreement with Greece.<br></p> <p> The referendum was highly contested. The no/yes question was complicated, relating to the acceptability of creditor terms for an extension of Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn of bailouts since 2010. Exactly what a no or a yes verdict signalled was also a point of much debate. The Council of Europe democracy watchdog complained that the referendum\u2019s organisation entailed a litany of how not to conduct such exercises. Besides, the bailout terms that voters were deciding on had already been withdrawn by the creditors when the scheme expired last Tuesday without an agreement.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jul/06/greek-referendnum-no-oxi-syntagma-athens-reaction-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4ad47\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2332186\"            data-video-name=\"Greece's judgment day as country went to the polls \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436142472895/Greece-referendum-Domoko-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457414018\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436142472895/Greece-referendum-Domoko-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Many Greeks spent the day of the vote still locked in debate. Video by John Domokos</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But Tsipras and his flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have been hugely vindicated following a big gamble which will resonate in Greece and Europe for years to come. And even though the terms which were voted on had already been withdrawn, they have now been so definitively rejected by democratic ballot that the eurozone\u2019s scope for negotiation is effectively narrowed.<br></p> <p>Kosmas Papadopoulos, who turned 18 in March, said: \u201cI am voting no because we have to say \u2018no\u2019 to the rotten system.\u201d Fiddling with a large silver earring in his left ear, he said: \u201cI have never known anything else. There must be something better out there.\u201d<br></p> <p>On Sunday night, voices were already being raised in German banking and trade circles that the scale of the no vote meant that Greece would need to exit the euro. Events rather than legal and political niceties may now determine that outcome, with Greek banks believed unable to reopen without a fresh infusion of cash via the ECB. Its governing council is also to confer today. If it decides not to supply more liquidity to the Greek banking system on the grounds it may be throwing good money after bad as a default looms, the Greek banks will not be able to stay afloat for long, despite claims from the Tsipras government that they will be open this week.<br></p> <p> In anticipation of a possible Greek collapse, there is expected to be turmoil when the financial markets open on Monday. Around the world, bankers and investors prepared to meet to discuss the implications of the outcome.<br></p> <p> The ECB, which last weekend capped the emergency lending it provides to Greece\u2019s banks, is also due to meet on Monday. The ECB\u2019s move triggered the imposition of a \u20ac60 restriction on daily cash withdrawals and there was concern that, with \u20ac20 notes running out, the limit might have to be reduced to \u20ac50.</p> <p>Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, Slovakia\u2019s finance minister, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the result and that Greece\u2019s rejection of reforms \u201ccannot mean that they will get the money easier\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe will not go gently into this good night. We stand united and we need to respond to this situation as soon as possible,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the executive board of the ECB, hinted at support. \u201cIn the current circumstances of great uncertainty in Europe and the world, our will to act in this matter should not be doubted,\u201d he said on Sunday. But that comment was viewed as an encouragement for a yes vote.<br></p> <p> According to Der Spiegel, Merkel concluded over the last three weeks of frantic and high-stakes negotiations with Tsipras that the Greek leader was a \u201chard and ideological\u201d gambler. He was \u201cdriving his country to the wall\u201d, \u201cplaying roulette with an entire country\u201d, she told a private meeting of her Christian Democrats over the last week, the news magazine reported.<br></p> <p> The no vote was supported by the hard left and the neo-fascist right in Greece, while the mainstream centre-left and centre-right campaigned for a yes vote.<br></p> <p> Tsipras appeared cool and relaxed casting his ballot. \u201cA day of celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy has defeated fear.\u201d<br></p>",

He has said he is on a \u201cwar footing\u201d. The governor of the central bank, the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, is also likely to be summoned amid fears that Greece\u2019s banks are close to being completely depleted of cash. Banks are reported to have only some \u20ac500m left in cash \u2013 equal to just \u20ac45 (\u00a332) per head of the 11 million-strong population. The stakes are high: before the result of the referendum, Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cWithout new money, salaries won\u2019t be paid, the health system will stop functioning, the power network and public transport will break down, and they won\u2019t be able to import vital goods because nobody can pay.\u201d Where does this leave the bailout negotiations? Greece\u2019s negotiating team was set to fly to Brussels where they will attempt to get eurozone leaders back to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, Angela Merkel, the German premier, is flying to Paris on Monday evening to meet her French counterpart, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in a move that suggests no immediate deal. Will the European Central Bank cut off Greece\u2019s liquidity? The European Central Bank holds the key. Led by Mario Draghi, it is scheduled to meet on Monday morning to decide whether to extend its \u201cemergency liquidity assistance\u201d (ELA) to Greek banks. So far, it has pledged \u20ac89bn and it was the ECB\u2019s decision last week not to offer more that led to capital controls being put in place. Greece will ask for help again. If the ELA was suspended altogether it would ultimately propel Greece towards a euro exit. Analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said: \u201cThe Greek government has already clearly indicated that it is not actively seeking to take the country out of the euro. We have long argued that the day the ECB cuts off ELA is de facto the day that Greece would leave the euro\u201d. But the ECB seems unlikely to want to do that, says SocGen. How will the markets react? Investors get to react to the shock referendum result once markets start trading in Asia at 2.30am London time on Monday. Barclays had teams of foreign exchange traders at their desks from 5pm on Sunday night in preparation for any moves in the currency markets. The focus will be on the euro \u2013 which has already been under pressure \u2013 but also on government bonds and stock markets. Goldman Sachs has predicted that there could be an initial 10% wiped off the European shares. Is Greece more likely to leave the euro? While Tspiras has said a no vote would give him a better negotiating hand with his creditors, analysts at Deutsche Bank are sceptical. According to its analysis, one potential scenario is that Tsipras\u2019s Syriza government is replaced with one of national unity to enable a new deal to be made with creditors. The Deutsche analysts also think it possible that a no vote will result in a Grexit. \u201cWe see the probability of Grexit increasing the larger the margin of victory of the no vote,\u201d the Deutsche analysts said. What about the UK? In the UK, George Osborne, the chancellor, will hold crisis meetings with the prime minister, David Cameron, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. Carney had already been attending meetings of Cobra \u2013 behind-the-scenes talks at the highest level of government \u2013 as the Greece crisis was deepening last week and said that contingency plans to deal with repercussions if Greece exits the euro are being put in place. When is the next deadline? Greece missed a payment to the International Monetary Fund last week and the clock will tick down to 20 July when Greece must repay \u20ac3.5bn to the ECB \u2013 the final deadline, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s membership of the euro hangs by a gossamer thread after the victory for the no side in the country\u2019s referendum. The cash machines are running out of money and the economy is in freefall. The fate of the home of democracy is not in its own hands. If it chooses to do so, the European Central Bank could force Athens to default on its debts and issue its own currency on Monday morning by withdrawing emergency support for the Greek banking system. That looks unlikely. The ECB has so far avoided taking overtly political decisions during this crisis, so it will avoid pulling the plug while talks are still going on between Greece and its creditors, and Athens wants talks to resume immediately. There are, though, a number of ways events could play out. Almost every European leader of note sought last week to put the frighteners on the Greek people, warning them that a victory for \u201cno\u201d meant leaving the single currency. Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi and the rest now have to put up or shut up. More than likely they will shut up, at least for now. Emergency assistance for Greece will continue while the troika of the European commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund sees how events in Greece unfold. Despite the decisive result, Greece\u2019s eurozone partners will not offer notably softer terms than those that were on the table when Tsipras walked out of negotiations just over a week ago. Merkel, for one, would be in serious political trouble if she did. The temptation for the creditors could be to let the Greeks sweat a bit, to see if a couple of weeks of a cashless economy can do what the referendum could not: effect regime change. Tsipras would be under pressure to resign and call fresh elections if the economic news worsens, and that might result in the election of a government more amenable to the rest of Europe. But playing it long is risky. Greece might be forced out of the euro before Tsipras gets round to resigning, so desperate is its economic plight. What the creditors should do is to respect the result of the referendum, realise that they have to give Greece something in order to prevent the crisis escalating out of control, and recognise that debt relief must be an explicit part of a funding package that will see the eurozone\u2019s weakest member through the next couple of years. Put simply, they should try a bit less stick and a bit more carrot. Whether they will do so remains to be seen. Indeed, the relentless mishandling of Greece ever since the crisis first flared up in 2010 suggests that blunder will follow blunder. It doesn\u2019t help that relations between Greece and the other 18 members of the eurozone are now so sour. The chances of Greece leaving the euro by mistake, just as Lehman Brothers went bust by mistake in 2008, are reasonably high. All options currently remain open. Greece could do what Cyprus did: default on some of its debts while staying in the euro. Tsipras could decide to accept the tax increases and the pension cuts demanded by the creditors while receiving only minor and vague concessions on debt relief. Greece could have run out of money and be out of the euro within 24 hours. Some things though are clear. Firstly, the Greeks have said no to austerity rather than to membership of the euro. Tsipras does not have a mandate to bring back the drachma, even if that is where this all ends. Secondly, the referendum result means both economic and political chaos. As Joan Hoey of the Economist Intelligence Unit put it even before the vote: \u201cGreece is angry and fearful; divided and conflicted.\u201d Inevitably, Greece faces a fresh period of acute economic pain. It will take months, if not years, to recover from the events of the past week, even if there is a speedy resolution to the crisis. The Greek economy has already shrunk by a quarter in the past five years. Thirdly, it is no longer possible to kick the can down the road. Any solution to the Greek crisis that involves more austerity without measures designed to get the economy growing again and to make the country\u2019s debt sustainable will be a pyrrhic victory. The upshot would be a period of feeble growth and mounting indebtedness that would bring the possibility of Grexit back on the agenda. Sooner rather than later, in all likelihood. Fourthly, this is the most serious crisis in the euro\u2019s relatively short history. There have been confident pronouncements that Greece has been quarantined so that there will be no knock-on effects on the rest of the eurozone. Such sentiments will be tested to the full if there is a Grexit. Share prices will inevitably take a tumble when the financial markets open for business, but more attention should be paid to the bond yields \u2013 or interest rates \u2013 on the sovereign debt of other eurozone members seen as vulnerable. The short-term problem for Merkel and Hollande is obvious. If they take a tough line in talks with Athens, they will get the blame for Greece\u2019s departure from the single currency. The longer-term problem is perhaps even more serious.

      "body": "<p>Greece\u2019s membership of the euro hangs by a gossamer thread after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/05/greece-referendum-early-results-historic-no-vote-against-austerity\">the victory for the no side</a> in the country\u2019s referendum. The cash machines are running out of money and the economy is in freefall.</p> <p>The fate of the home of democracy is not in its own hands. If it chooses to do so, the European Central Bank could force Athens to default on its debts and issue its own currency on Monday morning by withdrawing emergency support for the Greek banking system.</p> <p>That looks unlikely. The ECB has so far avoided taking overtly political decisions during this crisis, so it will avoid pulling the plug while talks are still going on between Greece and its creditors, and Athens wants talks to resume immediately. <br></p> <p>There are, though, a number of ways events could play out. Almost every European leader of note sought last week to put the frighteners on the Greek people, warning them that a victory for \u201cno\u201d meant leaving the single currency. Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi and the rest now have to put up or shut up.</p> <p>More than likely they will shut up, at least for now. Emergency assistance for Greece will continue while the troika of the European commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund sees how events in Greece unfold. Despite the decisive result, Greece\u2019s eurozone partners will not offer notably softer terms than those that were on the table when Tsipras walked out of negotiations just over a week ago. Merkel, for one, would be in serious political trouble if she did.<br></p> <p>The temptation for the creditors could be to let the Greeks sweat a bit, to see if a couple of weeks of a cashless economy can do what the referendum could not: effect regime change. Tsipras would be under pressure to resign and call fresh elections if the economic news worsens, and that might result in the election of a government more amenable to the rest of Europe.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jul/06/greek-referendnum-no-oxi-syntagma-athens-reaction-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4ad47\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2332186\"            data-video-name=\"Greece's judgment day as country went to the polls \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Guardian\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436142472895/Greece-referendum-Domoko-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-457414018\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436142472895/Greece-referendum-Domoko-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/07/06/150706greekreferendum_FromGAus.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Greece\u2019s judgment day: Video by John Domokos and Phoebe Greenwood</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But playing it long is risky. Greece might be forced out of the euro before Tsipras gets round to resigning, so desperate is its economic plight. What the creditors should do is to respect the result of the referendum, realise that they have to give Greece something in order to prevent the crisis escalating out of control, and recognise that debt relief must be an explicit part of a funding package that will see the eurozone\u2019s weakest member through the next couple of years. Put simply, they should try a bit less stick and a bit more carrot.</p> <p>Whether they will do so remains to be seen. Indeed, the relentless mishandling of Greece ever since the crisis first flared up in 2010 suggests that blunder will follow blunder. It doesn\u2019t help that relations between Greece and the other 18 members of the eurozone are now so sour. The chances of Greece <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/15/eurozone-greece-lehman-brothers-debt\">leaving the euro by mistake</a>, just as Lehman Brothers went bust by mistake in 2008, are reasonably high.</p> <p>All options currently remain open. Greece could do what Cyprus did: default on some of its debts while staying in the euro. Tsipras could decide to accept the tax increases and the pension cuts demanded by the creditors while receiving only minor and vague concessions on debt relief. Greece could have run out of money and be out of the euro within 24 hours.</p> <p>Some things though are clear. Firstly, the Greeks have said no to austerity rather than to membership of the euro. Tsipras does not have a mandate to bring back the drachma, even if that is where this all ends.</p> <p>Secondly, the referendum result means both economic and political chaos. As Joan Hoey of the Economist Intelligence Unit put it even before the vote: \u201cGreece is angry and fearful; divided and conflicted.\u201d <br></p> <p>Inevitably, Greece faces a fresh period of acute economic pain. It will take months, if not years, to recover from the events of the past week, even if there is a speedy resolution to the crisis. The Greek economy has already shrunk by a quarter in the past five years.</p> <p>Thirdly, it is no longer possible to kick the can down the road. Any solution to the Greek crisis that involves more austerity without measures designed to get the economy growing again and to make the country\u2019s debt sustainable will be a pyrrhic victory. The upshot would be a period of feeble growth and mounting indebtedness that would bring the possibility of Grexit back on the agenda. Sooner rather than later, in all likelihood.</p> <p>Fourthly, this is the most serious crisis in the euro\u2019s relatively short history. There have been confident pronouncements that Greece has been quarantined so that there will be no knock-on effects on the rest of the eurozone. Such sentiments will be tested to the full if there is a Grexit. Share prices will inevitably take a tumble when the financial markets open for business, but more attention should be paid to the bond yields \u2013 or interest rates \u2013 on the sovereign debt of other eurozone members seen as vulnerable. </p> <p>The short-term problem for Merkel and Hollande is obvious. If they take a tough line in talks with Athens, they will get the blame for Greece\u2019s departure from the single currency. </p> <p>The longer-term problem is perhaps even more serious. Greece has highlighted the structural weaknesses of the euro, a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn\u2019t suit such a diverse set of countries. One solution would be to create a fiscal union to run alongside monetary union, with one eurozone finance minister deciding tax and spending decisions for all 19 nations. This, though, requires the sort of solidarity notable by its absence in recent weeks. The European project has stalled.</p> <p>So, this story is not over. In Homer\u2019s epic tale, it took Odysseus 10 years to return to his Ithaca home from the Trojan war, losing all his men along the way. Greece\u2019s modern odyssey, similarly, is only half over.

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority has imposed more than \u00a3800m of fines on banks and other companies in the first half of this year \u2013 giving the chancellor the opportunity to make eye-catching allocations to worthy causes in this week\u2019s budget. The City regulator handed out fines worth \u00a3819m in the six months to the end of June, up from \u00a3136m in the same period a year earlier. The fines are paid by the FCA to the Treasury and George Osborne, the chancellor, has used past budgets to earmark particular fines for multimillion giveaways to popular causes. David Cameron, the prime minister, announced over the weekend that a national memorial was to be created for all UK victims of terrorism and this would be funded by fines imposed on banks for rigging the key Libor interest rate. Osborne will give more details in Wednesday\u2019s budget. In the last parliament, Osborne allocated \u00a3450m of Libor fines to military-related causes. In last year\u2019s autumn statement, he said \u00a31.1bn of penalties against banks for manipulating the foreign exchange market would be spent on the National Health Service. The pool of fines for the first half of this year was increased by two penalties worth a combined \u00a3511m for rigging financial markets. David Cameron said in April that Deutsche Bank\u2019s \u00a3227m fine for Libor rigging would be used to fund the creation of 50,000 apprenticeships. The record \u00a3284m imposed on Barclays in May for colluding with other banks to manipulate foreign exchange rates has not yet been allocated to a cause. There were two other big penalties in the first half that might also catch Osborne\u2019s attention. Lloyds Banking Group received a \u00a3117m penalty last month for mishandling compensation claims for payment protection insurance. The FCA also fined Bank of New York Mellon \u00a3126m in April for breaking rules designed to protect clients\u2019 assets. Fines that are not earmarked for particular causes are used for general government spending. Despite containing some of the FCA\u2019s biggest fines, the total for the first half of this year is smaller than the record \u00a31.34bn that the regulator meted out in the second half of 2014. Those penalties took the total of last year\u2019s fines to \u00a31.47bn - three times the previous annual record. Tracey McDermott, the FCA\u2019s head of enforcement and financial crime, said: \u201cThe timing, number and amounts of the fines or other sanctions we impose will always vary from year to year depending on the type of case and other factors such as whether cases settle or are litigated. We don\u2019t set ourselves targets for the number of fines we will issue in a given period \u2013 what we look at is whether the sanctions we do impose are having an impact on behaviour.\u201d The number of fines in the first half of this year rose to 24 from 18 a year earlier. The smallest penalty was \u00a39,900 against the internal auditor of Bank of Beirut for lack of openness in dealing with the regulator. Rachel Couter, a partner at the law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons, said the fines showed there was no let-up in the FCA\u2019s hardline approach to wrongdoers. \u201cThis is really more of the same as 2014, with further fines for rate fixing, transaction reporting failures, mis-selling, client asset breaches and complaints handling failures.\u201d The FCA said in its annual report last week that the \u00a31.4bn in fines that was collected in the financial year that ended on 31 March was more than for the previous four years combined.",

      "bodyText": "Some of the UK\u2019s biggest companies are sounding out shareholders about pay rises for their bosses in a move that risks reigniting the controversy over excessive executive pay. The potential increases to salaries would further inflate overall boardroom remuneration as annual bonuses and long-term incentive plans are all hinged on basic pay. The increases appear to be driven by changes in the way company directors receive their bonuses. Shareholders have insisted bonuses be paid out over longer periods. Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of the proxy voting agency Manifest, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing that there are lots of companies saying their chief executives need 20 to 30% pay rises for their basic salary \u2026 That is going to go down like a lead balloon. The request for pay rises may be a backlash against longer retention periods.\u201d Top directors tend to be remunerated with salaries, annual bonuses and long-term incentive plans. The latter, which are often paid in shares, were generally based over three years but are increasingly based over longer periods, often five years. The fund manager Fidelity released data in May showing that a growing number of FTSE 100 companies were adopting longer retention periods. Forty-two now have a minimum period of five years, compared with four in 2013. Banking is one sector where regulation is imposing longer periods when bonuses could be at risk. Bonuses can be clawed back from the most senior bankers over 10 years. Wilson said she would also focus on termination payments for departing directors and packages for new recruits this year. One of the biggest pay revolts of the annual general meeting season, which is drawing to a close, was over a package compiled for the new head of Intertek. The FTSE 100 product-testing company had its remuneration report voted down and Andr\u00e9 Lacroix, its incoming boss, gave up a \u00a3560,000 guaranteed bonus offered to compensate him for leaving Inchcape. Data from Manifest shows that Intertek was the only company to have its remuneration report voted down so far this year. The scale of rebellions has returned to the levels of the shareholder spring in 2012, which also resulted in executives being pushed out of their jobs \u2013 notably Andrew Moss at Aviva. This was at a time when Vince Cable, who was business secretary at the time, was focused on boardroom pay. After a government consultation, companies were required to hold votes on their remuneration reports , which cover their annual pay and remuneration policiesthat set out the principles they will follow for the next three years. Those policies went to the vote for the first time last year. Afren, an oil and gas company not large enough to be in the main index, had the largest rebellion so far when deliberate abstentions were included alongside outright no votes. Afren put two aspects of remuneration to a vote. Almost 55% of shareholders, including abstainers, failed to back either its remuneration reportor policy , though both votes were formally passed. At John Menzies, the distribution and airport handling group, about 52% failed to support the pay report when abstentions were included. Without the abstentions, the figure was 26%. Some of the companies that endured revolts last year have not yet held their AGMs. At Burberry, more than 52% of shareholders lvoted against last year\u2019s pay deal for Christopher Bailey, its chief executive. He had been handed shares worth nearly \u00a315m. The company hopes to avoid a repeat of a revolt on last year\u2019s scale, after issuing a detailed explanation of Bailey\u2019s pay arrangements and revealing that he could be in line for shares and bonuses worth up to \u00a350m in coming years. Wilson said: \u201cThere should be no reason why any company engaging with its shareholders should get a high level of dissent \u2026 A vote of 10% or more is a failure of communication of somewhere along the way.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Breakup of big six energy firms not needed, says regulator", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes that a long-awaited report from financial regulators would recommend the breakup of big six energy suppliers such as British Gas and SSE are about to finally be dashed. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will deny that the large companies have been colluding to drive up profits and will even suggest reversing a new policy that restricts the number of tariffs on offer. But the CMA will argue that it has been too easy for the traditional players to make significant profits and will recommend a raft of new intiatives in a bid to introduce innovation and encourage customers to switch to cheaper providers. The decision in Tuesday\u2019s interim report not to force the dismantling of the large companies which use \u201cvertical integration\u201d \u2013 owning power generation and supply businesses \u2013 will come as a huge relief to the big six companies which also include EDF Energy, RWE npower, E.ON and Scottish Power. But it will frustrate some campaign groups and the Labour party, which under its former leader, Ed Miliband, had promoted the policy in a bid to break the 90% market share of the big six in the retail market. Laura Hill, a spokeswoman for the Fuel Poverty Action group, said it would be \u201claughable\u201d if switching was emphasised over breakup as it would put the responsibility for the current problems on customers, not companies. \u201cBlaming energy customers for the big six\u2019s exploitative antics is disgraceful and will not end the hardship millions of households suffer during the winter months.\u201d Equally there will be alarm if the CMA \u2013 as expected \u2013 calls for a U-turn on the system whereby energy companies have been forced to concentrate on four key tariffs to get away from the previous system of dozens of different schemes which had confused customers. But the CMA will argue that the key to unlocking the stranglehold of the big six on market share and profits is to make it easier for \u201csticky\u201d customers to move to independent suppliers offering cheaper deals. The CMA, which has been reviewing the working of the energy market for the last 12 months, may also call for a bonfire of the 10,500 pages of industry codes which cause bureaucracy and cost, particularly hindering smaller new market entrants. Juliet Davenport, chief executive of independent supplier Good Energy, said she would be delighted to see the CMA cutting red tape because it was hankering innovation. \u201cWe want to see more people actively participating in the energy markets, from changing their usage patterns of energy through to generating their own power, and the way the market is set up at the moment just means those kinds of innovations are impossible,\u201d she explained. There are also hopes that the CMA will recommend some kind of action to prevent users of pre-payment meters facing higher charges than others. This has been a key concern of fuel poverty campaigners and Ofgem has already agreed to tackle the issue. Those proposed remedies from the authority to reinvigorate the energy supply markets will go out for consultation, with final recommendations to be made before the end of 2015. Rising concern about the energy supply sector has gradually increased over the last five years, exacerbated by a series of what appeared to be excessive and coordinated price rises amid mounting evidence of widening fuel poverty. Alleged profiteering became a political issue when Miliband launched a ferocious attack on the industry at the Labour party conference in the autumn of 2013. The energy regulator, Ofgem, finally unveiled an initial investigation and quickly concluded a wider probe involving the CMA was needed. Among the concerns was the fact that industry retail profits had increased from \u00a3233m in 2009 to \u00a31.1bn in 2012, with no clear evidence of suppliers becoming more efficient in reducing their own costs. Mark Todd, director of price comparison site energyhelpline.com, said there was plenty of evidence that retail customers were still not getting the deals they deserved. \u201cWholesale prices have been falling for months and we are now at a five-year low. It\u2019s now more apparent than ever that energy firms should pass on the savings that customers deserve. The cuts made to domestic tariffs earlier this year were paltry at just 2.5% and short-changed most customers, who are rightly angry.\u201d Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, warned that trust in the energy market was still at rock bottom. \u201cThe vast majority of customers don\u2019t understand the relationship between energy companies\u2019 costs, the prices imposed on consumers and margins made from them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is crucial that the CMA leaves behind a sound framework that gives consumers confidence that they are not being ripped off.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Hopes that a long-awaited report from financial regulators would recommend the breakup of big six energy suppliers such as British Gas and SSE are about to finally be dashed. </p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will deny that the large companies have been colluding to drive up profits and will even suggest reversing a new policy that restricts the number of tariffs on offer.</p> <p>But the CMA will argue that it has been too easy for the traditional players to make significant profits and will recommend a raft of new intiatives in a bid to introduce innovation and encourage customers to switch to cheaper providers.</p> <p>The decision in Tuesday\u2019s interim report not to force the dismantling of the large companies which use \u201cvertical integration\u201d \u2013 owning power generation and supply businesses \u2013 will come as a huge relief to the big six companies which also include EDF Energy, RWE npower, E.ON and Scottish Power. </p> <p>But it will frustrate some campaign groups and the Labour party, which under its former leader, Ed Miliband, had promoted the policy in a bid to break the 90% market share of the big six in the retail market.</p> <p>Laura Hill, a spokeswoman for the Fuel Poverty Action group, said it would be \u201claughable\u201d if switching was emphasised over breakup as it would put the responsibility for the current problems on customers, not companies.</p> <p>\u201cBlaming energy customers for the big six\u2019s exploitative antics is disgraceful and will not end the hardship millions of households suffer during the winter months.\u201d</p> <p>Equally there will be alarm if the CMA \u2013 as expected \u2013 calls for a U-turn on the system whereby energy companies have been forced to concentrate on four key tariffs to get away from the previous system of dozens of different schemes which had confused customers. </p> <p>But the CMA will argue that the key to unlocking the stranglehold of the big six on market share and profits is to make it easier for \u201csticky\u201d customers to move to independent suppliers offering cheaper deals.</p> <p>The CMA, which has been reviewing the working of the energy market for the last 12 months, may also call for a bonfire of the 10,500 pages of industry codes which cause bureaucracy and cost, particularly hindering smaller new market entrants.</p> <p>Juliet Davenport, chief executive of independent supplier Good Energy, said she would be delighted to see the CMA cutting red tape because it was hankering innovation.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to see more people actively participating in the energy markets, from changing their usage patterns of energy through to generating their own power, and the way the market is set up at the moment just means those kinds of innovations are impossible,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>There are also hopes that the CMA will recommend some kind of action to prevent users of pre-payment meters facing higher charges than others. This has been a key concern of fuel poverty campaigners and Ofgem has already agreed to tackle the issue. </p> <p>Those proposed remedies from the authority to reinvigorate the energy supply markets will go out for consultation, with final recommendations to be made before the end of 2015.</p> <p>Rising concern about the energy supply sector has gradually increased over the last five years, exacerbated by a series of what appeared to be excessive and coordinated price rises amid mounting evidence of widening fuel poverty.<br></p> <p>Alleged profiteering became a political issue when Miliband launched a ferocious attack on the industry at the Labour party conference in the autumn of 2013. The energy regulator, Ofgem, finally unveiled an initial investigation and quickly concluded a wider probe involving the CMA was needed.</p> <p>Among the concerns was the fact that industry retail profits had increased from \u00a3233m in 2009 to \u00a31.1bn in 2012, with no clear evidence of suppliers becoming more efficient in reducing their own costs.</p> <p>Mark Todd, director of price comparison site energyhelpline.com, said there was plenty of evidence that retail customers were still not getting the deals they deserved.</p> <p>\u201cWholesale prices have been falling for months and we are now at a five-year low. It\u2019s now more apparent than ever that energy firms should pass on the savings that customers deserve. The cuts made to domestic tariffs earlier this year were paltry at just 2.5% and short-changed most customers, who are rightly angry.\u201d</p> <p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, warned that trust in the energy market was still at rock bottom.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of customers don\u2019t understand the relationship between energy companies\u2019 costs, the prices imposed on consumers and margins made from them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is crucial that the CMA leaves behind a sound framework that gives consumers confidence that they are not being ripped off.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer face protests from shareholders and campaigners this week over high executive rewards and low pay for staff. Pirc , a shareholders advisory group, and Manifest, a proxy voting agency, have both raised concerns about excessive pay for Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, and a share award for Justin King, his predecessor. M&amp;S is under fire for offering Marc Bolland, its chief executive, the chance to earn up to three times his salary in long-term share awards based on performance targets that were not linked to financial targets. Pirc is also concerned about a new executive share option plan that allows for awards to be accelerated in the event of a takeover or when an executive leaves the business. It recommended shareholders vote against both schemes. Pirc urged shareholders to vote against Sainsbury\u2019s remuneration policy. It said that Coupe\u2019s pay, which was \u00a31.5m including bonuses last year, was excessive compared with that of the average employee at Sainsbury\u2019s. It also had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about King\u2019s termination arrangements. King, who left Sainsbury\u2019s in June after a decade at the helm, waived his cash severance payment of up to \u00a31.7m but held on to long-term share awards, which are subject to performance targets. Manifest said it calculated that King could receive 211% of his former salary, or \u00a31.9m, from outstanding long-term share awards relating to the performance of the business in 2012/13. It said Sainsbury\u2019s should have made clear the potential total payout and put a limit on payments at the time of his departure. Both Pirc and Manifest said they were concerned that shareholders had been left in the dark about the total value of King\u2019s final payout. The expected protests by shareholders come after significant protest votes over pay at the annual shareholder meetings of both Tesco and Morrisons in recent weeks. Last week more than 18% of shareholders failed to back Tesco\u2019s remuneration report, which detailed the \u00a34.13m paid to Dave Lewis, its new chief executive, for onlysix months\u2019 work at the supermarket group last year, and a \u00a31.2m payout to his predecessor, Phil Clarke, who oversaw diving sales and profits. More than a third of shareholders (35.6%) voted against the Morrisons remuneration report after the company awarded a \u00a31m bonus to Dalton Philips, its sacked former chief executive. All the big retailers have also been under fire from low-pay campaigners \u2013 who will continue their protests this week. ShareAction and Citizens UK are set to urge both M&amp;S and Sainsbury\u2019s to pay their staff at least the living wage, which amounts to \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 across the rest of the UK. In a quirky new tack to the campaign, M&amp;S\u2019s board will be presented with handkerchiefs embroidered by activists from the Craftivist Collective at a series of \u201cstitch-ins\u201d at branches of Marks &amp; Spencer branches across the UK.

      "bodyText": "It is almost 20 years since Ken Clarke delivered the last purely Conservative budget in the dog days of John Major\u2019s government. A lot has happened since the Cool Britannia year of 1996: the economy has boomed and gone bust; the euro has arrived; an independent Bank of England sets interest rates; and the gap between the super rich and the rest has widened. All these developments will shape the package of measures George Osborne is to announce on Wednesday. In 1996, Clarke realised his party was going down to defeat. Knowing it was his swansong, he included spending cuts in his last budget, little thinking that Gordon Brown would stick to them. Osborne, by contrast, has the assurance of the victor, of a chancellor who knows that he can plan for a whole parliament and is already thinking about how to win again in 2020. Politically, Osborne is in a much better position than Clarke was in 1996. He faces a demoralised Labour party that is allowing the Conservatives to frame the debate during the crucial months after a general election, just as it did after the 2010 election. It is a much more mixed picture when it comes to the economy. Back in 1996, the balance of payments actually balanced and the big hole in the public finances left by the recession of the early 1990s was virtually repaired. Today, Osborne presides over an economy with a twin deficit problem: a current account deficit running at 6% of national income and a budget deficit of about the same size. What\u2019s more, when Clarke left office in 1997, the newly independent Bank of England raised interest rates to 7.5%. That gave Threadneedle Street plenty of scope to cut the cost of borrowing if the economy ran into difficulties. There is no such headroom today. Official interest rates remain where they were when Osborne became chancellor, at a record low of 0.5%. There have been other developments. Britain\u2019s North Sea oil production peaked at the end of the 1990s and is in decline. Manufacturing\u2019s share of the economy has fallen to little more than 10%. The nation\u2019s economic centre of gravity has shifted even more towards London and the south-east. A minimum wage and tax credits have been introduced to deal with the problem of low pay. Osborne has a number of challenges in the budget. One of them is how to get the balance right between monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary policy is what the Bank of England does, and includes setting interest rates and using quantitative easing to create money. Fiscal policy is what the Treasury does, and involves setting tax rates and spending public money. Osborne will announce significant spending cuts on Wednesday, targeting welfare payments and Whitehall departments. As with the austerity measures taken after the 2010 election, these will have the effect of slowing the economy, leaving the onus on the Bank to keep things ticking over. That is likely to mean that interest rates stay lower for longer than would otherwise be the case. There are two risks here. One is that, with interest rates almost at zero, monetary policy is less effective than it once was. The second is that ultra-stimulative monetary policy was supposed to be an emergency measure, and continuing with it for more than six years leads to asset bubbles, reckless speculation and, ultimately, the next crash. The body that represents the world\u2019s central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, recently warned of the dangers of the once abnormal becoming the new normal, and it is right to do so. Osborne got his judgement wrong in 2010, cutting too aggressively when the economy was still in the early stages of rehab following the slump of 2008-09. He was later forced to ease up on the pace of deficit reduction when the economy slowed far more quickly than he anticipated. Getting it wrong again would be inexcusable. A further challenge is to make welfare cuts without damaging the \u201chard-working people\u201d championed by the Conservatives during the election campaign. It was rare to see Osborne out on the stump without a hard hat and hi-vis jacket, so intent was he on showing that the Tories rather than Labour were on the side of those struggling to earn a living. Many of those who work in the warehouses and construction sites the chancellor visited ahead of polling day have their wages topped up by tax credits, but they will need to be cut on Wednesday if the Treasury is to find \u00a312bn in welfare savings. In principle, there is nothing wrong with the government\u2019s approach. Tax credits let bad employers off the hook, because they know that they can pay poverty wages safe in the knowledge that they will be topped up by the tax and benefits system. Many Conservatives think the state should not have to foot the bill, which has now grown to \u00a330bn a year, simply because companies refuse to pay their staff enough to live on. On the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Osborne said the solution was to cut taxes so that workers kept more of what they earned. It is, however, not quite as simple as that, given that almost 6 million workers don\u2019t earn enough to pay income tax. They will be net losers \u2013 in many cases big net losers \u2013 when tax credits are cut, unless employers can be forced, cajoled or shamed into paying higher wages. The chancellor must not be allowed to duck this challenge. Finally, the first budget of a parliament is the moment for a shakeup of the tax system , because any changes have a chance to bed down before the next election. So far, Osborne has been more of a tinkerer than a radical reformer, but there are two candidates for action if he favours boldness. The first would be moves towards the eventual merging of income tax and national insurance, something that would help the lowest paid more than raising tax thresholds. The second would be a comprehensive overhaul of property taxation to make it less generous and more progressive. The signs are not especially good. Osborne, like his predecessors, has three iron laws: never raise the basic rate of income tax; never upset pensioners; and never do anything that might result in the price of homes going down. Hence the decision to make inheritance tax more generous and the refusal to touch council tax. Osborne has a fourth law: mention Greece at every opportunity. Five years ago, the chancellor used the first manifestation of the Greek crisis to justify austerity. He will repeat that message on Wednesday. The budget has been overshadowed by the drama in the eurozone but he won\u2019t mind that a bit. For him, Greece is the gift that keeps on giving.",

Monetary policy is what the Bank of England does, and includes setting interest rates and using quantitative easing to create money. Fiscal policy is what the Treasury does, and involves setting tax rates and spending public money.</p> <p>Osborne will announce significant spending cuts on Wednesday, targeting welfare payments and Whitehall departments. As with the austerity measures taken after the 2010 election, these will have the effect of slowing the economy, leaving the onus on the Bank to keep things ticking over. That is likely to mean that interest rates stay lower for longer than would otherwise be the case.</p> <p>There are two risks here. One is that, with interest rates almost at zero, monetary policy is less effective than it once was. The second is that ultra-stimulative monetary policy was supposed to be an emergency measure, and continuing with it for more than six years leads to asset bubbles, reckless speculation and, ultimately, the next crash. The body that represents the world\u2019s central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, recently warned of the dangers of the once abnormal becoming the new normal, and it is right to do so.</p> <p>Osborne got his judgement wrong in 2010, cutting too aggressively when the economy was still in the early stages of rehab following the slump of 2008-09. He was later forced to ease up on the pace of deficit reduction when the economy slowed far more quickly than he anticipated. Getting it wrong again would be inexcusable.</p> <p>A further challenge is to make welfare cuts without damaging the \u201chard-working people\u201d championed by the Conservatives during the election campaign. It was rare to see Osborne out on the stump without a hard hat and hi-vis jacket, so intent was he on showing that the Tories rather than Labour were on the side of those struggling to earn a living.</p> <p>Many of those who work in the warehouses and construction sites the chancellor visited ahead of polling day have their wages topped up by tax credits, but they will need to be cut on Wednesday if the Treasury is to find \u00a312bn in welfare savings.</p> <p>In principle, there is nothing wrong with the government\u2019s approach. Tax credits let bad employers off the hook, because they know that they can pay poverty wages safe in the knowledge that they will be topped up by the tax and benefits system. Many Conservatives think the state should not have to foot the bill, which has now grown to \u00a330bn a year, simply because companies refuse to pay their staff enough to live on.</p> <p>On the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Osborne said the solution was to cut taxes so that workers kept more of what they earned. It is, however, not quite as simple as that, given that almost 6 million workers don\u2019t earn enough to pay income tax. They will be net losers \u2013 in many cases big net losers \u2013 when tax credits are cut, unless employers can be forced, cajoled or shamed into paying higher wages. The chancellor must not be allowed to duck this challenge.</p> <p>Finally, the first budget of a parliament is the moment for a shakeup of the tax system , because any changes have a chance to bed down before the next election. So far, Osborne has been more of a tinkerer than a radical reformer, but there are two candidates for action if he favours boldness. The first would be moves towards the eventual merging of income tax and national insurance, something that would help the lowest paid more than raising tax thresholds. The second would be a comprehensive overhaul of property taxation to make it less generous and more progressive.</p> <p>The signs are not especially good. Osborne, like his predecessors, has three iron laws: never raise the basic rate of income tax; never upset pensioners; and never do anything that might result in the price of homes going down. Hence the decision to make inheritance tax more generous and the refusal to touch council tax.</p> <p>Osborne has a fourth law: mention Greece at every opportunity. Five years ago, the chancellor used the first manifestation of the Greek crisis to justify austerity. He will repeat that message on Wednesday. The budget has been overshadowed by the drama in the eurozone but he won\u2019t mind that a bit. For him, Greece is the gift that keeps on giving.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, took to the stage in California in April to launch a solar battery for the home, the audience hollered and whooped at every detail. On the other side of the Atlantic, a more modest, quieter challenger plans to take on the US electric car giant. Based within a railway arch, with the sound of trains running overhead from nearby London Bridge station and surrounded by other ecologically minded startups, the offices of Powervault are a far cry from Tesla\u2019s showpiece Californian stage. The similarity lies in the product \u2013 the Powervault battery, which stores energy from domestic solar panels. \u201cSome people, especially if they don\u2019t have solar panels, just assume solar panels come with a battery,\u201d says Joe Warren, Powervault\u2019s managing director. They don\u2019t. Home energy generation has blossomed in the UK over the past four years, with an estimated 650,000 homes fitted with solar panels. In 2010, the government introduced the feed-in tariff scheme to pay householders who produce and supply energy. The scheme aims to push renewable energy in the UK towards 15% of total energy by 2020. In 2009, the figure stood at 2%. Powervault, Tesla and other players in the emerging solar battery market aim to supply the means for householders to store energy produced during the sunniest part of the day for use at peak times, when more people are at home but the sun is down. \u201cA lot of people are not at home during the day, they are at work,\u201d Warren says. \u201cThe solar system is generating energy which is all exported. We thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could store that energy and use it when you are at home in the evening?\u2019 Our system stores energy during the day when it is sunny and then gives it back to the customer in the evening.\u201d The Powervault unit is about the size of a washing machine and weighs about 150kg (330lbs). Inside are batteries, chargers and electronics. A charger takes the energy from the solar panels and transforms it into energy which is then stored in the batteries and discharged around the home when needed. \u201cTypically the system works on a daily cycle so it charges up when it is sunny and then on that same day discharges,\u201d Warren says. \u201cIt would typically store the energy for less than 24 hours. \u201cIt has a control system and a monitoring system which works out whether you are importing or exporting [electricity]. If you are exporting, it will charge the batteries until they are full and if it notices that you are importing electricity, it will start to discharge energy and reduce the amount of energy being imported from the grid by offsetting that with the energy in the battery.\u201d The unit stores 2 to 4 kilowatt hours, enough energy to watch television for 14 or 28 hours or wash two to four full loads in the washing machine. Priced between \u00a32,000 and \u00a32,800 per unit, it is cheaper than rivals, says Warren, and it has been reduced in size to tailor it for the British home\u2019s energy needs. \u201cThe main purpose is to reduce people\u2019s electricity bills, to charge up during the day when it\u2019s sunny, discharge it in the evening when people are using power. If you made the battery bigger, you could store the energy for longer but the problem with that is it would cost a lot more. What we have tried to do is size the unit so it is just right for a British house.\u201d Savings from the device depend on consumption, the number of solar panels installed and how much energy they produce, although the company estimates that it could lower electricity bills by up to 15%. Warren said sales started in September, with devices snapped up by early adopters and people enthusiastic about green technology. Powervault is aiming to cut the cost to \u00a31,000, making the savings on evolving battery technology and economies of scale. Warren says some estimates put the number of households with solar panels at 2m by 2020, by which time the company hopes to have sold 50,000 units. \u201cWhat we are trying to do here is change the electricity market, change the way people consume energy,\u201d says Warren. \u201cThe country and everybody [in it] are facing big challenges, we have got huge electricity cost increases that are affecting homeowners, are affecting the country. We need to get the carbon emissions of the country down, we need to ensure security of supply \u2013 all those things affect people and affect the country as a whole.\u201d However, competition is expected to be harsh. Tesla\u2019s wall-mounted Powerwall batteries are designed to store up to 10kW hours of wind or solar energy; units have sold out until mid-2016. It aims to have its batteries in the UK by the end of this year. Last month, Mercedes-Benz also entered the battery market for home and business use. Eco-entrepreneur Dale Vince, chair of the renewable energy firm Ecotricity, said the home battery market remained undeveloped until now because energy had been \u201ctoo cheap for too long for it to matter\u201d. Ecotricity is also developing a product \u2013 expected to be launched next year \u2013 with a working title of \u201cblack box\u201d, a 2ft to 3ft-high device that will control power coming in and out of the home. The missing link Energy storage has been described as the missing link of solar energy adoption. A report from Deutsche Bank this year said solar energy storage would be cheap enough to be deployed on a large scale within five years as a result of a yearly cost reduction of 20% to 30% in the price of lithium-ion batteries. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

But the answer we were really looking for is that they will all be topics with which to bash Sainsbury\u2019s this week as the grocer holds its annual meeting. Bristol Rovers have been suing the grocer over the retailer\u2019s plans to pull out of a deal to buy the football club\u2019s ground, and Sainsbury\u2019s is expecting a court ruling this week. Its board might also have to take questions from animal rights campaigners, who are attempting to stop the supermarket buying milk from areas where badgers are being culled. And that will merely be the warm-up before somebody brings up the living wage. There\u2019s an irony here, and not solely because of the grocer\u2019s slogan \u201cLive well for less\u201d. While defending low pay, the Sainsbury\u2019s board will also have to justify what shareholder activist Pirc terms its \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over another issue. That would be the, er, potentially huge awards still on offer to former boss Justin King, who has \u201cretained all his outstanding long-term incentive awards in full\u201d. Marc, Marc and Marks: it must be Wembley In 1972 Marc Bolan played Wembley with T Rex. Marc Bolland will do the same with Marks &amp; Spencer this week. The chief executive will take the stage for the retailer\u2019s annual meeting there on Tuesday, when you\u2019ll have to be a real connoisseur to spot any differences between the two events. Still, if you watch the footage really closely you might notice one of the frontmen constantly preening his famous coiffure, while the other concentrates on his music. Anyway, the City will be more interested in less juvenile comparisons. Analysts at Investec reckon that, when the retailer simultaneously announces its first-quarter trading, M&amp;S\u2019s good form may have been reversed, with same-store sales of general merchandise possibly turning negative again \u201cas May\u2019s cooler weather affected clothing demand\u201d. Still, with Marks it\u2019s mainly about the third quarter (Christmas), so for now the City\u2019s focus will be less on the actual merchandise and more on improving margins. Which brings us to another difference between the frontmen: one of them goes on about \u201cyour shoes and your stockings\u201d, and the other runs M&amp;S. To the Mansion House for fine dining and panic Another week, another chance for our nation\u2019s bankers to squeeze into their dinner suits and visit the Lord Mayor of London\u2019s gaff for dinner. Just four weeks after the chancellor\u2019s Mansion House speech \u2013 when the City satiated itself on a salmon and sea bass tartare, canon of lamb and aubergine polenta plus a rhubarb and almond tart \u2013 they\u2019ll be back for a refill on Tuesday and an audience with George Osborne\u2019s predecessor, Alistair Darling. Yes it\u2019s the annual dinner of the banking trade body, the British Bankers\u2019 Association, an event that\u2019s not even wildly exciting the bankers this year. Instead, they\u2019ll spend the evening frantically speculating on the following day\u2019s budget and what last month\u2019s guest speaker will announce on how banks will be taxed. It\u2019s enough to put some off the dinner\u2019s traditional Stirrup Cup nightcap. All of which may explain why the BBA feels the need to hype its bash so brazenly. In the bumf promoting the dinner, the trade body drools: \u201cThis prestigious event will provide a unique occasion for senior representatives and leading figures in the City to enjoy an evening of fine dining, networking opportunities and unrivalled speeches at the Mansion House.\u201d Unique in July, that is.",

While defending low pay, the Sainsbury\u2019s board will also have to justify what shareholder activist Pirc terms its \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over another issue. That would be the, er, potentially huge awards still on offer to former boss Justin King, who has \u201cretained all his outstanding long-term incentive awards in full\u201d.</p> <h2>Marc, Marc and Marks: it must be Wembley</h2> <p>In 1972 Marc Bolan played Wembley with T Rex. Marc Bolland will do the same with Marks &amp; Spencer this week.</p> <p>The chief executive will take the stage for the retailer\u2019s annual meeting there on Tuesday, when you\u2019ll have to be a real connoisseur to spot any differences between the two events. Still, if you watch the footage really closely you might notice one of the frontmen constantly preening his famous coiffure, while the other concentrates on his music.</p> <p>Anyway, the City will be more interested in less juvenile comparisons. Analysts at Investec reckon that, when the retailer simultaneously announces its first-quarter trading, M&amp;S\u2019s good form may have been reversed, with same-store sales of general merchandise possibly turning negative again \u201cas May\u2019s cooler weather affected clothing demand\u201d.</p> <p>Still, with Marks it\u2019s mainly about the third quarter (Christmas), so for now the City\u2019s focus will be less on the actual merchandise and more on improving margins. Which brings us to another difference between the frontmen: one of them goes on about \u201cyour shoes and your stockings\u201d, and the other runs M&amp;S.</p> <h2>To the Mansion House for fine dining and panic</h2> <p>Another week, another chance for our nation\u2019s bankers to squeeze into their dinner suits and visit the Lord Mayor of London\u2019s gaff for dinner.</p> <p>Just four weeks after the chancellor\u2019s Mansion House speech \u2013 when the City satiated itself on a salmon and sea bass tartare, canon of lamb and aubergine polenta plus a rhubarb and almond tart \u2013 they\u2019ll be back for a refill on Tuesday and an audience with George Osborne\u2019s predecessor, Alistair Darling.</p> <p>Yes it\u2019s the annual dinner of the banking trade body, the British Bankers\u2019 Association, an event that\u2019s not even wildly exciting the bankers this year. Instead, they\u2019ll spend the evening frantically speculating on the following day\u2019s budget and what last month\u2019s guest speaker will announce on how banks will be taxed. It\u2019s enough to put some off the dinner\u2019s traditional Stirrup Cup nightcap.</p> <p>All of which may explain why the BBA feels the need to hype its bash so brazenly. In the bumf promoting the dinner, the trade body drools: \u201cThis prestigious event will provide a unique occasion for senior representatives and leading figures in the City to enjoy an evening of fine dining, networking opportunities and unrivalled speeches at the Mansion House.\u201d</p> <p>Unique in July, that is.</p>",

This week marks the 10th anniversary of the Gleneagles summit, when Tony Blair convened his G8 colleagues, plus a smattering of African leaders, at the swish golf hotel in Perthshire, to sign up for what they called \u201ca new vision for the continent\u2019s future\u201d. Blair dashed back to London to deal with the aftermath of the 7/7 bombings, but returned to Scotland to finish the talks. As Justin Forsyth, now Save the Children chief executive but then the prime minister\u2019s right-hand man on development, recalls, Blair and his fellow leaders consciously saw their pledges \u2013 to double aid to Africa, and offer 100% debt write-offs for more than 30 countries \u2013 as a response to terrorism. \u201cIt was almost symbolic, that we as a world stand for something better, to help the poorest people on the planet; it was also a response to terrorism: the world standing together and saying what democracy was about.\u201d The agreement was the culmination of years of work, inside and outside government, bringing together Gordon Brown\u2019s strongly held commitment to development and Blair\u2019s diplomatic verve. Their relationship was often fraught, but this was the pair\u2019s partnership at its best. Today, the world looks a very different place. The G8 itself has fractured, with Russia ejected and subject to economic sanctions for its role in the war in Ukraine. The legitimacy of the anachronistic club \u2013 which includes Canada, but not China, India or Brazil \u2013 had already looked increasingly shaky; but since the credit crunch, the wider G20 group has become a more potent force. Money has been harder to come by since the global financial crisis. David Cameron should be applauded for sticking with the UK\u2019s commitment \u2013 now enshrined in law \u2013 to spend 0.7% of national income on aid; among other countries, backsliding has been rife. Germany\u2019s aid budget, for example, is still at 0.41% of national income; Italy\u2019s just 0.16%. In some ways, the very project of trying to make poverty history also feels more complex. Multilateral, state-to-state loans have often been replaced by private-sector borrowing by both governments and companies, for example. That\u2019s a sign of success, but it will make future debt crises hard to resolve. Even at Gleneagles, there was an acknowledgment that overseas aid was not a panacea. Leaders also pledged to work towards completing the Doha round of international trade talks, though their enthusiasm later evaporated when they looked at the sacrifices that might be required. The latest rash of multilateral trade deals focus on fostering trade between the US, Europe and Asia, with African markets lower down the list of political priorities. And while many countries have been encouraged to foster a more business-friendly climate and welcome foreign direct investment, it\u2019s now increasingly acknowledged that without better global tax rules, too much of the benefit just leaks away. There are pressing questions about the strings attached to aid, too. Fascinating recent work by Jomo Kwame Sundaram and Michael T Clark at the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation shows that the tick-box standards of \u201cgood governance\u201d many aid recipients have been asked to meet may have done more harm than good. \u201cExperience over two decades shows that such directives provide little practical guidance for solving the technically, socially, and politically complex real-world problems of economic development\u201d, they say. As Greece\u2019s dire plight shows, economic reform is all but impossible to achieve by drawing up lists of institutions and rules that have evolved over decades in well-functioning economies and imposing them from outside. There are doubts, too, about whether the data used to drive aid targets is up to the task. A recent report by Liz Stuart at the Overseas Development Institute found, for example, that \u201csome 133,000 women may have died from childbirth-related causes in 2013, or twice as many. We cannot be sure\u201d. Yet some of these doubts and complexities are not reasons to ditch overseas aid, but ways to make sure it\u2019s done better \u2013 and backed up by richer data, more coherent tax rules, a friendlier trade environment for the poorest countries and better global institutions, not least to rein in the excesses of financial markets. This month, representatives from scores of countries will meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, under the auspices of the UN, for the Financing for Development Conference \u2013 a chance for governments to say what they are willing to do and how much they will spend to ensure the successors to the millennium development goals (the sustainable development goals) can be met. The process has its flaws, not least that \u201c17 goals with 169 associated targets\u201d are probably too many. Yet the needs are still acute. As global campaigning body ONE puts it, \u201cdevelopment assistance is, and will continue to be, crucial to providing basic services, including education and health, in the least developed countries\u201d. It would like to see poor countries commit to minimum levels of spending on basic services (rather than a thicket of detailed targets) as part of a global pact that would include a significant boost to aid. With budgets tight in the aftermath of the credit crisis, it may be hard to rekindle the idealism of that Scottish summer day, and NGOs have never quite captured the public\u2019s imagination in the same way. But as ministers from around the world prepare to meet in Addis, it\u2019s hard to better the aspiration to \u201cmake poverty history\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "China is panicking over a market bubble. What would it do in a real crisis?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Greece holds a referendum that may create more uncertainties than it solves, are we looking in the wrong place for a financial crisis? In China, the authorities are in a fine sweat about a more traditional financial conundrum: a bubble in the stock market. How do you deflate it safely? Should you even try? As with many things in China, the numbers are staggering. The two main indices \u2013 the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite \u2013 had risen about 150% in the 12 months to mid-June. In terms of market value, that was a gain of about $6.5tn. Since then, the market has tumbled almost 30% \u2013 call it a $2tn plunge. What\u2019s the big deal? Shares never go up in a straight line and anybody who bought a year ago has still more than doubled their money. But there are several potential problems, at least to Beijing\u2019s apparent way of thinking. First, there are a lot of latecomers to the share frenzy. In May, just before prices started to fall, 12 million trading accounts were opened. Second, some latecomers are novices ill-equipped to take losses. Trading on margin \u2013 using borrowed money \u2013 is commonplace in China, raising the likelihood that losing investors will be forced to get out in a hurry, creating more selling pressure. Third, a crash in the share market could hit the real economy. Consumer confidence could be damaged. More directly, companies could find it hard to raise capital and the gradual liberalisation of the Chinese economy could stall as locals and foreigners conclude it is safer to stay away. Such worries explain why the authorities seem so keen to put a floor under share prices. Interest rates have been cut and margin requirements have been relaxed, seemingly to help investors with their backs to the wall. Banks have been told they can hold less capital with the central bank, freeing up liquidity in the financial system. So far, nothing has worked. On Friday, operations took a new direction. The securities regulator said it would look for \u201cclues of illegal manipulation across markets\u201d. In other words, short-sellers and devious individuals are being blamed \u2013 a traditional excuse for authorities who like there to be a culprit. Maybe more measures will follow if the market continues to fall. Already, voices can be heard calling for direct intervention \u2013 in other words, the state buying shares. The Chinese do things differently, but these measures seem a ridiculous over-reaction. If the authorities feel compelled to intervene every time the stock market rises 150% then corrects by 30%, they are creating massive problems for the future. Investors will believe it really is true that the share prices are \u201cofficially sanctioned\u201d. Instead of assessing companies\u2019 prospects intelligently, investors will try to guess the intentions of the bigwigs in Beijing. You can\u2019t liberalise an economy that way; you just create the risk of an even bigger bubble next time. Even if one accepted the dubious proposition that emergency measures could be justified to prevent damage to the wider economy, the authorities acted far too soon. The interest rate cut came after a 20% fall from the mid-June highs. That was a mere slip in the context of the market\u2019s rise. No wonder investors were not reassured. Beijing was sending a message that it is setting interest rates for the stock market rather than the economy. What happened to famous Chinese long-termism? The only certain way to deal with a stock market bubble is let prices fall to the point where they are cheap. At 20 times earnings, the Chinese market is not an obvious bargain even after these declines. The deeper worry is this: if the Chinese authorities think a wobble in the stock market is a threat to financial stability, do they have the ammunition to cope with a proper crisis in the more important property market? Click, collect and cough up \u2013 the new retail trend is no longer free The John Lewis click and collect service has been a huge success. Anyone who really needs another lip gloss or a new pair of tights can order by 8pm and the item is ready to collect at a John Lewis or Waitrose supermarket branch after 2pm the next day. Whether the item cost \u00a33 or \u00a3300, there is no delivery cost to customers. About half of the department store\u2019s online orders make use of the service, and the number of items being clicked and collected has exploded from 350,000 in 2008 to some 6 million now. But from the end of the month John Lewis will no longer allow free pick-ups on purchases of less than \u00a330. Customers will have to hand over \u00a32 to pick up lower-value purchases in store. It was inevitable. Shipping individual items out of a centralised warehouse in Milton Keynes, overnight, to one of hundreds of possible destinations makes no financial sense if the goods are worth just a few pounds. The profit margin on the item would be slashed. Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, had just the word to describe this sales model: \u201cbonkers\u201d. The collapse of City Link \u2013 which delivered goods for John Lewis \u2013 at Christmas shed light on the cost pressures of home deliveries. Drivers described how they received \u00a32.15 per delivery, no matter how many items were going to one house. Free click and collect is still on offer at Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and House of Fraser. But rivals will be watching the impact of the new John Lewis delivery charge, and simultaneously keeping an eye on Amazon. The online retailer last week unveiled a new Prime Now service that offers deliveries in some areas of London within an hour for \u00a36.99, or free within a two-hour slot. The likelihood is that people will pay up \u2013 \u00a32 is not a big ask for JL\u2019s well-heeled shoppers. But the charge \u2013 and the new Amazon deal, which will be rolled out beyond London in coming months \u2013 show that delivery options are now a key part of the offer. A bad reason to shorten a lifeline for savers Greeks queuing to take their cash out of banks evoke memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007. So it is apt that it should be last week that the Bank of England had to announce a \u00a310,000 cut to the amount covered by the deposit protection scheme, which became such a focus during the banking crisis. Since the end of 2010, \u00a385,000 in savings accounts in the UK has been covered by the scheme, which guarantees a saver\u2019s money should a bank, building society or credit union go bust. The level was based on the threshold of \u20ac100,000 set across the European Union at the height of banking crisis; uniformity was needed to stop savers pushing their cash across borders to chase the best protection. But as Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, points out, it is absurd that the level of protection for UK savers should depend on currency fluctuations, forcing a cut in the guarantee to \u00a375,000. Someone needs to take action.",

In May, just before prices started to fall, 12 million trading accounts were opened.</p> <p>Second, some latecomers are novices ill-equipped to take losses. Trading on margin \u2013 using borrowed money \u2013 is commonplace in China, raising the likelihood that losing investors will be forced to get out in a hurry, creating more selling pressure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Beijing was sending a message that it is setting interest rates for the stock market rather than the economy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Third, a crash in the share market could hit the real economy. Consumer confidence could be damaged. More directly, companies could find it hard to raise capital and the gradual liberalisation of the Chinese economy could stall as locals and foreigners conclude it is safer to stay away.</p> <p>Such worries explain why the authorities seem so keen to put a floor under share prices. Interest rates have been cut and margin requirements have been relaxed, seemingly to help investors with their backs to the wall. Banks have been told they can hold less capital with the central bank, freeing up liquidity in the financial system. So far, nothing has worked.</p> <p>On Friday, operations took a new direction. The securities regulator said it would look for \u201cclues of illegal manipulation across markets\u201d. In other words, short-sellers and devious individuals are being blamed \u2013 a traditional excuse for authorities who like there to be a culprit. Maybe more measures will follow if the market continues to fall. Already, voices can be heard calling for direct intervention \u2013 in other words, the state buying shares.</p> <p>The Chinese do things differently, but these measures seem a ridiculous over-reaction. If the authorities feel compelled to intervene every time the stock market rises 150% then corrects by 30%, they are creating massive problems for the future. Investors will believe it really is true that the share prices are \u201cofficially sanctioned\u201d. Instead of assessing companies\u2019 prospects intelligently, investors will try to guess the intentions of the bigwigs in Beijing. You can\u2019t liberalise an economy that way; you just create the risk of an even bigger bubble next time.</p> <p>Even if one accepted the dubious proposition that emergency measures could be justified to prevent damage to the wider economy, the authorities acted far too soon. The interest rate cut came after a 20% fall from the mid-June highs. That was a mere slip in the context of the market\u2019s rise. No wonder investors were not reassured. Beijing was sending a message that it is setting interest rates for the stock market rather than the economy. What happened to famous Chinese long-termism?</p> <p>The only certain way to deal with a stock market bubble is let prices fall to the point where they are cheap. At 20 times earnings, the Chinese market is not an obvious bargain even after these declines. The deeper worry is this: if the Chinese authorities think a wobble in the stock market is a threat to financial stability, do they have the ammunition to cope with a proper crisis in the more important property market?</p> <h2>Click, collect and cough up \u2013 the new retail trend is no longer free</h2> <p>The John Lewis click and collect service has been a huge success. Anyone who really needs another lip gloss or a new pair of tights can order by 8pm and the item is ready to collect at a John Lewis or Waitrose supermarket branch after 2pm the next day. Whether the item cost \u00a33 or \u00a3300, there is no delivery cost to customers.</p> <p>About half of the department store\u2019s online orders make use of the service, and the number of items being clicked and collected has exploded from 350,000 in 2008 to some 6 million now.</p> <p>But from the end of the month John Lewis will no longer allow free pick-ups on purchases of less than \u00a330. Customers will have to hand over \u00a32 to pick up lower-value purchases in store.</p> <p>It was inevitable. Shipping individual items out of a centralised warehouse in Milton Keynes, overnight, to one of hundreds of possible destinations makes no financial sense if the goods are worth just a few pounds. The profit margin on the item would be slashed. Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, had just the word to describe this sales model: \u201cbonkers\u201d.</p> <p>The collapse of City Link \u2013 which delivered goods for John Lewis \u2013 at Christmas shed light on the cost pressures of home deliveries. Drivers described how they received \u00a32.15 per delivery, no matter how many items were going to one house.</p> <p>Free click and collect is still on offer at Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and House of Fraser. But rivals will be watching the impact of the new John Lewis delivery charge, and simultaneously keeping an eye on Amazon. The online retailer last week unveiled a new Prime Now service that offers deliveries in some areas of London within an hour for \u00a36.99, or free within a two-hour slot.</p> <p>The likelihood is that people will pay up \u2013 \u00a32 is not a big ask for JL\u2019s well-heeled shoppers. But the charge \u2013 and the new Amazon deal, which will be rolled out beyond London in coming months \u2013 show that delivery options are now a key part of the offer.</p> <h2>A bad reason to shorten a lifeline for savers</h2> <p>Greeks queuing to take their cash out of banks evoke memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007. So it is apt that it should be last week that the Bank of England had to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/03/bank-of-england-cuts-savings-protection-euro-crisis\" title=\"\">announce a \u00a310,000 cut</a> to the amount covered by the deposit protection scheme, which became such a focus during the banking crisis.</p> <p>Since the end of 2010, \u00a385,000 in savings accounts in the UK has been covered by the scheme, which guarantees a saver\u2019s money should a bank, building society or credit union go bust. The level was based on the threshold of \u20ac100,000 set across the European Union at the height of banking crisis; uniformity was needed to stop savers pushing their cash across borders to chase the best protection. But as Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, points out, it is absurd that the level of protection for UK savers should depend on currency fluctuations, forcing a cut in the guarantee to \u00a375,000. Someone needs to take action.</p>",
