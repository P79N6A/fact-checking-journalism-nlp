      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow, after another day dominated by wild swings in the markets and angst over the global economy. Will Tuesday be different? Come back tomorrow and find out. Goodnight! GW Wall Street has closed for the night, after a day of turmoil in the major stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial has finished down 177 points, or 1.1%, at 16,027, as gloom over global growth hit financial stocks. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers more US stocks than the Dow, shed 1.4% and the Nasdaq finished down 1.8%. Serious losses, but better than the lowest points of the day. Wall Street was dragged up by a late rally in energy stocks. Credit card firm Visa was the biggest faller on the Dow, followed by Goldman Sachs: Tech firms had a bad day - with social media network Twitter dropping by over 5% to a new record low: As we\u2019ve been covering for the last 14 hours, that followed hefty losses in Europe. The FTSE 100 plunged by 2.7%, or 158 points, wiping \u00a340bn off the blue-chip London index. And European markets fell further, hit by fears over the banking sector and the global economy. Greece was the worst performer, though, hitting its lowest level in 25 years! Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said investors are increasingly anxious about the \u201cfundamental picture\u201d of the world economy. Callan said: \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks. \u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s selloff: Hello..... the US stock market is staging a late rally, bouncing off its earlier lows. The Dow is now down just 150 points, or 0.9%, having been down almost 400 points a couple of hours ago: Some big names are leading the Wall Street fallers, with 20 minutes until the closing bell is rung. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is down 5.8%, mirroring the selloff in global banking stocks. Visa is close behind, down 5.6%, followed by Nike (5%), Home Depot (4.6%) and Boeing (3%). Here\u2019s a few photos from Wall Street today, as traders faced another day of chunky losses. Deutsche Bank\u2019s soothing statement about its bond repayments may have calmed investors nerves a little. Shares are creeping back from their lows on Wall Street, meaning the Dow is now only down 269 points, or 1.7%. Good news, there\u2019s only one hour to go until Wall Street closes and Manic Monday is over. Bad news, the US stock market is still heavily in the red. The Dow is down 2.17%, or 351 points to the bad, with the S&amp;P and Nasdaq in deeper trouble: Newsflash: Deutsche Bank has just issued a statement, saying it can meet a crucial debt repayment in April. The Frankfurt-based bank, which was at the heart of today\u2019s market turmoil, says it has a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of around \u20ac1bn. That will cover the \u20ac350m due in April on its CoCo bonds -- debt which converts into shares, or is wiped out, if a bank hits financial problems and defaults. As we covered this morning (details here), some analysts fear Deutsche could miss a CoCo payment in 2017, if economic conditions worsen. Deutsche says it will probably have a \u201cpayment capacity\u201d of \u20ac4.3bn next year in 2017, depending on its operating performance this year. Here\u2019s Deutsche\u2019s statement: Deutsche Bank publishes updated information about AT1 payment capacity The stock market turmoil risks blowing a multi-billion pound black hole in the UK government\u2019s fiscal plans. That\u2019s the warning from the IFS thinktank, which published its Green Budget today, one month ahead of the official budget. Here\u2019s the story: Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances are warning that the turmoil on global stock markets threatens to leave a \u00a32bn black hole in George Osborne\u2019s deficit-reduction plans that could force the chancellor to raise taxes or make fresh cuts in spending to hit his budget targets. On a day in which share prices crashed in Europe and the US, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Osborne\u2019s plan to put the UK back in the black by the end of the current parliament was vulnerable to a protracted financial market panic. The IFS said tumbling share prices \u2013 which wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of the companies quoted on the FTSE 100 Index on Monday \u2013 were one of a number of factors that could blow the chancellor\u2019s plan off course in the next four years. Forecasts that wages growth will be lower than previously expected could knock another \u00a35bn hole in his budget, the thinktank said. And here\u2019s the full story: The Telegraph\u2019s Mehreen Kahn points out that the European banking sector has lost a sixth of its value in the last month. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s market mayhem: Global stocks were gripped by a fresh bout of panic selling on Monday raising fears over the health of the world\u2019s banking system for the first time since the financial crisis. European markets slumped to their lowest level in more than two years amid an unremittingly bleak outlook for the global economy and concerns over the resilience of the world\u2019s biggest lenders. The Euro Stoxx 600 index of leading bank shares fell as much as 6pc in Monday\u2019s trading, closing down 5.6pc, plumbing depths not seen since August 2012. The continent\u2019s lenders have now lost 17.3pc of their value of the last 30 days.... (more here) Anxious investors are continuing to pile into gold, sending it up to $1,200 per ounce for the first time in over seven months: So far this year, shares in America\u2019s largest banks have slumped by at least 15% as investors fear a global downturn. The biotech boom has speedily unwound, too.. There\u2019s no sign, yet, that Wall Street might recover from its early selloff. The Dow is stubbornly down around 344 points, or 2.1%, at 15,860 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%, and the tech stock-packed Nasdaq has shed 2.9%. That\u2019s nearly as bad as the European selloff, and suggests we\u2019re facing yet more market turbulence. \u201cYelp\u201d indeed..... US technology stocks are being hit hard today. Tesla, the electric car company, have slumped by 9% today, dropping below $150 for the first time in two years. Global markets suffered a bad start to the week, with the Chinese new year proving as turbulent as the slump in the early days of January. Although the Chinese markets were closed, that did not end the recent spate of volatility facing investors. Fears about a slowdown in global growth returned with a vengeance, while banking shares were among the poorest performers on worries about the outlook, and the effect of negative interest rates on their business. On top of that came a cocktail of other concerns, from the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union to concerns about the review of Greek\u2019s progress in meeting its bailout targets. The rout was widespread, with the Greek market at its lowest for around 25 years and the Eurofirst300 dropped to a near two and a half year low. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 158.7 points or 2.7% to 5689.36 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 3.3% to 8979.36 with Deutsche Bank 9.5% lower France\u2019s Cac closed 3.2% lower at 4066.31 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 4.09% to 16,441.2 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 4.44% at 8122.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 7.87% to 464.23 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 323 points or 2%. There seems little justification for the day\u2019s slump in banking shares, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: Markets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. The tables were turned in the UK stock market today with recent winners suffering from profit-taking, while the miners were virtually the only stocks to keep their heads above water. The collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment. A sense of panic seems to be setting in, but any increase in the oil price might help markets, said Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct: Equities across the globe have kicked off the week in a deeply downbeat mood. London\u2019s FTSE-100 has posted a 2.7% sell-off, pushing the benchmark index squarely back into bear-market territory, but losses across mainland Europe have been even more pronounced. The fact that WTI crude tested territory below $30/barrel once again has done nothing to help matters but we\u2019ve got this overriding fear that another global slow down is imminent and many investors are adjusting portfolios to suit. The theme of risk aversion is buoying precious metals... as gold eyes a break above $1200 an ounce for the first time in over six months. But 25 stocks [in the FTSE 100 are] sporting losses in excess of 5% on the day, underlying the sense of panic that is creeping in. Economic data remains thin on the ground tomorrow but given at least some of the downside in stocks can be attributed to that renewed weakness in oil, this remains a metric worth watching closely. Anything that fundamentally impacts on supply could be all it takes to instil some confidence in markets, but in the absence of any better news the bears are likely to remain in control. One reason for the current market problems is the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bloomberg has the story: Ever since the Federal Reserve began to withdraw monetary stimulus, liquidity has steadily been drying up. Therein lies the crux of the broader stress in financial markets, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which have seen violent selloffs occur following the surprise revaluations of currencies in Switzerland and China, as well as Japan\u2019s introduction of negative interest rates. Head of U.S. Mortgages Chris Flanagan and Strategist Mao Ding don\u2019t necessarily lay blame for market dislocations squarely on U.S. monetary policymakers. The two observe, however, that since early 2014\u2014when the Fed began winding down its open-ended asset purchases\u2014liquidity stress has \u201cpersistently risen\u201d and served as the proximate cause of the episodic spikes in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Financial Stress Index that have since occurred. [They said:] \u201cThis persistence suggests to us that deteriorating liquidity is at the heart of and may be the primary driver of broader rising financial stress.\u201d Full story here: Bank of America: This Chart Shows \u2018Deteriorating Liquidity\u2019 Is at the Heart of Market Carnage More turbulence in the banking sector, which has been by worries about negative interest rates, the outlook for profits and slowing global growth. Trading in Barclays shares was halted briefly after volatile movements. Now resumed, the shares are down 5.4%. With China\u2019s markets closed for the new year holiday, it is a worrying sign that share prices elsewhere continue to tumble, says Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG: The selling that began this morning has gathered pace across the globe this afternoon, as the US joins in the one-way move. Chinese investors will feel relieved that their market has taken the week off, but the absence of the volatility provided by Shanghai sends a worrying message \u2013 investors in the US and Europe are worried by many things, not least the current interest rate outlook in the US. Recent surveys of fund managers may indicate rising cash balances, but so far these appear to be remaining on the side lines, pulling the rug from under what remains of this bull market. In a week when economic data is relatively light, it is becoming increasingly apparent investors are struggling to find any positive news on which to create a rally. Then there are the banks. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Banking shares across Europe buckled under the pressure of global growth concerns in concert with the ugly spectre of negative interest rates. Weak earnings from European banks, notably that of Deutsche Bank have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse whose chief executive asked to have his bonus cut by as much as 50% is refocusing investor attention on bad loan books which have not been addressed since the European crisis. In the days after Deutsche Bank issued a surprise profit warning, credit default swap spreads ballooned as investors started to question the bank\u2019s ability to fund itself. The CDS jump has caused a sharp drop in Deutsche Bank shares. Markets continue to slide, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down around 300 points. Meanwhile in Greece, the Athens market has closed down 7.87% to 464.23, its lowest level in at least 25 years. Banks - as elsewhere - are among the biggest fallers, down up to nearly 30% in some cases. Greece\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said he expected the review of the country\u2019s bailout programme to restart next week, and conclude two weeks later. But with worries about planned pension and tax reforms - which have seen major protests in recent days - have unnerved investors. Manos Hatzidakis of Beta Securities told Reuters: The market is pricing in financial and political instability, and delays in the review. Sterling has hit a one week low, falling to $1.4393 amid worries about the outlook for banks and concerns about the effects of any vote from Britain to leave the European Union. It is also at a 13 month low against the euro. The recent move by central banks to push interest rates into negative territory is bold but unco-ordinated and could lead to a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d according to Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. The ratings agency said: Four European central banks--in Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, plus the European Central Bank--have adopted negative policy rates, and Japan surprisingly joined the club on January 29 this year. \u201cThe Bank of Japan\u2019s decision to follow suit on negative rates is likely to reinforce the trend toward shrinking yields in core government bond markets, as the search for yield spreads from Japan into Europe,\u201d said Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s economist Sophie Tahiri... \u201cThe bold venture into negative interest rates signals to market participants that central banks will use all tools at their disposal to meet inflation targets,\u201d said Ms Tahiri. \u201cThe problem is that all developed markets\u2019 central banks face the same deflationary pressures from weak commodity prices and have the same incentive to use their exchange rate to combat those pressures.\u201d This increasing competition between developed markets\u2019 central banks to stem currency appreciation signals a new phase in the extended aftermath of the global financial crisis. Independent attempts to weaken exchange rates could lead to an undesirable \u201crace to the bottom\u201d among central banks. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the Dow movers, mainly down of course: Amid the current worries about the global economy, Europe could start moving up the list according to strategist Graham Secker at Morgan Stanley. In a new note he says: We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d And then there is Europe: Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery. Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open. With the Greek stock market at its lowest since at least 1990 and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year: Readers in America should brace themselves. The selloff that began in Europe this morning is heading your way. Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up. \u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. Some analysts are concerned that Deutsche Bank may struggle to repay some of its bonds, if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. That\u2019s helps explains why its shares have slumped 5%, as investors also drive up the cost of insuring its debt. The key is Deutsche\u2019s CoCo bonds, or contingent convertible bonds, which are written down or converted to equity when a bank\u2019s capital falls to a certain level. CoCo bonds have been introduced since the 2008 financial crisis, to spare governments from funding another bailout. They pay a decent return, to encourage investors to hold them, in return for shouldering the risk if things go wrong. Bloomberg\u2019s John Glover has the story: Deutsche Bank may struggle to pay coupons on its riskiest bonds next year if operating results disappoint or litigation costs are higher than expected, according to analysts at CreditSights Inc. Bonds and stock of Germany\u2019s largest bank have plunged this year, with the shares shedding 35% of their value and its contingent convertible bonds -- known as CoCos, or additional Tier 1 securities -- turning in a similar performance. The cost of protecting the company\u2019s subordinated debt from default for five years using credit-default swaps has more than doubled since the end of 2015, rising to 420 basis points, a four-year high, from 187. \u201cWhile we are confident about 2016 coupons, we are less so about coupon payments in 2017,\u201d CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson wrote in a note to clients today. Deutsche Bank will do \u201ceverything in its power to pay them\u201d because it will need to issue such bonds in the future, he said. Full story: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Woes Threaten CoCo Coupons, CreditSights Says The selloff is gathering pace in Frankfurt. The German DAX index has just slumped through the 9,000 point mark for the first time in 16 months, down 3.2%. Bank stocks are leading the DAX further down.... Stock market wizards like to tell you that \u2018buy and hold\u2019 is a solid strategy, that allows shareholders to ride out turbulence. Shares outperform other assets in the long term, they chant. Well, tell that to a Greek investor. The Athens market has just slumped to its lowest level in at least 25 years. Greek bank shares are being pulverised today, with Eurobank down 27%, National Bank of Greece down 25% and Piraeus down 20%. It\u2019s only three months since the Greek banking sector was recapitalised, getting \u20ac14bn of new funding to help stabilise the economy. China has lost its claim to be the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, to India. New government figures from Delhi show that Indian gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the last quarter of 2015, compared with a year earlier. That beats China, which expanded by 6.8% over the same period. India\u2019s statistics body also estimated that GDP will expand by 7.6% in the year through March. That would also outpace Beijing, which is aiming for growth close to 7%. Caution is needed with these figures. Many economists suspect China is growing rather slower than the official readings. And some have told Reuters that India\u2019s figures are surprisingly strong. Almost every company on the FTSE 100 index has fallen this morning, during another bout of heavy selling across Europe\u2019s stock markets. Worries over the state of the world economy continue to drive shares lower. Only five companies are defying the rout, including gold producer Randgold and silver producer Fresnillo, who are both benefitting from the panic. That has left the FTSE 100 languishing at 5,735 points, down 112 points or 1.9% today. Other European markets are deeper in the red, losing around 2.4% on average, and hitting their lowest level since October 2014. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has summed up the situation (I\u2019ve added links to key points in this blog): A slow start soon turned disastrous this Monday, with many of the European indices plunging to lows not seen since October 2014. With Citigroup warning of a potential \u2018death spiral\u2019 if investors behave irrationally to the stronger dollar/weaker commodities/harmed emerging markets cycle that the world appears to be trapped in at the moment, the markets have taken another kicking this Monday. It doesn\u2019t help, of course, that the day\u2019s economic calendar is so sparse, with investors left pondering the purely negative side of things as the morning continued. The FTSE sank by nearly 2%, plummeting past 5800 in the process as Brent Crude fell back towards the $33 per barrel mark. The DAX, always the liveliest index in instances like this, lopped off a whopping 2.6% in value as the morning progressed, and is in serious danger of falling below the 9000 mark; the CAC, meanwhile, matched its dramatic German peer with its own 2.5% drop. The Eurozone had the added negative of a 10 month low Sentix investor confidence figure, the reported 6.0 far lower than the 9.6 announced in January, whilst the German index has the extra burden of a dismal morning from Deutsche Bank. The FT\u2019s Joel Lewin has a handy explanation of why bank shares are falling today. Fears surrounding non-performing loans and other deep-rooted issues in the Italian banking sector have driven nerves, while a slew of weak earnings from large banks such as Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have added to concerns. Weak growth provides an unsupportive backdrop, as does the possibility of more deeply negative benchmark interest rates. And that\u2019s why Commerzbank has dropped by 4.7%, Deutsche Bank is down 3.4%, and BNP Paribas has lost 3.3%. UK banks are also suffering, with Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland both down 1.7% In another sign of angst, the gold price has just hit a three month high. Bullion is swapping hands at $1,171 per ounce, the most since the end of October. It has already gained around 10% since the start of 2016, as concerns over the world economic outlook have grown. The OECD think tank has issued new economic indicators for investors to digest (in between hammering the SELL button). It sees \u2018tentative\u2019 signs that the Chinese economy is bottoming out, but slowing growth in the US. The OECD is also quite upbeat about Europe, saying: In the euro area as a whole, and in Germany and Italy, the composite leading indicators signal stable growth momentum while in France the outlook is for firming growth.\u201d We\u2019ll find out on Friday if they\u2019re right, when the latest eurozone GDP figures are published (starting at 6.30am GMT, so set your alarm clocks). How worried should we really, really be about a global recession? No-one knows for sure. But investment bank Goldman Sachs reckons it is still unlikely, despite fears that the recent market turmoil will feed into the \u2018real economy\u2019. They have estimated that there is an 18% chance that the United States goes into recession over the next year, rising to 23% over the next two years. For the eurozone, it\u2019s a 24% risk this year, up to 38% by the end of 2017. So hardly a done deal. Goldman\u2019s Jan Hatzius agues that \u201cThe recent market weakness should provide good risk-adjusted opportunities for those brave enough to defy Mr. Market\u2019s gloomy prognosis about the world economy.\u201d The selloff in European markets this morning suggests Mr Market isn\u2019t convinced.... The Greek stock market is still falling, and now down over 6%. That\u2019s pretty worrying, given the political tensions in Athens. Wall Street is expected to suffer losses when trading begins in New York, in just over three hours time. According to the future market, the Dow Jones industrial average will fall 1.2% at the open. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is being called down 1.6%. The oil price is falling again, hit by concerns over the global economy. Brent crude has dropped by 1.7% to $33.47 per barrel, wiping out last week\u2019s rally. Confirmation that Germany\u2019s stock market is at a 15-month low: The Greek stock market has slumped by 5% to its lowest level since 2012 - when it nearly left the eurozone. That\u2019s partly due to the general wave of worry today, but it also reflects the standoff over Greece\u2019s bailout. Creditors are pushing the government to make deeper pension reforms, while protestors flocked to the streets last week to call for less austerity. European banking shares are bearing the brunt of today\u2019s rout. In Germany, shares in Deutsche Bank have tumbled by 4.35%. And the cost of insuring Deutsche\u2019s debt against default, using a credit default swap or CDS, has hit the highest level since July 2012. That underlines how much nervousness is in the markets today: Last month, Deutsche announced that it suffered a loss of \u20ac6.7bn last year. New CEO John Cryan said it was \u2018sobering\u2019, and some analysts fear Cryan will struggle to turn Deutsche around in the current market turmoil. As well as the huge loss, Deutsche also reported falling revenues. According to Bloomberg, that could indicate the bank will struggle to hit its capital ratio targets. As shares slide, investors are scrambling to get their hands on safe-haven assets such as German government debt today. And that has driven the yield, or interest rate, on German bunds into deeper negative territory. In other words, traders are willing to pay more than the face value of the bonds and accept a guaranteed loss - unless they can offload them onto someone even more desperate..... A wave of selling is gripping Europe\u2019s stock markets, as this morning\u2019s stream of bad news hits traders. In London, the FTSE 100 index is suddenly down by 101 points, or 1.7%. And there are steeper losses across Europe, where the benchmark FTSeurofirst 300 index has shed 2%. That means European stocks are at their lowest point since October 2014, as money pours out of shares and into safe-haven bonds. Concerns over the weakness of the global economy appear to be rippling through trading floors again. The sharp fall in eurozone investor confidence reported a few minutes ago is contributing to the bad mood: Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG. says: Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... with the disappointing Sentix figures triggering a mid-morning selloff. The news that UK business morale has hit a three-year low isn\u2019t helping either. More gloom! Economic sentiment among investors across the eurozone has fallen sharply this month, as the problems in the global economy hit Europe. Sentix, the Frankfurt-based think tank, has just reported that its index of investor morale has hit a 10-month low in February, dropping from 9.6 to 6.0. And its sub-index of economic expectations hit its lowest level since November, 2014, sliding from 6.3 to just 1.5. Manfred Huebner, Sentix\u2019s managing director, warns: The euro zone proves it is not immune to the enormous loss of momentum in the global economy. The global economy is thus currently on the brink, led by a US economic downturn! Sentix blamed \u201cthe loss of dynamism\u201d in Germany and the United States, while Latin America and Eastern Europe are in a worse state. And Sentix singles out the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increase last December, which is \u201cnow considered a big mistake by the majority of investors\u201d. It also pointed to the slump in commodity prices, and its impact on emerging markets. Wall Street bank Citigroup has contributed to the sombre feeling in the markets, with a research note last week warning that we could face a \u2018death spiral\u2019. The bad news, according to Citi, is that the dollar could keep strengthening, driving commodity prices lower, hurting emerging markets (EM), and thus pushing the dollar higher etc etc. The good news is that it probably won\u2019t happen though, if \u2018rational behaviour\u2019 kicks in . CNBC has the details: \u201cThe world appears to be trapped in a circular reference death spiral,\u201d Citi strategists led by Jonathan Stubbs said in a report on Thursday. \u201cStronger U.S. dollar, weaker oil/commodity prices, weaker world trade/petrodollar liquidity, weaker EM (and global growth)... and repeat. Ad infinitum, this would lead to Oilmageddon, a \u2018significant and synchronized\u2019 global recession and a proper modern-day equity bear market.\u201d Stubbs said that macro strategists at Citi forecast that the dollar would weaken in 2016 and that oil prices were likely bottoming, potentially providing some light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cThe death spiral is in nobody\u2019s interest. Rational behaviour, most likely, will prevail,\u201d he said in the report. Great headline - but maybe the report is a little overblown? One money manager thinks so.... The Economist Intelligence Unit is also concerned about the economic situation. Their managing director, Robin Bew, tweets that they think UK interest rates will remain at 0.5% until 2019 In another sign of unease, shares in UK chipmaker ARM Holdings have slipped by 4% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. ARM reports results on Wednesday, and analysts fear it is suffering from the slowdown in the US technology sector. Last week, Apple predicted that sales of the iPhone (which uses ARM chips) will start to fall later this year. Another UK tech firm called Imagination, which designs chips, warned this morning it will make an operating loss this year. It blamed a slowing market, and uncertainty over China. Peter Elston, chief investment officer at Seneca Investment Managers, argues that we\u2019re unlikely to be entering a recession yet. Recessions generally start because central banks are trying to restrain economies, he told Bloomberg TV this morning. But right now, inflation pressures are very low, and economies are still some way from full capacity. \u201cThis would be an extremely unusual place for a global recession to start.\u201d True. But arguably, we\u2019ve been in an \u201cextremely unusual place\u201d since the financial crisis, with central bank stimulus has been underpinning growth. Ultra-low interest rates helped struggling firms limp on and quantitative easing pumped up the stock market. Still, though, global growth is weak and vulnerable to the impact of higher US interest rates - unless the Fed changes course.... Shares in engine maker Rolls Royce have shed 2% at the start of trading, as the City braces for further problems. After hitting shareholders with five profit warnings in two years, Rolls-Royce could now slash its dividend when it posts its annual results on Friday. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The company has been hurt by cuts to defence spending by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and a slump in the oil price. European stock markets have begun the new week rather gingerly. The FTSE 100 index has gained 20 points, or 0.4%, but Germany\u2019s DAX is only up 0.1% and the French CAC is slightly lower. This fall in UK business confidence will only fuel concern that the global economy is slowing. Chris Weston of financial spread-betting firm IG says this is the biggest issue in the markets today. Will we see a recession in the US and other developed nations? There is little doubt this is the number one question being asked right now. He points out that insurance against company\u2019s defaulting has spiked in value recently, especially for banks. And the stock market turbulence, and the recent surge in the US dollar, show how financial conditions have deteriorated. If that feeds through to the real economy, we could be in serious trouble. As Chris puts it: The strong fear is this stress \u2013 that is clearly being felt in the financial markets \u2013 will start to filter through to Main Street. We have some worrying news to start the week -- confidence among UK executives has hit its lowest level since 2013. Concerns over Britain\u2019s upcoming EU referendum are adding to worries over the global economy. And business leaders now fear their companies are suffering. That\u2019s according to a regular survey conducted by BDO, the professional services firm. It warns that the UK is now suffering from problems in the global economy, particularly China\u2019s slowdown and signs of weakness in America. The turmoil in the Middle East is also hitting confidence. Peter Hemington, partner at BDO LLP, warns: \u201cGlobal headwinds are finally hitting business confidence and the added uncertainty of EU referendum just round the corner is fuelling concerns. This knocked BDO\u2019s Business Optimism Index \u2013 which predicts growth six months ahead \u2013 down to 100.0. That\u2019s the tipping point below which firms expect their output growth to drop under the long term trend rate. So what can be done? One option, the BDO says, is for the government to introduce a zero-rate of VAT on companies that sell their goods to exporters. Manufacturers could certainly use some help. The sector is already in recession, even though the wider UK economy grew by a solid-enough 0.5% in the final quarter of 2015. BDO found that manufacturing output contracted again this month, which it attribued to \u201cdecreasing global confidence\u201d. Dr Gerard Lyons, the Mayor London\u2019s economic advisor, points out that other measures were less gloomy: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It looks like a quiet start to the week, as investors wait to hear from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Yellen testifies to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, and will give her take on the recent turmoil in the financial markets, and the state of the global economy. She\u2019s also likely to be questioned on whether the Fed was right to raise interest rates in December, and whether future hikes are now on the back-burner. It could be a tricky balancing act for Yellen; she won\u2019t want to fuel the current market angst, but nor can she sound complacent. Thomas Costerg, of Standard Chartered Bank in New York, predicts that Yellen will keep her options open regarding future interest rate rises: \u201cShe may emphasize the positives in the U.S. economy, particularly the still-strong labor market. Looking ahead, she may sound more cautious, and she will likely highlight that the negatives are mostly from abroad and that they are watching the global picture closely.\u201d City traders are also digesting the news that China burned through another $99.5bn in foreign exchange reserves last month, defending the yuan. That takes China\u2019s FX reserves down to their lowest level since 2012, although Beijing still has $3.23 trillion fo firepower. Those figures haven\u2019t alarmed Chinese investors, though, as they are now on holiday for the Chinese New Year. We\u2019re expecting a quiet start to trading in Europe, with the main indices expected to rise. And there\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from the monthly survey of eurozone Investor Confidence, from Sentix, at 9.30am GMT.",

In a new note he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We struggle to remember many occasions when investor sentiment was quite as bearish and widespread as it feels today. Sure, 2008 was worse as the global financial crisis and fears of global depression created panic in markets, but today\u2019s cool disdain for risk assets still takes some beating. When we were asked by a client this week what reason bullish investors were citing for their optimism, we had to confess that we couldn\u2019t answer as we hadn\u2019t met any in recent times. The collective noun for a group of bears is a \u2018sleuth\u2019, but it doesn\u2019t take much detective work just now to identify what investors are concerned about. </p> </blockquote> <p>Those concerns revolve around the usual suspects - China, emerging markets, dollar, oil etc - but added to that are the fact that central banks are moving towards negative interest rates, which is not particularly positive for equity markets. Secker said he feared any moves higher by stock markets, prompted by relief rallies on positive new, would \u201cprove short-lived as investors increasingly question the value and effectiveness of further central bank action.\u201d</p> <p>And then there is Europe:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent investor caution tends to focus on fears of excess US dollar strength, low oil prices and/or China, but we think it is quite plausible that Europe moves back up the pecking order (to its more usual place some would say!) as we move through 2016. The UK\u2019s forthcoming referendum on EU membership, likely to take place in June, may appear the most plausible catalyst in the short term to raise regional risk premia, but the ongoing migrant issue risks eroding political cohesion over the medium term and political uncertainty is rising in the periphery.</p> <p>Greece has a daunting debt repayment due this summer, Spain is currently without a government, new European regulations are preventing Italy from adopting an effective \u2018bad bank\u2019 solution and the recently elected socialist government in Portugal is reversing course on prior austerity and competitiveness improvements. During a cyclical upswing, markets are prone to overlook such concerns, but the opposite would be true if growth starts to relapse. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b8a5ede4b09b1cb9ebb4fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T14:34:30.619Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens sharply lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have followed Europe into the red, as fears about the global economy continue to rattle investors.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 220 points or 1.3% while the S&amp;P 500 is down just over 1% and the Nasdaq has fallen 1.7% at the open.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b8a3cfe4b08e789ae4d89b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T14:20:34.092Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the Greek stock market at <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/08/uk-business-confidence-falls-global-recession-fears-markets-business-live?page=with:block-56b891ebe4b08e789ae4d874#block-56b891ebe4b08e789ae4d874\">its lowest since at least 1990</a></strong> and banks bearing the brunt of the selling, here is the huge damage done to the four biggest since the start of the year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zantespear/status/696698428580036608\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola\">@Frances_Coppola</a> Greece 4 biggest banks YTD Alpha Bank -45,38% NBG -40,82% Piraeus -51,08% Eurobank -47,31%.Market cap YTD from 11.5B to 6B</p>&mdash; Theo Mylonas (@zantespear) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zantespear/status/696698428580036608\">February 8, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b89faee4b08a40b2bad984\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T14:10:11.322Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Readers in America should brace themselves. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/08/uk-business-confidence-falls-global-recession-fears-markets-business-live?page=with:block-56b882ffe4b08e789ae4d841#block-56b882ffe4b08e789ae4d841\">The selloff that began in Europe this morning </a>is heading your way. </strong></p> <p>Wall Street is expected to fall sharply when trading begins in 20 minutes time, as fears over the global economy reach New York.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is tipped to fall by over 1%, while US crude oil is flirting with the $30/barrel mark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"072c6afddf0177015aeb3ea03e47fd44c03a8d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/072c6afddf0177015aeb3ea03e47fd44c03a8d89/0_0_545_221/500.jpg\" alt=\"Here\u2019a a handy Wall Street scorecard from the FT\" width=\"500\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here\u2019a a handy Wall Street scorecard from the FT</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Terry Sandven,</strong> chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, told Reuters that investors will remain nervous until the oil price picks up.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cEquities are in a \u2018go-nowhere-fast\u2019 mode, with a downward bias in the near term. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b89bdfe4b08a40b2bad97c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-08T13:58:13.913Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Is this why Deutsche Bank shares are falling?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eb3be0b1d90647a8e7cda0107c9e7057a70883f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb3be0b1d90647a8e7cda0107c9e7057a70883f9/0_0_2162_3500/618.jpg\" alt=\"The headquarter of German company Deutsche Bank is pictured in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, on January 28, 2016.

There is talk of a US recession, induced by a strong dollar that is already causing havoc in China, much of the rest of Asia and Latin America. In the good \u2013 or bad \u2013 old days, we could predict what the chair of US Federal Reserve would do in these circumstances. Alan Greenspan would cut interest rates, or hint at his intention to do so. Is Janet Yellen, Greenspan\u2019s successor but one, of similar mind? If she is, she has an opportunity to say so on Wednesday when she begins two days of testimony before Congress. This event has suddenly assumed an importance that seemed unlikely when the Fed raised interest rates last December for the first time since 2006. Back then, investors cheered the early evidence of \u201cnormalisation\u201d in monetary conditions. Stock markets rose and few were troubled by the thought of four quarter-point increases in US rates in 2016. The economy looked strong enough to take it. Two months later, and investors are screaming for relief. The central banks of Japan, the eurozone, and the UK have turned their dials to dovish in the face of weakening global growth, and now the same is demanded of the US. Some even argue that the Fed should reverse December\u2019s tweak, not just signal delays to further rises. Yellen plainly won\u2019t go that far. But she could join her colleague William Dudley in warning that additional strength in the dollar could have \u201csignificant consequences\u201d for the US economy. That would be a sure sign that a rate rise in March is off the agenda. Embarrassing for Yellen? Absolutely: the Fed, having trailed its plans for a year, cannot have expected to hit a hurdle so soon. But embarrassment is better than ploughing on regardless. The basic fact is that the world economy, and the US, looks weaker than two months ago. That fragility is deeply alarming but, for the Fed\u2019s credibility, a small about-face now is better than a big U-turn later. Yellen should delay a rate rise \u2013 not for fear of igniting more turmoil in financial markets, but because the economic weather has deteriorated. HSBC: should we stay or go now? Even HSBC can\u2019t prolong the suspense much longer. A decision on whether to stay in London or go is imminent. Having pondered the question since last April, the board can\u2019t credibly delay beyond the full-year results on 22 February. London is now deemed by outsiders the warm favourite, which should not be surprising. Chancellor George Osborne has performed contortions in pursuit of his \u201cnew settlement\u201d with the banking industry, rejigging the bank levy to the benefit of mega banks such as HSBC and to the disadvantage of the \u201cchallenger\u201d banks that were once the politicians\u2019 favourites. Meanwhile, the supposed allure of Hong Kong has surely faded in the past year as Chinese regulators have shown themselves to be variously naive and incompetent when trying to manage the inevitable popping of their stock market bubble. Hong Kong may still formally enjoy the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model but, when contemplating moving a bank the size of HSBC, it\u2019s the 20-year, or 30-year, outlook \u2013 which remains obscure \u2013 that matters. The decision lies with HSBC and its shareholders, of course, but we can make one plea. If London is the winner, HSBC should commit for a decade or so. Anything less and its board would look as if it is addicted to prevarication. Rolls-Royce must stay in the driving seat The debate over Rolls-Royce\u2019s dividend seems more of a non-debate. Nine times out of 10, roughly speaking, companies that say they will \u201cconsider\u201d changes to their dividend policy \u2013 as Rolls did last November \u2013 end up cutting. It is true that Rolls\u2019 balance sheet is not under severe strain, even after five profits warnings in two years, but there\u2019s no point giving credit rating agencies an excuse to grumble. Downgrades could affect the Rolls\u2019 negotiating clout when signing 20-year service contracts on engines. Stay away from that slippery slope. A near-halving of the dividend would save \u00a3200m a year. It all helps. In fact, the more interesting question for Friday\u2019s full-year results is whether Rolls will grant a seat in the boardroom to ValueAct. The US activist hedge fund is a 10% shareholder in Rolls and its request for a seat needs to be answered. The view here remains the same: just say no. ValueAct may be co-operative in style but there is no guarantee that it wants to stay for the long-haul, which is what a seat in the boardroom should mean. Chairman Ian Davis should keep it simple and remember that managers are paid to manage.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets around the globe have plunged into the red, amid fears that weaker growth will leave banks exposed to a fresh economic slowdown. Investors dumped shares and piled into the safe havens of gold and government bonds in a resumption of the panic conditions that marked the start to trading in 2016. With some analysts rekindling memories of the crash of 2008, shares in London closed only just above their lowest level in four years after a 159-point fall sent the FTSE 100 index 2.7% lower to 5689 points. Bourses in Frankfurt and Paris had even worse days, both closing down more than 3%. The Greek stock market plunged to its lowest level for 25 years. US stock markets seemed set for a similar sell-off but managed a late rally to pare back on some of the day\u2019s losses. Much of the focus was on the banking sector, where falling share prices reflected the increasing riskiness of the sector.\u201d In the US Goldman Sachs lost 4.6%, Morgan Stanley 6.9%. Falling banking shares accounted for a fifth of the fall in the FTSE 100. Shares in Barclays and Standard Chartered were briefly suspended on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 although the biggest loser was Deutsche Bank, listed in Frankfurt, which lost almost 10% during the day. \u201cThe fundamental picture is clearly softening,\u201d said Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks. \u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d Bank shares have been under pressure since the start of the year as concerns about the global economy have knocked sentiment. But Monday left them nursing further losses. Deutsche \u2013 Germany\u2019s biggest bank \u2013 and Credit Suisse of Switzerland have now lost a third of their value since the start of the year. Deutsche, which last month reported its first full-year loss since the 2008 crisis, was under the microscope after the cost of buying insurance against default rose sharply. \u201cWhile we think the market is overstating the risks, and the panic is not justified by the fundamentals, it is hard to see a catalyst that will turn sentiment round in the near term,\u201d said analysts at CreditSights. Investors raised fears that Deutsche might not be able to make payments on specialised bonds issued in 2014 that can be converted into shares during times of crisis. This was despite reassurance from the bank\u2019s finance director only last month that such payments would be made. Bonds such as these are relatively new and investors have been attracted to them because they pay relatively high coupons, or returns, to investors. The cost of buying insurance against default, measured by credit default swaps, hit a two-and-a-half-year high, although banks are holding more capital than they were before the 2008 crisis. In the UK, the stock market turmoil has already prompted George Osborne to delay an offering of Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public. The shares are down almost 20% this year. Shares in the other bailed out bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, are down nearly 25% since the turn of 2016. Traders said concerns over bank margins in a negative interest rate environment were hurting the bank sector after central banks in Europe and Japan hinted in January that already low interest rates could be cut further. Worries over a possible British vote to leave the European Union later this year were also weighing. HSBC, which is heavily exposed to emerging markets, dropped to its lowest level since 2009, the year that marked the low point for the global economy. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said: \u201cCentral banks are turning to negative rates in order to combat deflationary pressures and currency appreciation. But simultaneous independent efforts to depreciate could result in an undesirable \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 among central banks.\u201d An early sell-off in the City was amplified when trading began in New York with a sharp drop in all three of the US\u2019s leading share-price indicators. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 300 points in the first three hours of trading on Wall Street, dropping below the 16,000 level. The tech-dominated Nasdaq index was down by more than 2%, with shares in Facebook, Google and Amazon all down sharply. Oil prices fell by 2% after talks between Saudi Arabia and Venezuela on possible production curbs ended inconclusively. Brent crude was trading just under $33.50 a barrel. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cMarkets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. \u201cThe collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment.\u201d",

Bourses in Frankfurt and Paris had even worse days, both closing down more than 3%. The Greek stock market plunged to its lowest level for 25 years. </p> <p>US stock markets seemed set for a similar sell-off but managed a late rally to pare back on some of the day\u2019s losses. </p> <p>Much of the focus was on the banking sector, where falling share prices reflected the increasing riskiness of the sector.\u201d In the US Goldman Sachs lost 4.6%, Morgan Stanley 6.9%. Falling banking shares accounted for a fifth of the fall in the FTSE 100.</p> <p>Shares in Barclays and Standard Chartered were briefly suspended on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 although the biggest loser was Deutsche Bank, listed in Frankfurt, which lost almost 10% during the day.</p> <p>\u201cThe fundamental picture is clearly softening,\u201d said Owen Callan, senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. \u201cPeople are worried about the global economy and particularly now we are beginning to look at the banks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cYou are seeing more and more people saying: \u2018Is this 2008 again?\u2019 Maybe not quite as severe, but do we need to be worrying about the banking sector and risk assets on a bigger level?\u201d </p> <p>Bank shares have been under pressure since the start of the year as concerns about the global economy have knocked sentiment. But Monday left them nursing further losses. Deutsche \u2013 Germany\u2019s biggest bank \u2013 and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/08/credit-suisse-chief-asks-for-significant-reduction-to-annual-bonus\">Credit Suisse of Switzerland</a> have now lost a third of their value since the start of the year.</p> <p>Deutsche, which last month reported its first full-year loss since the 2008 crisis, was under the microscope after the cost of buying insurance against default rose sharply. \u201cWhile we think the market is overstating the risks, and the panic is not justified by the fundamentals, it is hard to see a catalyst that will turn sentiment round in the near term,\u201d said analysts at CreditSights.</p> <p>Investors raised fears that Deutsche might not be able to make payments on specialised bonds issued in 2014 that can be converted into shares during times of crisis. This was despite reassurance from the bank\u2019s finance director only last month that such payments would be made.</p> <p>Bonds such as these are relatively new and investors have been attracted to them because they pay relatively high coupons, or returns, to investors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c70b782595ca1e66ce012c3f0714862e61946ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c70b782595ca1e66ce012c3f0714862e61946ab/0_170_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders hurry across the floor of the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders hurry across the floor of the NYSE as low stocks put the market on track for its second sizeable loss in a row.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cost of buying insurance against default, measured by credit default swaps, hit a two-and-a-half-year high, although banks are holding more capital than they were before the 2008 crisis.</p> <p>In the UK, the stock market turmoil has already prompted George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/george-osborne-postpones-sale-sell-off-last-publicly-owned-lloyds-bank-shares\">to delay an offering of Lloyds Banking Group shares</a> to the public. The shares are down almost 20% this year. Shares in the other bailed out bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, are down nearly 25% since the turn of 2016.</p> <p>Traders said concerns over bank margins in a negative interest rate environment were hurting the bank sector after central banks in Europe and Japan hinted in January that already low interest rates could be cut further.</p> <p>Worries over a possible British vote to leave the European Union later this year were also weighing. HSBC, which is heavily exposed to emerging markets, dropped to its lowest level since 2009, the year that marked the low point for the global economy.</p> <p>The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said: \u201cCentral banks are turning to negative rates in order to combat deflationary pressures and currency appreciation.

Oil prices fell by 2% after talks between Saudi Arabia and Venezuela on possible production curbs ended inconclusively. Brent crude was trading just under $33.50 a barrel.</p> <p>Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cMarkets are clearly worried about a global economic downturn at a time when central banks have little dry powder left to fight off recessionary forces. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe collapse in the oil price has been a big shock to the financial system and its effects are still being absorbed by international stock markets, in particular the implications for global demand. Financials have been really badly hit of late, and in a sign of how dire things have got, some European banks are trading lower than they did during the depths of the financial crisis. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much justification for such a dismal outlook, but markets appear to be stuck in a negative feedback loop at the moment.\u201d</p>",

Then they noticed the letter-sized sign with \u201cBRB\u201d written in bold letters. Across the country, confused customers were denied their burrito fix on Monday as Chipotle held a nationwide meeting to update staff on changes to its food safety protocol following a six-month long E coli outbreak that has battered the company\u2019s image. The meeting, which started at 11am ET, was first announced on 15 January. All US stores were set to re-open at 3pm, after 50,000 employees gathered at more than 400 locations as executives discussed the future of the company. The E coli outbreak might have caused the Chipotle shares to tumble in value over the past months and many of its customers to leave, but not everyone was dissuaded. As the Chipotle doors remained closed, tourists, teenagers with skateboards and local businessmen in search for lunch attempted to get in. A father and son duo were attempting to get in as six Chipotle workers walked up. \u201cThree o\u2019clock. We will open at three o\u2019clock,\u201d said one of the female employees as her colleagues gave cards for free burrito, tacos or salad to passerbys. The card was valid between 4 and 8pm that evening. The employees had just come back from the meeting, a second female employee said. Did they learn anything? \u201cOh, yes. A lot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I cannot share it with you.\u201d Parts of the Monday\u2019s meeting were live-tweeted by Chipotle. The company also live-streamed a portion of the meeting on Periscope. Not wasting any time, founder and CEO Steve Ells kicked off the meeting with an apology, saying that he was deeply sorry that people became ill after eating Chipotle and that he is committed to making sure it won\u2019t happen again. \u201cWe\u2019ve come together today to make sure Chipotle is not just the most delicious place to eat, but also the safest,\u201d co-CEO Montgomery \u201cMonty\u201d Moran said on Monday. Chipotle has a long way to go to recover from the outbreak. Over the past 12 months, the value of Chipotle stock has dropped by more than 30%. This time last year, Chipotle was worth $648 a share. On Monday, its shares were worth about $448. On 1 February, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the E coli outbreak appeared to be over. Yet the six-month-plus outbreak had already taken its toll. As the outbreak continued, Chipotle had to close number of stores for days and weeks at the time and in the process had lost many of its loyal customers. In December, the company was served with a grand jury subpoena as a part of a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration into an outbreak at one of its California locations. Chipotle said it will fully cooperate with the investigation, but failed to notify its shareholders of the subpoena until January. Week into the New Year, Chipotle\u2019s investors filed a class action lawsuit claiming that the company\u2019s executives misled them and the public about the severity of the outbreaks. It further alleged that the company failed to disclose that its \u201cquality controls were inadequate to safeguard consumer and employee health\u201d. According to Moran, Chipotle worked with experts to improve its food safety procedures. The company will be performing testing on its ingredients at farms and central kitchens. In addition to high resolution testing at those locations, Chipotle is implementing new policies at its stores including produce blanching, heightened restaurant sanitation, store audits and inspections and employee wellness and incentive structure, which will reward restaurants that score well on food safety. Other companies hit by food scares have taken about a year or more to recover, Chipotle executives noted. Yet considering that Chipotle\u2019s outbreak involved more than incident and the company received intense exposure in both social and regular media, their recovery might take even longer. As lights went on in the Chipotle store in the financial district, a couple passed by speaking of the E coli outbreak. \u201cAfter I saw that, I don\u2019t go there anymore. Fuck that,\u201d said the young woman. \u201cYeah, fuck that,\u201d said her male companion. Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading experts on the public finances are warning that the turmoil on global stock markets threatens to leave a \u00a32bn black hole in George Osborne\u2019s deficit-reduction plans that could force the chancellor to raise taxes or make fresh cuts in spending to hit his budget targets. On a day in which share prices crashed in Europe and the US, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Osborne\u2019s plan to put the UK back in the black by the end of the current parliament was vulnerable to a protracted financial market panic. The IFS said tumbling share prices \u2013 which wiped more than \u00a340bn off the value of the companies quoted on the FTSE 100 Index on Monday \u2013 were one of a number of factors that could blow the chancellor\u2019s plan off course in the next four years. Forecasts that wages growth will be lower than previously expected could knock another \u00a35bn hole in his budget, the thinktank said. The UK\u2019s leading thinktank on public finances warned the chancellor may be forced to make \u201ctough decisions\u201d after placing big bets on volatile tax receipts. In its annual \u201cgreen budget\u201d, which analyses the state of the public finances before Osborne\u2019s March budget, it said a weaker-than-expected growth performance or over-optimistic forecasts for tax receipts might force the Treasury to make deeper cuts in welfare, cut spending further or raise taxes. Fears that a faltering US economy will drag down the global economy, adding to the turmoil caused by a slowdown in China, have unnerved investors and pulled down share prices in recent weeks. European bank shares were among the worst affected following concerns that they continue to struggle with bad debts and regulatory investigations seven years after the financial crash. The risk that Britain could quit the EU, possibly destabilising the government, is another threat to growth that has heightened concern among international investors. Osborne has pledged to turn the deficit, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility puts at almost \u00a370bn in the current 2015-16 financial year, into a surplus by the end of the parliament in 2020. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said: \u201cOsborne\u2019s new fiscal charter is much more constraining than his previous fiscal rules. Uncertainty in the fiscal forecasts means that he may well have to cut spending further or raise taxes to get to surplus in 2019\u201320. \u201cWith public spending reaching historically low levels relative to national income, promises on tax cuts to keep and pay for, and pressure on revenues from a number of taxes, there may be more tough decisions to come. How he responds to any further unpleasant fiscal surprises may, more than anything we have seen so far, come to define his period as chancellor.\u201d On current plans, total public spending in 2019-20 will reach its lowest share of national income for more than 60 years with the exception of 1999-2000 and 2000-01. Spending on public services other than health will be at its lowest level as a fraction of national income since at least 1948-49, at a time when the population continues to grow and age. Osborne was planning to run a budget surplus of \u00a310bn in five years, but the IFS said he faced a number of challenges on the tax side. The chancellor was banking on tax revenues rising, largely in response to big tax increases announced since the general election. \u201cBut tax revenues are volatile and uncertain. Last week\u2019s Bank of England inflation report downgraded forecast average earnings by more than 1% just since November,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cIf average earnings do rise 1% less by 2019\u201320 than the November forecast, he could expect to lose \u00a35bn of income tax and National Insurance revenues. The fall in equity prices seen just since the spending review could, unless it proves purely temporary, cost the government \u00a32bn in lower capital tax receipts in 2020.\u201d Oxford Economics lead UK economist Andrew Goodwin warned that growth is likely to be harmed if the UK quits Europe. And he predicted that a British exit from the EU \u2013 or even a run of opinion polls suggesting voters may opt for Brexit in the upcoming referendum \u2013 would undermine business investment as firms prepare for a period of uncertainty. \u201cIt\u2019s very apparent that most of the scenarios in terms of Brexit fall on the downside and imply a worse outcome in terms of GDP growth.\u201d Goodwin added that the government was sacrificing public investment in vital infrastructure projects and key services to reach a surplus target when Britain\u2019s long-term growth prospects show Osborne can be more relaxed. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \u201cThe IFS are warning what Labour has been saying for months now that the chancellor is gambling with the public finances and it\u2019ll be taxpayers and our public services that will have to pay the price. \u201cThe truth is that no one believes the targets that the chancellor sets anyway as he hardly ever meets them. After all, last year was supposed to be the year the deficit was cleared, according to his first budget. \u201cBut by trying to play this silly political game with his fiscal rule, instead of setting a sensible target, George Osborne is risking not equipping our economy for any dangers ahead, increasing cuts to our public services and big tax hikes for working families.\u201d A Treasury spokesman said the latest growth figures show that despite turbulence in the global economy, Britain is pushing ahead. \u201cWith the risks we see elsewhere in the world, there may be bumpy times ahead \u2013 so here in the UK we must stick to the plan that\u2019s cutting the deficit, attracting business investment and creating jobs.\u201d",

Uncertainty in the fiscal forecasts means that he may well have to cut spending further or raise taxes to get to surplus in 2019\u201320.<br></p> <p>\u201cWith public spending reaching historically low levels relative to national income, promises on tax cuts to keep and pay for, and pressure on revenues from a number of taxes, there may be more tough decisions to come. How he responds to any further unpleasant fiscal surprises may, more than anything we have seen so far, come to define his period as chancellor.\u201d</p> <p>On current plans, total public spending in 2019-20 will reach its lowest share of national income for more than 60 years with the exception of 1999-2000 and 2000-01.<br></p> <p>Spending on public services other than health will be at its lowest level as a fraction of national income since at least 1948-49, at a time when the population continues to grow and age.</p> <p>Osborne was planning to run a budget surplus of \u00a310bn in five years, but the IFS said he faced a number of challenges on the tax side.</p> <p>The chancellor was banking on tax revenues rising, largely in response to big tax increases announced since the general election. </p> <p>\u201cBut tax revenues are volatile and uncertain. Last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/04/markets-bank-of-england-interest-rate-business-live\">Bank of England inflation report</a> downgraded forecast average earnings by more than 1% just since November,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cIf average earnings do rise 1% less by 2019\u201320 than the November forecast, he could expect to lose \u00a35bn of income tax and National Insurance revenues. The fall in equity prices seen just since the spending review could, unless it proves purely temporary, cost the government \u00a32bn in lower capital tax receipts in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Oxford Economics lead UK economist Andrew Goodwin warned that growth is likely to be harmed if the UK quits Europe. And he predicted that a British exit from the EU \u2013 or even a run of opinion polls suggesting voters may opt for Brexit in the upcoming referendum \u2013 would undermine business investment as firms prepare for a period of uncertainty. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very apparent that most of the scenarios in terms of Brexit fall on the downside and imply a worse outcome in terms of GDP growth.\u201d </p> <p>Goodwin added that the government was sacrificing public investment in vital infrastructure projects and key services to reach a surplus target when Britain\u2019s long-term growth prospects show Osborne can be more relaxed.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \u201cThe IFS are warning what Labour has been saying for months now that the chancellor is gambling with the public finances and it\u2019ll be taxpayers and our public services that will have to pay the price. </p> <p>\u201cThe truth is that no one believes the targets that the chancellor sets anyway as he hardly ever meets them. After all, last year was supposed to be the year the deficit was cleared, according to his first budget. </p> <p>\u201cBut by trying to play this silly political game with his fiscal rule, instead of setting a sensible target, George Osborne is risking not equipping our economy for any dangers ahead, increasing cuts to our public services and big tax hikes for working families.\u201d <br></p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said the latest growth figures show that despite turbulence in the global economy, Britain is pushing ahead. \u201cWith the risks we see elsewhere in the world, there may be bumpy times ahead \u2013 so here in the UK we must stick to the plan that\u2019s cutting the deficit, attracting business investment and creating jobs.\u201d</p> <p><br></p> <p></p>",

    "webTitle": "Government denies blackout risk as Rugeley coal plant unveils closure plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has issued a fresh denial that the UK is at risk of blackouts after one of the country\u2019s biggest coal power stations announced plans to close. The French company Engie said it would shut its Rugeley power station in the summer, putting 150 jobs in doubt and affecting 190 contractors. The Staffordshire coal power plant is the latest to pull down the shutters due to low power prices and higher carbon costs, as the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, moves to phase out coal by 2025. The closure will fuel fears of a supply crunch because it removes a gigawatt (GW) of energy from the National Grid \u2013 enough to power 500,000 homes. The National Grid bought 2.4GW of extra capacity for this winter as part of a scheme under which it pays companies to reduce energy usage or provide more power at short notice. The scheme added an extra 50p to the average household bill this year, while the grid has also bought 3.6GW for next year, adding a further \u00a31.50. New coal plant closures raise the prospect that the Grid will have to buy even more capacity for the 2016-17 winter to keep the lights on. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change said Britain was not at risk of blackouts. \u201cWe are clear that providing a secure supply of affordable energy for our families and businesses is non-negotiable. There will be no impact on this winter and action has already been taken to secure extra capacity for next winter,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe will continue to work alongside National Grid and Ofgem to take whatever additional steps are necessary to protect our energy supply.\u201d Ofgem said it was \u201cconfident\u201d about next winter\u2019s power supply but added that there was \u201cno room for complacency\u201d. Engie blamed the closure of Rugeley on increased carbon costs linked to the UK\u2019s shift to greener energy, alongside low power prices as renewable energy provides increased competition. The squeeze on fossil fuel generators has been intensified by tougher EU controls on carbon emissions aimed at reducing dependence on fossil fuels. \u201cUnfortunately market conditions for UK coal plant have deteriorated rapidly in recent years, as a result of a continued fall in power prices on the back of commodity market decline, and increases in carbon costs,\u201d Engie said. \u201cUnder such conditions, there is no prospect of the power station recovering its future operating costs.\u201d The energy firm, which employs 20,000 people in the UK and was formerly known as GDF Suez, said it would try to find affected staff new roles at its other plants in the UK. Engie owns five other plants, including the 2GW First Hydro pumped storage facility in north Wales and a 1GW gas-fired power station at Saltend in East Yorkshire. The demise of Rugeley adds to a growing list of coal-fired plants that have been forced to close. The 2GW Eggborough plant in Yorkshire and Longannet in Fife are slated to close in March, while Ironbridge in Shropshire closed last year and power supplier SSE is to close most of the 2GW Fiddler\u2019s Ferry plant near Manchester. The move away from coal also led to the closure of the UK\u2019s last remaining deep coal mine in Kellingley, North Yorkshire. Engie said it was in talks with the Department of Energy and Climate Change, but insisted there was no way to keep the plant open. \u201cWe implemented a number of changes at Rugeley a year ago in order to help maintain operations at the site but a combination of falling prices and the impact of various market changes has now made this unviable,\u201d the company said. A spokesman said Engie had moved to reduce operating costs and minimise outage expenditure, but this had not been enough to make the plant economically viable.",

      "bodyText": "A new runway will be built at Heathrow or Gatwick by 2030 and the work being done now is vital to make sure the decision is legally watertight, the transport secretary has told sceptical MPs. Questioned by the Commons transport select committee on Monday, Patrick McLoughlin insisted that the government had made progress on the issue of airport capacity and still hoped to give a final decision by July. McLoughlin said questions over air quality in the light of revised government pollution targets, as well as the VW emissions scandal, meant evidence from the commission needed to be examined and more work had to be done. He said: \u201cI guarantee that there will be attempts to get judicial reviews on whatever decisions we take. To ensure we are in the strongest position it is right this exercise is carried out or we would have even longer delays in the process.\u201d The Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, made a \u201cclear and unanimous\u201d recommendation last June that an extra runway should be built at Heathrow, but in December the government further prolonged the debate by only agreeing that a new runway was needed, and deferring a final response on its location. McLoughlin told MPs: \u201cWe did take a number of decisions, that we accepted the recommendations of Davies, the locations, the timescales \u2013 it was the location that we didn\u2019t make a decision on.\u201d Committee chair Louise Ellman replied: \u201cI think you know that location has to be the key decision and that\u2019s what everyone expected the government to be announcing.\u201d The transport secretary said a likely EU referendum in June would not rule out a decision being made before summer recess. Previously, he had suggested the vote could further prolong the final verdict. McLoughlin promised that a runway would be delivered by 2030, adding: \u201cBusiness needs to be reassured that we are sticking by that date.\u201d However, the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it was \u201ca little worrying\u201d that the government was working to a 2030 timeline. \u201cWe\u2019re working to 2025.\u201d He said he did not believe there was a need to preempt judicial reviews, adding: \u201cThe government has been stung by these before so I can understand them wanting to be sure it is robust.\u201d In an unusually strong attack on Gatwick, Holland-Kaye warned that the prime minister had a choice of a third runway at Heathrow or a Gatwick option that \u201cwill not get us to emerging markets, which does nothing for the regions of the UK, or for exports, that delivers a fraction of the jobs or the economic benefits, is less financially robust, does not have the support of business or unions, nor the local community, nor the airlines, nor politicians, nor the policy basis of the airports commission. That offers local people no respite from noise. That has only one motorway and one railway line.\u201d A Gatwick spokesperson said Holland-Kaye failed to mention \u201cinsurmountable barriers that had stopped Heathrow expansion time and time again\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat remains obvious is that Heathrow\u2019s time has passed.\u201d",

Previously, he had suggested the vote could further prolong the final verdict. </p> <p>McLoughlin promised that a runway would be delivered by 2030, adding: \u201cBusiness needs to be reassured that we are sticking by that date.\u201d</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/05/john-holland-kaye-interview-heathrow-airport-expansion-third-runway-airports-commission\">Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye</a>, said it was \u201ca little worrying\u201d that the government was working to a 2030 timeline. \u201cWe\u2019re working to 2025.\u201d </p> <p>He said he did not believe there was a need to preempt judicial reviews, adding: \u201cThe government has been stung by these before so I can understand them wanting to be sure it is robust.\u201d </p> <p>In an unusually strong attack on Gatwick, Holland-Kaye warned that the prime minister had a choice of a third runway at Heathrow or a Gatwick option that \u201cwill not get us to emerging markets, which does nothing for the regions of the UK, or for exports, that delivers a fraction of the jobs or the economic benefits, is less financially robust, does not have the support of business or unions, nor the local community, nor the airlines, nor politicians, nor the policy basis of the airports commission. That offers local people no respite from noise. That has only one motorway and one railway line.\u201d </p> <p>A Gatwick spokesperson said Holland-Kaye failed to mention \u201cinsurmountable barriers that had stopped Heathrow expansion time and time again\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat remains obvious is that Heathrow\u2019s time has passed.\u201d </p>",

George Osborne also wants to achieve surplus, and one trend that could help him is the low oil price. If there was one overriding feature in the 1990s that kept the global economy growing and the tax receipts rolling in, apart from the giddy tech boom, it was oil at $12 a barrel. Oil prices may stay low for the rest of the parliament, but it would be a huge gamble to rely on this happening when most forecasts predict rising prices by the end of the year, let alone the end of the parliament. These same forecasts consider a global recession a real danger. Unfortunately, betting on steady growth financed largely by low oil prices wouldn\u2019t be the chancellor\u2019s only leap of faith. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has detailed a whole series of risks that could upset Osborne\u2019s plan.

    "webTitle": "Apple under pressure as lawyers pledge action over 'Error 53' codes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Apple has come under pressure to scrap its controversial policy of permanently disabling repaired iPhone 6s when software is upgraded, following a global consumer backlash and claims the company could be acting illegally. At least one firm of US lawyers said it hopes to bring a class action against the technology giant on behalf of victims whose \u00a3500 phones have been rendered worthless by an Apple software upgrade. In the UK, a barrister told the Guardian that Apple\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d policy of effectively killing people\u2019s iPhones following the software upgrade could potentially be viewed as an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The act makes it an offence to intentionally destroy the property of another. The Guardian revealed on Friday how thousands of iPhone 6 users found an iOS software upgrade permanently disabled their phone, which was left displaying an \u201cError 53\u201d code. Nothing could be done to restore it to working order. The Apple iOS 9 software update which it launched last autumn will, in the jargon, \u201cbrick\u201d the handset if it detects that the touch ID fingerprint recognition and/or the home button is not the original. Some victims had had their phones repaired by third-party contractors. Others had simply damaged their handset. In most cases the phone had been working normally for weeks or months before the software upgrade shut down the handset. Apple has described this as a security feature, but some have suggested the policy could be designed to increase revenues by forcing anyone needing a repair to their home button to pay the \u00a3236 the company charges in the UK. People whose phones have been shut down and have complained at Apple stores have been told that nothing can be done and they must buy a new handset. Within hours of publication of the Guardian story, the Seattle-based law firm PCVA called for victims to get in touch, with a view to bringing a class action suit. Consumers have reacted with disbelief and growing anger. \u201cShow me where, in consumer law, the vendor has the right to render inoperable the hardware you just bought,\u201d said one poster on the Guardian\u2019s website. PCVA said it believed Apple\u2019s stance may violate various consumer protection laws in the US, and is offering to represent victims for free. \u201cWe believe Apple may be intentionally forcing users to use their repair services, which cost much more than most third-party repair shops. There is incentive for Apple to keep end users from finding alternative methods to fix their products. Think of it this way: let\u2019s say you bought a car, and had your alternator replaced by a local mechanic. Under Apple\u2019s strategy, your car would no longer start because you didn\u2019t bring it to an official dealership. They intentionally disable your car because you tried to fix it yourself. That is wrong,\u201d it states on its website. London-based barrister Richard Colbey, of Lamb Chambers, said it was likely that Apple\u2019s actions breached basic consumer laws in the UK, and added that it could be committing an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971. \u201cIt is hard to see how something which ceases to work in this way could be said to be of reasonable quality, one of the determinants of which is durability,\u201d he said. The law states: \u201cA person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.\u201d If Apple continues with this policy, it could find itself fighting multiple legal battles. It may also face additional scrutiny by the European commission, which is already looking at how it and other big multinational tech firms manage their tax affairs. Apple has so far declined to comment other than a revised statement issued on Saturday saying: \u201cThis security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used. If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.\u201d",

The act makes it an offence to intentionally destroy the property of another.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed on Friday how thousands of iPhone 6 users found an iOS software upgrade permanently disabled their phone, which was left displaying an \u201cError 53\u201d code. Nothing could be done to restore it to working order.</p> <p>The Apple iOS 9 software update which it launched last autumn will, in the jargon, \u201cbrick\u201d the handset if it detects that the touch ID fingerprint recognition and/or the home button is not the original. Some victims had had their phones repaired by third-party contractors. Others had simply damaged their handset. In most cases the phone had been working normally for weeks or months before the software upgrade shut down the handset.</p> <p>Apple has described this as a security feature, but some have suggested the policy could be designed to increase revenues by forcing anyone needing a repair to their home button to pay the \u00a3236 the company charges in the UK. People whose phones have been shut down and have complained at Apple stores have been told that nothing can be done and they must buy a new handset.</p> <p>Within hours of publication of the Guardian story, the Seattle-based law firm PCVA called for victims to get in touch, with a view to bringing a class action suit.</p> <p>Consumers have reacted with disbelief and growing anger.</p> <p>\u201cShow me where, in consumer law, the vendor has the right to render inoperable the hardware you just bought,\u201d said one poster on the Guardian\u2019s website.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pcvalaw.com/apple-iphone-error-53-lawsuit/\">PCVA</a> said it believed Apple\u2019s stance may violate various consumer protection laws in the US, and is offering to represent victims for free.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe Apple may be intentionally forcing users to use their repair services, which cost much more than most third-party repair shops. There is incentive for Apple to keep end users from finding alternative methods to fix their products. Think of it this way: let\u2019s say you bought a car, and had your alternator replaced by a local mechanic. Under Apple\u2019s strategy, your car would no longer start because you didn\u2019t bring it to an official dealership. They intentionally disable your car because you tried to fix it yourself. That is wrong,\u201d it states on its website.</p> <p>London-based barrister Richard Colbey, of Lamb Chambers, said it was likely that Apple\u2019s actions breached basic consumer laws in the UK, and added that it could be committing an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to see how something which ceases to work in this way could be said to be of reasonable quality, one of the determinants of which is durability,\u201d he said. The law states: \u201cA person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.\u201d</p> <p>If Apple continues with this policy, it could find itself fighting multiple legal battles. It may also face additional scrutiny by the European commission, which is already looking at how it and other big multinational tech firms <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/eu-multinationals-tax-arrangements-us-google-amazon\">manage their tax affairs</a>.</p> <p>Apple has so far declined to comment other than a revised statement issued on Saturday saying: \u201cThis security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used. If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.\u201d</p>",

The bank reckons the Costa Coffee business has the potential to beat expectations: A detailed examination highlights multiple levers not on investors\u2019 radar: It is trialling Costa Collect, a pay and collect app which could be transformational (less queuing, more loyalty, extra sales, improved productivity...) and an improved food offer. The food capture rate is 60-70% at its Fresco trial site versus the 42% Costa estate average, and a fresher/healthier range could boost lunch trade where Costa is weak. It also recently put through a price increase and is considering differential pricing, an opportunity to price up in London / travel hubs. Costa also has untapped demand, as around 20% of its UK stores are at full capacity, suggesting upside from additional sites. We estimate around \u00a380m EBIT from these, +50% to Costa\u2019s EBIT, with our forecasts only capturing expansion and 3% like for like sales. We trim 2017-2019 earnings per share forecasts by around 5% due to weak London hotel trading (post Paris attacks), dull high street trading for Costa, and we assume \u00a310m extra operating costs /development and administrative costs with the new chief executive\u2019s focus here. We assume around 2% like for like sales and revenue per available room in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full year 2017, with expansion driving all of our forecast earnings per share growth. We value Costa at \u00a34.2bn (15 times EBITDA), so Whitbread\u2019s enterprise value of \u00a38.4bn implies Hotels &amp; Restaurants is \u00a34.2bn (7 times EBITDA, 9 times PE), or a \u2018free\u2019 operating company value if the \u00a35bn real estate were stripped out.

Currently, Costa\u2019s food offer is oriented to sweet treats and centrally produced paninis, and it underindexes on food in the key lunchtime day part, and is missing out on the trend to more freshly-made and healthier food.

      "bodyText": "As markets continue to slide, ITV is among the biggest fallers after a sell note from Deutsche Bank. After hosting a conference call with four UK media buyers, the bank said the UK market had started the year strongly but ITV was lagging: First quarter consensus for the UK TV market was +5% to 6%. A number of forecasts had been cut recently on weakening retail spend; supermarkets and DIY particularly cited. ITV was seen up 2-3% underlying, underperforming the market with C4 particularly strong. The bank also said ITV Player was boosting the broadcaster\u2019s year on year figures: ITV has included its online video service, ITV Player, in its revenue figures cited to media agencies for the first time this year. Player ad revs are around 3% of ITV linear TV ad income. So although ITV was seen up +5% to 6.5% on a headline basis, on a like-for-like basis this is 2-3%. In its financial reporting to the market, the company reports the two items separately; \u201cITV Family net advertising revenues\u201d and in \u201cOnline, pay and interactive\u201d. The company has confirmed that it will not be combining the two in its financial reporting, but has done for discussions with media agencies. It stated this would boost figures reported by agencies, but would not confirm whether 3% was the appropriate adjustment. On the outlook, Deutsche said: There are solid grounds to expect ITV to perform better in the second quarter. It has Euro2016 rights, easier comps and C4\u2019s strong start to the year was seen as likely to reverse. 2016 was seen up +3-3.5% for ITV ex-Player (+6% to 6.5% headline). But market consensus for ITV Family net advertising revenues at +4% is now relying on a far stronger second quarter (comps toughen in the third and fourth quarter from the Rugby World Cup). Moreover, revisions since the start of the year have seen some 5-6% estimates, which look very demanding. Deutsche Bank ITV Family net advertising revenues +2%; 6% below consensus EPS (16.9p). Our estimates are unchanged. ITV is down 11.4p at 244.1p. Overall the fall in the FTSE 100 has accelerated, with the index now down 116.02 points at 5732.04, on course to hit its lowest level since 20 January. Worries about the banking sector continue after poor updates recently from the likes of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. So Barclays is down 3.3p at 169.85p while HSBC is 14.1p lower at 443.75p. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With China celebrating the Lunar New Year it was hoped that Chinese growth concerns would be absent from markets this week but monthly data showing a fall in the country\u2019s foreign reserves has created some additional uncertainty surrounding official policy towards its exchange rate. European markets after initially opening higher, have been led sharply lower by banking shares, a number of which are hitting multi-year lows. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in Europe alongside the ugly spectre of negative interest rates have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. With investors looking to mull over Friday\u2019s mixed payrolls report attention is now shifting to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s meeting with US lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday with respect to further clues as to the possible timing of the next rise in US rates. One thing seems certain, is that further stock market volatility looks likely to keep the Fed on the sidelines.",

      "body": "<p>As markets continue to slide, <strong>ITV</strong> is among the biggest fallers after a sell note from Deutsche Bank.</p> <p>After hosting a conference call with four UK media buyers, the bank said the UK market had started the year strongly but ITV was lagging:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First quarter consensus for the UK TV market was +5% to 6%. A number of forecasts had been cut recently on weakening retail spend; supermarkets and DIY particularly cited. ITV was seen up 2-3% underlying, underperforming the market with C4 particularly strong.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bank also said ITV Player was boosting the broadcaster\u2019s year on year figures:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ITV has included its online video service, ITV Player, in its revenue figures cited to media agencies for the first time this year. Player ad revs are around 3% of ITV linear TV ad income. So although ITV was seen up +5% to 6.5% on a headline basis, on a like-for-like basis this is 2-3%. In its financial reporting to the market, the company reports the two items separately; \u201cITV Family net advertising revenues\u201d and in \u201cOnline, pay and interactive\u201d. The company has confirmed that it will not be combining the two in its financial reporting, but has done for discussions with media agencies. It stated this would boost figures reported by agencies, but would not confirm whether 3% was the appropriate adjustment. </p> </blockquote> <p>On the outlook, Deutsche said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are solid grounds to expect ITV to perform better in the second quarter. It has Euro2016 rights, easier comps and C4\u2019s strong start to the year was seen as likely to reverse. 2016 was seen up +3-3.5% for ITV ex-Player (+6% to 6.5% headline). But market consensus for ITV Family net advertising revenues at +4% is now relying on a far stronger second quarter (comps toughen in the third and fourth quarter from the Rugby World Cup). Moreover, revisions since the start of the year have seen some 5-6% estimates, which look very demanding. Deutsche Bank ITV Family net advertising revenues +2%; 6% below consensus EPS (16.9p). Our estimates are unchanged.</p> </blockquote> <p>ITV is down 11.4p at 244.1p.</p> <p>Overall the fall in the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has accelerated, with the index now down 116.02 points at 5732.04, on course to hit its lowest level since 20 January. </p> <p>Worries about the banking sector continue after poor updates recently from the likes of Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. So <strong>Barclays </strong>is down 3.3p at 169.85p while <strong>HSBC</strong> is 14.1p lower at 443.75p. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With China celebrating the Lunar New Year it was hoped that Chinese growth concerns would be absent from markets this week but monthly data showing a fall in the country\u2019s foreign reserves has created some additional uncertainty surrounding official policy towards its exchange rate.</p> <p>European markets after initially opening higher, have been led sharply lower by banking shares, a number of which are hitting multi-year lows. The disappointing earnings across the sector from the big US firms to Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in Europe alongside the ugly spectre of negative interest rates have seen investors significantly reassess the chance of an earnings turnaround after years of regulatory fines for past misdeeds. </p> <p> With investors looking to mull over Friday\u2019s mixed payrolls report attention is now shifting to Fed Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s meeting with US lawmakers on Wednesday and Thursday with respect to further clues as to the possible timing of the next rise in US rates. One thing seems certain, is that further stock market volatility looks likely to keep the Fed on the sidelines.</p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne could be forced to raise taxes or increase his public spending cuts if he wants to hit his target of turning Britain\u2019s budget deficit into a surplus by the end of the parliament, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. The UK\u2019s leading thinktank on public finances said a weaker-than-expected growth performance or over-optimistic forecasts for tax receipts might mean the chancellor has to make unpopular decisions. Osborne has pledged to turn the deficit, which the independent Office for Budget Responsibility puts at almost \u00a370bn in the current 2015-16 financial year, into a surplus by 2019-20. In its annual \u201cgreen budget\u201d, which analyses the state of the public finances before Osborne\u2019s March budget, the IFS said British governments had run a surplus in only eight of the past 60 years. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said: \u201cOsborne\u2019s new fiscal charter is much more constraining than his previous fiscal rules. Uncertainty in the fiscal forecasts means that he may well have to cut spending further or raise taxes to get to surplus in 2019\u201320. \u201cWith public spending reaching historically low levels relative to national income, promises on tax cuts to keep and pay for, and pressure on revenues from a number of taxes, there may be more tough decisions to come. How he responds to any further unpleasant fiscal surprises may, more than anything we have seen so far, come to define his period as chancellor.\u201d The IFS said Osborne was planning to run a budget surplus of \u00a310bn by 2019-20, but he faced a number of challenges on the tax side. The chancellor was banking on tax revenues rising, largely in response to big tax increases announced since the general election. \u201cBut tax revenues are volatile and uncertain. Last week\u2019s Bank of England inflation report downgraded forecast average earnings by more than 1% just since November. If average earnings do rise 1% less by 2019\u201320 than the November forecast, he could expect to lose \u00a35bn of income tax and National Insurance revenues. The fall in equity prices seen just since the spending review could, unless it proves purely temporary, cost the government \u00a32bn in lower capital tax receipts in 2020.\u201d The IFS said Osborne had also promised \u00a38bn in income tax cuts but had yet to say where the money was coming from to pay for a higher personal allowance and an increased higher-rate threshold. \u201cOther things equal, delivering them will require equivalent tax rises or spending cuts elsewhere,\u201d it said. Treasury forecasts also depend on the chancellor raising fuel duties in line with inflation as measured by the retail prices index \u2013 something the chancellor has failed to do since 2011. Freezing them for a further five years would cost \u00a33bn, the IFS noted. Andrew Goodwin, the lead UK economist at Oxford Economics, which puts together the economic forecasts for the green budget, said: \u201cThe renewed fall in the oil price promises to keep inflation lower for longer and should prolong the \u2018sugar rush\u2019 enjoyed by UK consumers over the past year. This is a very welcome development given the substantial headwinds to global growth. \u201cBut once this \u2018sugar rush\u2019 has faded, GDP growth is likely to slow as the welfare cuts and cuts to government departmental spending exert a significant drag. This will mean that the pace of growth remains underwhelming and that the economy still has some spare capacity left at the end of the parliament.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The maker of Pure digital radios has decided to sell the business and parted company with its longtime chief executive, Sir Hossein Yassaie, after warning that it would suffer a loss this year. Imagination Technologies, which also makes microchips for companies such as Apple, said Yassaie had stepped down with immediate effect after it issued its second profit warning in two months. It will sell Pure, whose radios feature in many British kitchens, as part of a restructuring plan to save \u00a315m a year. When Imagination announced half-year results in December, it warned that annual profit would miss market expectations because of weaker demand for smartphones containing its chips but it predicted business would pick up in the second half. In a trading update, Imagination said conditions had got worse and that it now expects a loss for the year ending in April. Its shares, which have almost halved in the past year, tumbled 16% in early trading and were down 1.5% at 130p by mid-morning on Monday. The company blamed a slowdown in sales of microchips reinforced by concerns about trading prospects in China for its woes. Royalty payments from some large customers fell short of expectations in the final three months of 2015 and forecasts have been reduced for the first quarter of this year. Imagination said two weeks ago it was reviewing its options for Pure, which Yassaie launched in 2002 to capitalise on the development of digital radio. The business, originally conceived to showcase Imagination\u2019s chip technology, has sold more than 5m radios. The company said: \u201cThere are potentially more appropriate owners for Pure, given the economies of scale in the consumer electronics market, who will be able to leverage its leading technologies and brand. Imagination will treat the Pure division as a discontinued operation with immediate effect.\u201d Yassaie moved to Britain in 1976 and completed a PhD in electronics at Birmingham University. After working at other technology companies he joined Imagination in 1992 and became chief executive in 1998. He received a knighthood in the 2013 honours list for services to technology and innovation. Bert Nordberg, Imagination\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThrough Hossein\u2019s vision and drive, the group has become a global technology leader. His many notable achievements include the development of graphics and video processors for smartphones, gaming devices, TVs and the automotive industry, and the introduction of digital radios as a mainstream product.\u201d Andrew Heath, a non-executive director, has taken over as chief executive while Imagination looks for a new boss.",

      "bodyText": "With markets starting the week on the back foot despite a reasonable performance from Asia, one exception is Randgold Resources. Mining stocks have, as is well known, been rather volatile in recent weeks and precious metal miners are no exception. But Randgold has reported better than expected results despite turbulence in the gold price and commodities generally. Full year profits fell 11% to $572.2m as gold fell for the third year in 2015. But earnings per share of $2.03 were better than the expected $1.95 and the company has also raised its dividend by 10%. Chief executive Mark Bristow said 2015 was one of the best year\u2019s in the company\u2019s history: It\u2019s easy to achieve when the stars are all aligned but it\u2019s a lot more difficult in a market as challenged as this one, which makes these results even more pleasing. Randgold shares have risen 140p or 2.6% to \u00a354.40, and analyst Hunter Hillcoat at Investec said: Randgold produced 1,211,000 ounces in 2015 at cash costs of $679 an ounce, in line with guidance, to deliver earnings of 203 cents per share (Investec 193 cents per share) and leave it with cash of $213m, up from $83m at the end of 2014. Randgold is one of the few companies to still generate earnings growth on our forecasts, while its investment discipline has left it well placed to withstand the current environment. Consequently, it trades at an ever increasing premium to its peers. Our forecasts are under review, pending incorporation of the results. Meanwhile Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo has followed suit, up 5p at 793p. But otherwise there are few risers in the FTSE 100, which has fallen 86.42 points to 5761.64. Investors are still concerned about the global economy, with mixed signals from Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers and recent weakness from China. Downbeat confidence surveys from BDO in the UK and Sentix in Europe are adding to the gloom. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... continuing the theme from last Friday. There will be considerably less chance of any monkey business from Asian markets as China enjoys a week off celebrating the start of a new year with its spring festival. The day\u2019s economic data releases are almost non-existent, with only this morning\u2019s European Sentix investor confidence and this afternoon\u2019s US Labor Market conditions data worthy of note. With so few stimuli to confuse the picture, today should be a day for calmer heads and smoother market conditions.

But Randgold has reported better than expected results despite turbulence in the gold price and commodities generally. Full year profits fell 11% to $572.2m as gold fell for the third year in 2015. But earnings per share of $2.03 were better than the expected $1.95 and the company has also raised its dividend by 10%.</p> <p>Chief executive Mark Bristow said 2015 was one of the best year\u2019s in the company\u2019s history:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"182612d886a613186b35fdf7d496fcbf47470afe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/182612d886a613186b35fdf7d496fcbf47470afe/0_0_2621_3931/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Bristow.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Bristow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s easy to achieve when the stars are all aligned but it\u2019s a lot more difficult in a market as challenged as this one, which makes these results even more pleasing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Randgold shares have risen 140p or 2.6% to \u00a354.40, and analyst Hunter Hillcoat at Investec said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Randgold produced 1,211,000 ounces in 2015 at cash costs of $679 an ounce, in line with guidance, to deliver earnings of 203 cents per share (Investec 193 cents per share) and leave it with cash of $213m, up from $83m at the end of 2014. Randgold is one of the few companies to still generate earnings growth on our forecasts, while its investment discipline has left it well placed to withstand the current environment. Consequently, it trades at an ever increasing premium to its peers. Our forecasts are under review, pending incorporation of the results. </p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Mexican precious metals miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has followed suit, up 5p at 793p.</p> <p>But otherwise there are few risers in the <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, which has fallen 86.42 points to 5761.64. Investors are still concerned about the global economy, with mixed signals from Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers and recent weakness from China. Downbeat confidence surveys from BDO in the UK and Sentix in Europe are adding to the gloom. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stock markets in Europe are in full retreat... continuing the theme from last Friday.</p> <p>There will be considerably less chance of any monkey business from Asian markets as China enjoys a week off celebrating the start of a new year with its spring festival. The day\u2019s economic data releases are almost non-existent, with only this morning\u2019s European Sentix investor confidence and this afternoon\u2019s US Labor Market conditions data worthy of note.</p> <p>With so few stimuli to confuse the picture, today should be a day for calmer heads and smoother market conditions. Of course, that would have been the case if the disappointing Sentix figures hadn\u2019t triggered a mid-morning selloff.

Criminals move more than $2tn (\u00a31.4tn) around the world each year, corrupt payments amount to $1tn and tax evasion robs countries of up to 70% of their tax income, according to a paper by Peter Sands, the former chief executive of Standard Chartered who advises the British government. Yet efforts to stem the flows by catching perpetrators or detecting payments result in less than 1% of illicit flows being seized. Eliminating \u20ac500, $100, SFr1,000 and \u00a350 notes would scrap a method of payment favoured by wrongdoers, even though it made little sense for legitimate users, Sands argued. Cash was useful for small transactions, such as buying a cup of coffee, or for pocket money, but it could be lost or stolen and people preferred electronic payments for big transactions, he said. \u201cHigh-denomination notes are arguably an anachronism in a modern economy given the availability and effectiveness of electronic payment alternatives. They play little role in the functioning of the legitimate economy, yet a crucial role in the underground economy. The irony is that they are provided to criminals by the state,\u201d Sands said in his Harvard Kennedy school paper, Making it Harder for the Bad Guys. Sands said there was a strong case for scrapping notes worth $50 or more, and that there was even an argument for eliminating notes below that threshold. But governments should start by looking at dropping the highest value notes. \u201cAsk people in the United Kingdom when they last used a \u00a350 note, the highest sterling denomination, and the most common answer is to pay a builder or plumber,\u201d he said. \u201cThe incentive is tax evasion, since payment in cash makes it easier for the individual to avoid VAT of 20%; and if the builder pays his workers in cash, he in turn avoids employment taxes and they avoid income tax.\u201d Sands\u2019s idea is not new. Last week, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said its policy on issuing \u20ac500 notes was under review because of concerns they were widely used by criminals. British banks and money exchange businesses stopped issuing the notes in 2010 after a report showed criminals accounted for 90% of demand. Scrapping high-value notes would not eliminate crime and corruption but doing so would increase criminals\u2019 costs and make them easier to detect, Sands argued. Sands quit Standard Chartered last year after rising bad debts caused profits to tumble, damaging a reputation built up when the emerging markets bank came through the financial crisis relatively unscathed. He was one of the architects of the banking bailout in October 2008 and is the lead non-executive director for the Department of Health. The former McKinsey consultant also provides informal advice to 10 Downing Street on matters such as changes in the labour market.",

While the figures were not as bad as 0% growth might suggest, they do show signs of households being more circumspect about spending than they have been for some while. One of the problems with retail trade figures is that for the most part we talk in terms of current dollars. So when the Australian Retail Association talks about the Christmas sales setting a record, it\u2019s actually not that big of a statement. Things for the most part cost more now than they did a year ago, and thus even with small wage growth, generally each December we spend more in the shops than we did a year earlier. The other problem with retail trade figures is that they are affected by seasonal factors perhaps more than most other statistics. While the seasonally adjusted figures showed that in December there was just 0.03% growth over the sales in November, in reality Australians spent 23.9% more in December than they did in November, and 4.7% more they did in December 2014: But we don\u2019t really bother with original data because it doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot \u2013 it\u2019s no big surprise to discover we shop more in December than we do in November and we will always do so unless Christmas gets shifted to 25 November. The seasonally adjusted figures attempt to give us an idea of how much more we spent in December taking into account that every year we always spend big in that month. But even the seasonally adjusted figures can be a tad excitable: The trend growth in December was a fairly respectable 0.3%. However, even the trend figures struggle a bit in the retail world. The release of the iPhone 6 in August 2014 saw such a big jump in the sales that it \u201cbroke\u201d the trend line. And its most recent incarnation last year also wrecked havoc with the figures. The biggest drag on the retail turnover figures in December were electrical and electronic goods \u2013 those sales fell 1.7% in December. But this is not all that surprising given the latest version of the iPhone was released in September. In September and October electrical goods sales rose 3.1% and 1.9%. If we excluded electrical and electronic sales from the total figures, then December trade would have gone up by 0.2%. It\u2019s why even with the weak December figures, the annual growth is a fairly respectable 4.0% in trend terms and 4.2% seasonally adjusted: It also goes to the changing nature of our consumption habits and the importance of December in the retail figures. Thirty years ago, 43% of our retail spending was on food (from supermarkets etc) and from cafes, restaurants and takeaways. By the turn of the century it was up to 49% and in December last year it was 53%: And while we do spend more on food and eating out in December than in other months \u2013 all those big Christmas lunches \u2013 December is less important for those sectors of the retail industry than all others. For department stores, December is worth almost two months of the year in sales. For clothing and footwear, December is equivalent to six weeks: And thus as our spending habits have turned from spending in department stores and on clothing to food and eating out, the month of December has become less important: Mostly however, this isn\u2019t because of a big change in our tastes, but because non-food purchases have become relatively cheaper over the years. Think about how much a DVD player cost 15 years ago relative to, say a meal at McDonalds, and you get an idea. In essence, we haven\u2019t actually taken to eating out more, just that more of our weekly spend is being taken up on food and eating out. We actually buy a lot more household goods than we used to, but they also cost much less now: Looking at the growth in the volume of how much we spend is important because household consumption has been a big driver of GDP growth \u2013 in the past year it contributed only slightly less than net exports. And real GDP growth looks at volume not current dollars. The ABS only measures retail volume spending each quarter, and in the December quarter it grew by 0.6% in trend terms and by 2.5% over the past year \u2013 down from 3.1% in the September quarter. Retail spending does not include all of household consumption \u2013 it doesn\u2019t for example include education and health spending, or other services, but the two measures have shown good parallels over the past decade: The slight slowing in the growth of retail spending volume is not particularly indicative of a strong economy, but the growth of 0.6% in volume at least provides some counter to the gloom of the 0% spending growth in current dollars. The figures, however, also provide some signs that the housing boom is on the wane. In NSW spending on furniture, floor coverings, homeware and textile goods \u2013 things that you buy for a new home \u2013 grew by just 0.6% in 2015 \u2013 well down on the 21% growth that occurred in 2014. Similarly the growth of such spending in Victoria has fallen drastically in the past six months: Despite the 0% growth in trade recorded in December, the retail figures are not a horror show. But they do point to somewhat of a slowing, and not just in things we buy in the shops but also in the housing sector. And they certainly suggest households are at best less eager to spend money than they have been for almost two years, which is not a great sign for an economy that relies on households to power much of its growth.",
