    "webTitle": "Eurozone risks breakup or continuing stagnation, warns David Cameron", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron warns on Monday that the eurozone risks facing perpetual economic stagnation from an unresolved crisis or a breakup caused by a failure to address its underlying economic failures. Britain will feel the impact of any continuing crisis, the prime minister will say in a speech at the G20 summit of the world's leading economies which starts in Mexico today. The summit will last two days. Cameron will urge the political classes in Europe to recognise how incredibly high the stakes have become and he will plead for a decisive response from them. He is also expected to assess the state of the euro economy after the Greek elections as he lands in Mexico with his chancellor, George Osborne. There they will meet other world leaders as they gather in the Mexican coastal resort of Los Cabos. Cameron will be updated on the state of the world's stock markets and the eurozone's reaction to the Greek elections as he flies to Mexico. In a speech to business leaders in Los Cabos before the summit opens, Cameron will argue for European partners to come to a decision and not to delay any longer. That suggests he is desperate to see a resolution of the Greek crisis one way or another, rather than further lengthy negotiations about changing the terms of the country's bailout package. He will also argue against solving the sovereign debt crisis with extra borrowing. Directly urging his eurozone partners to get a grip, he will say: \"The reality is that there are a set of things the eurozone countries need to do, and it is up to the eurozone countries to decide whether they are prepared to make the sacrifices these entail. The challenge is as much of political will as of economics. Of course these things are difficult to do, but just because things are difficult does not mean we should not say them. \"If the eurozone is to stay together, then it has to make at least some of these difficult decisions. The alternatives to action that create a more coherent eurozone are either perpetual stagnation from a eurozone crisis that is never resolved or a breakup caused by a failure to address underlying economic fundamentals that would have financial consequences that would damage the world economy \u2013 including Britain\". At the same time, Cameron will urge the European Central Bank to take more measures to stimulate growth through forms of credit easing and guaranteed loans, similar to the measures announced by the Bank of England on Thursday. In remarks that clash with the anti-austerity thinking advanced by the French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the US President Barack Obama, Cameron will insist the solution to low economic growth lies in monetary activism and structural reform, as opposed to stimulating demand. He will say: \"If a country wants growth in its national economy, then it has to deal with its debts, and dealing with its debts is every bit as essential as for the global economy. Countries simply cannot continue to run indefinite structural fiscal deficits without contributing to the fundamental imbalances that fuelled the 2008 crisis. \"The world is gripped by five inter-related threats: the eurozone crisis, sovereign debt, the challenges of growth and low competitiveness, protectionism and failure to regulate the banking system.\" Cameron will also call on world leaders to take more action on the commitments made at previous summits on a new global financial architecture. The prime minister will argue: \"This demands courage, resolve, political commitment\", adding \"it is easy to sign up to declarations, but much harder to push through the difficult changes that are vital to generate the growth and the jobs that our citizens demand\". He will point out that six G20 countries have yet to start to implement international rules requiring banks to hold bigger cushions of capital, and he will call for tougher monitoring of progress on this. Britain is concerned by signs of self-defeating protectionism as world trade conditions worsen. He will point to 124 acts of trade restrictions in the last eight months. But he will argue that China and the US have taken action to reduce global trade imbalances \u2013 the Chinese by an appreciation of their exchange rate and the Americans by reducing their current deficit from 5% to 3%. Nevertheless, he will say more needs to be done. Cameron's comments on the continuing fragility in the eurozone followed a warning by Labour's former prime minster Tony Blair who called on Germany to use its financial might to shore up the euro. Blair said the Germans would do this only if wide-ranging reforms were delivered by European governments. Lord Mandelson warned that Greece \"faces a very long and very painful road back\" and urged leaders to take action.",

      "bodyText": "If there was ever a time when international economic cooperation was needed, it is now. The situation in the eurozone, and around the globe, was catastrophic before Sunday's second Greek election. The result changes little. All eyes now turn to the financial markets and today's summit of world leaders in Mexico. There were high hopes for the G20 when it met for the first time in Washington in November 2008. Then, the conclave of the big nations proved they were up to the challenge of responding collectively and decisively, if not with lasting success, to the contraction in the global economy triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Anybody expecting the G20 to pull another rabbit out of the hat now simply hasn't been paying attention. Leaderless and at odds over what needs to be done, it has taken the G20 less than four years to become as redundant as the G8 it was supposed to replace. Barack Obama's policy horizon stretches no further than election day in November, the Germans feel they are being unfairly branded as the villains of Europe's debt crisis, and Beijing has been having a giant sulk at G20 meetings for more than a year after bridling at the suggestion that an oblique reference to its trade surplus should be included in the Paris summit communiqu\u00e9 of February 2011. Conditions have markedly deteriorated since the first Greek election in May. The outgoing president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, says he can detect growing signs of protectionism and economic nationalism. Extreme parties are on the rise. The eurozone crisis has engulfed Spain and is lapping at the door of Italy, yet a break-up of monetary union is still seen as an impossibility in Europe's capitals. There is, though, no sense that Europe has a plan for averting the doomsday scenario and that is why fear stalks the markets and \u2013 in the words of Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King \u2013 a black cloud has descended over the global economy. Three things need to happen to avert the worst. Firstly, there has to be a proper analysis of why the world is in its current state. Secondly, measures have to be put in place to address the problems highlighted by that analysis. Because this will take time, there is a third imperative: short-term damage limitation to prevent another recession causing permanent scarring through loss of skills and mothballing of investment. Thus far, there has been a bit of ineffective damage limitation and not much else. The analysis is not that difficult, even though the conclusions that are drawn from it are uncomfortable. At root, the current crisis is the result of the imbalances in the global economy, which in turn reflect differences in productivity and competitiveness. The show could only be kept on the road in the boom times because countries like China, Japan and Germany were prepared to finance the deficits of the US, Britain and the weaker members of the eurozone. To tackle Europe's problem therefore means tackling the competitiveness question. This can only be done in a number of ways: by a long and brutal process of austerity that reduces the cost base of the weaker nations; by Germany and the richer nations of the north eroding their competitive advantage by tolerating a higher rate of inflation than the nations of the south; by a permanent process of fiscal transfers that will probably exceed the assistance provided to the l\u00e4nder of the old East Germany; or by countries seeking to generate an instant competitiveness boost through departure from the euro. As it stands at its crossroads, Europe has to choose one of these four routes, something it appears incapable or unwilling to do. Sooner or later, a country like Greece may decide it cannot take the strain any more and conclude there will be first-mover advantage in being the first country to leave the euro, just as there was for the first country \u2013 Britain \u2013 to leave the gold standard. This, whatever European policy makers say, would result in mayhem. The rest of the world knows this, and that's why Obama is constantly on Angela Merkel's case and why King announced steps last week to boost mortgage and business lending, and to keep UK banks awash with liquidity. These moves are welcome precautions, if somewhat late in the day. They should do some good, although perhaps not as much as the government hopes. Until policy makers are ready to tackle the structural issues, damage limitation is all there is. It would be naive to imagine that the G20 is preparing a blueprint for global recovery or that the euro zone crisis will soon be over. Central banks are on high alert to cope with the fallout from Greek elections. Why? Because at the moment the global economy can be divided into nations that are in recession, about to go into recession or rapidly losing momentum. For the moment there are no good outcomes, just bad and really bad.",
