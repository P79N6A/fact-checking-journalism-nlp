      "bodyText": "Just in: Deutsche Bank chairman Paul Achleitner has survived attempts to oust him, despite criticism of his role in the company\u2019s troubles Reuters has snapped the details: 84.4% OF DEUTSCHE BANK SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO RATIFY ACTIONS OF SUPERVISORY BOARD CHAIRMAN ACHLEITNER FOR 2017 9.05% OF DEUTSCHE BANK SHAREHOLDERS VOTE IN FAVOR OF MOTION TO REMOVE CHAIRMAN PAUL ACHLEITNER FROM SUPERVISORY BOARD; 90.95% AGAINST That must be a relief for Achleitner after a bruising day. But given the scale of the problems at Deutsche, you could imagine that this might be his last AGM - especially if today\u2019s cost-cutting plan doesn\u2019t deliver profitability. Umpteen thousands of Deutsche Bank workers will be more concerned about their own future, of course, following the news that more than 7,000 jobs are going. Fingers crossed for them. And on that note, goodnight. GW It\u2019s been quite a marathon AGM in Frankfurt today, but it\u2019s now coming to a head. Out of the mouths of babes and young shareholders.... The cancellation of the US-North Korea summit has sent a new bout of geopolitical jitters through the markets. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed 71 points lower at 7716, a drop of nearly 1%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Donald Trump\u2019s decision has unnerved the City: With trade war fears with China still circulating, Trump aggravating the global community with potential tariffs on the automobile industry and now a cancellation of the Summit with North Korea the geopolitical climate is looking extremely fragile and this is clearly unnerving the markets. Traders are taking risk off the table, selling out of global equites whilst flows into safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and gold are on the up. Whilst the Japanese yen is over 1% higher, gold has pushed back above $1300 for the first time in over a week. Newsflash: Shares are dropping across the globe, after Donald Trump dramatically cancelled next month\u2019s summit meeting with North Korea. In a letter just released, the US president said he was cancelling the meeting with Kim Jong Un \u201cfor the good of both parties, but to the detriment of the world\u201d. Trump blames the \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility\u201d shown by North Korea -- who called vice-president Mike Pence a \u2018political dummy\u2019 earlier today. The president also warns North Korea that America\u2019s nuclear weapons arsenal is \u201cmassive and powerful\u201d; ratcheting up the tensions between the countries again. Wall Street traders have responded by driving shares down; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed over 130 points, or 0.5% Shares are also falling in London, with the FTSE 100 now down 42 points or 0.5% at 7746. Deutsche Bank\u2019s AGM may drag on for some time yet, as there are scores of shareholders keen to have their say.... So in the meantime, here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s latest dispatch: Deutsche Bank is slashing thousands of jobs as Germany\u2019s largest lender refocuses its global investment banking business on Europe and seeks to return to steady profitability. The bank said Thursday it would cut its workforce from 97,000 to \u201cwell below\u201d 90,000 in order to achieve cost reduction targets. It said the reductions were already \u201cunderway.\u201d A chief target of the cutbacks is its stocks trading business, mostly based in New York and London. Head count at the equities business is to be reduced by about 25 percent. Those cuts will cost the bank some 800 million euros ($935 million) this year. The announcement came just hours before Board Chairman Paul Achleitner had to face disgruntled investors at the bank\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. The bank\u2019s share price has sagged and it paid only a small dividend of 11 euro cents per share last year. Achleitner drew rueful laughs from the assembled shareholders when he misspoke and said the dividend was 11 euros per share, a mistake he quickly corrected. Deutsche Bank has struggled with high costs, subpar earnings and troubles with regulators. The bank replaced its CEO in April after three years of annual losses and lagging progress in streamlining its operations. New CEO Christian Sewing has said the investment banking business would refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier and riskier operations where it doesn\u2019t hold a leading position. Sewing said the bank was committed to international investment banking but must \u201cconcentrate on what we truly do well.\u201d The new strategy means stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase. Sewing replaced John Cryan in April with a mandate to accelerate the bank\u2019s wrenching restructuring. It has suffered billions in losses from fines and penalties related to past misconduct. But progress in cutting costs has remained elusive. Sewing on Thursday affirmed the bank\u2019s goal to hold costs to 23 billion euros this year and 22 billion euros next year. Deutsche Bank lost \u20ac735m last year after U.S. tax changes cost it \u20ac1.4bn. Earnings in the first quarter of \u20ac120m were sharply down from the year-earlier quarter. Addressing an audience of several thousands in Frankfurt, Achleitner said Cryan had \u201cset the ball rolling for fundamental change\u201d but later displayed \u201cshortcomings in decision-making and implementation.\u201d \u201cDear shareholders, you are right to expect the bank and its management to hit the targets it has set itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are signs those targets are in jeopardy... then we on the supervisory board have to act swiftly and decisively.\u201d The bank\u2019s troubles and the turmoil surrounding Cryan\u2019s departure have put pressure on Achleitner as well. Cryan was forced to publicly push back against a media report that Achleitner was looking for a replacement, then left to twist in the wind for days before being shown the door. Achleitner brought Cryan to the bank in 2015 and thus in principle shares responsibility for the bank\u2019s strategy and performance since then. The selloff is gathering pace, as investors fret about the \u20ac800m cost of the job cuts plan (which will hit profits this year). The WSJ\u2019s Paul J Davies isn\u2019t impressed by today\u2019s restructuring plan. He writes: Deutsche Bank is caught in a vicious spiral. It is losing profit-making staff, clients and investors and it desperately needs to restore confidence among all three Christian Sewing, the bank\u2019s new chief executive, didn\u2019t mention anything at Thursday\u2019s annual investor meeting that will stem these losses. More radical ideas are needed. Deutsche Bank are threatening legal action against anyone who has leaks details of its board meetings. That follows media stories in March about boardroom unrest, ahead of John Cryan\u2019s ousting as CEO. Meanwhile, the AGM cranks on.... Back in Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank shareholders voted to allow chairman Paul Achleitner to chair today\u2019s AGM, with 99% approval. Achleitner\u2019s reward? Facing more criticism from shareholders, who say he should step down. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jenny Strasburg has the details: Newsflash: The number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefits has hit a seven-week high. The initial claims total jumped to 234,000 last week, more than the 220,000 which economists had expected. The previous week\u2019s figure has been revised up too, from 220,000 to 223,000. These are still low figures in historical terms, reflecting the long-running improvement in the US labor market in recent years. Klaus Nieding of shareholder lobby group DSW has urged Deutsche Bank\u2019s management to speed up its recovery plan. Nieding told today\u2019s AGM (via Reuters): \u201cIt is high-time to ... end the years-long and still-popular \u2018Deutsche Bank bashing\u2019 and get to work finally getting our bank back on its feet after six long years of restructuring.\u201d Wowzers. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares are now down almost 4% -- quite a thumbs-down to Christian Sewing\u2019s cost-cutting restructuring plan. Professor Brian Scott-Quinn, director of Banking Programmes at Henley Business School, suggests Deutsche Bank is trapped in a \u2018spiral of decline\u2019. Scott-Quinn says that Deutsche should accept that the game is up. \u201cWe really no longer need Deutsche Bank. There are already plenty of retail banks in Germany to provide competition and a good service to consumers. In investment banking it is the same as there are still good European investment banks which can provide a good service to German industry. It is almost impossible now to recover from years of mismanagement. At the same time, to attract the people they still need, they have to pay more than others where bonus prospects are much better. It is a spiral of decline and it started perhaps 20 years ago, even before the financial crisis. \u201cBarclays, along with other European banks, are perfectly capable of meeting the needs of German industry for corporate and investment banking services. Deutsche might be better acknowledging that its days as a global champion and as a German regional champion are over and that sometimes banks reach the end of their lives.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be easy to send Deutsche Bank shuffling off into retirement, of course. Apart from anything else, it has a famously huge exposure to derivative contracts -- estimated at \u20ac46 trillion in 2016 (the potential losses on the portfolio would be rather lower). Here\u2019s a photo of Deutsche Bank\u2019s new CEO, Christian Sewing, outlining his cost-cutting plans to shareholders: Oops indeed... Deutsche Bank shareholders are voting on whether to allow Paul Achleitner to actually chair today\u2019s AGM (a fairly crucial part of a chairman\u2019s duties).... Deutsche Bank still haven\u2019t revealed exactly how many jobs are being cut under the restructuring announced today. All we know is that the headcount is being reduced from 97,0000 to \u201cwell below\u2019 90,000. So that must be more than 7,000 jobs -- and could even be the 10,000 figure that was rumoured last night. Deutsche Bank would rather tell us that it will be serving 9,000 Frankfurter sausages to shareholders today, along with pretzels and slices of cake: Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is continuing to slide, and is now down 2.5% in Frankfurt trading. Job cut announcements usually trigger a share price rally (investors usually ignore the grim implications for staff and celebrate the cost savings). Christian Sewing must be disappointed not to get a better reaction to his plan. One theory is that shareholders aren\u2019t happy that the restructuring will cost \u20ac800m, making a dent in Deutsche\u2019s profitability this year. Wild scenes at the AGM.... It\u2019s really kicking off at the Deutsche Bank AGM: Shame the bank won\u2019t let us watch it remotely -- so much for CEO Sewing\u2019s pledge to offer more clarity.... Deutsche Bank shareholders are now having their say at the AGM -- giving them the chance to demand chairman Paul Achleitner\u2019s resignation. Unfortunately, Deutsche Bank have suspended their live feed from the annual meeting - it\u2019s playing some lift muzak, not the sound of angry investors letting rip. Not a good look at all. Fortunately, some journalists are tweeting from the event, such as the FT\u2019s Patrick McGee: Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have now dropped into the red, down 0.7% at \u20ac10.80. That suggests investors aren\u2019t convinced that Sewing\u2019s plan to slash jobs and reduce its investment banking operations will resolve all the bank\u2019s problems - even though he insists the cost-cutting will help boost profitability. Six hundred investment bankers have left Deutsche Bank in the last seven weeks, according to CEO Christian Sewing. He has told today\u2019s AGM that the huge job cuts announced this morning are already being implemented: He says: This reduction is already fully underway, and so far, due to the considered way we\u2019ve handled this, we have not seen any meaningful revenue attrition.\u201d Sewing says that Deutsche will also consider hiring freezes, and cutting the use of contractors. He also says that staff want \u2018clarity\u2019 -- so the bank is going to stop endlessly debating plans and actually \u2018execute\u2019 them. In conclusion, Sewing says he wants to make people proud to work for Deutsche, or invest in it, again -- a tacit admission of how the bank has fallen from grace in recent years. Today\u2019s job cuts mean that Deutsche Bank is abandoning its goal of competing directly with America\u2019s investment banking giants, says Associated Press: New CEO Christian Sewing has said the bank would refocus on its European and German customer base and cut back on costlier and riskier operations where it doesn\u2019t hold a leading position. Sewing said the bank was committed to its international investment banking operations but must \u201cconcentrate on what we truly do well.\u201d The new strategy means stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank sought to compete with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan Chase. Sewing also warns shareholders that trading conditions remain tough, as it starts to cull workers. The Axeman Cometh, as CEO Christian Sewing starts to address Deutsche Bank\u2019s AGM in Frankfurt. On today\u2019s huge job cuts, Sewing says it is \u201ca difficult situation\u201d but Deutsche\u2019s current financial position leaves him with \u201cno choice\u201d. We need to lay the basis for long-term profitability. Our long-term goal is to put Deutsche Bank back at the centre of society, adds Sewing, a little enigmatically. Oddly, Sewing also says it is a \u2018good idea\u2019 to write yourself a letter when you begin a new task - only to reveal that he didn\u2019t bother when he became CEO! Newsflash: Back in the UK, retail sales have surged as shoppers returned to the high street last month. Retail sales volumes (the amount of stuff bought) jumped by 1.6% in April compared to March, when the Beast from the East dumped snow and ice on Britain. Encouraging news for the economy, and has sent the pound jumping by half a cent to $1.34 (away from yesterday\u2019s five-month low). However, sales have barely risen over the last three months, suggesting British consumers remain cautious and cash-strapped. Rob Kent-Smith, Head of National Accounts says: \u201cIncreases were seen across all sectors in April, except department stores. Department stores declined following relatively strong sales last month, when their online sales were boosted during the adverse weather. Over the longer-term, retail sales growth has slowed considerably, with increases in food, household goods and internet retailers being largely offset by declines across all other types of retailing.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story on Deutsche\u2019s job cuts: Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, is to cut more than 7,000 jobs globally, with its investment banking business in London likely to be hit. Deutsche said one in four jobs in its equities sales and trading business would be axed. The bank\u2019s global headcount is expected to fall from just over 97,000 to well below 90,000. The firm said it would not provide a breakdown at this stage but that all regions will be affected. Deutsche\u2019s largest investment banking operation is based in the City of London. It employs about 8,500 people in the UK \u2013 mostly in London, with smaller operations in Birmingham and Bournemouth \u2013 and is one of the largest employers in the City. The news came a few hours before the group\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Frankfurt, due to start at 9am London time, where the group is expected to face a protest from shareholders over its poor performance. Deutsche\u2019s new chief executive, Christian Sewing, said: \u201cWe remain committed to our corporate and investment bank and our international presence \u2013 we are unwavering in that \u2026 However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.\u201d When Sewing, the former co-head of the bank\u2019s retail banking arm, was appointed to replace his British predecessor, John Cryan, in April, he vowed to take \u201ctough decisions\u201d to return the bank to profitability. Deutsche has suffered three years of losses and Cryan had been criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures. Paul Achleitner is now claiming that Deutsche\u2019s board should be praised for handing back some bonuses, in recognition of the problems at the bank. Achleitner reminds the AGM that eleven executives who served during the financial crisis agreed to wave \u20ac38.4m of bonuses, even though an internal investigation found that no-one could be held personally responsible for Deutsche mistakes. Chairman Achleitner is trying to refute claims that he botched the change of CEO last month. He insist that Christian Sewing (who has worked at Deutsche Bank) is the right man to lead the company, rather than a heavy-hitting external candidate. Achleitner says Sewing is the right man, because he is a Deutsche man. Christian Sewing is our first choice..... He is Deutsche Bank through and through. True, but this hasn\u2019t prevented Sewing from deciding to lay off thousands of fellow Deutsche workers today. And it won\u2019t please critics who argue that Deutsche needs fresh blood. Deutsche Bank\u2019s AGM is getting underway in Frankfurt. Chairman Paul Achleitner is getting his defence in early, telling shareholders that he hadn\u2019t planned to oust CEO John Cryan last month - but was forced to act due to a leak. Achleitner says: We had to act - even though it wasn\u2019t originally our intention to make our change so swiftly. Personally I had hoped that the reshuffle at the top of our bank would be made in a constructive spirit at today\u2019s annual general meeting.\u201d He adds that Deutsche\u2019s management had failed to show sufficient discipline when sticking to strategy plans over the last year. This led to last year\u2019s disappointing loss (the third in a row), forcing the supervisory board to reshuffle its top team. Achleitner is now berating those who leaked details of the reshuffle over Easter - this damaged the bank, and forced the early appointment of Christian Sewing to replace CEO John Cryan. No wonder Deutsche\u2019s shareholders are angry - the bank\u2019s value has slumped by a third in the last year. Dr. Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes Investment Management, a Deutsche Bank shareholder, blames chairman Paul Achleitner for the company\u2019s woes. Hirt tells Bloomberg TV that Achleitner has failed in three ways: Too much managerial change; with Deutsche Bank now on its fourth CEO under Achleitner No strategy to create value A lot of turnover on the supervisory board. These are all important responsibilities for a chairman, Hirt says, adding: In our opinion, he hasn\u2019t done a particularly good job. However, Hermes won\u2019t support today\u2019s no-confidence vote, as it believes Deutsche doesn\u2019t need any more disruption. We will give him one last warning - saying you need to do better, you are in the last-chance house. Protesters have gathered outside Deutsche Bank\u2019s AGM in Frankfurt. They are calling on the bank to \u201cget out of coal, weapons and tax havens\u201d, with a sign reading \u201cDeutsche Bank: Ich krieg die Krise\u2019 (literally,\u201d I\u2019m getting the crisis\u201d). Angry investors will try to oust Deutsche Bank\u2019s chairman, Paul Achleitner, at its AGM today. Achleitner is under fire for failing to stop Deutsche\u2019s track record of underperformance in recent years, and for a series of strategic zig-zags that have left shareholders dizzy. He now faces a vote of no-confidence from investors who believe his time is up. Achleitner made his name selling East German government assets following reunification in 1990. He has been chairman of Deutsche since 2012 - a time in which Deutsche has struggled to shake off the legacy of the financial crisis. The New York Times explains: Mr. Achleitner left Allianz in 2012 to become chairman of Deutsche Bank, overseeing the executives who run the company on a day-to-day basis. Deutsche Bank had grave problems. The culture was toxic. Large swaths of the business were poorly managed. Risks were not controlled. The bank had a tendency to needlessly antagonize regulators. It was caught up in just about all of the industry\u2019s worst scandals: rigging interest rates, selling toxic mortgages, laundering money, violating sanctions. Rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse scaled back their investment banks in the wake of the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank, with Mr. Achleitner\u2019s backing, continued to try to play in the Wall Street big leagues. Mr. Achleitner insisted that Europe needed a counterweight to the big American investment banks. \u201cIf we don\u2019t watch out,\u201d he said in an interview with a German magazine in May 2015, \u201cwe\u2019ll have the same American dominance that we already have in the internet.\u201d Shares in Deutsche Bank have risen 0.4% in early trading in Frankfurt, as investors react to today\u2019s job cuts. Postbank, which is Deutsche Bank\u2019s consumer banking unit, faces heavy job losses under today\u2019s restructuring plan. Last night, the Financial Times reported that workers in the US and the City are also at risk: The person familiar with the bank\u2019s plans said that the 10,000 jobs included \u201ca few thousand jobs\u201d at Deutsche\u2019s German retail division Postbank, which were already earmarked to be culled. The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans on Wednesday. Roughly half of the additional job cuts would be taking place in the group\u2019s struggling investment bank, he added. \u201cMost of the cuts will happen in the US, but London will see the axe too.\u201d Deutsche is trying to convince investors that it\u2019s serious about returning to profitability after three years of losses, says the AFP newswire. It adds: The bank said it would slash leverage exposure in the investment bank by 10 percent of \u201cthe \u20ac1,050bn of leverage exposure reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\u201d A Deutsche Bank spokesperson says that today\u2019s job cuts will affect \u2018all regions\u2019, but they won\u2019t give a detailed breakdown. However, it seems certain that the UK will be hit, as Deutsche\u2019s biggest investment banking office is in the heart of London\u2019s Square Mile. Deutsche employs 8,500 people in the UK, making it one of the biggest employers in the City. The bank says: Deutsche Bank chooses to base its largest investment banking operations in the City of London, a centre of global flows of trade and wealth. We use this position as a global bank to keep our UK clients connected to markets, and help clients do business all over the world. It also has offices in Birmingham and Bournemouth. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Deutsche Bank has sent a shiver through the City by announcing that it plans to lay off thousands of staff worldwide. German\u2019s biggest bank plans to cut its headcount to \u2018well below\u2019 90,000, from 97,000 today, as it shake up its corporate and investment banking operations. It says: The number of full-time equivalent positions is expected to fall from just over 97,000 currently to well below 90,000. The associated personnel reductions are underway. The move follows rising investor anger over Deutsche\u2019s performance - the bank has posted three annual losses in a row, and sacked CEO John Cryan last month. Cryan\u2019s successor, Christian Sewing, had pledged to cut back on risk operations and refocus on Europe - and he\u2019s now wielding the axe. In a statement, Sewing says: \u201cWe remain committed to our Corporate &amp; Investment Bank and our international presence, we are unwavering in that.... However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.\u201d Deutsche\u2019s corporate and investment bank will face the brunt of the restructuring. The wide-ranging cuts include 25% headcount reduction at the bank\u2019s equities sales and trading business following a review of the business. The announcement comes just a few hours before Deutsche faces investors at its annual general meeting on Thursday. More details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up today: New retail sales figures will show whether UK consumers hit the shops in April, as the cold snap ended. Economists predict that sales jumped by 0.8% during the month, after a 1.2% decline in March. A weak reading, though, might weaken the pound and spark fresh concerns about the UK economy and consumer confidence. The Bank of England will be hosting Markets Forum 2018 - a conference to discuss measures to stamp out misconduct and make the financial world fairer and more effective. The agenda: 9am BST: The Bank of England\u2019s Markets Forum 2018 9am BST: Deutsche Bank annual meeting begins 9.30am: UK retail sales for April 1.30pm: US initial jobless claims figures",

      "bodyText": "Shareholders in BT may be under the impression their company had a lousy time last year. Investors did. BT\u2019s share price fell by a third in a rising stock market and sits at its lowest level since 2012. The dividend was merely held, making a nonsense of the chief executive Gavin Patterson\u2019s confidence a couple of years ago that double-digit increases were in prospect. Staff, too, may be less than cheerful. Some 13,000 are about to lose their jobs as Patterson confronts the fact that BT\u2019s revenues are falling again. But, no, it turns out that 2017-18 was a triumph, at least in the boardroom. The victory wasn\u2019t the maximum possible under the terms of the executive bonus scheme but the outcome was \u201cabove target\u201d, says the annual report. Even Patterson seems to have sensed that finding looks perverse because he volunteered for an \u201cat target\u201d score, meaning his bonus was \u00a31.3m not the \u00a31.6m that the mechanical formula said it should be. Come on, though, awarding a \u00a31m-plus bonus in these circumstances to a boss on a guaranteed basic whack of \u00a3997,000 is ridiculous. The pay formula may record BT performing wonders on cash flow and \u201ccustomer experience\u201d but, when the share price has more than halved in two years, a remuneration committee chaired by the former BSkyB boss Tony Ball should be asking whether it is measuring the right things. A further prompt should have come from BT\u2019s three-year incentive scheme, which paid out nothing and thus gave a reading closer to shareholders\u2019 misery. BT was 20th out of 23 in a league table of peers judged by shareholder returns, missed its cash-flow target by \u00a31.7bn and was miles off on revenues. This disconnect between the three-year scheme and the single-year bonus plan seems to have escaped Ball\u2019s committee. BT\u2019s defence is that the pay structure was approved last year with a majority of 96%. Well, yes, companies always say that. None dares to submit a proposal that would require them to apply some common sense when the bonus model spits out a silly figure that doesn\u2019t fit the facts on the ground. Lloyds saw a 20% revolt against its pay report on Thursday. The numbers are smaller at BT but the decision-making process looks worse. CMA must establish Heathrow facts The Competition and Markets Authority may have the audit market on its mind (after Carillion, it should) but here\u2019s another inquiry worth doing \u2013 and more urgently. Heathrow Hub, which is the lower-cost scheme that would expand the airport by extending the existing northern runway, wants the CMA to investigate whether the owners of Heathrow have unfairly favoured their own more expensive \u00a314bn plan to build a third runway. It is a pressing subject for two reasons. First, MPs are due to vote on Heathrow\u2019s expansion in the summer. Second, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, made an alarming statement at a select committee hearing in February that should have caused a bigger fuss. Grayling, who favours Heathrow\u2019s proposal, said: \u201cI have to say that the extended runway proposal is a very innovative one. At the end of the day \u2026 the biggest issue for us was that the promoters of that scheme could not secure from Heathrow a written guarantee that if we picked it they would do it. That seemed to be a fairly fundamental problem for us.\u201d One can understand Grayling\u2019s desire to be pragmatic. If the parliament votes for more capacity at Heathrow, it has to be confident the work will be done. But surely the first question is: which scheme is fundamentally better? The Airports Commission in 2015 opted for Heathrow\u2019s third runway, calling the Hub idea \u201cimaginative\u201d and \u201cviable\u201d but \u201cless attractive from a noise perspective\u201d among other factors. Since then a furious debate has raged about whether the commission got the correct data on noise and safety, and made fair comparisons on capacity. That\u2019s one for the technical experts but there is sufficient uncertainty for Grayling to switch sides credibly if he so wishes. That is why the Hub\u2019s claim that Heathrow \u201cabused its dominant market position\u201d by, in effect, vetoing a rival\u2019s cheaper and quicker proposal is serious. Heathrow denies the allegation but it would remove all suspicion if its owners \u2013 an international consortium led by Spanish group Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 committed to build whatever scheme parliament approves and survives the likely judicial reviews. That guarantee ought to be easy to give. The CMA should establish the facts. This air around Heathrow is bad enough without this lingering row.",

      "body": "<p>Shareholders in BT may be under the impression their company had a lousy time last year. Investors did. BT\u2019s share price fell by a third in a rising stock market and sits at its lowest level since 2012. The dividend was merely held, making a nonsense of the chief executive Gavin Patterson\u2019s confidence a couple of years ago that double-digit increases were in prospect. Staff, too, may be less than cheerful. Some 13,000 are about to lose their jobs as Patterson confronts the fact that BT\u2019s revenues are falling again.</p> <p>But, no, it turns out that 2017-18 was a triumph, at least in the boardroom. The victory wasn\u2019t the maximum possible under the terms of the executive bonus scheme but the outcome was \u201cabove target\u201d, says the annual report. Even Patterson seems to have sensed that finding looks perverse because he volunteered for an \u201cat target\u201d score, meaning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/24/bt-paid-chief-23m-shortly-after-revealing-13000-job-cuts\">his bonus was \u00a31.3m</a> not the \u00a31.6m that the mechanical formula said it should be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/24/bt-paid-chief-23m-shortly-after-revealing-13000-job-cuts\">BT paid chief \u00a32.3m shortly after revealing 13,000 job cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Come on, though, awarding a \u00a31m-plus bonus in these circumstances to a boss on a guaranteed basic whack of \u00a3997,000 is ridiculous. The pay formula may record BT performing wonders on cash flow and \u201ccustomer experience\u201d but, when the share price has more than halved in two years, a remuneration committee chaired by the former BSkyB boss Tony Ball should be asking whether it is measuring the right things.</p> <p>A further prompt should have come from BT\u2019s three-year incentive scheme, which paid out nothing and thus gave a reading closer to shareholders\u2019 misery. BT was 20th out of 23 in a league table of peers judged by shareholder returns, missed its cash-flow target by \u00a31.7bn and was miles off on revenues. This disconnect between the three-year scheme and the single-year bonus plan seems to have escaped Ball\u2019s committee.</p> <p>BT\u2019s defence is that the pay structure was approved last year with a majority of 96%. Well, yes, companies always say that. None dares to submit a proposal that would require them to apply some common sense when the bonus model spits out a silly figure that doesn\u2019t fit the facts on the ground. Lloyds saw a 20% revolt against its pay report on Thursday. The numbers are smaller at BT but the decision-making process looks worse.</p> <h2>CMA must establish Heathrow facts</h2> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority may have the audit market on its mind (after Carillion, it should) but here\u2019s another inquiry worth doing \u2013 and more urgently. Heathrow Hub, which is the lower-cost scheme that would expand the airport by extending the existing northern runway, wants the CMA to investigate whether the owners of Heathrow have unfairly favoured their own more expensive \u00a314bn plan to build a third runway.</p> <p>It is a pressing subject for two reasons. First, MPs are due to vote on Heathrow\u2019s expansion in the summer. Second, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, made an alarming statement at a select committee hearing in February that should have caused a bigger fuss.</p> <p>Grayling, who favours Heathrow\u2019s proposal, said: \u201cI have to say that the extended runway proposal is a very innovative one. At the end of the day \u2026 the biggest issue for us was that the promoters of that scheme could not secure from Heathrow a written guarantee that if we picked it they would do it. That seemed to be a fairly fundamental problem for us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One can understand Grayling\u2019s desire to be pragmatic. If the parliament votes for more capacity at Heathrow, it has to be confident the work will be done. But surely the first question is: which scheme is fundamentally better?</p> <p>The Airports Commission in 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/heathrow-airport-expansion-gets-government-approval-gatwick\">opted for Heathrow\u2019s third runway</a>, calling the Hub idea \u201cimaginative\u201d and \u201cviable\u201d but \u201cless attractive from a noise perspective\u201d among other factors. Since then a furious debate has raged about whether the commission got the correct data on noise and safety, and made fair comparisons on capacity. That\u2019s one for the technical experts but there is sufficient uncertainty for Grayling to switch sides credibly if he so wishes.</p> <p>That is why the Hub\u2019s claim that Heathrow \u201cabused its dominant market position\u201d by, in effect, vetoing a rival\u2019s cheaper and quicker proposal is serious. Heathrow denies the allegation but it would remove all suspicion if its owners \u2013 an international consortium led by Spanish group Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 committed to build whatever scheme parliament approves and survives the likely judicial reviews. That guarantee ought to be easy to give. The CMA should establish the facts. This air around Heathrow is bad enough without this lingering row.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has suffered its first significant shareholder rebellion since fully exiting state ownership last year, after more than a fifth of investors refused to back its remuneration report. Almost 21% of Lloyds investors voted against the bank\u2019s executive pay report for 2017, which was seen as a landmark year for the company after it ended almost a decade of taxpayer ownership. The former bailed-out bank becomes the latest major British company to suffer a pay revolt from investors over recent weeks. More than 20 listed firms, including the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the oil company Shell, have now been rocked by pay rebellions. Alongside RBS and Northern Rock, Lloyds was one of the biggest casualties of the financial crisis, requiring more than \u00a320bn of money from taxpayers to stay afloat. The government sold the last of its remaining stake in Lloyds in May last year. The Lloyds chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio,saw his earnings rise 10.9% from \u00a35.78m in 2016 to \u00a36.42m in 2017 \u2013 nearly 100 times the average worker\u2019s pay at the bank. The advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended a vote against the bank\u2019s remuneration report at the annual general meeting, which took place in Edinburgh on Thursday, highlighting discrepancies between \u201cpay and relative performance\u201d. Despite the protest, a majority of shareholders backed the pay report. Responding to the vote, the bank\u2019s chair Norman Blackwell, told the annual meeting: \u201cThe vote has been carried, however as I said we are disappointed that a number of shareholders did not support the resolution this year and we will of course note and respond to them.\u201d The TV presenter Noel Edmonds was among the shareholders publicly berating the bank at the event , having bought one share for 67p in order to attend. The former Deal or No Deal host used the opportunity to criticise Lloyds\u2019 treatment of small customers. \u201cIf you want to turn it into \u2018Jail or No Jail\u2019 you are going in the right direction. Things are very serious but I keep asking questions and you keep ducking them,\u201d he told the bank\u2019s management. Edmonds is seeking financial redress from Lloyds after allegedly falling victim to fraud by former staff at HBOS Reading, which Lloyds bought at the height of the financial crisis. Edmonds has been a vocal critic of Lloyds ever since the collapse of his company, Unique Group, which he alleged was \u201cgroomed, pillaged and destroyed\u201d by the bank, leading to scores of job losses. Six people, including two former HBOS bankers, were jailed last year for the fraud and the bank is still being investigated by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency. Lloyds has apologised to the victims of the HBOS Reading fraud and set aside \u00a3100m for compensation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest lender, is to cut more than 7,000 jobs globally, with its investment banking business in London likely to be hit. Deutsche said one in four equities sales and trading jobs, which are mainly located in New York and London, would be axed. The bank\u2019s global headcount is expected to fall from just over 97,000 to well below 90,000. The firm said it would not provide a breakdown at this stage but that all regions would be affected. Deutsche\u2019s largest investment banking operation is based in the City of London. It employs about 8,500 people in the UK \u2013 mostly in London, with smaller operations in Birmingham and Bournemouth \u2013 and is one of the largest employers in the City. Deutsche\u2019s new chief executive, Christian Sewing, said: \u201cWe remain committed to our corporate and investment bank and our international presence \u2013 we are unwavering in that. We are Europe\u2019s alternative in the international financing and capital markets business. However, we must concentrate on what we truly do well.\u201d The move is part of a plan to scale back its global investment bank and refocus on Europe after three consecutive years of losses. Last month the bank said it would pare back US bond trading, global stock trading and its business serving hedge funds. The news came a few hours before the group\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in Frankfurt, where Paul Achleitner, who has chaired Deutsche since 2012, faced a no-confidence motion over the company\u2019s poor performance. When Sewing, the former co-head of the bank\u2019s retail banking arm, was appointed to replace his British predecessor, John Cryan, in April, he vowed to take \u201ctough decisions\u201d to return the bank to profitability. Cryan was criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures. Sewing told shareholders gathered at Frankfurt\u2019s Festhalle that the job cuts were already under way and that 600 investment bankers had left in the last seven weeks. He said the bank wanted a better balance between business divisions. He also warned of a tough outlook: \u201cIn the second quarter, the revenue situation remains challenging, particularly for the corporate and investment bank.\u201d At the meeting, where shareholders were served Frankfurter sausages, pretzels and cake, Achleitner denied claims he had botched the change of CEO last month. Cryan\u2019s ousting came after a two-week boardroom battle and the Deutsche chairman insisted that Sewing was the best man for the job, rather than a company outsider. Shareholders called on Deutsche to speed up the recovery after months of internal turmoil. Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes Investment Management, a Deutsche Bank shareholder, told Achleitner \u2013 who has presided over four CEO changes \u2013 he should be replaced and called for more \u201ceffective\u201d leadership of the supervisory board. \u201cUnfortunately, the results of your work are not convincing.\u201d Klaus Nieding of the shareholder lobby group DSW said: \u201cIt is high-time to \u2026 end the years-long and still-popular \u2018Deutsche Bank bashing\u2019 and get to work finally getting our bank back on its feet after six long years of restructuring.\u201d However, Brian Scott-Quinn, the director of banking programmes at Henley Business School, said Deutsche was trapped in a \u201cspiral of decline\u201d that started 20 years ago. \u201cWe really no longer need Deutsche Bank. There are already plenty of retail banks in Germany to provide competition and a good service to consumers. In investment banking it is the same as there are still good European investment banks which can provide a good service to German industry. It is almost impossible now to recover from years of mismanagement.\u201d The cutbacks will mean Deutsche stepping back from several decades of global expansion in which the bank vied with Wall Street rivals such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Redundancy packages and other restructuring costs will result in charges of up to \u20ac800m this year, hitting profits. Deutsche\u2019s shares fell almost 6% on Thursday.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s could face legal action from the union Unite after the supermarket said it was pressing ahead with a plan to cut paid breaks, annual bonuses and premium pay for Sundays, leaving thousands of workers out of pocket. After weeks of consultation with staff and pressure from unions and MPs, the supermarket on Thursday pledged extra pay for online delivery drivers, those on night shifts and those in outer London boroughs, adding \u00a310m to its pay settlement. Sainsbury\u2019s said it was investing \u00a3110m in a pay rise for 93% of its 130,000 shop workers, taking pay from \u00a38 to \u00a39.20 an hour, or \u00a39.80 in London, to give an average pay rise of 9.3%. However, the removal of paid breaks, the annual bonus and Sunday and bank holiday pay means 7% of Sainsbury\u2019s staff, or about 9,000 people, will suffer an average pay cut of \u00a3400 a year. The supermarket said it would make up the difference in their earnings for 18 months and pledged to review its policy in March 2020. Unite said it had anticipated that a consultation about the new pay arrangements would run until 4 June and feared staff who did not sign up to new contracts enshrining the pay changes could be made redundant in September when they come into effect. The union said it was seeking legal advice over whether Sainsbury\u2019s had failed to meaningfully consult workers. It also claimed Sainsbury\u2019s was attempting to harmonise its contracts with those of Asda workers before a planned merger, which was announced in April. Joe Clarke, the union\u2019s national officer for food and drink, said: \u201cBosses have cut short the consultation extension over the plans, which will leave thousands out of pocket while still holding a gun to workers\u2019 heads with the threat of sign up to the new contract or be out of a job.\u201d A spokesperson from Sainsbury\u2019s said the company had informed Unite on Wednesday that there were no grounds to continue the consultation and was \u201cdisappointed with this reaction from Unite as they have had a seat at the table throughout the consultation process\u201d. They said there was no legal merit to Unite\u2019s proposed claim. \u201cThis consultation relates to Sainsbury\u2019s stores only and has nothing to do with the proposed merger with Asda,\u201d the spokesperson added. Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, said it remained concerned that some workers would lose out but said it was pleased to have persuaded Sainsbury\u2019s to make some concessions after \u201cextensive consultation\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s has previously been accused by unions of \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d and more than 100 MPs signed a letter to the prime minister this week calling for her to intervene. The MPs, led by Labour\u2019s Siobhain McDonagh, criticised the retailer for a \u201cwhole array of deplorable decisions that will hit hardest their most dedicated, loyal and long-term staff\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said the new deal was \u201cintended to rectify the unfairness of colleagues working side by side in store, doing exactly the same job but being paid different amounts depending on when they started working for Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201d Simon Roberts, the retail and operations director of Sainsbury\u2019s, said the supermarket had tried to minimise the negative impact of the changes and denied that the majority of those affected by pay cuts would be longer-serving staff. \u201cWe are trying to do the right thing and to protect our business and grow our business, and protect jobs going forward,\u201d Roberts said.",

      "bodyText": "The EU has settled a seven-year dispute with Gazprom after the Russian state-controlled energy giant agreed to change its operations in central and eastern Europe. The deal, announced on Thursday by the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, comes at a time of tensions between Russia and Europe over Ukraine, Syria and the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, which has taken British-Russian relations to a new low. Meanwhile there is division within the EU over the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. Vestager sought to isolate the case from the political turmoil. \u201cThis case is not about Russia, this case is about European consumers and European businesses and making the market serve them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about what rules to play by, no matter your flag, no matter your ownership.\u201d Under the terms of the deal, Gazprom will be banned from imposing restrictions on how its customers in central and eastern Europe use gas. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia will no longer be banned from exporting gas to another country. The deal aims to answer concerns that customers in five countries were being over-charged for their gas. From now on, customers in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have the right to demand a price in line with those in Germany and the Netherlands. If Gazprom fails to respond, these customers can take their complaint to an arbitration body in the EU, which is empowered to impose a lower price. Some governments are unhappy about the commission\u2019s decision not to fine Gazprom for its past behaviour. Lithuania\u2019s prime minister, Saulius Skvernelis, described the proposed settlement as \u201cstrange\u201d, Reuters reported. Acknowledging that some would have liked to have seen Gazprom fined, Vestager said that option was not in the best interests of European consumers. \u201cWith today\u2019s decision, Gazprom has accepted that it has to play by our common European rules, at least if it wants to sell its gas in Europe. It has accepted to play by a rulebook that is tailor-made to ensure that European customers can benefit from the free flow of gas this very day.\u201d She said failure to comply could lead to a fine of up to 10% of global turnover, a step that can be taken without another lengthy legal investigation. \u201cThis is not empty theory,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2013 we fined Microsoft over half a billion euros when the company broke its obligation. In other words, the case doesn\u2019t stop with today\u2019s decision. Rather, it is the enforcement of the Gazprom obligations that starts today.\u201d Gazprom\u2019s deputy chief executive, Alexander Medvedev, said he was satisfied with the settlement, describing it as \u201cthe most reasonable outcome for the well-functioning of the entire European gas market\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nottingham is the city with the lowest incomes in the UK, where residents\u2019 take-home pay is only one-fifth of the disposable income enjoyed by people in west London. The average household income per head, once taxes and benefits are taken into account, is only \u00a312,232 in Nottingham, compared to \u00a358,816 in Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham in west London. The average for the whole of the UK is \u00a319,432 per head, according to official government figures that reveal the vast gulf in living standards across Britain. The data reveals not only large differences between regions but also the disparity within those regions. A few miles east of Hammersmith and Fulham, household disposable incomes per head plummet by two-thirds to \u00a319,261 in Newham and Hackney. In the north-west, incomes are lowest in Blackburn, at \u00a312,450, little more than half of those in wealthy Cheshire East (\u00a322,025). In the south, incomes are lowest in Southampton (\u00a314,797) and Luton (\u00a314,889), while the East and West Surrey districts make up Britain\u2019s most well-off county, with incomes averaging above \u00a328,000. The reasons behind Nottingham\u2019s ranking as the lowest-income city in the country are complex. The east Midlands city had a strong and prosperous textile industry during the Industrial Revolution but it declined rapidly during the 1950s and 60s. In 2014 it was named the city with the highest proportion of workless households in the UK. More than a third of children in the city live in poverty, according to a report by End Child Poverty earlier this year, with 52% of children in the Arboretum ward living below the breadline. The figures issued on Thursday are for 2016, the latest available data at a local authority level. They also reveal that while average incomes rose marginally on a national level, in many parts of the country they fell. The biggest fall in incomes in 2016 was in Tees Valley in the north-east, a byword for heavy industry, where they fell by 1.6% in real terms after inflation.

      "bodyText": "Retailers enjoyed the biggest jump in sales in 18 months during April as shoppers, forced to stay home by the bitter weather in March, returned to the high street. Fashion clothing, food and petrol sales bounced back to push sales volumes up 1.6% in April on the previous month as the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d receded and the sun came out. However the Office for National Statistics, which compiled the figures, warned that sales growth remained subdued \u201cwith the volume of goods sold over the last six months broadly unchanged\u201d. A spokesman said: \u201cOver the longer-term retail sales growth has slowed considerably, with increases in food, household goods and internet retailers being largely offset by declines across all other types of retailing.\u201d A number of retailers are struggling, with Marks &amp; Spencer saying earlier this week it would close 100 stores by 2022. Department stores were among the biggest losers in April, though this reflected their resilience in March when their internet operations profited from the cold snap. Sales fell 1.2% in March from February, with petrol sales down 7.4% after large parts of the UK were brought to a standstill by heavy snow and transport delays. On Thursday, Kingfisher, the owner of the B&amp;Q, reported that its flagship DIY chain had seen a 9% drop in sales in the three months to 30 April. It blamed 6% of the fall on the effects of the snow, which hit sales of outdoor products and forced it to close stores. Kingfisher\u2019s chief executive, Ve\u0301ronique Laury, described UK market conditions as uncertain with trade at B&amp;Q affected by \u201csoft demand\u201d and a lower number of shoppers out and about. She said the start to the year had been \u201cchallenging\u201d as a result of \u201cexceptionally harsh weather\u201d. Andrew Westbrook, head of retail at accountancy firm RSM, said: \u201cRetail sales were slightly better than expected in April giving operators a chance to partially recover from the poor weather in March. \u201cThe amount spent by shoppers increased by 3.5% when compared with the same month last year. However, while these numbers are encouraging, there is still a Darwinian struggle taking place on the UK high street.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said there were reasons to remain downbeat about the prospects for retailers. He said: \u201cWith inflation moderating and regular earnings growth firming gradually the squeeze on consumers has eased. Nevertheless, consumers are still under significant pressure and it looks unrealistic to expect a marked upturn in consumer spending any time soon.\u201d Consumers are expected to have an easier time this year than 2017, when Brexit uncertainty first began to undermine confidence in the economic outlook and real incomes dropped as a result of soaring inflation and lacklustre wage rises. Since January inflation has dropped from 3% per annum to 2.4% in March while over the same few months regular pay growth has moved up from 2.6% to 2.9%. Investors were cheered by the recovery in retail sales, briefly sending the pound back above $1.34 while the share prices of supermarkets, which were one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rebound, edged higher after the figures were published. However, the good news should be tempered, said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, said: \u201cEven though the squeeze from high inflation should ease over the year ahead, consumers are likely to remain cautious as real wages are growing slowly and Brexit uncertainty remains a negative factor weighing on big spending decisions.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Bovis Homes hit by shareholder revolt over pay of interim chief", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bovis Homes has suffered a sizeable shareholder revolt over the pay package it awarded its interim chief executive for fighting off two hostile takeover bids and steadying the business after a scandal over badly built homes. At the housebuilder\u2019s annual meeting at the Spa Hotel in Tunbridge Wells, 37.6% of shareholders voted against the Bovis remuneration report but it was passed with the backing of 62.4% of investors. Bovis has been trying to turn itself around ever since its shock profit warning at the end of 2016, when it was accused of paying thousands of pounds in cash incentives to persuade buyers to move into unfinished homes riddled with defects to meet ambitious targets. This prompted the departure of its chief executive Dave Ritchie, who was replaced by Earl Sibley, the finance director, until the arrival of industry veteran Greg Fitzgerald in April 2017. Bovis lured Fitzgerald with a three-year pay and shares package worth up to \u00a38.1m. As the scandal widened, Sibley set aside \u00a37m to fix defects, met angry homebuyers and scaled back the construction of new homes to get to grips with the problems. He also fended off takeover bids from rivals Galliford Try and Redrow. Bovis said much of the shareholder concern related to its decision to raise Sibley\u2019s 2017 bonus by 15% to \u00a3258,000, taking his total annual package to \u00a3661,000, and by granting him an exceptional long-term incentive award worth \u00a3243,750 this year. Sibley returned to his previous role of finance director when Fitzgerald took over. Alastair Lyons, chair of the remuneration committee, said: \u201cThe committee\u2019s priorities were to ensure that the company\u2019s remuneration arrangements were fully aligned with the business and incentivised the successful delivery of our challenging turnaround plan, while also ensuring that they were fair and reasonable both for the executives and shareholders, in what was an unusual year. \u201cWe recognise, however, that a significant minority of our shareholders have expressed their concerns about the arrangements we put in place and going forward we will continue to seek full shareholder engagement.\u201d A number of homebuyers, including some who bought Bovis homes last year, have told the Guardian they still have problems ranging from minor issues to more serious structural faults. Bovis faces a potential class-action lawsuit from a group of buyers. Dave Howard, who with his wife Ann set up a Facebook group for disgruntled Bovis buyers and sits on the company\u2019s homebuyers panel, created last summer, said: \u201cBovis need to resolve their customers issues before they pat themselves on the back and award themselves larger bonuses.\u201d He added: \u201cThe progress made by Earl Sibley doesn\u2019t appear to have been continued under the new leadership. The way they treat customers certainly hasn\u2019t improved, based on our personal experience and the experiences of a large number of members of our 3,000-strong Facebook group.\u201d He said the couple was personally in dispute with Bovis over the findings of a structural survey the company recently commissioned on their property but has, as yet, refused to act upon. Several other companies have faced shareholder revolts over executive pay in recent weeks, including the fellow housebuilder Persimmon, the drugmaker AstraZeneca and the consumer giant Unilever.",

Sibley returned to his previous role of finance director when Fitzgerald took over.</p> <p>Alastair Lyons, chair of the remuneration committee, said: \u201cThe committee\u2019s priorities were to ensure that the company\u2019s remuneration arrangements were fully aligned with the business and incentivised the successful delivery of our challenging turnaround plan, while also ensuring that they were fair and reasonable both for the executives and shareholders, in what was an unusual year. </p> <p>\u201cWe recognise, however, that a significant minority of our shareholders have expressed their concerns about the arrangements we put in place and going forward we will continue to seek full shareholder engagement.\u201d</p> <p>A number of homebuyers, including some who bought Bovis homes last year, have told the Guardian they still have problems ranging from minor issues to more serious structural faults. Bovis faces a potential <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/09/bovis-homebuyers-class-action-lawsuit-property-defects\">class-action lawsuit from a group of buyers</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dave Howard, who with his wife Ann set up a Facebook group for disgruntled Bovis buyers and sits on the company\u2019s homebuyers panel, created last summer, said: \u201cBovis need to resolve their customers issues before they pat themselves on the back and award themselves larger bonuses.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe progress made by Earl Sibley doesn\u2019t appear to have been continued under the new leadership. The way they treat customers certainly hasn\u2019t improved, based on our personal experience and the experiences of a large number of members of our 3,000-strong Facebook group.\u201d</p> <p>He said the couple was personally in dispute with Bovis over the findings of a structural survey the company recently commissioned on their property but has, as yet, refused to act upon.</p> <p>Several other companies have faced shareholder revolts over executive pay in recent weeks, including the fellow housebuilder Persimmon, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/astrazeneca-rocked-by-shareholder-revolt-over-executive-pay\">drugmaker AstraZeneca</a> and the consumer giant Unilever.</p>",
