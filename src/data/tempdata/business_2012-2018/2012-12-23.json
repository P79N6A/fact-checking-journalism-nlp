    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On the Saturday before Christmas the shop windows told their own story. Up to 50% off at Hobbs. Discounts of 60% at LK Bennett. Similar reductions at French Connection and the Gap. The sales started early this year and that means the economy is struggling. Fearful of being left with large amounts of unsold stock, retailers are slashing prices to attract hard-up consumers. It was the same a year ago. Hopes of recovery have been dashed in 2012, a year in which the UK has gone nowhere fast. Interest rates, gross domestic product and house prices are where they were in January. The economy is not collapsing but it is not growing either. For the past two years it has gone sideways, and the expectation at the Bank of England and the Treasury is that 2013 will be little better. Historically, it is extremely unusual for the economy to be stuck in a groove like the needle on a vinyl record. Subsistence economies can have long periods of low or zero growth but modern western economies traditionally do not. There is a cyclical pattern in which periods of slow growth gain momentum, ending in a boom-bust phase. A recession, normally relatively brief, removes the excess and allows the cycle to begin again. For the past century, this process has been lubricated by government action: interest rates are raised to stifle mounting inflationary pressure in the boom then cut in order to get growth and employment rising again during the downturn. Tax and spending policy has tended to operate in the same counter-cyclical fashion. The crisis of the past five years can be divided into two distinct phases. What happened in the first phase was entirely predictable: the financial collapse of 2008 and the economic slump of 2009 followed inexorably from the asset price bubbles of the mid-2000s. It was a big collapse because there was a big bubble. Less easy to explain is the crab-like performance subsequently. The UK economy has not really budged since the autumn of 2010, something that has not happened since the second world war and probably for a long time before that. Other western economies have broadly followed the same pattern. The US has grown a bit faster than the UK and the eurozone is already in a mild double-dip recession, but there has been the same sense of economic torpor. A third year of the same would be distinctly weird. Could it happen? Yes, of course it could. In some ways, not a lot has changed since before the crisis. Real income growth is still weak, but is no longer being supplemented by large dollops of borrowing. Banks are still recognisably the same creatures they were in 2007 but are sitting on vast quantities of underperforming assets. Macro-economic policy has been aggressive enough and persistent enough to prevent a fresh slump of the sort seen four years ago but no more than that. Expectations are already so low there is a chance that 2013 will surprise on the upside. The passage of time together with policy action could finally work over the coming months, particularly if the Americans come to a budget deal and the eurozone gets to grips with its debt crisis. There is plenty of spare capacity in the global economy and that, in normal circumstances, would point to several years of above-trend growth. Recent US data has looked relatively perky. Rising housing starts indicate that the long real-estate recession is over. Investment is picking up and jobs are being created. Barack Obama's second term will be easier than his first. Similarly, the worst for the eurozone may now be over. To be sure, the economic numbers are still dire and austerity is still hurting, but the financial markets were impressed by Mario Draghi's insistence that the European Central Bank would do whatever it took to safeguard the future of the single currency. The next 12 months are not going to be easy, but historians could well look back to Draghi's speech in London in July 2012 as the moment the corner was turned. What then do we look out for in 2013? For the UK, the short-term threats are a triple-dip recession and a credit downgrade. The rating agencies have the UK in their sights and it won't take much more bad news for the AAA status to be removed. George Osborne will not have an easy year and in the budget will face the dilemma of whether to tighten policy further in the face of fresh fiscal slippage despite weak growth. Some analysts, such as Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics, believe the UK has more spare capacity than the Office for Budget Responsibility is estimating and that the size of the structural deficit is therefore not as big as feared. That means that the plans for budgetary tightening are too tough and could be relaxed. This would be sensible but it is unlikely to happen. So where is growth going to come from in 2013? Not from the government, which has pledged no let-up in the austerity programme. Not from the consumer, who is seeing rising prices reduce the value of near-worthless pay rises. Perhaps from exports if the skies clear over the eurozone and the US does not hurtle over the fiscal cliff; perhaps from investment if brightening export prospects persuade companies to spend some of the cash balances they have accumulated in recent years. Don't bank on it, though. On past form, Europe will find a way of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory and the UK will continue to remain highly risk-averse. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme may help to increase the flow of credit and reduce its cost but Threadneedle Street is fighting two powerful headwinds. The first is the inability of first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder due to the combination of high prices and the big deposits demanded by lenders. The second is that real incomes continue to be squeezed. Capital's victory over labour since the late 1970s has come at a price: workers lack the purchasing power to buy the goods and services they are producing, and they are no longer willing or able to borrow the money to do so. Hence the high street early bargains. There will be more, it is fair to assume, in 2013.",

The US has grown a bit faster than the UK and the eurozone is already in a mild double-dip recession, but there has been the same sense of economic torpor. A third year of the same would be distinctly weird.</p> <p>Could it happen? Yes, of course it could. In some ways, not a lot has changed since before the crisis. Real income growth is still weak, but is no longer being supplemented by large dollops of borrowing. Banks are still recognisably the same creatures they were in 2007 but are sitting on vast quantities of underperforming assets. Macro-economic policy has been aggressive enough and persistent enough to prevent a fresh slump of the sort seen four years ago but no more than that.</p> <p>Expectations are already so low there is a chance that 2013 will surprise on the upside. The passage of time together with policy action could finally work over the coming months, particularly if the Americans come to a budget deal and the eurozone gets to grips with its debt crisis. There is plenty of spare capacity in the global economy and that, in normal circumstances, would point to several years of above-trend growth.</p> <p>Recent US data has looked relatively perky. Rising housing starts indicate that the long real-estate recession is over. Investment is picking up and jobs are being created. Barack Obama's second term will be easier than his first.</p> <p>Similarly, the worst for the eurozone may now be over. To be sure, the economic numbers are still dire and austerity is still hurting, but the financial markets were impressed by Mario Draghi's insistence that the European Central Bank would do whatever it took to safeguard the future of the single currency. The next 12 months are not going to be easy, but historians could well look back to Draghi's speech in London in July 2012 as the moment the corner was turned.</p> <p>What then do we look out for in 2013? For the UK, the short-term threats are a triple-dip recession and a credit downgrade. The rating agencies have the UK in their sights and it won't take much more bad news for the AAA status to be removed.</p> <p>George Osborne will not have an easy year and in the budget will face the dilemma of whether to tighten policy further in the face of fresh fiscal slippage despite weak growth. Some analysts, such as Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics, believe the UK has more spare capacity than the Office for Budget Responsibility is estimating and that the size of the structural deficit is therefore not as big as feared. That means that the plans for budgetary tightening are too tough and could be relaxed. This would be sensible but it is unlikely to happen.</p> <p>So where is growth going to come from in 2013? Not from the government, which has pledged no let-up in the austerity programme. Not from the consumer, who is seeing rising prices reduce the value of near-worthless pay rises. Perhaps from exports if the skies clear over the eurozone and the US does not hurtle over the fiscal cliff; perhaps from investment if brightening export prospects persuade companies to spend some of the cash balances they have accumulated in recent years.</p> <p>Don't bank on it, though. On past form, Europe will find a way of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory and the UK will continue to remain highly risk-averse. The Bank of England's Funding for Lending Scheme may help to increase the flow of credit and reduce its cost but Threadneedle Street is fighting two powerful headwinds.</p> <p>The first is the inability of first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder due to the combination of high prices and the big deposits demanded by lenders. The second is that real incomes continue to be squeezed. Capital's victory over labour since the late 1970s has come at a price: workers lack the purchasing power to buy the goods and services they are producing, and they are no longer willing or able to borrow the money to do so. Hence the high street early bargains. There will be more, it is fair to assume, in 2013.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Banking industry's year of shame ends in a blizzard of Libor revelations", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pledge made by one UBS trader \u2013 \"I'm a man of my word\" \u2013 seems a fine sentiment, until the realisation dawns that the promise he is making is to do \"one humongous deal\" with a broker to help him manipulate the Libor rate. Last week saw another blizzard of revelations in the Libor scandal, as the Swiss bank was slapped with hefty fines for repeatedly trying to fiddle the key interest rate. \"I will fucking do one humongous deal with you \u2026 Like a 50,000-buck deal, whatever \u2026 I need you to keep it as low as possible \u2026 If you do that \u2026 I'll pay you, you know, $50,000, $100,000 \u2026 whatever you want.\" The revelations contained in the documents published alongside last week's settlement with regulators in the UK, US and Switzerland, as they fined UBS \u00a3940m, came at the end of a year of shame for banking. Andrew Simms of thinktank the New Economics Foundation now says that, far from the banking crisis being caused by a few bad apples, \"the level of mould inside the barrel is thick and healthy and covering every part of it\". The coalition is in the process of rethinking the UK regulatory regime \u2013 giving the Bank of England back the power to police the banks, for example \u2013 but Simms says the changes are little more than cosmetic: \"I think the banks feel almost untouchable \u2013 the absence of any genuine structural reforms; the absence of any genuine change of culture. I think they think they've got away with it.\" Taxpayers who had hoped the multibillion-pound rescues of Northern Rock, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group marked the darkest days of the financial crisis have instead watched with horror as increased scrutiny from the world's regulators has uncovered a consistent pattern of misbehaviour and, in some cases, outright fraud. An industry once viewed by ministers \u2013 not least in the Labour government \u2013 as a world-beating national champion has become not only a drain on the public purse, but a source of shame. \"We have just had one scandal after another,\" says Vince Cable, the business secretary, whose strong reputation in opposition was founded partly on his fierce criticisms of Britain's banks. \"There is a deep cultural problem.\" And he argues that the failings are not confined to the swashbuckling disregard for the public interest revealed in the Barclays and UBS cases. It also extended to the retail banks' dealings with ordinary savers and borrowers: \"The high street banks lost their relationship with their customers.\" The legacy of the era when anyone who ventured into a branch could expect to be bombarded with offers of loans and insurance has come back to bite the biggest banks. The bill to compensate customers wrongly sold payment protection insurance has already topped \u00a312bn, for example, while small business customers mis-sold interest rate swaps are also awaiting multimillion-pound payouts. The same claims companies that have spearheaded the effort to win PPI compensation for clients are now turning their efforts to investigating the interest-only mortgages that were popular while house prices were booming. And one after another, the major banks have been fined for a string of other offences. Even those once regarded as having escaped the 2008 banking crisis with their reputations intact \u2013 HSBC and Standard Chartered \u2013 have now joined the shameful roll-call. HSBC was fined \u00a31.2bn by US authorities for having systems so lax that it let billions of pounds be laundered for drug barons in Mexico; cashiers in its Mexican branches had extra-wide windows to allow the piles of cash to be paid in. Standard Chartered paid \u00a3415m in penalties after breaching US rules on money laundering, including with Iran. One of its top executives, Richard Meddings, is said to have responded to warnings about the bank's misdeeds with: \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians?\" The bank denies such remarks were made. Barclays was fined \u00a3290m by the Financial Services Authority and US regulators after its traders were found to be offering bottles of Bollinger champagne in exchange for collusion in fixing Libor. Then last week came the fine for UBS over charges that 40 staff were involved in or aware of efforts to rig Libor. The banks made corrupt payments of \u00a315,000 a quarter to brokers to help fix the rates. Two former employees of the Swiss bank \u2013 including British citizen Tom Hayes \u2013 have been charged in the US. There will be more Libor revelations in the new year, too: bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to be next. The Financial Services Authority still has investigations under way into six financial firms, not all of them banks. This apparently widespread culture of \"gaming\" any rules put in place to constrain the banks' activities underpinned the findings of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, which issued its first report on Friday. George Osborne has backed the proposals of Sir John Vickers's commission on banking, which called for the banks' safer retail activities to be legally and financially separated from their riskier investment banking businesses. But Tyrie and his colleagues argued that this so-called ring fence between the two types of activity should be \"electrified\", to prevent canny banks from finding a way around it. Tyrie said the latest revelations about the banks' behaviour \"beggar belief,\" and offer \"the clearest illustration yet that a great deal more needs to be done to restore standards\". Chris Leslie of the shadow Treasury team says Labour will fight to have a backstop written into the legislation in the new year that would impose a full split on the banks if they have failed to implement the Vickers proposals faithfully by 2015. \"It's about trying to create a banking system that is not only safe but appears to be safe, not just for customers but for taxpayers,\" he says. \"The jury's out on a ring fence, therefore we have got to insure against its failure.\" Tyrie's commission is due to report next year on a series of other issues, such as whether a new professional body might take on the role of banning miscreant bankers in the same way as the General Medical Council has the power to strike off doctors. But Cable says new rules and regulations, and measures such as the coalition's creation of two new watchdogs, the Prudential Regulation Authority (inside the Bank) and the Financial Conduct Authority, can only go so far. \"You can only partly deal with these things through structural reform,\" he says. He points to the importance of competition \u2013 challengers such as Metro Bank, Handelsbanken and the mutually owned Co-op grabbing a growing share of new business \u2013 as another important check on the other banks' behaviour. He also welcomes the wholesale shake-up in personnel at the top of the major financial groups since the grim days of 2008 and 2009: \"We've got sensible people running Lloyds and Barclays, who are much more interested in long-term banking.\" Despite the new faces, the persistence of bumper pay deals in the Square Mile has helped perpetuate fears that it is \"business as usual\" at the top of Britain's financial institutions. Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research shows that people working in the financial sector routinely earn up to 20% more than those with similar qualifications elsewhere. When it was announced last week that Hector Sants, the former boss of the Financial Services Authority, had won a package worth up to \u00a33m in his new job at Barclays \u2013 where he has been brought in to help restore the broken corporate culture \u2013 many in the City didn't bat an eyelid. But to outsiders it looked like an extraordinary reward for a gamekeeper turning poacher. And while the reputational damage to the banks of the latest revelations has been serious, the financial penalties do not seem to be causing too much pain. Even as UBS admitted that the \u00a3940m payout would force it into a fourth-quarter loss, its share price barely moved, almost in relief that the bad news was out of the way. Pete Hahn of the Cass Business School is concerned that fines have become a \"cost of doing business\" \u2013 one of those hiccups caused by having operations in financial centres around the world. He asks whether instead banks that misbehave should be stripped of their licences \u2013 effectively closed down: \"My suggestion is that the penalties need to be much more. That will create a real cultural change.\" Meanwhile, Cable says he can easily understand why many members of the public still don't have confidence in the banks: \"I don't have confidence either.\"",

      "body": "<p>The pledge made by one UBS trader \u2013 \"I'm a man of my word\" \u2013 seems a fine sentiment, until the realisation dawns that the promise he is making is to do \"one humongous deal\" with a broker to help him manipulate the Libor rate.</p> <p>Last week saw another blizzard of revelations in the Libor scandal, as the Swiss bank was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/19/ubs-pays-libor-fixing-claims\" title=\"\">slapped with hefty fines</a> for repeatedly trying to fiddle the key interest rate.</p> <p>\"I will fucking do one humongous deal with you \u2026 Like a 50,000-buck deal, whatever \u2026 I need you to keep it as low as possible \u2026 If you do that \u2026 I'll pay you, you know, $50,000, $100,000 \u2026 whatever you want.\"</p> <p>The revelations contained in the documents published alongside last week's settlement with regulators in the UK, US and Switzerland, as they fined UBS \u00a3940m, came at the end of a year of shame for banking.</p> <p>Andrew Simms of thinktank the New Economics Foundation now says that, far from the banking crisis being caused by a few bad apples, \"the level of mould inside the barrel is thick and healthy and covering every part of it\". The coalition is in the process of rethinking the UK regulatory regime \u2013 giving the Bank of England back the power to police the banks, for example \u2013 but Simms says the changes are little more than cosmetic: \"I think the banks feel almost untouchable \u2013 the absence of any genuine structural reforms; the absence of any genuine change of culture. I think they think they've got away with it.\"</p> <p>Taxpayers who had hoped the multibillion-pound rescues of Northern Rock, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group marked the darkest days of the financial crisis have instead watched with horror as increased scrutiny from the world's regulators has uncovered a consistent pattern of misbehaviour and, in some cases, outright fraud.</p> <p>An industry once viewed by ministers \u2013 not least in the Labour government \u2013 as a world-beating national champion has become not only a drain on the public purse, but a source of shame.</p> <p>\"We have just had one scandal after another,\" says Vince Cable, the business secretary, whose strong reputation in opposition was founded partly on his fierce criticisms of Britain's banks. \"There is a deep cultural problem.\"</p> <p>And he argues that the failings are not confined to the swashbuckling disregard for the public interest revealed in the Barclays and UBS cases. It also extended to the retail banks' dealings with ordinary savers and borrowers: \"The high street banks lost their relationship with their customers.\"</p> <p>The legacy of the era when anyone who ventured into a branch could expect to be bombarded with offers of loans and insurance has come back to bite the biggest banks. The bill to compensate customers wrongly sold payment protection insurance has already topped \u00a312bn, for example, while small business customers mis-sold interest rate swaps are also awaiting multimillion-pound payouts.</p> <p>The same claims companies that have spearheaded the effort to win PPI compensation for clients are now turning their efforts to investigating the interest-only mortgages that were popular while house prices were booming.</p> <p>And one after another, the major banks have been fined for a string of other offences. Even those once regarded as having escaped the 2008 banking crisis with their reputations intact \u2013 HSBC and Standard Chartered \u2013 have now joined the shameful roll-call.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/10/standard-chartered-settle-iran-sanctions\" title=\"\">HSBC was fined \u00a31.2bn by US authorities</a> for having systems so lax that it let billions of pounds be laundered for drug barons in Mexico; cashiers in its Mexican branches had extra-wide windows to allow the piles of cash to be paid in.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/10/standard-chartered-settle-iran-sanctions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered paid \u00a3415m in penalties</a> after breaching US rules on money laundering, including with Iran. One of its top executives, Richard Meddings, is said to have responded to warnings about the bank's misdeeds with: \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians?\" The bank denies such remarks were made.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">Barclays was fined \u00a3290m</a> by the Financial Services Authority and US regulators after its traders were found to be offering bottles of Bollinger champagne in exchange for collusion in fixing Libor.</p> <p>Then last week came the fine for UBS over charges that 40 staff were involved in or aware of efforts to rig Libor. The banks made corrupt payments of \u00a315,000 a quarter to brokers to help fix the rates. Two former employees of the Swiss bank \u2013 including British citizen Tom Hayes \u2013 have been charged in the US.</p> <p>There will be more Libor revelations in the new year, too: bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to be next. The Financial Services Authority still has investigations under way into six financial firms, not all of them banks.</p> <p>This apparently widespread culture of \"gaming\" any rules put in place to constrain the banks' activities underpinned the findings of the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/dec/21/bank-ringfencing-proposals-briefing\" title=\"\">issued its first report on Friday</a>.</p> <p>George Osborne has backed the proposals of Sir John Vickers's commission on banking, which called for the banks' safer retail activities to be legally and financially separated from their riskier investment banking businesses. But Tyrie and his colleagues argued that this so-called ring fence between the two types of activity <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/21/call-strengthen-ring-fence-banks\" title=\"\">should be \"electrified\",</a> to prevent canny banks from finding a way around it.</p> <p>Tyrie said the latest revelations about the banks' behaviour \"beggar belief,\" and offer \"the clearest illustration yet that a great deal more needs to be done to restore standards\".</p> <p>Chris Leslie of the shadow Treasury team says Labour will fight to have a backstop written into the legislation in the new year that would impose a full split on the banks if they have failed to implement the Vickers proposals faithfully by 2015.</p> <p>\"It's about trying to create a banking system that is not only safe but appears to be safe, not just for customers but for taxpayers,\" he says. \"The jury's out on a ring fence, therefore we have got to insure against its failure.\"</p> <p>Tyrie's commission is due to report next year on a series of other issues, such as whether a new professional body might take on the role of banning miscreant bankers in the same way as the General Medical Council has the power to strike off doctors.</p> <p>But Cable says new rules and regulations, and measures such as the coalition's creation of two new watchdogs, the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/about/what/reg_reform/pra\" title=\"\">Prudential Regulation Authority</a> (inside the Bank) and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/19/payday-loans-regulator-new-powers\" title=\"\">Financial Conduct Authority</a>, can only go so far.</p> <p>\"You can only partly deal with these things through structural reform,\" he says. He points to the importance of competition \u2013 challengers such as Metro Bank, Handelsbanken and the mutually owned Co-op grabbing a growing share of new business \u2013 as another important check on the other banks' behaviour.</p> <p>He also welcomes the wholesale shake-up in personnel at the top of the major financial groups since the grim days of 2008 and 2009: \"We've got sensible people running Lloyds and Barclays, who are much more interested in long-term banking.\"</p> <p>Despite the new faces, the persistence of bumper pay deals in the Square Mile has helped perpetuate fears that it is \"business as usual\" at the top of Britain's financial institutions. Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research shows that people working in the financial sector routinely earn up to 20% more than those with similar qualifications elsewhere.</p> <p>When it was announced last week that Hector Sants, the former boss of the Financial Services Authority, had won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/19/peter-burt-cable-business-bank\" title=\"\">a package worth up to \u00a33m in his new job at Barclays</a> \u2013 where he has been brought in to help restore the broken corporate culture \u2013 many in the City didn't bat an eyelid. But to outsiders it looked like an extraordinary reward for a gamekeeper turning poacher.</p> <p>And while the reputational damage to the banks of the latest revelations has been serious, the financial penalties do not seem to be causing too much pain. Even as UBS admitted that the \u00a3940m payout would force it into a fourth-quarter loss, its share price barely moved, almost in relief that the bad news was out of the way.</p> <p>Pete Hahn of the Cass Business School is concerned that fines have become a \"cost of doing business\" \u2013 one of those hiccups caused by having operations in financial centres around the world.</p> <p>He asks whether instead banks that misbehave should be stripped of their licences \u2013 effectively closed down: \"My suggestion is that the penalties need to be much more. That will create a real cultural change.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cable says he can easily understand why many members of the public still don't have confidence in the banks: \"I don't have confidence either.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Perhaps one of the most cheering moments of 2012 was when Sir Mervyn King summoned Barclays chairman Marcus Agius and told him that after the appalling revelations about Libor-fixing, the bank's chief executive Bob Diamond would have to go \u2013 or, as the Sun headline had it: \"Sign on, You Crazy Diamond.\" Both King's high moral tone and the headline-writers' cheek seemed refreshingly modern \u2013 but for anyone wandering the damp streets of London with half an hour or so to kill during this festive season, a corner of the British Museum offers a healthy dose of historical perspective on these and many other events over the past torrid five years. Tucked away in Room 69a, just around the corner from a display of Roman pottery, is a small temporary exhibition dedicated to \"Bubbles and Bankruptcy: Financial Crises in Britain Since 1700\". One exhibit is a cartoon from Punch, published after the Bank of England bailed out Barings (yes, that Barings) in 1890. A stiff-looking woman with an apron made of banknotes \u2013 the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street \u2013 crossly hands out cash to a queue of cowed financiers, saying: \"You've Got Yourself into a Nice Mess With Your 'Speculation'!\" It must be reassuring for King to regard himself as today's incarnation of that starchy matron. It's also salutary \u2013 and somehow comforting \u2013 to see artefacts from the events of the recent crash boxed up in glass cases as historical exhibits: an empty champagne bottle from the flotation of the ill-fated Northern Rock; a Steve Bell cartoon of ravenous fat cats having their toenails gingerly clipped by George Osborne; and a handful of credit cards from the bailed-out banks. These now-poignant objects sit alongside exhibits illustrating a bevy of other investment frenzies and financial crises: the South Sea bubble, tulip mania and the railway investment boom \u2013 and bust \u2013 of the mid-19th century. Apart from the facile (but nonetheless true) insight that there's nothing new under the sun, the exhibition holds one or two other lessons for today's policymakers. The first is that these boom-bust events tend to follow a classic arc: a tale with a grain of truth in it is seized on and peddled to credulous investors by an unholy alliance of greedy optimists and downright swindlers. An engraving in one case shows a certain Gregor MacGregor, a dashing-looking Scottish general who went off to Latin America and came back claiming to have discovered a lush territory called Poyais. He raised an extraordinary \u00a3200,000 \u2013 detailed in minute letters on a loan document on display \u2013 from investors convinced by the tale of vast, untapped riches in a faraway colony. Unfortunately for MacGregor and the hundreds of would-be settlers who believed his tale and boldly set out across the Atlantic from Leith, Poyais turned out to be largely uninhabitable, and his backers lost their money. Anyone reading the wild predictions about the potential riches to be made from exploiting shale gas deposits in the US should recognise the ring of a story so compelling that, given enough time, it could easily become a vast investment bubble. Fortunes will be made, but also lost. A share certificate from the Sheffield and Retford Bank is a reminder that when Britain's railways arrived, they certainly transformed the economy and created millionaires; but many of the early firms set up to drive brand-new lines across great tracts of the country went bust. The Sheffield and Retford made many loans to these companies. When they defaulted, the bank failed. Some of the items on display also highlight the way that Britain's political and social elites have always been prone to being seduced by smooth-talking investors. An 18th-century ballad, the Bubblers Medley, printed at the time of the South Sea crash, talks of the \"Stars and Garters\" tempted into the scheme alongside \"harlots\" from Drury Lane. However, Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling should note that while the then chancellor of the exchequer, John Aislabie, did buy shares in the South Sea company, he shrewdly sold them before the crash \u2013 as visitors can see from the bill with his signature \u2013 making them over to some more gullible citizen. When veteran bank-watcher Sir Donald Cruickshank appeared before the parliamentary commission on banking standards recently, he also called for some historical perspective, urging its members to immerse themselves in a copy of Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now. Reading the rip-roaring adventures of shady financier Augustus Melmotte, who takes London by storm with his eye-watering wealth, drawing politicians and aristocrats into his net, it's hard not to think of the charming chancers in charge of Britain's banks, who convinced us (and themselves) they were financial geniuses before the crisis \u2013 and were revealed to be self-deluded at best. True, Melmotte certainly wouldn't resort to the vulgar \"done ... for you big boy\" tone of the emails that surfaced in the Barclays Libor settlement, but the sentiment is similar. Or, as Cruickshank put it: \"I don't think bankers are any worse than they have been before: they always calibrate off society \u2026 We have been here before.\"",

It's never a great day for shop-keepers, but if you're a lawyer or an accountant you'll hardly be able to sleep with the excitement of how the deadline might help fill your Christmas stocking with a load more insolvencies. Property law firm Mundays drools: \"Previous rent days this year forced retailers Aquascutum, Peacocks and Game into administration, with the latter suspending dealing in its shares as a result of experiencing difficulties in raising the \u00a3180m needed to pay rent. 2012's final instalment could well be the final nail in the coffin for retailers which are already struggling to balance the books.\" Elsewhere, others give the impression of being equally impatient for the big day to arrive. Restructuring firm Begbies Traynor reckons that the quarterly rent day and tough trading conditions on the high street could mean a \"surge of new insolvency activity during the first quarter of 2013\", while R3, the insolvency industry's trade body, reckons Christmas is often the period when they receive the most calls. It's not Grinch-like to hope that they don't get what they're asking for. Midwinter may not be so bleak in the City Anybody watching the markets rather than the television next week is likely to be presented with a phrase that's getting more reruns than favourite episodes of Only Fools and Horses. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed on Friday at 5939.99, which students of these matters are contractually obliged to point out is closing in on the \"psychologically important 6000 mark\" it last hit in July 2011. It may be that that level is psychologically important, although the City's tea-leaves readers who study technical charts suggest that the key level is actually 5950 (for reasons too tedious to dwell on). But if recent history is any kind of measure, we could have a decent chance of hitting that 6000. The blue chip index has risen between Christmas and New Year in nine of the 12 years since 2000. It managed it even in 2008, when the markets had a shocker. December as a month also tends to book positive FTSE returns as traders bet on the shares that might be in vogue at the start of the year when fund managers reassess their portfolios. This is also the time they start punting their bonuses (although maybe not this year). Also, thin volumes over the festive period and a desire to end the year on a high may also be contributory factors. In the City, they call it the Santa rally \u2013 and everybody believes in it.",
