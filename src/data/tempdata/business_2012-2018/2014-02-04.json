    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of BP has become the most senior busi ness leader yet to step into the Scottish independence debate by saying he did not want to see Scotland \"drifting away\" from the UK. Bob Dudley claimed that \"all businesses have a concern\" about the referendum and his company would almost certainly face higher costs amid currency uncertainty that would not help future investment. He made the comments as George Osborne said a currency union based on the pound would be \"unworkable\" in the wake of analysis by the Bank of England. The chancellor warned that a recent review by central bank governor Mark Carney showed Edinburgh and London would need to agree public sector spending limits and a banking union, which would be almost impossible to agree following a yes vote. He said: \"Alex Salmond's claims about sharing the currency were demolished by the governor. I don't think a workable currency can be created.\" Osborne said Dudley's intervention highlighted the concerns of many business leaders and especially those in the oil industry who point out that the North Sea should play a key role providing jobs and tax revenues north of the border. There have been similar warnings from one of the big six power suppliers, SSE, plus renewable energy company, Infinis, in addition to Carney, the new governor of the Bank of England warning of the complications of a yes vote around the currency. But most business leaders have steered clear of passing judgment on such a contentious issue while drinks producer Diageo, and transport group Stagecoach, are among those which have argued that independence would not affect their investment plans. Dudley's comments were condemned by the pro-independence \"Yes Scotland\" campaign. \"With independence, the continued use of sterling has the overwhelming support of the people of Scotland and the public in the rest of the UK,\" a spokesman said. In remarks following BP's annual financial results, Dudley said: \"It does not seem the right thing to me for the country [Scotland] to drift off. That's not a company view, that's from me.\" In a separate interview with the BBC he went on: \"We have a lot of people in Scotland. We have a lot of investments in Scotland. You know there's much debate about currency, what would happen with the currency and of course connections with Europe or not. \"These are quite big uncertainties for us and at the moment we're continuing to invest at a pace because these projects are underway but it's a question mark. I think all businesses have a concern,\" adding: \"My personal view is Great Britain is great and it ought to stay together.\" Asked in the interview whether there could be a reduction in the amount of investment being made in the North Sea, where BP continues to be one of the major participants, Dudley said: \"There's enough uncertainty and talk about it and the questions raised. It would create extra costs for our business and we would have to have duplicate centres and do things, and again the currency question \u2026 These investments they're big, they're underway and we want to see things develop. It depends on what tax regimes are there and it depends on currency.\" The Edinburgh government believes Scotland is entitled to a 90% geographical share of the North Sea's oil and gas fields but such a claim would be disputed by the government in London. Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, has claimed an independent country could raise \u00a354bn from tax revenues over the next five years from the North Sea. The Scottish government was further accused of failing to tackle questions about how an independent Scotland would pay for its state pensions and for heavy debts in cross-border public and private sector pension funds. The Institute of Chartered Accountants Scotland (ICAS) said Scottish ministers had failed to properly address the questions the institute raised on pensions last year in their white paper on independence, on how UK-wide cross-borders schemes, worth billions of pounds, would be financed or managed. ICAS warned that Scotland's larger ageing population was a significant issue, yet Scottish ministers were promising more generous pensions after independence. \"Affordability is a challenge for many developed countries including the UK, but the demographics of Scotland with a higher projected ratio of pensioners to those of working-age population mean that this is likely to be more of a challenge here,\" it stated in an updated report on independence.Alistair Darling, head of the Better Together campaign, said that the comments by Dudley, an American national, marked the biggest intervention by a major business so far in the referendum debate. \"I hope that more companies and business leaders speak out over the coming weeks and months. This debate is far too important to be left to politicians alone,\" he added. However, the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign dismissed the BP chief's remarks. \"With independence, the continued use of sterling has the overwhelming support of the people of Scotland and the public in the rest of the UK,\" a spokesman told the BBC. Despite the downsizing that followed the Deepwater Horizon accident, BP remains one of the Britain's largest companies and Dudley pointed out yesterday that the North Sea had helped drive its annual profits over the last 12 months to a total of $13.4bn (\u00a38.2bn).",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has expressed concerns about plans by bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group to cut hundreds of small business experts. Speaking after he delivered a speech calling for new ways to get more competition into banking, the business secretary said he had received a reply to the letter he sent to the Lloyds boss, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, last week after 560 roles were cut from its small business division. The Portuguese banker had written an emollient letter, Cable said, \"but they are nevertheless pulling back from small-scale lending which is worrying. \"If they aren't going to do it, who is? From a commercial point of view it is easy to see his point of view but in terms of the future of lending it's a great step back.\" Cable said he had taken measures to open up competition \u2013 such as the creation of the business bank and encouraging challenger banks, with about 20 going through the process of launch this year \u2013 but suggested some other ways to create more credit. \"In the US there is a product called bank in a box \u2013 effectively an off-the-shelf IT framework which enables a new challenger to provide banking services.

    "webTitle": "Stephen Hester takes charge at troubled insurance group RSA", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stephen Hester, the executive who was forced out of the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, is to take charge of the troubled insurer RSA. Hester, a Yorkshire-born banker who has never worked in the insurance industry, will get \u00a31.26m in annual pay and perks as chief executive of RSA, the 304-year old general insurer embroiled in scandal and profit warnings. At RBS Hester was paid \u00a31.2m, but he is far more likely to earn a bonus at the insurer and his total pay package could be worth \u00a35m by next year. As chief executive, Hester is entitled to a bonus of 80% of his annual salary, and could be awarded share options worth up to \u00a32.85m in 2014, and \u00a32.2m in subsequent years, for \"the achievement of stretching performance conditions\" - although they would not be available to collect until 2017. While at RBS Hester bowed to huge political pressure in giving up a \u00a31m bonus in 2012, an issue he later said brought him to the brink of resignation. While his move to RSA was greeted with talk of 'frying pans and fires' on Twitter, the markets gave the appointment the thumbs up: RSA's share price rose almost 3% to 99p. Hester said he was delighted to be asked to lead the insurer, but warned that the group had to do better. \"The challenges of recent months have demonstrated that we have not lived up to our stakeholders' expectations and performed to our true potential. We have an obligation to deliver shareholder value and excellent products and services that provide everyday protection for our customers.\" \"I look forward to getting started immediately and working closely with the board on the business review to ensure that we are able to deliver strength and value to all of our stakeholders and re-emerge as an attractive, solidly performing group.\" RSA, which insured the home of Captain James Cook in the 1760s while he was on his voyage to the new world, issued three profit warnings in the final weeks of 2013 as storms battered the country, raising payouts to householders. Analysts predict that bad weather will cost the insurer \u00a335m. But the storms have been dwarfed by accounting irregularities at RSA's Irish division, which have left it with a \u00a3200m black hole in its finances. Senior executives have been sacked and group chief executive Simon Lee stood down late last year. Hester earned his turnaround spurs at RBS, being drafted in at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 after a \u00a345m bailout left the taxpayer owning 81% of the bank. During his tenure, RBS shed 39,000 jobs \u2013 around one in four of its staff \u2013 and stepped back from complex overseas operations that had contributed to its troubles. Hester's abrupt departure from RBS came last June, as it began to prepare for eventual privatisation. He had been reluctant to stay at RBS for as long as the board wanted, but said he would have preferred to stay longer and see the bank return to private ownership.",

While at RBS Hester bowed to huge political pressure in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16783571\" title=\"\">giving up a \u00a31m bonus in 2012</a>, an issue he later said brought him to the brink of resignation.</p> <p>While his move to RSA was greeted with talk of 'frying pans and fires' on Twitter, the markets gave the appointment the thumbs up: RSA's share price rose almost 3% to 99p.</p> <p>Hester said he was delighted to be asked to lead the insurer, but warned that the group had to do better.</p> <p>\"The challenges of recent months have demonstrated that we have not lived up to our stakeholders' expectations and performed to our true potential. We have an obligation to deliver shareholder value and excellent products and services that provide everyday protection for our customers.\"</p> <p>\"I look forward to getting started immediately and working closely with the board on the business review to ensure that we are able to deliver strength and value to all of our stakeholders and re-emerge as an attractive, solidly performing group.\"</p> <p>RSA, which insured the home of Captain James Cook in the 1760s while he was on his voyage to the new world, issued three profit warnings in the final weeks of 2013 as storms battered the country, raising payouts to householders. Analysts predict that bad weather will cost the insurer \u00a335m. But the storms have been dwarfed by accounting irregularities at RSA's Irish division, which have left it with a \u00a3200m black hole in its finances. Senior executives have been sacked and group chief executive Simon Lee stood down late last year.</p> <p>Hester earned his turnaround spurs at RBS, being drafted in at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 after a \u00a345m bailout left the taxpayer owning 81% of the bank.</p> <p>During his tenure, RBS shed 39,000 jobs \u2013 around one in four of its staff \u2013 and stepped back from complex overseas operations that had contributed to its troubles. Hester's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/12/rbs-ceo-stephen-hester-quits\" title=\"\">abrupt departure from RBS</a> came last June, as it began to prepare for eventual privatisation.

      "bodyText": "Britain's construction firms started the new year with a jump in business as housebuilders enjoyed their strongest growth in more than a decade. The first gauge of activity in the sector for 2014 suggested commercial projects, as well as civil engineering, also experienced a resurgence, growing at the fastest pace since before the financial crisis. But the survey of building firms raised concerns about materials shortages hampering the sector's recovery. The Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI survey posted a headline reading of 64.6 for January, the strongest since August 2007, and comfortably above the 61.5 forecasted in a Reuters poll of economists. The headline figure for December was 62.1. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Against the backdrop of government help for the housing market, residential construction led the surge, with the steepest pick-up in activity since late 2003. The construction sector, which accounts for about 6% of the UK economy, still has a long way to go to make up ground lost during the downturn. But January's upbeat survey will boost hopes that the sector's drag on GDP growth at the end of 2013 was a blip. \"January's survey provides reassurance that the UK construction recovery remains on track,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. \"The latest data show positive developments on a number of fronts, with job creation rebounding at the start of the year while output and new business growth was the fastest since the summer of 2007.\" Markit also said a strengthening economy spurred greater spending on commercial projects in January. But following widespread reports in recent months that brickmaking were delaying some building projects, the survey highlighted that suppliers were still \"struggling to adjust\" to greater demand for construction materials. \"Vendor lead-times were lengthening even before the surge in construction output began last year, and now firms are reporting that cutbacks to capacity have caused supply bottlenecks as demand picks up across the sector,\" said Moore. Despite those worries, firms were at their most confident since September 2009, which in turn supported hiring in January. Higher levels of employment have now been recorded in the sector for eight months in a row \u2013 the longest continuous period of job creation since early 2008. Economists said the survey suggested construction activity would continue to recover. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said the pickup in new orders growth \"augurs well for construction output over the coming months\". \"An extremely strong across the board \u2026 survey for January provides highly compelling evidence that the construction sector's upturn remains intact at the start of 2014,\" he said. The survey compares with the most recent official data estimating construction output dipped 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of 2013. That dragged on overall GDP growth, which eased off to 0.7% in the fourth quarter. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at private bank Berenberg, said the latest construction report and its sister survey on Monday showing that manufacturers continued to grow in January pointed to a return to growth of 0.8% this quarter. \"Low interest rates and government stimulus are evidently driving a very strong construction recovery, which should continue through this year, helping support GDP growth,\" he said. Financial markets are now awaiting Wednesday's PMI survey from Britain's dominant services sector for further clues to the start of 2014.",

And, during the course of a press conference given on the sixth floor of the country\u2019s increasingly drab finance ministry, it was easy to see why. </p> <p>Two years after it first made the request to levy taxes on Greek deposits held at Swiss banks (and at an estimated $47bn dollars it is easy to see why) Athens was told clearly that Switzerland would not be playing ball. </p> <p>Switzerland, said Schlumpf, was willing \u201cto share information and follow up on judicial requests\u201d but it was not willing to compensate Greece for tax income lost on accounts that had been undisclosed in the past. </p> <p>\u201cWe should be moving towards a different direction,\u201d she insisted, describing the imposition of a one-off levy on secret account holders \u2013 as agreed by Switzerland and the UK in 2011 - as being \u201cvery outdated.\u201d</p> <p>Greece has long hoped to come to a similar deal with Stournaras telling reporters: \u201cthe Greek people have made huge sacrifices and we are asking for Switzerland\u2019s help so that Greeks who have untaxed money in Switzerland can also carry some of the burden.\u201d</p> <p>Even now, almost four years after debt-stricken Greece narrowly averted default with the EU, ECB and IMF announcing its first bailout, Geneva continues to remain the favourite destination for rich Greeks stashing their money away. </p> <p>Acutely aware that little has been done to clamp down on the culprits -- publication of the so-called Lagarde list of more than 2,000 suspected tax dodgers has brought little in the way of prosecution -- Stournaras said: \"We continue talks, we insist on our view, we want the British model to apply to us.\u201d</p> <p>(<i>and that's really all for tonight!

Given that we saw a similar bounce in a predominantly risk-off environment this time last week, investors now need only ask one question: do they feel lucky?</p> <p>With several event risks in the form of two central bank meetings, and with the ever-publicised US non-farm payrolls data later this week, equity markets are mainly consolidating before deciding on the next move. The financials, basic material and oil sectors have all ramped up gains, the former being something of a surprise given the level of exposure to emerging markets the majority of European banks hold. BP showed a drop in earnings with its replacement cost-profit declining to $2.8 billion from $3.9 billion a year earlier. BG Group also managed to make gains as bargain hunters looked beyond the losses, believing that the share price has been punished enough.</p> <p>Tech stocks have not held up so well and ARM Holdings stock has plunged owing to one-off charges which contributed to a loss in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>UK manufacturing output may have disappointed yesterday, but this has been almost wholly neutralised by the six-and-a-half-year high seen in construction output in January. The good news is that perhaps housing supply has an inside chance of keeping up with demand, which may help to cool the overheating property market.

The Swiss finance minister has rejected the suggestion that it could agree a one-off deal over secret accounts, as it did with the UK in 2011, to give cash-strapped Greece a much-needed windfall. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The ever-optimistic Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras was uncharacteristically stony-faced after holding talks with his Swiss counterpart Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf. And, during the course of a press conference given on the sixth floor of the country\u2019s increasingly drab finance ministry, it was easy to see why. Two years after it first made the request to levy taxes on Greek deposits held at Swiss banks (and at an estimated $47bn dollars it is easy to see why) Athens was told clearly that Switzerland would not be playing ball. Switzerland, said Schlumpf, was willing \u201cto share information and follow up on judicial requests\u201d but it was not willing to compensate Greece for tax income lost on accounts that had been undisclosed in the past. \u201cWe should be moving towards a different direction,\u201d she insisted, describing the imposition of a one-off levy on secret account holders \u2013 as agreed by Switzerland and the UK in 2011 - as being \u201cvery outdated.\u201d Greece has long hoped to come to a similar deal with Stournaras telling reporters: \u201cthe Greek people have made huge sacrifices and we are asking for Switzerland\u2019s help so that Greeks who have untaxed money in Switzerland can also carry some of the burden.\u201d Even now, almost four years after debt-stricken Greece narrowly averted default with the EU, ECB and IMF announcing its first bailout, Geneva continues to remain the favourite destination for rich Greeks stashing their money away. Acutely aware that little has been done to clamp down on the culprits -- publication of the so-called Lagarde list of more than 2,000 suspected tax dodgers has brought little in the way of prosecution -- Stournaras said: \"We continue talks, we insist on our view, we want the British model to apply to us.\u201d (and that's really all for tonight! GW) European stock markets have closed, with the two biggest indices in the red again. The FTSE 100 extended its recent losing streak, dropping another 16 points to 6449. Smartphone chipmaker ARM did the damage, losing almost 6% after revenues missed forecasts this morning. But some stocks exposed to emerging economies, such as Aberdeen Asset Management and Prudential, did rally. Nick Fletcher's closing market report is here: FTSE slips as Arm drops but Aberdeen leads emerging stocks revival Germany's DAX saw deeper losses, down 58 points or 0.65% to 9127. But the French CAC managed to rise 0.2%. And the Dow is up 87 points, or early 0.6%. Brenda Kelly, chief market strategist at IG, sums up the day: It's turnaround Tuesday, so the FTSE has managed to trim some of its losses by bouncing mildly off its intraday lows. Given that we saw a similar bounce in a predominantly risk-off environment this time last week, investors now need only ask one question: do they feel lucky? With several event risks in the form of two central bank meetings, and with the ever-publicised US non-farm payrolls data later this week, equity markets are mainly consolidating before deciding on the next move. The financials, basic material and oil sectors have all ramped up gains, the former being something of a surprise given the level of exposure to emerging markets the majority of European banks hold. BP showed a drop in earnings with its replacement cost-profit declining to $2.8 billion from $3.9 billion a year earlier. BG Group also managed to make gains as bargain hunters looked beyond the losses, believing that the share price has been punished enough. Tech stocks have not held up so well and ARM Holdings stock has plunged owing to one-off charges which contributed to a loss in the fourth quarter. UK manufacturing output may have disappointed yesterday, but this has been almost wholly neutralised by the six-and-a-half-year high seen in construction output in January. The good news is that perhaps housing supply has an inside chance of keeping up with demand, which may help to cool the overheating property market. It is highly unlikely that better economic data will sway the Bank of England from the current forward guidance scheme tomorrow. And with that, I'm off. Thanks for reading and all the comments. Back tomorrow.... GW George Osborne put the boot into the Yes campaign for Scottish independence this afternoon, saying Bank of England governor Mark Carney had 'demolished' the SNP case and warned that Scots would be hit in the pocket with higher borrowing costs if they quit the UK. The chancellor said: We had to make it clear to gilt investors that a gilt issued by the UK would be honoured by the UK. Otherwise they would start to charge us a higher premium for our debt. But therein lies the clue. The higher premium would be one that would be paid an independent Scotland. In other words, Scottish people would be out of pocket, paying more to the international debt markets. It's another reason why people would be worse off in an independent Scotland. Andy Sparrow's blog has all the quotes. Lloyds has become the latest bank to suspend a foreign exchange dealer over the unfolding investigation into allegations of currency rate fixing. Bloomberg has more details on the move: Martin Chantree, who has worked at the London-based bank for about nine years, was put on leave today while Lloyds holds an investigation, according to the person, who asked not to be identified while the probe continues. \u201cIt is group policy not to comment on individual employees,\u201d Lloyds said in a statement. Chantree didn\u2019t immediately reply to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. Andy Haldane, one of the Bank of England's brightest and most senior officials, has waded into the emerging markets turbulence by warning that certain countries are pursuing 'individual' policies rather than caring about the wider financial system. In a speech delivered in Oxford this afternoon, Haldane said leaders and policymakers had failed to co-ordinate policies in a better way. Reuters is there, and reports: Turmoil in some emerging markets reflects a failure of advanced and developing economies to learn from the financial crisis and coordinate economic policies in a better way, a senior Bank of England official said on Tuesday. \"Individual countries act in their own best interests without taking into account the broader best interest of the financial system as a whole,\" said Andy Haldane, the BoE's executive director for financial stability. \"What is going on with the head-to-head combat is people pursuing policies of individual countries,\" Haldane said in a speech at the University of Oxford.\"What is at stake is the system as a whole,\" he added. The comments come just a few days after India's central bank chief, Raghuram Rajan, said international monetary co-operation has broken down as the Federal Reserve tapered, or slowed, its bond-buying stimulus programme - despite the recent upheaval in emerging markets Haldane's comments are being interpreted as an nudge to the Federal Reserve too: Look who's back -- Stephen Hester, the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, has just been appointed as the new CEO of insurance group RSA. He'll succeed Simon Lee, who quit in December as the insurer posted its third profit warning. Running RSA will be a challenge, given the recent discovery of problems at its Irish division. But I guess it'll be less hassle than cleaning up Fred Goodwin's mess, being lambasted by the media over the Libor scandal and PPI misselling, and apologising for RBS's tech problems. Hester might even get to keep a few bonuses, having surrendered most of his during his time at RBS.... A couple more interesting points from George Osborne -- asked whether the UK recovery is sustainable, he told the Lords economics committee that potential risks include \"the weakness of some eurozone countries\", adding that some US economic data in the last couple of weeks has been \"a little bit soft\". The chancellor added that it's \"also worth having on one's radar the problems in some emerging markets\", as a problem in an emerging market can cause ructions in other parts of the financial system. Osborne also indicated he had little time for the 'secular stagnation' theory being pushed by former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers (with whom Osborne had an entertaining dust-up at Davos). UK chancellor, George Osborne, is being questioned by the House of Lords economic affairs committee now -- he's started by telling their lordships that Britain is leading Europe on shale gas, and denying that the government isn't showing leadership over the issue. It's being streamed live here. Our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action here: George Osborne questioned by Lords economic affairs committee: Politics live blog Here's a flavour: Q: If shale drilling takes off, will that have an impact on gas prices? Osborne says he thinks it will have some impact. But it won't be as dramatic in the US, he suggests. He says the gas market in the UK is more open, and so the gas price in the UK tracks the world price. But if the gas price overall came down, Britain would benefit. Just in -- US factory orders fell by 1.5% in December, which is actually a better result than expected. The decline was mostly due to a big drop in transportation orders - strip that out and orders were up by 0.2%, which may calm fears of a US slowdown (although no promises!) Shares moved a little higher on the news, with the FTSE 100 now up 8 points and the Dow Jones 60 points higher, or 0.4%. Reuters correspondent Blaise Robinson reports that the emerging market wobbles have made some investors appreciate the virtues of good old Europe: Over on Wall Street, shares are inching higher in early trading as investors try to put yesterday's heavy selloff behind them. The Dow Jones index is up 39 points at 15413, +0.3%, with the other indices also slightly higher. Hardly a bounce-back, though after the biggest one-day fall in seven months -- investors may be sitting tight having seen the Asian selloff earlier today, where the Nikkei slumped 4.2% and the Hang Seng fell over 2% into an official correction (10% off its recent peak). Microsoft's new chief executive, Satya Nadella, wins instant brownie points by quoting Oscar Wilde (sort of), in his letter to staff this morning Here's a flavour: What do we do next? To paraphrase a quote from Oscar Wilde \u2014 we need to believe in the impossible and remove the improbable. This starts with clarity of purpose and sense of mission that will lead us to imagine the impossible and deliver it. We need to prioritize innovation that is centered on our core value of empowering users and organizations to \u201cdo more.\u201d We have picked a set of high-value activities as part of our One Microsoft strategy. And with every service and device launch going forward we need to bring more innovation to bear around these scenarios. Next, every one of us needs to do our best work, lead and help drive cultural change. We sometimes underestimate what we each can do to make things happen and overestimate what others need to do to move us forward. We must change this. Finally, I truly believe that each of us must find meaning in our work. The best work happens when you know that it's not just work, but something that will improve other people's lives. This is the opportunity that drives each of us at this company. Many companies aspire to change the world. But very few have all the elements required: talent, resources, and perseverance. Microsoft has proven that it has all three in abundance. And as the new CEO, I can\u2019t ask for a better foundation. [end] \u2022 - the actual Wilde quote is \"Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the improbable\" (see Collins Dictionary).... ....Not to be confused with Conan Doyle's \"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth\". The long search for Microsoft's next chief executive is over - with the software giant announcing that (as rumoured) Satya Nadella will take the helm. Nadella had been running Microsoft's cloud and enterprise computing division, and will succeed Steve Ballmer to become only the third CEO in the company's history. In another switch, Bill Gates is shifting from the chairman's role to become 'technology advisor' -- meaning he'll spend more time with the company's staff. Nadella faces a tough task, given Microsoft's loss of influence as the technology world in the post-PC world. In a video message, Gates said Nadella is the \"tough leader\" the company needs. In it, Gates declares that \"The opportunity for Microsoft is greater than ever before\", from making Office more interactive to perhaps building a new Cloud platform to connect to \"all sorts of different devices\". Speaking of the Anglo Irish Bank trial, here is a mural of the busted financial institution's uncompleted HQ that never was, down in Dublin's docklands. The painting comes complete with images of the tapes that recorded some Anglo executives laughing, joking and even singing about how Irish and German taxpayers were going to rescue themselves and their bank from the abyss. This anti-Anglo Irish Bank image close to the iconic Ha'penny Bridge on the river Liffey is a 15 minute stroll north towards the criminal courthouse where some of the other Anglo Irish executives stand trial tomorrow morning (from Sean O'Neil and Henry McDonald). The price of Brent crude oil has dropped through the trading session, as this week's disappointing US and Chinese manufacturing surveys suggested weaker demand for energy. Brent is currently down 0.4 of a cent per barrel at $105.6. After reporting falling profits this morning, BP has also waded into the issue of Scottish independence by warning that the issue raises \"big uncertainties\". Speaking to the BBC this morning, Bob Dudley said he was concerned by the \"question mark\" over whether an independent Scotland would keep the pound. He said: \ufeff\"We have a lot of people in Scotland. We have a lot of investments in Scotland. My personal view is that Great Britain is great and it ought to stay together.\" Last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that an independent Scotland would have to give up some control over fiscal policies if it wanted to keep using sterling. Over in Ireland, a petrol bomb attack was launched at the company once run by the country's former richest man, Sean Quinn, last night - a day before the start of a huge trial into the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank. The attack brought down telephone and broadband links around the headquarters in County Fermanagh, cutting of around 200 people (there's a photo here). Our Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, reports: Ireland's one-time richest man Sean Quinn is one of 800 people who is scheduled to give evidence in Dublin at one of the biggest financial crime trials in European history. Ex-billionaire Quinn became bankrupt after borrowing billions from the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank when he started to play the global property casino. Quinn's gamble spectacularly backfired after the world property crash left him owing billions and resulted in him losing control of his other businesses. The case against three senior Anglo Irish Bank executives begins on Wednesday morning at Dublin's Central Criminal Court and could last up to six months (here's our preview) Ahead of what will eventually be a momentous day when Sean Quinn finally gets called to the witness box, the former tycoon has other worries today about his old business base in Co.Fermanagh. Two petrol bombs were thrown close to the headquarters of the former Quinn family business on the Ballyconnell Road in Derrylin close to the border with the Irish Republic. The damage done last night has cut off phone and broadband coverage in the rural area where Quinn was once king. The petrol bomb attack is the latest in a string of incidents where properties belonging to the Quinn family were damaged. Last month, a bus was set on fire at the entrance to three of its businesses in Rakeelan, Ballyconnell, across the border in County Cavan. In December, a fuel tanker was set on fire after being driven into the former headquarters of the Quinn Group in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. It was renamed Aventas last November. HMcD Two small earth tremors in 2011 haven't deterred shale gas firm Cuadrilla with pushing on with its fracking activities in the picturesque Lancashire countryside. Cuadrilla announced this morning it would dig up to eight wells at two sites in the county - at Roseacre Wood, near Elswick, and to the west of the delightfully named village of Little Plumpton. From our environment desk, Adam Vaughan reports that Cuadrilla is promising to be a good neighbour as it blasts the bedrock with high-pressure fluids to release gas. However, Friends of the Earth's north-west campaigner, Helen Rimmer, said: \"These plans will be met by stiff opposition from local people rightly concerned about having the UK's first attempted multiple-well fracking operation under their feet. Cuadrilla claims to be a good neighbour, but it still hasn't cleared up the mess from the botched fracking operation that caused earth tremors only a few miles from one of the proposed sites.\" Here are the key quotes from the FCA's Martin Wheatley to MPs this morning, on its investigation into allegations that foreign exchange rates have been rigged by traders: \"I would be surprised if we got to conclusions within this year. I hope that we will next year. \"We are still in the investigation phase ... The allegations are every bit as bad as they have been with Libor,\" Back in parliament the head of the City watchdog, Martin Wheatley, has told MPs that claims that foreign exchange traders collaborated to fix currency bench markets are just as serious as the Libor rate-rigging scandal. Wheatley said the Financial Conduct Authority was taking allegation of FX benchmark-rigging very seriously, calling them \"every bit as bad\" as the Libor affair. He said the allegations had cast doubt on the reliability of foreign exchange rates, and also said the regulator is probing other benchmarks..... However, he wouldn't give clear details about how the FCA investigation was proceeding -- and indicated we might not get results until 2015, or even later. Many major banks have suspended foreign exchange traders since the news broke last autumn that the daily 'fixes' (which determine the official exchange rate between currencies) could have been manipulated. HSBC and Citigroup both suspended traders last month. After yesterday's 326-point tumble, the Dow Jones industrial average is expected to stagger back off the mat with a small rise when trading resumes later today. David Madden, market analyst at IG, says the Asian tumble and the prospect of another US debt ceiling fight continues to cast a shadow over the City. \ufeffStocks are offside, but holding up relatively well considering the massive selloff in Japan overnight as fears over emerging-market exposure echoed around the world. Traders are treading lightly, not wanting to get stung if there is a sudden exodus from equities into cash or bonds. The US debt-ceiling deadline is approaching again and, as on the past two occasions, dealers are anticipating downgrade speculation and a slide in stocks. BP is still suffering from the Gulf of Mexico disaster, and the oil titan's asset-stripping programme may be topping up the compensation pool but is it is taking its toll on production levels. Ocado's deal with Morrisons helped to increase the former's revenue, but was not enough to stop it delivering a loss for 2013. The FTSE 100 is currently down 27 points, but there are deeper losses in Germany where the DAX has dropped 100 points, or 1.1%. The Treasury Select Committee is grilling the Financial Conduct Authority's John Griffith-Jones and Martin Wheatley about the regulator's performance since taking over from the FSA. My colleague Sean Farrell is following events: Greek cleaning staff are protesting outside the finance ministry in Athens today ahead of a meeting with Switzerland's finance minister to discuss tax evasion. The Greek government is hoping to recover some of the estimated $42bn hidden in Swiss bank accounts by Greek citizens, our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, reports. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras and his Swiss counterpart, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf are expected to give a press conference later, and tax evasion will be on the agenda. Greek newspaper Kathimerini has more details: Widmer-Schlumpf said on January 25 in Davos that she will discuss Greek assets held with Swiss banks at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. Talks on the issue have stalled since 2012 and progress toward an agreement would provide a boost for the Greek government. \u201cIf this were achieved, it would be a gesture that shows the government wants to move toward a catharsis,\u201d said George Tzogopoulos, a research fellow at the Athens-based Hellenic Foundation for European &amp; Foreign Policy. \u201cFor public opinion, tax evasion continues to be a problem. An agreement would show that it is determined to deal with the problem.\u201d The strong UK construction data sent the pound rallying, up 0.4 of a cent against the US dollar at 1.634. It also sparked a small revival in the City, with the FTSE 100 now down just 8 points at 6457. Upmarket grocery chain Ocado remains a big faller, though, down 4.5% after reporting yet another pre-tax loss of \u00a312.5m, and announcing that one of its founders, Jason Gissing, is leaving. Here's the story: Ocado founder to leave this year amid rising sales My colleague Sean Farrell tweeted the highlights of Ocado's morning conference call too: Jeremy Cook of World First also flags up the warning that building firms may struggle to get their hands on supplies; Suppliers cannot fill demand as quickly as they get it, which could lead to a rise in costs. For now we will look at it as a natural brake on output. As that earlier graph showed, all three areas of construction reported a strong January. House building remains the hottest area, though -- with growth at the highest level in a decade years. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, says construction started 2014 in \"formidable fashion\". He's worried, though, that the building industry's supply chain could be stretched...\uf0a7 The one area which is beginning to be a concern is the ongoing pressure on suppliers to meet the rush in demand. As the industry\u2019s lifeblood, suppliers are still recovering from the recession, and until they get back to full capacity, the continued lengthening of delivery times may become a restraining force on the sector in the coming months.\u201d Our economics reporter, Katie Allen, wrote last month that British brickmakers are working flat-out to meet orders as the construction recovery picks up. It's a great read: UK brickmakers straining to meet rising demand Martin Warner is standing on a pile of nearly one and a half million bricks, stacked several metres high in a vast open shed. Below him pipes of natural gas pump flames into the stack, lighting a fire that will burn day and night for 17 days to bake the bricks at 1080 degrees Celsius, sending the stench of sulphur into the air in billows of steam. When the whole shed has been set alight, the glowing bricks are left to cool off for a further two weeks. The gas flames are moved on to the next shed, where more \"green bricks\", moulded from clay are being stacked ready to be fired..... Activity in the UK construction sector in January has smashed forecasts by growing at its fastest rate since before the financial crisis began, a survey just released shows. In a sign that the British economic recovery continues, data firm Markit's monthly PMI jumped to 64.6 last month, driven by a surge in new work - up from December's 62.1. That shows strong growth, and is the most rapid monthly expansion since August 2007 - the month before the credit crunch struck. Markit reported that construction firms hired more workers during January, for the eighth month running. It also flagged up anecdotal evidence that the recent economic recovery, and \"greater access to finance among clients\" had led to more new business. Confidence about the year-ahead outlook was the most positive since September 2009, it added. All the sub-sectors of construction - house-building, commercial property construction, and civil engineering - all saw rising activity, as this graph shows: Last week's GDP data had shown that the UK construction sector shrank slightly in the final three months of 2013. This survey may show that activity bounced back in January. Tim Moore, Markit Economist, said the survey provides reassurance that the UK construction recovery remains on track. The latest data show positive developments on a number of fronts, with job creation rebounding at the start of the year while output and new business growth was the fastest since the summer of 2007. Housing activity growth now stands at its strongest for just over a decade, boosted by growing demand for new homes and improving confidence within the UK property market. Meanwhile, strengthening domestic economic conditions spurred greater spending on commercial projects in January. A sharp rise in civil engineering activity completed an impressive showing from all three sub-categories of construction monitored by the survey. In the corporate world, BP has hiked the total cost of its 2011 Deepwater Horizon oil spill by another $200m, to $42.7bn. But as energy editor Terry Macalister reports, the full bill could be even higher: The latest tally does not take account of additional provisions for economic loss claims from a further legal settlement it has made, the group said. BP is also waiting for a final US court decision over whether it was considered grossly negligent for the Deepwater Horizon accident. That could add over $20bn to the final bill because it would bring cash penalties under the Clean Water Act. Eleven workers were killed when the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2011, triggering a catastrophic oil leak which caused one of America's worst environmental disasters. BP's Deepwater Horizon bill rises $200m as profits fall Overnight, the Reserve Bank of Australia became the latest central bank to tweak its monetary stance. While the RBA voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 2.5%, it dropped its previous suggestions that it might ease policy in future months (ie cut rates). Today's statement said \"the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.\" The RBA also dropped its previous warning that the Australian dollar was uncomfortably high, which had also been seen as hinting at a cut in borrowing costs. More here: Reserve Bank of Australia holds interest rates steady Hong Kong's Hang Seng index has followed the Nikkei into correction territory today, after tumbling by almost 2.9% in its biggest daily selloff in 18 months. Investors hit the sell button with gusto on their first day back after the Lunar New Year holiday, wiping 637 points off the Hang Seng. This means the index has dropped more than 10% since its recent peak on 2nd December, the official definition of a correction (the Nikkei got there yesterday) Asian markets are mostly bathed in red today as this screengrab shows: Asian investors have been spooked by the latest economic surveys from China, which showed a slowdown in January: Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank, comments: \ufeff\"True, there are distortions related to the timing of Lunar New Year, and a pollution and corruption crackdown by Beijing, but the message is still that we are seeing slower growth.\" Spain's unemployment total has risen again, but the country's government insists that the situation is improving. The number of people out of work rose by 113,097 in January, ending three months of declines, pushing the total out of work to 4,814,43. That dashed hopes of another fall - but the Labour ministry points out that unemployment invariably goes up in January. And on a seasonally adjusted terms, Spanish unemployment did decrease by 3,907 people in January. This is the sixth consecutive monthly fall in the seasonally-adjusted total , for the first time since 2007. Spain's secretary of state for employment, Engracia Hidalgo, says in this statement that the data confirms that Spain's labour market is stabilizing. European stock markets are down in early trading, following those deep losses in Asia overnight. The FTSE 100 has dropped 40 points, or 0.6%, to 6426, led by Arm Holdings. The smartphone chipmaker has dropped over 4% after reporting disappointing financial results this morning, less than a week after Apple (a key customer for ARM) also missed expectations. ARM did grow profits by 19%, but admitted that sales of some high-end chips had slowed. The other main European markets are down around 0.5%-0.6% in early trading. Analysts at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole reckons the turbulence will continue for a while, telling clients that: \ufeff\"Investors should steer clear of risk assets over the short term as the turmoil does not look like it will be over anytime soon.\" The Nikkei has now fallen by 14% in barely a month, as Japan's stock market felt the full force of the recent selloff. It shed another 610 points this morning as it dropped over 4% to 14,008 - with only two companies defying the selloff. A clutch of heavyweight manufacturers, from Japan Steel Works to Sharp, all fell at least 8% during the day. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and the business world. European stock markets are heading for further falls this morning after another rout in Asia overnight send markets to fresh lows, leaving Japan's Nikkei in its worst slump since last June. Nagging fears over an emerging market crisis, and worries that the US economy has hit a rut, are haunting the markets. The Nikkei just slumped to a 4.2% loss, sliding deeper into an official correction, in a nervy selloff, following the Dow Jones's 300 point tumble last night. Every Asian index is in the red (excluding those closed for the Chinese lunar New Year). South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 1.7%, while the Australian S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 1.8%. Yesterday, Wall Street had been hit by a weak ISM manufacturing survey from the ISM, and concern that Washington faces another battle over the debt ceiling. Treasury secretary Jack Lew is demanding action \"very soon\" -- with a fresh warning on Monday that America is running out of time to raise its borrowing limits. Over in Melbourne, Chris Weston of IG reports that: \ufeff\"The market feels like it's been hit by a freight train and traders are asking what exactly is going on. What started out as a profit taking exercise has steamrolled into something far more substantial.\" Here's the early spreadbetters' forecasts: FTSE100: to open 43 points lower at 6,424 DAX: to open 89 points lower at 9,098 CAC40: to open 34 points lower at 4,074 The yen continues to strengthen against the dollar - undermining Tokyo's efforts to stimulate inflation. Traders have also moved money out of stocks and into safer bonds, pushing down the yield (interest rate) on US Treasuries to its lowest level since early November. The irony for European policymakers is that this selloff comes just as the eurozone looks a little brighter, and as the UK recovery continues. Yesterday we saw encouraging manufacturing surveys from most eurozone countries (although not France) - there must be concerns that this long-awaited recovery is knocked off course by events elsewhere. We get new economic data shortly - the latest Spanish unemployment data (around 8am), and January's survey of UK construction (9.30am GMT). I'll be tracking all the main action through the day.",

Appearing before the Treasury select committee, Martin Wheatley said: \"These investigations are not public but there are a number of other benchmarks, London being the centre it is, that operate in London that we are investigating because of concerns raised with us.\" Wheatley declined to say which benchmarks the FCA had added to its list of investigations until it had decided whether there was a case to answer. The regulator has fined banks heavily for rigging Libor, the London interbank offered rate that is used to price more than $300trillion (\u00a3184tn) of financial products across the world from household mortgages to business loans. A partner at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, Jonathan Herbst, said: \"This is a very hot topic for the FCA.

Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS are among banks in talks with the FCA about possible wrongdoing though no formal accusations have been made. MPs questioned Wheatley and his chairman, John Griffith-Jones, about a wide range of misconduct by banks but particularly their continued abuse of customers. Wheatley agreed with Labour MP John Mann that Britain had seen \"the biggest series of quantifiable wrongdoing in the history of our financial services industry\" and said he could not think of another industry that had an equivalent record. The FCA fined Lloyds Banking Group \u00a328m in December for putting staff under pressure to sell products customers did not want or face demotion and pay cuts. Wheatley said the FCA was examining Lloyds' proposed bonuses for 2013 and said there would be deductions from senior managers who encouraged staff to sell \u00a32bn of inappropriate products.

In Norway, there have been complaints that it is no longer really a Norwegian airline. \"We don't give a shit about that. We go where the passengers go.

    "webTitle": "Arm shares drop 5% after slowdown in smartphone sales hits royalties", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Chip designer leads the FTSE fallers as markets continues to slide after weak US data", 
      "body": "<p>As markets continue their slide after being spooked by poor US data on Monday, chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> is leading the fallers.</p> <p>The highly rated company, whose technology is used by major companies like Apple and Samsung, missed expectations for its fourth quarter royalty revenues. It blamed a slowdown in smartphone growth - its designs are in the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S4 - for a shortfall in its royalties. These rose 7% to $130.4m but were lower than analyst forecasts of around $138m.</p> <p>Both Apple and Samsung reported lower than expected sales over the festive period, fuelling fears that the top-end smartphone market may have reached saturation point. Arm said:</p> <blockquote> Arm's 2013 processor royalty revenue grew faster than the overall semiconductor industry by 18 percentage points...although the degree of outperformance was impacted by slower sales of chips for high-end smartphones in the second half of the year. <br> Arm's strategy is for our technology to continue to gain share in long-term growth markets, such as smartphones, tablets, enterprise equipment and embedded computing, and to increase the royalty percentage Arm receives from each device.  Arm saw good progress in the fourth quarter as our latest technology was chosen by major companies in all our target markets...These design wins will help to drive Arm's future royalty revenues. </blockquote> <p>Overall, full year revenues rose 24% to \u00a3714.6m and profits were up 32% to \u00a3364m. But the slowdown fears have sent its shares down 44p or nearly 5% to 886p. Analysts at Liberum repeated their long standing sell recommendation:</p> <blockquote> Arm's processor royalties came in 6% below our forecast on the back of the on-going slowdown in high-end smartphone shipments. This weakness was compensated by processor licensing which was 11% ahead, taking overall sales 2% ahead of our forecasts at \u00a3189.1m. <br> However, as we have argued before we no longer think licensing is necessarily a driver of future royalties for Arm given that many licensees are just new entrants into already crowded markets such as smartphones. Operating expenses were higher than expected showing again that Arm is being forced to increase spending to compete effectively. Earnings per share of \u00a35.31 is 1% below our forecast. Overall these results will continue to stoke fears of a further slowdown in Arm's royalty trends.  We forecast processor royalties and overall earnings below current market expectations in coming years. The stock is expensive versus its longer term earnings growth outlook. </blockquote> <p>But Julian Yates at Investec was still a buyer, saying:</p> <blockquote> We see the long term investment outlook as highly attractive, with the strong licence results suggesting good growth in royalties ahead. Once the royalty outlook and foreign exchange has been fully digested, we would see any weakness as a good buying opportunity. We retain our buy and 2017 estimated royalty-driven 1100p target price. <br> </blockquote> <p>With fears of problems in emerging markets after the US Federal Reserve continued to trim its monthly bond buying programme, a survey on Monday showing that new orders in the US had slumped was not the news nervous investors wanted to hear.</p> <p>So after a 2% fall on Wall Street and heavy declines in Asia - the Japanese market has now lost 14% in around a month - the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dropped 25.18 points to 6440.48. Worries about the latest US budget battle - with a deal needing to be settled by 7 February - have added to the nerves. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> The global rout continues with heavy US equity losses (worst since June) following a big ISM Manufacturing data miss which stoked fears of a US slowdown and a warning from US Treasury Secretary Lew about avoiding another debt ceiling pantomime which added to the existing emerging markets (equities and foreign exchange) pressure from the worries of taper-induced outflows, political unrest and a slowing the world's number two economy China. <br> After the US close, the Fed's Fisher reiterated his \"financial market declines\" do not change [the central bank's] taper decision, with their focus being on the real economy. </blockquote> <p>Among the rises <strong>Anglo American</strong> has added 29p to \u00a31426 as its platinum business moved back into profit, although fresh strikes in South Africa could threaten the recovery.</p> <p><strong>J Sainsbury</strong> has risen 6.5p to 352p after Bernstein analysts moved from market perform to outperform. They said:</p> <blockquote> Consumers know why they shop at Sainsbury's: quality food, sourced with integrity, priced at a premium, combined with Tesco matching prices on branded products. Its distinctive offer, great store execution and a good format mix drove positive like for likes for the past 36 quarters and will continue to take market share from undifferentiated retailers (Tesco, Morrison).

      "bodyText": "As markets continue their slide after being spooked by poor US data on Monday, chip designer Arm is leading the fallers. The highly rated company, whose technology is used by major companies like Apple and Samsung, missed expectations for its fourth quarter royalty revenues. It blamed a slowdown in smartphone growth - its designs are in the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S4 - for a shortfall in its royalties. These rose 7% to $130.4m but were lower than analyst forecasts of around $138m. Both Apple and Samsung reported lower than expected sales over the festive period, fuelling fears that the top-end smartphone market may have reached saturation point. Arm said: Arm's 2013 processor royalty revenue grew faster than the overall semiconductor industry by 18 percentage points...although the degree of outperformance was impacted by slower sales of chips for high-end smartphones in the second half of the year. Arm's strategy is for our technology to continue to gain share in long-term growth markets, such as smartphones, tablets, enterprise equipment and embedded computing, and to increase the royalty percentage Arm receives from each device. Arm saw good progress in the fourth quarter as our latest technology was chosen by major companies in all our target markets...These design wins will help to drive Arm's future royalty revenues. Overall, full year revenues rose 24% to \u00a3714.6m and profits were up 32% to \u00a3364m. But the slowdown fears have sent its shares down 44p or nearly 5% to 886p. Analysts at Liberum repeated their long standing sell recommendation: Arm's processor royalties came in 6% below our forecast on the back of the on-going slowdown in high-end smartphone shipments. This weakness was compensated by processor licensing which was 11% ahead, taking overall sales 2% ahead of our forecasts at \u00a3189.1m. However, as we have argued before we no longer think licensing is necessarily a driver of future royalties for Arm given that many licensees are just new entrants into already crowded markets such as smartphones. Operating expenses were higher than expected showing again that Arm is being forced to increase spending to compete effectively. Earnings per share of \u00a35.31 is 1% below our forecast. Overall these results will continue to stoke fears of a further slowdown in Arm's royalty trends. We forecast processor royalties and overall earnings below current market expectations in coming years. The stock is expensive versus its longer term earnings growth outlook. But Julian Yates at Investec was still a buyer, saying: We see the long term investment outlook as highly attractive, with the strong licence results suggesting good growth in royalties ahead. Once the royalty outlook and foreign exchange has been fully digested, we would see any weakness as a good buying opportunity. We retain our buy and 2017 estimated royalty-driven 1100p target price. With fears of problems in emerging markets after the US Federal Reserve continued to trim its monthly bond buying programme, a survey on Monday showing that new orders in the US had slumped was not the news nervous investors wanted to hear. So after a 2% fall on Wall Street and heavy declines in Asia - the Japanese market has now lost 14% in around a month - the FTSE 100 has dropped 25.18 points to 6440.48. Worries about the latest US budget battle - with a deal needing to be settled by 7 February - have added to the nerves. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: The global rout continues with heavy US equity losses (worst since June) following a big ISM Manufacturing data miss which stoked fears of a US slowdown and a warning from US Treasury Secretary Lew about avoiding another debt ceiling pantomime which added to the existing emerging markets (equities and foreign exchange) pressure from the worries of taper-induced outflows, political unrest and a slowing the world's number two economy China. After the US close, the Fed's Fisher reiterated his \"financial market declines\" do not change [the central bank's] taper decision, with their focus being on the real economy. Among the rises Anglo American has added 29p to \u00a31426 as its platinum business moved back into profit, although fresh strikes in South Africa could threaten the recovery. J Sainsbury has risen 6.5p to 352p after Bernstein analysts moved from market perform to outperform. They said: Consumers know why they shop at Sainsbury's: quality food, sourced with integrity, priced at a premium, combined with Tesco matching prices on branded products. Its distinctive offer, great store execution and a good format mix drove positive like for likes for the past 36 quarters and will continue to take market share from undifferentiated retailers (Tesco, Morrison). Despite this strength all events, even opposing events, are used as a reason to drive down Sainsbury's share price: 'Tesco going down market with a price war is bad for Sainsbury', 'Tesco going upmarket is bad for Sainsbury', ... as if Sainsbury wasn't in control of its own destiny. We retain a target price of \u00a34.30 but due to unwarranted drop in share price we upgrade our rating to outperform. Banks moved higher after recent weakness, with Lloyds Banking Group 0.75p better at 80.74p and HSBC up 6.3p at 627.8p. Among the mid-caps Ocado has dropped 19.5p to 504p after its losses increased from \u00a30.6m to \u00a312.5m and it said co-founder Jason Gissing would leave the company after May's annual meeting.",

      "bodyText": "Four executive directors at Ocado will enjoy a \u00a35.5m share bonus this year despite revealing widening losses at the online grocer on Tuesday. Jason Gissing, Ocado's commercial director and co-founder, will not share in the bumper bonus after announcing his intention to leave the company in May to spend more time with his four children and to work on environmental and social causes. He owns a 2.95% stake in Ocado worth about \u00a390m. Gissing's exit leaves only chief executive Tim Steiner of the three former Goldman Sachs bankers who founded the online grocery firm 14 years ago. Gissing leaves Ocado on a relative high after strong Christmas sales and the successful launch of its distribution deal with Morrisons. The shares have risen five-fold in the last year as investors believe the deal to run the supermarket's online operation has transformed Ocado's prospects. However, shares in the company dipped 2.6% to 510p on Tuesday as Ocado, which has never made a pretax profit, revealed pretax losses had deepened to \u00a312.5m in the year to last December from \u00a30.6m in 2012 despite a 17.2% rise in gross sales. \"We struggle to think what the annual incentives would have been if Ocado had made a profit,\" said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. The company insisted it was on track to move into the black in 2014. Steiner said: \"Analysts are expecting us to make a profit this year and that's what we think is going to happen.\" He added: \"The stakeholders in this business, some of which own a large chunk, are not focused on 2014 profitability they are focused on 2020 and 2030. They want to position for the long term, if that delays or reduces profitability now that's what they are focused on.\" Gissing, Steiner and Jonathan Faiman founded Ocado in 2000 at the peak of the dotcom boom. Gissing, a former member of the Bullingdon Club at the University of Oxford, served as Ocado finance director for 10 years but has concentrated on employee relations, pricing, buying and corporate responsibility matters since 2010. Steiner said Gissing, who earned \u00a3330,000 in 2012, had resigned and would receive no payoff. \"Jason will be paid as normal. There is no funny money for the boys. We haven't made him resign or fired him and he is not entitled to a severance payment and nor would he want one.\" Steiner said he expects more deals with partner retailers in the next few years, although nothing short term, and were working on technology to expand internationally but that no deal was imminent. He said building up the Morrisons operation was the main job for this year and that they expected to open a third giant warehouse in 2014. Ocado also expects to open a second specialist non-food site this year and a couple next year with health &amp; beauty, home and kitchenware and babycare items likely to be top of the list. These are more likely to be standalone businesses than tie-ups with a partner. Steiner said the UK grocery market was at an \"inflexion point\" with shoppers moving online rapidly, as demonstrated by Ocado's sales and the rise in supermarket internet sales over Christmas. But he said Ocado's lead on service and accuracy was unmatchable because it had invested while the big supermarkets were slow off the mark. \"If one of them had a time machine and went back 10 years and decided to focus on this they could catch us up. They ridiculed us and have found themselves behind in a very important part of the market.\" But some analysts remain sceptical about the market's newfound enthusiasm for Ocado. John Ibbotson, an analyst at the consultancy Retail Vision, said he thought Ocado would struggle to turn a profit. \"Despite these results, I suspect the Ocado share price will keep on rising, fuelled by speculation that Amazon or Boots will buy it for its state-of-the-art technology, or that it can license its technology to others abroad. It's all wishful thinking and has echoes of the dotcom boom,\" he said.",

Lew's comment's followed disappointing manufacturing figures for January which combined to knock over 200 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average by noon. The Dow has fallen close to 5% since its all time high at the end of the year, dropping in part on fears that China's growth is slowing and amid signs of more economic woes in emerging markets.</p> <p>There was stringer manufacturing data in Europe, where Greece's factory sector was shown to have finally returned to growth for the first time in more than four years, fuelling hopes that the country's long slump could be easing.</p> <p>The news of rising orders and activity for Greece's manufacturers came amid evidence of a manufacturing recovery continuing in much of the eurozone.</p> <p>In the US, by contrast, manufacturing growth, almost ground to a halt as new orders dried up, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).</p> <p>That slowdown was in contrast to a report showing that in January, Greek manufacturers finally reported their first expansion since August 2009.

      "bodyText": "Janet Yellen was sworn in as the first woman to head the Federal Reserve Monday, ascending to the top job at the central bank at a time when the US economic recovery was rocked by fresh worries about manufacturing and the debt ceiling. Her first day of the job started as Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned \"time is short\" to solve the US's latest budget battle, with a new deal supposed to be agreed before February 7. Lew's comment's followed disappointing manufacturing figures for January which combined to knock over 200 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average by noon. The Dow has fallen close to 5% since its all time high at the end of the year, dropping in part on fears that China's growth is slowing and amid signs of more economic woes in emerging markets. There was stringer manufacturing data in Europe, where Greece's factory sector was shown to have finally returned to growth for the first time in more than four years, fuelling hopes that the country's long slump could be easing. The news of rising orders and activity for Greece's manufacturers came amid evidence of a manufacturing recovery continuing in much of the eurozone. In the US, by contrast, manufacturing growth, almost ground to a halt as new orders dried up, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). That slowdown was in contrast to a report showing that in January, Greek manufacturers finally reported their first expansion since August 2009. The revival in peripheral countries saw Europe's manufacturing sector enjoy its strongest expansion in almost three years, according to the eurozone Manufacturing PMI survey by data company Markit. British manufacturers also benefited from the nascent recovery in the eurozone, their biggest export market, with Markit's UK survey showing growth in overseas orders hit a three-year high in January. The responses from Greek factories signalled an increase in new orders and higher exports last month, although manufacturers continued to trim their workforces. Economists said the long-awaited recovery in Greek manufacturing boosted hopes the overall economy will finally stop shrinking this year. The area's largest economy, Germany, led the new year's manufacturing march, but Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland and Greece also expanded. France, however, continued to lag behind the rest of the eurozone.

The Greek PMI's rise above 50 for the first time since August 2009 is an important signal of how even the most troubled member states are returning to growth.\" The UK survey signalled manufacturers took on new staff at a faster pace as they enjoyed a jump in new orders from home and abroad. But the rapid recovery in overall factory activity eased off, with the headline reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI easing to 56.7 in January from 57.2 in December.
