      "bodyText": "Ignore, for the moment, the rights and wrongs of Pfizer's attempt to buy AstraZeneca. This column's view was made clear last week: the US group is untrustworthy, its proposal rests on a dubious tax arbitrage and UK interests are threatened. In short, the deal stinks. But will it happen? A hard-headed assessment a week ago might have put the probability at 90%. Might prevails nine times out of 10, even when national tempers are inflamed. Kraft bagged Cadbury in 2010 and, most famously, Vodafone squeezed Mannesmann so hard in 2000 that the board of the German telecoms group ran out of breath to resist. That is how the game is played. The odds are stacked in favour of the bidder because fund managers, with very few exceptions, like instant gratification. They are happy to sign any number of declarations about their long-term duties of stewardship. They may even agree that most hostile bids end up destroying value. But when there's a whiff of \"jam today\", most salivate. A week ago Pfizer chief executive Ian Read will have been confident the plot was running his way. He thought he had squared David Cameron with a few vague pledges about Pfizer's commitment to research and development in the UK. The prime minister had described the assurances as \"robust\" even though Read had included the mighty get-out that Pfizer could change its mind should circumstances change. Better still for Read, his opening pitch for AstraZeneca \u2013 \u00a350 a share in cash and paper \u2013 had prompted a few AstraZeneca shareholders to mutter about the attractions of a deal at a higher price. That is what the Pfizer camp wanted to hear: \u00a350 was always a non-starter; the aim was to encourage fund managers to debate the terms of surrender. The figure being kicked around was \u00a355. A week on, though, the story looks less simple. Cameron and his cabinet are suddenly all over the place. The prime minister now declares himself \"not satisfied\" with the assurances and wants more. Business secretary Vince Cable talks vaguely about a public interest test. Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Miliband has woken up, understood there is a threat to UK science and is arguing (rightly) for just such a public interest investigation. The scientists are up in arms. Sir David Barnes, former AstraZeneca boss, caught the mood best when he called Pfizer a \"praying mantis\" on account of its grim record of cutting research and development after acquisitions. Sir Richard Sykes, former GlaxoSmithKline boss, cuts a lonely figure as a supporter of the bid. Swedish politicians talk bitterly about Pfizer's broken promises after buying Pharmacia. US politicians are also unhappy as they contemplate the threat to the US tax system if companies follow Pfizer's plan to move its tax domicile to the UK via a so-called \"inversion\". The US rules allow such a soft-shoe shuffle on tax if shareholders in the non-US company end up with at least 20% of the new entity. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate finance committee, wants to raise the bar to 50% immediately. \"Corporations must understand that they won't profit from abandoning the US,\" he wrote in yesterday's Wall Street Journal. The tax inversion, though, is a \"key driver\" of Read's pitch to AstraZeneca. But Read's biggest problem is the apparent lack of enthusiasm for the adventure among his own shareholders. By mid-afternoon on Friday, Pfizer's shares had fallen 7% since the proposal was published, meaning its \u00a350 offer in cash and paper was now worth a shade under \u00a348. Imagine if Pfizer's investors were gung-ho and confident in Read's ability to deliver. In that case, the share price might have overcome Monday's soggy set of first-quarter results and risen 7%, instead of falling. The proposal would then be worth about \u00a352.50. Pushing on to \u00a355, and beyond, would look a breeze: just improve the terms a bit and let a rising Pfizer share price carry AstraZeneca's valuation higher. As it is, AstraZeneca's shares closed yesterday at \u00a346.05, suggesting the market has doubts about Pfizer's ability to offer \u00a355. Is \u00a355 the right figure anyway? Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive, talked up the wonders in prospect in his group's drugs pipeline this week. His presentation was long on optimism, but maybe \u00a360 is the price at which AstraZeneca's board would feel compelled to cave in. That's another old rule of takeovers: the target, even if it was considered dull a year ago, can sparkle under the spotlight of a bid. And, actually, the AstraZeneca board would have good reason to demand a comfort premium in any deal involving Pfizer shares. A takeover could not be completed until the end of this year at the earliest because the European commission and, probably, the Chinese competition authorities will study it. A lot can happen in six months, as Publicis and Omnicom have just shown by abandoning their merger. That is the tricky backdrop for Read as he faces two parliamentary select committees this week. He would desperately like to dim the political noise, but what does he say? Cameron's new stance implies Pfizer has to give harder pledges on investment and jobs in the UK. But if Read offers legally binding guarantees his shareholders may wonder if he has lost control of events. Read is also constrained in what he can say by UK Takeover Panel rules. On the other hand, he'll come across as a chancer if he says \"I can't comment\" for two hours. In the wider picture, Pfizer still has big cards to play. Its aces are the tax savings and the scope for cost cuts. The sums would run into billions of dollars a year and Read is calculating that fund managers, once they've glimpsed the prize, will insist on receiving it. And 14 of AstraZeneca's top-20 institutional investors also own Pfizer shares. Read will also know that pulling out of the scrap could wreck his career. Assembling an army of investment bankers, launching an unsolicited \u00a363bn bid and creating a storm on both sides of the Atlantic is not an everyday undertaking. Once you've started, you don't retreat at the first sign of trouble. Indeed, as with Kraft and Vodafone, success depends on being sufficiently bloody-minded to carry on. Yet, one week into the fight, it feels as if Pfizer is off course. The political strife, in both the UK and US, is probably more intense than the company expected. If he fluffs his lines in front of the select committees, Read could make matters worse. The share prices really tell the story. If the market truly believed this deal was going to happen at \u00a355-plus, AstraZeneca would not be trading at just \u00a346 and Pfizer's shares would not be so weak. There is a long way to go and, to repeat, Pfizer retains the bidder's advantages. But the odds have moved this week. The likelihood now of Pfizer winning? On the current state of play, maybe 60%.Three key questions that MPs must ask Pfizer boss Ian Read next week. 1. Would you be prepared to make Pfizer's offer conditional on the approval of the UK government? The UK appears to have virtually no formal powers to block the deal. Pfizer, in the spirit of goodwill and harmonious relations, could be invited to grant the government a formal right of veto. In effect, Read would be consenting to a public interest test. 2. Are you prepared to give legally binding guarantees on jobs and investment in the UK? Read's current pledges are flimsy as Pfizer retains the right to \"adjust\" them \"should circumstances significantly change\". Would the company be prepared to forfeit assets, or cash, if it fails to honour its commitments? And would it extend its current five-year assurances to, say, 15 years? 3. Is Pfizer's offer dependent on the ability to win a tax inversion? In other words, does the deal only work if the US company flips its tax domicile to the UK? Does Pfizer have formal clearance for the tax structure from the US authorities? And what is its best estimate of the size of the tax savings?",

      "bodyText": "Drax, the operator of Britain's biggest power station, has become the second energy company in as many days to issue a profit warning on the back of falling wholesale prices. It blamed warm weather for hitting energy demand and lowering the price of electricity and said it had also been hurt financially by the falling value of its renewable energy subsidies. But Drax is in the middle of converting half of its boilers to the more carbon-friendly biomass \u2013 or wood pellets \u2013 for which it receives renewable obligation certificates (ROCs), a form of subsidy which has no fixed price and is traded on the open market. However, those subsidies are becoming less valuable because so much wind-generated power has came on to the wholesale power system in the UK - watering down the value of each ROC. It came after Centrica, the owner of British Gas, warned on Thursday that a mild winter, a loss of customers and a variety of other problems meant it would undershoot the profit expectations of the City this year. Drax operates a power station near Selby, North Yorkshire, which in its original form as a near 4,000 megawatt coal-burning plant was the UK's largest single emitter of carbon dioxide. Angelos Anastasiou, analyst at Whitman Howard, said Drax profits could fall to \u00a3210m for 2014, which would be 20% lower than the most optimistic analysts' forecasts. Last year, the company reported profits of \u00a3230m, down 23% on 12 months earlier. Peter Atherton at Liberum Capital said lower wholesale power prices were good for the consumer in the short term but meant companies such as Drax and Centrica would have less money to invest in the UK's energy sector, which needs modernisation. Drax said it had just raised an extra \u00a3100m through a private placement with various funds managed by M&amp;G Investments to strengthen its balance sheet. The company reiterated that it had launched legal proceedings against the government for excluding part of its biomass programme from a special subsidy regime known as contracts for difference. These give a set price for low carbon electricity rather than the variable price available under the ROC scheme. \"Legal advice confirmed that Drax has a good foundation to challenge the government's decision,\" Drax said. Despite Friday's profit warning, Drax said it was fully committed to completing its conversion programme which remains on time and budget.",

The main reason for the jump was a \u00a34.4m payment under its long-term incentive plan (LTIP). The windfall includes the \u00a32.6m payout on shares awarded to Harrison to match a \u00a31m investment he made in Whitbread shares when he joined in 2010.</p> <p>Harrison's pay, including his \u00a3731,000 salary but excluding the LTIP, rose by 7.8% last year, compared with 3.1% for Whitbread's employees \u2013 a comparison required under measures imposed by the business secretary, Vince Cable.</p> <p>The chief executive of the High Pay Centre (HPC), Deborah Hargreaves, said: \"LTIPs have been extremely generous and the question is what they are being paid for and whether the executives themselves know what they are being paid for or whether it is just a question of the stock market going up.\"</p> <p>Bosses' pay is in the spotlight as the annual general meeting season begins. It is the first round of AGMs since Cable required listed companies to put their pay policy to a binding vote of shareholders.</p> <p>Cable increased the pressure on boards last month when he wrote to the chairs of FTSE 100 remuneration committees, urging them to show restraint on bonuses to help restore public trust in big business.</p> <p>In Whitbread's annual report, Stephen Williams, who chairs the remuneration committee, said: \"Our strategy is to be competitive \u2026 in order to attract and retain high-calibre individuals.\" The increase in the LTIP was \"to bring the chief executive's package closer to competitive market practice\".</p> <p>Harrison was the only top executive to get the increase in potential long-term bonuses, which Whitbread said was partly to increase his pay compared with other directors.</p> <p>The company said the shares paid to Harrison when he joined were subject to the same performance standards as the rest of his LTIP, and he also had to invest \u00a31m in the company.</p> <p>Whitbread said it had discussed Harrison's new pay plan with its top 20 shareholders, the Association of British Insurers and ISS, the powerful US-based investor lobby group. Whitbread said its market value had increased from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a37.4bn since Harrison joined.</p> <p>Among pay rows so far this year, Royal Mail <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/06/royal-mail-scraps-plans-increase-boss-moya-greene-pay-vince-cable\" title=\"\">has scrapped plans to increase the pay of its chief executive, Moya Greene,</a> while Standard Chartered pledged to rethink its pay policy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/shareholder-rebellion-forces-standard-chartered-to-rethink-pay\" title=\"\">after a shareholder revolt</a>. Barclays, Ocado and Reckitt Benckiser also saw big votes against their pay reports. Hargreaves said HPC analysis of annual reports released so far this year showed bosses' pay levels at about the same as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/08/ftse-100-fatcats-wednesday-paid-salary\" title=\"\">\u00a34.3m average for the year before</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on May 12 2014. An earlier version said that the shares Harrison was awarded when he joined Whitbread were to replace those he forfeited when he left his former job at easyJet. In fact they were not connected to his easyJet shares, but were awarded to match a \u00a31m investment Harrison made in Whitbread shares when he joined the company.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison's pay package has soared by 85% to almost \u00a36.4m after he was allowed to cash in \u00a32.6m of shares he was handed when he joined the company.. The owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn also said it wanted to increase the amount Harrison can earn in long-term bonuses this year from 125% of his salary to 175%, with scope for him to get double his salary. Whitbread's annual report showed Harrison's pay jumped to \u00a36.4m from \u00a33.4m the year before. The main reason for the jump was a \u00a34.4m payment under its long-term incentive plan (LTIP). The windfall includes the \u00a32.6m payout on shares awarded to Harrison to match a \u00a31m investment he made in Whitbread shares when he joined in 2010. Harrison's pay, including his \u00a3731,000 salary but excluding the LTIP, rose by 7.8% last year, compared with 3.1% for Whitbread's employees \u2013 a comparison required under measures imposed by the business secretary, Vince Cable. The chief executive of the High Pay Centre (HPC), Deborah Hargreaves, said: \"LTIPs have been extremely generous and the question is what they are being paid for and whether the executives themselves know what they are being paid for or whether it is just a question of the stock market going up.\" Bosses' pay is in the spotlight as the annual general meeting season begins. It is the first round of AGMs since Cable required listed companies to put their pay policy to a binding vote of shareholders. Cable increased the pressure on boards last month when he wrote to the chairs of FTSE 100 remuneration committees, urging them to show restraint on bonuses to help restore public trust in big business. In Whitbread's annual report, Stephen Williams, who chairs the remuneration committee, said: \"Our strategy is to be competitive \u2026 in order to attract and retain high-calibre individuals.\" The increase in the LTIP was \"to bring the chief executive's package closer to competitive market practice\". Harrison was the only top executive to get the increase in potential long-term bonuses, which Whitbread said was partly to increase his pay compared with other directors. The company said the shares paid to Harrison when he joined were subject to the same performance standards as the rest of his LTIP, and he also had to invest \u00a31m in the company. Whitbread said it had discussed Harrison's new pay plan with its top 20 shareholders, the Association of British Insurers and ISS, the powerful US-based investor lobby group. Whitbread said its market value had increased from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a37.4bn since Harrison joined. Among pay rows so far this year, Royal Mail has scrapped plans to increase the pay of its chief executive, Moya Greene, while Standard Chartered pledged to rethink its pay policy after a shareholder revolt. Barclays, Ocado and Reckitt Benckiser also saw big votes against their pay reports. Hargreaves said HPC analysis of annual reports released so far this year showed bosses' pay levels at about the same as the \u00a34.3m average for the year before. \u2022 This article was amended on May 12 2014. An earlier version said that the shares Harrison was awarded when he joined Whitbread were to replace those he forfeited when he left his former job at easyJet. In fact they were not connected to his easyJet shares, but were awarded to match a \u00a31m investment Harrison made in Whitbread shares when he joined the company.",

That marks a pick up from growth of 0.8% in the three months to March. NIESR adds:</p> <p>\u201cBy this estimate, the UK economy was just 0.17% below its pre-recession peak at the end of April. Subject to data revisions and the uncertainties surrounding any out of sample predictions, it can reasonably be expected that the peak will be regained within the next month or so.\u201d</p> <p> Just to clarify what it is calling this situation, the National Institute adds that it interprets the term \u201crecession\u201d to mean a period when output is falling or receding, while \u201cdepression\u201d is a period when output is depressed below its previous peak. \u201cThus, unless output turns down again, the recession is over, while the period of depression is likely to continue for some time.

      "bodyText": "Disappointing company results - from Petrofac in the UK to Telefonica in Spain - helped push markets lower in a downbeat end to the week. Renewed worries about Ukraine ahead of the weekend's planned independence referendum also gave investors pause for thought. So after recent rises, the Friday scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 24.68 points or 0.36% to 6814.57 \u2022 Germany's Dax dipped 0.27% to 9581.45 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.66% lower at 4477.28 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB finished 1.56% down at 21,390.11 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.98% lower at 10,487.2 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading in the opposite direction, up 27 points or 0.17% at the moment. On that note it's time to close up for the evening, and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back on Monday. A quick correction from the ONS. They said earlier that factory output had seen its best quarterly performance since 1999. It appears that should be the best performance since the second quarter of 2010. So not quite as impressive.... The recovery in the UK economy is continuing, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Katie Allen writes: Following on from official numbers this morning on UK industrial production, the thinktank NIESR has released its monthly estimate of GDP growth. Not to be confused with its quarterly outlook report for the economy \u2013 which came out overnight and predicted the UK was close to be back at its pre-crisis strength \u2013 the monthly snapshot from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research puts GDP growth at 1% in the three months to April. That marks a pick up from growth of 0.8% in the three months to March. NIESR adds: \u201cBy this estimate, the UK economy was just 0.17% below its pre-recession peak at the end of April. Subject to data revisions and the uncertainties surrounding any out of sample predictions, it can reasonably be expected that the peak will be regained within the next month or so.\u201d Just to clarify what it is calling this situation, the National Institute adds that it interprets the term \u201crecession\u201d to mean a period when output is falling or receding, while \u201cdepression\u201d is a period when output is depressed below its previous peak. \u201cThus, unless output turns down again, the recession is over, while the period of depression is likely to continue for some time. We expect output to pass its peak (in early 2008) within the next few months,\u201d it adds. Earlier, Ireland's 10 year bond yields fell below those of the UK for the first time in six years, another sign of the continuing improvement in eurozone economies. At the moment the Irish yield is 2.657% while in the UK it is 2.687%. As for the US, it is up to 2.614% Pfizer has signed a deal with a group of leading UK universities to search for drugs to treat rare diseases. The announcement is bound to be held up by the US pharmaceutical giant and cheerleaders of the takeover of Astra Zeneca as a sign of its commitment to British research. The institutions are Cambridge University, Imperial College London, King\u2019s College London, Queen Mary University London, University College London and Oxford University. This is how the Pfizer press release describes the venture [It] has the potential to accelerate the translation of basic science into a new generation of innovative medicines for the treatment of these debilitating and life-threatening conditions.There are over 6,000 recognised rare diseases and, whilst each affects less than 0.1% of thepopulation, collectively they impact more than 3.5 million people in the UK alone and about 60million across Europe and the USA. From Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine and University of Oxford and chairman of the university group. We are looking forward to working with Pfizer on this project. It underlines the UK\u2019s strengths in biomedical research and creates an important vehicle for academic and industrial scientists to work together with the goal to translate fundamental research into benefit for patients. On that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Hot off the wires... The EU has agreed *in principle* to extend its sanctions list against Russia to 15 people and 5 Crimea-based companies. The final decision on whether to impose sanctions will be taken at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday. Based on this information , it does not sound as if the EU will issue broad, sweeping sanctions that could really damage the Russian economy. The list could even unravel at the weekend, depending on developments in eastern Ukraine. Some more context on those disappointing Canadian jobs numbers. Market analysts had been expecting jobs growth to slowdown, after gains averaging roughly 21,800 a month in the first quarter. But a fall of almost 29,000 was a surprise. Speaking ahead of the data, Derek Holt, economist at Bank of Nova Scotia said the strong performance of previous months could not last. Such a job market performance lies at odds with underlying softness across a broad number of activity measures. Via the Wall Street Journal The slip in employment numbers comes just days after the OECD pencilled in higher growth for Canada. However employment will recover more slowly, according to the rich-country thinktank. Here is how the Globe and Mail reported the OECD numbers on Tuesday. Economic growth will rise by next year to 2.75%, the OECD said in a global forecast, helped by a \"desirable rebalancing\" to exports and business investment, which the Bank of Canada, too, has hoped for. Helping to drive this will be the lower Canadian dollar and growth in the oil patch. Notably, given the OECD's previous warnings on inflated Canadian house prices, the group also projects that \"housing investment should decline towards a more sustainable level.\" .... The group projects economic growth in Canada, at 2.5% this year, will top the 2.2% of all OECD countries this year, and almost match the 2.8% of those nations in 2015. Canada will do better than the group when it comes to unemployment, according to the OECD, but the country's jobless rate is projected to remain stubbornly high, at 6.9 per cent this year, and 6.6 per cent in 2015. The bottom line is that the OECD sees global economic growth and trade progressing at a \"moderate pace\" this year and next. And that, almost six years after the financial crisis began, millions will still be without work. An unhappy surprise in Canada, where almost 29,000 jobs disappeared in April. Jobs were shed across the economy, with the seasonally-sensitive sector of \"accommodation and food services\", proving to be the biggest loser. Further job losses occurred in finance, insurance, real estate and leasing, according to the data provided by Statistics Canada. Economists had been expecting a gain of 13,500 jobs, suggesting something went badly wrong with the forecasts. Despite the steep decline in full-time jobs, the overall unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.9% as the number of people participating in the labour market went down. Statistics Canada said there had been little overall employment growth since August 2013. The bad news sent the Canadian dollar down to C$1.0886 against the US dollar, 91.86 U.S. cents, weaker than the previous day's close, according to Reuters. Mr Obama is going to Walmart. The president is expected to visit a store in Mountain View, California, where he will speak about energy efficiency. But the visit has come under fire from unions, who accuse the store of paying poverty wages that have contributed to the decline of the middle class. In the words of the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union: President Obama will stand to side by side with a company known for low wages, few benefits, unreliable hours, discrimination against women, violating workers\u2019 rights and yes, environmental degradation. Read more in the Wall Street Journal One Walmart employee with medical problems has said she is now sleeping on her son's living room floor because she cannot afford a place to live. Things have always been tight. After four years working at Wal-Mart in Mountain View, I am bringing home about $400 every two weeks (I\u2019d like to get more hours, but I\u2019m lucky if I work 32 hours a week). That\u2019s not enough to pay for bills, gas and food. All I can afford to eat for lunch is a cup of coffee and a bag of potato chips. I\u2019ve always done everything possible to stretch paychecks and scrape by. Sometimes it means not getting enough to eat. But then I got some bad news that made stretching my budget impossible. Two months ago, I started feeling ill. My doctor told me I needed to take a week off to have a series of medical tests. Every day for a week I went to the hospital and had to pay $30, $60 or $100 in co-pays for each appointment, test and X-ray. With these additional expenses and without a paycheck for the week I was out, it pushed me over the edge. I didn\u2019t have enough money to pay the rent. Right now, I don\u2019t have a place to call home. The full article is posted on Salon. Portugal's unemployment rate has fallen for the fourth successive quarter, while the government has been given a nod of approval from the Standard and Poor's rating agency. Official data showed that the jobless rate was 15.1% in March, down from 17.5% a year earlier. But youth joblessness continues to rise: the youth unemployment rate stood at 37.5% in March, up from 36.1%. Meanwhile S&amp;P has upgraded its outlook for the economy from negative to stable, but left Portugal's credit rating unchanged in junk territory. S&amp;P said the economy had grown faster than it expected and praised the government for adhering to the conditions of the \u20ac78bn bailout. We think Portugal's real GDP will likely grow on average about 1.4% per year during 2014-2015, chiefly on the back of sustained export growth, after a 1.4%contraction in 2013. We also expect a gradual recovery in domestic demand asprivate sector hiring continues to recover. jr -it is hard to see any consolation for the hundreds of thousands out of work, but this seems to be what counts as success in the austerity-hit countries of Europe's southern periphery . European leaders have declared the eurozone crisis over several times in recent months. Today is the turn of the outgoing president of the European Commission, Jose\u00b4Manuel Barroso. Here are the key lines from a speech he has given. The existential crisis of the euro, I think we can say is solved now. No complacency, some problems remain and we know the difficulties that exist mainly in social terms but the reality is that those observers, those analysts in Europe and outside who were predicting the Greek exit, they were predicting the implosion of the euro, they were completely wrong. They are the ones who have to apologise. Prices in Greece continue to fall at a steady pace, as wage cuts and unemployment take their toll. Data from the Hellenic Statistics Agency showed that prices were down 1.6% in April 2014 compared to April 2013. But the European Central Bank is not expected to intervene to shore-up tumbling prices, which it sees as part of the painful medicine for the Greek economy. Nick Clegg has said the government is not focusing on \"wielding vetoes\" to block the takeover of Astra Zeneca by US rival Pfizer. But the deputy prime minister wants to ensure that Pfizer's commitments to the UK are binding. From what I've seen, it's not clear how the government would make those commitments binding, or how long they would last for. Stephen Godwin from the independent health care research agency the Planning Shop told the BBC the firm may not be able to keep its promises. Pharmaceutical is... a bit dog-eat-dog. Assurances, however well meaning, will change depending on circumstance. It will not be able to stick to assurances, however well meant. Next week should be a critical week for the proposed deal. MPs on two parliamentary select committees have summoned the bosses of Pfizer and Astra-Zeneca to answer questions. Howard Archer, chief economist for Europe at IHS Global Insight, has said the latest ONS data does little to dilute the view that the UK economy is doing well. However, weak demand in the eurozone and strong imports into the UK are likely to cloud the picture. The prospects currently look largely encouraging for manufacturers, with April survey evidence from the CBI and the purchasing managers robust. Much improved consumer confidence, higher employment, a robust housing market and improving consumer purchasing power should bolster demand for consumer goods. Meanwhile, improving global growth should help UK manufacturers\u2019 export orders as 2014 progresses, although the upside for export orders may well be constrained by domestic demand in the Eurozone improving only gradually. Furthermore, the strength of the pound could become an increasing problem for UK manufacturers. Manufacturers will also be helped by a number of developments in March\u2019s budget, including measures aimed at limiting energy bills and providing more export finance at cheaper borrowing rates. Net trade will likely find it hard to make a significant positive contribution to UK growth in the near term at least, especially as imports are likely to continue to be underpinned by decent UK domestic demand. Nevertheless, the hope has to be that exports will increasingly benefit from global growth gradually picking up over the coming months. Tougher sanctions on Russia could damage German growth, according to a leaked report from the European Commission. The German magazine Stern reports that growth could be reduced by 0.9% percentage points this year and 0.3 points in 2015. Reuters summarises the main points: Light sanctions, such as blocking imports of Russian luxury goods like furs or expanding the list of political and business figures subject to travel bans, would slow German growth by 0.1 percentage points this year and next year, the Stern report said.But the worst-case scenario for the German economy would be prompted by a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas and Russian intermediate goods and a freeze on Russian financial assets and capital movements, according to the report.This would have a big impact on Germany's energy supplies, it said, estimating that Germany gets 46 percent of its gas and 37 percent of its oil from Russia and is even more dependent on it for supplies of certain raw materials like copper. The full article (in German) can be read here Meanwhile, analysts are asking whether Russia is having a Lehman Brothers moment. On Thursday the head of the European Central Bank suggested capital flight had been up to four times higher than official estimates. The Telegraph has a good account Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s president, said the outflows from Russia have been large enough over recent weeks to push up the euro exchange rate, complicating monetary policy for the ECB. \u201cWe had very significant outflows that have been estimated by some to be in the order of \u20ac160bn out of Russia,\u201d he said, without specifying where the information came from. This is equivalent to $222bn. It is the highest figure suggested so far by a senior official with access to confidential data. The Russian finance ministry said outflows had been just $51bn in the first quarter, though the total has almost certainly risen since then. \u201cDraghi\u2019s figure is a huge amount. If this is correct, it shows that Russia is in much more trouble than people think,\u201d said Tim Ash, from Standard Bank. \u201cThis is the same scale of outflows we saw in late 2008 after the Lehman crisis.\u201d Some useful charts on the manufacturing data, courtesy of Twitter users. A very timely nugget of data is contained in the ONS's latest tranche of economic statistics. The biggest contributor to growth in manufacturing came from pharmaceutical products, a fact that is bound to add to sceptics' armoury over the proposed takeover of the UK's second biggest drug company. Using the ONS definition, the manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products &amp; pharmaceutical preparations, increased by 4.2% in the year to March 2013. The second fastest-growing sector was the manufacture of food, beverages &amp; tobacco, which increased by 1.1%, followed by the manufacture of transport equipment, which increased by 0.8%. 10.10am update: I've corrected the date in this post. Also worth pointing out that pharmaceuticals fell by 5.8% in the first quarter compared to the previous one, the biggest faller. The ONS has some good news for George Osborne, with data showing that factory output grew 1.4% in the first three months of 2014. This is way above expectations and the best quarter since 1999. However, manufacturing, which accounts for around 10% of the economy, is still below where it was in 2008. Total production, which includes mining, quarrying as well as manufacturing, was down 0.1% on the previous quarter. This means that the effect on GDP, last week estimated to be 0.8% in Q1, is pretty negligible. In the words of the ONS This release of data estimates that production rose by 0.7% between Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 and the impact on the previously published Q1 2014 GDP estimate is minimal. Other ONS statistics showed that construction output was up 0.6% in Q1, compared to the previous quarter. This was driven by an increase in new buildings (up 0.9%) and repairs (0.2%). Here is the rundown of the trade data just released by the Office for National Statistics. The UK's deficit on trade in goods and services was \u00a31.3 bn in March 2014, compared with a deficit of \u00a31.7 bn in February 2014. There was a deficit of \u00a38.5 bn on goods, partly offset by an estimated surplus of \u00a37.2 bn on services. Exports of goods increased by 4.9% between February and March 2014 to \u00a324.6 bn reflecting an increase in exports of finished manufactures, including jewellery and cars. Imports of goods increased by 2.8% over the same period to \u00a333.1 bn, with an increase in the imports of aircraft a significant factor. Exports of goods decreased by 3.7% to \u00a372.0 bn in Q1 2014. Imports of goods decreased by 2.8% to \u00a398.7 billion in Q1 2014. Breaking news: UK industrial output fell 0.1% in March; trade deficit in goods narrows. A former head of the Eurogroup has warned France to stop blaming the euro for its woes. Jean-Claude Juncker, the centre-right candidate for European Commission, told Reuters that France had better fix its problems at home, before blaming the single currency. Here are the key quotes. I don't believe France is the sick man of Europe. But I do caution against looking for the causes of what is partly the result of (its) own mistakes somewhere other than at home. If France has a tougher time than other countries, then the reasons for this are to be found in France, not in exchange rates. France's socialist government is campaigning to weaken the euro to boost its exports and would like eurozone leaders more involved in setting rates - at odds with Germany's insistence on defending the integrity of the European Central Bank. Speaking of Astra-Zeneca, there is a great read in the FT by Martin Wolf, the paper's chief economics commentator. The questions any normal person would ask are three. Would a takeover increase competition? Would it increase investment in life-transforming research? Would assurances given by the bidder about future production and research be credible? The answer to all is \u201cno\u201d. Yet the merger is likely to go ahead, because the only people whose interests count are shareholders, whether they have owned their shares for 10 years or 10 seconds. AstraZeneca can be sold and bought like a sack of potatoes. Does this make sense? Until recently I believed it to be the least bad arrangement. Now I am not so sure. As I shall argue in a conference on Inclusive Capitalism in London later this month. We need to rethink ownership and control of limited liability companies. You can read the full article (metred paywall) here Pfizer's \u00a363bn bid for Astra-Zeneca has come under further attack, this time from the United States Senate. Two leading Democrat Senators are trying to close a loophole that allows US firms to pay less tax by going abroad. The practice, known as an \"inversion\", allows US firms to reincorporate abroad, enabling them to avoid the US corporate tax rate of 35%. Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations, said he was talking to colleagues about changing the law. His statement: I\u2019ve long been concerned about inversions \u2013 companies moving offshore on paper, for tax purposes, while the management and operations remain in the United States. It\u2019s become increasingly clear that a loophole in our tax laws allowing these inversions threatens to devastate federal tax receipts. We have to close that loophole. I am talking to my colleagues about legislation to close the loophole, which I intend to introduce soon. Companies that exploit this loophole benefit from the protections and services the federal government provides, including patent protection, research and development tax credits, national security and more; they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to shift their tax burden onto others. So no payday for the mad men of Omnicom and Publicis. The proposed $35 billion (\u00a320bn) mega merger between advertising giants, US Omnicom Group and French rival Publicis Groupe, has collapsed as the different cultures of the two firms proved impossible to reconcile. Omnicom chief executive John Wren told Reuters there was no one factor. There are a lot of complex issues we haven\u2019t resolved. There are strong corporate cultures in both companies that delayed us for reaching an agreement. There was no clear finish line in sight and uncertainty is never a good thing when you are in the personal service business. The Franco-US tie-up would have knocked WPP off its perch as the world's biggest advertising company. The FT has a nicely acerbic quote from WPP's boss Sir Martin Sorrell. In the end it was a case of eyes bigger than tummy Richard Murphy, well-known tax researcher and campaigner, thinks the deal was tax driven - and sees a lesson for Pfizer and Astra-Zeneca. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The great recession is over, according to a respected economic forecasting group, which says the ground lost since the 2008 financial crisis has almost all been recovered. The monthly estimate of growth from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research is expected to show that UK economic output is almost back to where it was in March 2008, falling just 0.1% of the pre financial-crisis benchmark. Jonathan Portes, NIESR director, told the Times that the economy had reached an important moment: The British economy is very close to being bigger than it has ever been. Symbolically, that matters, and it comes out a time when growth is entrenched. But speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he warned that workers would have to wait up to four years before their take-home pay recovered. But as far as individuals are concerned what really matters is how rich we are - per capita GDP - and that's well below the level of 2008 and won't get back to its previous level for a couple of years. In fact, real wages - take-home pay deflated by inflation - is about 6% lower than it was then and won't get back to its previous 2008 peak before, we reckon, another three or four years. It's also worth remembering that the upward trend might not go in a straight line. Data published this morning is expected to show that industrial production slowed down in March, following a period when factories expanded their output faster than anyone expected in the previous month. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says industrial and manufacturing numbers will determine whether a 0.8% estimate of GDP growth for the first three months of the year will be revised. Here is his forecast on today\u2019s data. Industrial production is expected to show a decline of 0.2%, down from 0.9% in February, while manufacturing production is expected to slow to 0.3% from 1%. Construction output is expected to expand 0.6% in March and 7.1% year on year. If these numbers come in any way positive it will add fuel to the belief that the economy is well on the way to recovering back to its GDP peaks, pre financial crisis. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s trade numbers are expected to show a \u00a39bn deficit. The British government can only look on with envy at Germany, which this morning reported a healthy trade surplus of \u20ac14.8bn. But there is a sting in the tail: German exports posted their biggest fall in nearly a year in March, wiping \u20ac1bn off the trade surplus. Mergers are also on our mind today. I\u2019ll also be looking on the collapse of the Omnicom-Publicis merger, ending hopes of creating an advertising company bigger than the current world no.1 WPP. Plus we hear further warnings on Pfizer\u2019s takeover of Astra-Zeneca. Stay tuned for that and all the latest...",

Analysts say this brave new world is within touching distance and its axis is the smartphone, which will become \"the remote control for your life\". That, at least, is the rationale for the tie-up between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse. They are expected to confirm details of a \u00a33.5bn merger next week, forging a new high street alliance to cash in on the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT refers to the trend of connecting everyday items such as phones, fridges and boilers to the internet so they can be \"smarter\". Tech group Cisco Systems thinks the IoT could be worth $14.4tn (\u00a38.5tn) by 2020 when 50bn objects will be connected to the internet. Mintel senior trends analyst Richard Cope says everyday objects will increasingly have \"digital identities\". \"Sensors are turning 'dumb' everyday objects into perceptive machines.\" The toothbrush for example sends a critique of your brushing style to your phone. \"They will become a portfolio of smart helpers with the potential to better serve our needs. Google's Android is no longer just a smartphone operating system; it's the backbone of a rising class of synced-up home appliances such as refrigerators, ovens and even watches.\" As lawyers and investment bankers thrash out the final details, City analysts are crunching the numbers to better understand the logic of a deal that creates a 3,000-store pan-European group with a turnover of close to \u00a312bn. While the IoT offers jam tomorrow, insiders say replacing Phones 4U concessions in Dixons' PC World and Curry's stores will provide an instant fillip. With more than 1,200 stores in Britain, costs can be cut by pooling headquarters \u2013 both companies have head offices in south-east England, each with annual running costs of \u00a315m-20m. \"The IoT is the uber-trend if you like,\" said one senior industry figure with knowledge of the deal. \"But in the short-term there is a lot they (Dixons and Carphone) can do. In the world of consumer electronics retailing mobile phones is a big and profitable category.\" Last year Dixons made pre-tax profits of \u00a394.5m on sales of \u00a38.2bn while Carphone made \u00a359m on a turnover of \u00a33.7bn. The deal, which is being done with shares rather than cash, is another notch on the belt of Charles Dunstone, the shrewd entrepreneur who founded Carphone in 1989. He will control an estimated 12% of the new company which he will also chair. Dixons boss Sebastian James is expected to hold on to the role of chief executive. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb is surprised by Dunstone's enthusiasm for a deal. \"I think it's easier to see what's in it for Dixons,\" said Bubb. \"Having seen him rip off Best Buy, Dixons are rightly wary. Only a few years ago Dunstone was saying how rubbish they were. If Carphone is the most desirable business in their sector it should be Dixons approaching them not the other way round.\" Last year Carphone Warehouse paid \u00a3471m to buy back the 50% stake it had sold to US chain Best Buy for \u00a31.1bn. \"[Best Buy] basically paid \u00a31.1bn for the same half they are selling back to us today for a lot less,\" explained Carphone's Roger Taylor at the time. \"When they bought in they had aspirations to put Best Buy stores across Europe and they probably paid a premium for that, and in the end that strategy didn't work for many reasons.\" Carphone did fulfil its side of the bargain, setting up a profitable mobile phone business for the US retailer, but Best Buy crashed and burned in Britain with the loss-making chain of \"big box\" electrical stores shut down in 2011. The Dixons-Carphone deal is unusual in that it is a nil-premium merger, continued the industry source. \"The money for Charles is based on the group's future prospects, I don't see anything sharp being done.\" While some of the technological innovations promised by the IoT seem light years away, some gadgets \u2013 even if they are not recognised as such \u2013 have already reached the mainstream. John Lewis, for example, sells a Samsung washing machine that can be controlled by a mobile app, offering handy updates to your phone when the cycle is finished. Initially an IoT sceptic Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts said the \"scales have fallen from my eyes\" as more and more suppliers and retailers see tangible opportunities. \"A couple of years ago the IoT sounded like science fiction but now it is actually happening,\" he said. \"You can buy an internet enabled washing machines or a fridge that triages your fresh food.\" He added: \"A lot of mergers are quite tactical and about putting the thumbscrews on suppliers but this seems more strategic. They are saying we believe in the next 10 years A,B and C is going to happen and we will be well positioned to benefit from it.\"",

      "bodyText": "It was a week of farewells, and some were better received than others. Justin King unveiled his last set of results as chief executive of J. Sainsbury, with a slightly better than expected 5.3% rise in full year profits to \u00a3798m. Despite a warning that trading for the big four supermarkets would remain tough as discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to snatch market share, King's swansong saw Sainsbury's shares end the week at 335.8p, up 4.6p on the day and 2.4p since the figures. The rise came despite news that King had sold just over \u00a31m worth of shares to cover tax liabilities following the exercise of options under a 2011 award scheme. King's successor Michael Coupe also raised nearly \u00a3220,000 to pay the tax bill but retained \u00a3245,000 worth of shares. Rival Morrisons meanwhile revealed its own battle with cheaper competitors had left it nursing a 7.1% fall in sales in the last three months. Its shares fell 1.3p to 197.6p. King's departure was expected but not so the news that Guy Berruyer would step down from Sage by next March, earlier than the accounting software group had previously indicated. Sage lost 3p to 396.5p. Also on the way out was the chief executive of Balfour Beatty, Andrew McNaughton, after the infrastructure group issued another profit warning, blamed on weakness in its UK construction business. Balfour's shares lost around a fifth of their value immediately following the news, and edged down 0.2p to 223.8p on Friday. The company also said three managers were suspended amid an investigation into alleged \"improper conduct\" on a \u00a3500m contract to modernise the UK's energy network for National Grid. Elsewhere around 19,000 Barclays staff will leave the bank as part of the restructuring plans put forward by chief executive Anthony Jenkins. As is the way in the unsentimental City, the news saw the bank's shares soar nearly 8%, although they slipped 2.3p to 260.15p on Friday. Overall, in a week of mixed economic and corporate signals, the FTSE 100 hit a near 11 week high on Thursday before falling back. It closed at 6814.57 on Friday, down 24.68 points on the day and down nearly 8 points on the week. On the plus side, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi pleased the market on Thursday with the suggestion that the central bank might act in June to offset the threat of deflation in the eurozone, perhaps by cutting interest rates or even starting a bond buying programme. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen also cheered investors with comments suggesting there was no urgency to raise rates across the Atlantic. In the UK there were strong service sector figures and a report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said UK economic output was almost back to the level before the 2008 financial crisis began. In the eurozone Markit's monthly health check showed the economy growing at its fastest rate since May 2011. But disappointing Chinese trade data revived concerns about the outlook for the country's economy. And investors remained nervous about the situation in Ukraine ahead of the weekend's planned independence referendum, despite conciliatory comments from Russia's Vladimir Putin on Thursday. Back in the UK, energy companies came under pressure after first Centrica, down 1.9p at 318.5p, then Drax, 17p lower at 660p, warned profits would be affected by lower demand and prices following the mild winter. SSE slipped 21p to \u00a315.11. AstraZeneca lost 112.5p to 4600.5p awaiting further developments in its bid to avoid being taken over by Pfizer. The biggest FTSE 100 faller on Friday was Petrofac, down 211p to \u00a311.77 after the energy services group warned full year profits could fall by up to 11%, partly due to delays to contracts in the North Sea and Romania. Rolls-Royce fell 12p to \u00a310.01 as Barclays reduced its recommendation from overweight to underweight and its price target from \u00a312.25 to 930p. The bank's analysts said: Following a detailed analysis of Rolls-Royce's Civil &amp; Defence aerospace businesses we conclude that the 'pause in growth' cited by management for 2014 will likely extend into 2015 and 2016. We believe Bloomberg consensus is modelling a significantly more optimistic outcome and as a result, earnings forecasts could come under pressure. Whilst we recognise the significant order backlog of around \u00a372bn, we consider the short-to-medium term to be less attractive. Slow growth over the next two years, high exposure to a single yet-to-enter service aircraft, significant cash and margin headwinds, accounting concerns, and questions over capital allocation lead us to our underweight rating. With three years of low-to-mid single digit earnings per share growth ahead, we do not see a compelling reason for the shares to re-rate to prior levels over the next 12 months. WPP dipped 11p to \u00a312.66 despite positive comments on the company as rival advertising agencies Omnicom and Publicis abandoned merger plans. In a buy note on WPP with a \u00a315.77 target price, Roddy Davidson at Westhouse Securities said: [The merger collapse] is not an enormous surprise given the regulatory hurdles which had emerged and the significant operational and cultural differences between the two businesses. From a WPP perspective there is evidence that the uncertainty and disruption caused was contributing to client losses from both parties and creating the opportunity to pick up creative talent. Presumably both companies will now redouble their efforts to arrest this. However, a fair degree of damage may already have been done and the proposed merger has highlighted strategic shortcomings around their international/digital reach and ability to deal with technological challenges. It must also call into question senior management competence and will cement WPP's position as the global industry leader. Our suspicion is that there may be more fall out to WPP's advantage and that ultimately this news has strengthened its competitive position. Both Omnicom and Publicis had promised their shareholders medium-term margin upside from a merger and will now need to come up with a plan B in this regard. It is difficult to assess their short-term behaviour on pricing, which appears to have become more aggressive as they attempt to retain clients, but ultimately this will have to be tailored to deliver their medium-term margin aspirations. In the meantime WPP is trading well, should be a core beneficiary of an improving environment for advertising spend and has raised its game in response to the proposed deal by redoubling its efforts to drive (already industry leading) exposure to digital and faster growing markets, accelerating cost saving/efficiency initiatives and increasing buy-back activity. But Intertek, the testing specialist, added 41p to \u00a330.27 after a positive note from Credit Suisse. The bank said: We upgrade Intertek to outperform (from neutral) with a 3500p price target (from 3200p). We think organic growth rates have troughed and will accelerate during 2014 as headwinds in commodities and industrials abate. We think that growth of 1% for the 6 months to April will rise to 5.5% in the second half. Retailers edged higher, with Marks &amp; Spencer up 9p at 458.4p, and Debenhams 1.6p better at 81.6p after the weekly John Lewis figures showed strong growth in clothing sales. Finally Tullett Prebon led the mid-cap fallers after unveil a cost cutting programme to deal with falling revenues. The interdealer broker said it wanted to cut annual costs by around \u00a320m as it reported a 12% drop in revenues in the first four months of the year. At the same time it is spending $160m to buy London-based broker PVM Oil Associates to boost its presence in the crude oil trading market. Tullett lost 18.5p to 297.2p while rival Icap ended 12.8p lower at 387.7p.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers have been urged to boycott Amazon's British business after it paid just \u00a34.2m in tax last year, despite selling goods worth \u00a34.3bn \u2013 more than the UK sales of Argos, Dixons or the non-food arm of Marks &amp; Spencer. Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, said shoppers should find alternatives to the Seattle-headquartered retailer, after consumer action persuaded coffee chain Starbucks to resume UK tax payments last year. \"It is an outrage and Amazon should pay their fair share of tax,\" said Hodge. \"They are making money out of not paying taxes. I no longer use Amazon. We should shop elsewhere. What we demonstrated with Starbucks is the power of the consumer voice.\" Amazon's most recent charge brings to just over \u00a310m its contribution to the public purse through corporation tax in a decade. Over the last four years, Amazon has generated \u00a323bn in British sales. It made a tax contribution of \u00a33.2m the previous year. Amazon is able to pay low tax because when shoppers in Europe buy from any of its local websites, the payment is taken by a subsidiary based in the low tax jurisdiction of Luxembourg. A British shopper's bank statement will show a payment to Amazon EU S.\u00e0.r.l. rather than Amazon.co.uk. Amazon's British arm employs thousands of staff in warehousing, software design, accounting, human resources and other functions. For tax purposes, its role is simply to provide services to the European master company in Luxembourg. \"People will look at this and feel it's incredibly unfair,\" said Tory MP and tax campaigner Charlie Elphicke. \"That they work hard and pay their taxes while big American multinationals engage in industrial scale tax avoidance. This is why international tax reform is badly needed and why the chancellor has been right to make the international case. Tax abuse is wrong and must be stamped out.\" The UK company declared a turnover of \u00a3449m for 2013, up 40% on 2012. However, this money was not raised from sales but in payments for its warehousing, distribution and administrative work, such as negotiating purchasing deals with book publishers. Amazon gives a fuller picture of its UK revenues in regulatory filings to US investors, and this data showed a growth in UK turnover of 13% during 2013, to $7.3bn (\u00a34.3bn). The rise was lower than in previous years, but enough to overtake Marks &amp; Spencer's entire UK revenue from non-food items. The \u00a34.2m in tax paid is just 0.1% of Amazon's UK revenues in 2013. But the Treasury sets corporation tax as a percentage of profits. Amazon.co.uk reported profits of \u00a317m in 2013, and effectively paid 24% of that in corporation tax. Hodge said: \"If you are an Amazon user you get endless emails saying Amazon.co.uk. You then order your goods and you get them delivered by the Royal Mail in parcels stamped with the Queen's head, and they then pretend it's nothing to do with business in the UK. They are damaging British jobs. If you are a small bookshop in the high street you can never compete with their prices, because you pay taxes. Even for John Lewis their future is also threatened because they pay their taxes.\" Amazon's British business, whose accounts were published at Companies House on Friday, increased its headcount by 41% during the year, to 5,912, although during a recent interview the company said it now employed 7,000 staff in the UK, with many more seasonal workers joining its warehouses at Christmas. Amazon said: \"Amazon pays all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within. Amazon EU serves tens of millions of customers and sellers throughout Europe from multiple consumer websites in a number of languages dispatching products to all 28 countries in the EU. We have a single European headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation.\"",
