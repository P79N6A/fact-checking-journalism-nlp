      "bodyText": "A \u00a3520m case is scheduled to begin in the high court on Monday that will scrutinise the months leading up to Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u00a345bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis. Along with other directors, the disgraced former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin will be forced to defend accusations that investors were misled into buying shares in the Edinburgh-based bank. Barring an eleventh-hour settlement, the case will open in London\u2019s high court and will require top bankers to give evidence in court for the first time since the bank was bailed out with taxpayers\u2019 cash in 2008. Goodwin and other former senior bankers will be forced to pore over the detail in the prospectus issued when RBS conducted a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. At the time, it was a record-breaking sum. The long-running legal action, which is a civil case that will be heard by a high court judge without a jury, is being brought by 9,000 individuals and big City investors who put up their cash to take part in the April rights issue and lost out when the bank was bailed out six months later. Alongside Goodwin, the case names three former directors and the bank itself in a claim that focuses on accusations that untrue or misleading statements were made about the financial health of the bank at the time of the cash call. RBS \u2013 which is supporting the former directors\u2019 legal cases and costs \u2013 has settled with 87% of the investors who had brought claims related to the rights issue, and has not admitted liability during the settlements. Earlier this month, Sir Howard Davies, chairman of RBS, said: \u201cIf we do not reach settlement with the remaining claimants, we will defend ourselves vigorously when the trial starts on 22 May.\u201d The claim was originally brought in the name of John Greenwood, a 75-year-old retired civil engineer from Huddersfield who lost \u00a345,000, although RBS eventually faced claims from five groups of investors whose total claims reached \u00a34bn. In December, RBS said it had \u00a3800m to share among the different groups making claims. RBS has settled with all but the remaining group, whose claim is for \u00a3520m but which could amount to \u00a3800m if interest is included. Some of the funding for the investor group is provided by the racehorse and pub owner Trevor Hemmings \u2013 who also owns Preston North End football club \u2013 who lost money himself. RBS staff are also among the claimants, while the former RBS board member Sir Angus Grossart, also a former shareholder, has attempted to join the action. Goodwin is scheduled to give evidence for two days, starting on 8 June \u2013 the day of the general election. He has not publicly discussed his role at RBS since February 2009, when he appeared before the Treasury select committee and offered a \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused.\u201d However, he said it was too simple to blame him for the bank\u2019s collapse. The case, for which RBS expects to incur \u00a3125m of legal fees, will be heard by Mr Justice Hildyard and is expected to last 14 weeks. But according to reports, it could take seven years to establish the bank\u2019s liability and quantify damages if appeals are made. The rights issue took place just months after the Edinburgh-based bank had been part of a consortium taking over the Dutch bank ABN Amro. Shareholders were offered 11 new shares at 200p for every 18 they owned. Comparisons with the current share price are made difficult by changes to the share base since the bailout but the equivalent price would be 2,000p. The shares were trading on Friday at 266p, compared with the average price of 502p at which the bank was bailed out. Taxpayers still own more than 70% of the bank. Goodwin had been named Forbes business man of the year in 2002 after masterminding the takeover of NatWest but in 2012 was stripped of the knighthood he was awarded in 2004.",

      "bodyText": "Consumers failed to propel the UK economy in the first quarter as rising prices dampened appetite for spending, official figures will show this week. City economists believe the Office for National Statistics will confirm on Thursday that economic growth more than halved to 0.3% in the first three months of the year from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The second estimate of GDP growth provides a more detailed breakdown of how the economy performed, including a first take on consumer spending. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said the detail was likely to confirm that the first quarter was \u201ca very soft period\u201d for household spending, following decent growth of 0.7% in the previous quarter. He said a consumer slowdown was likely to weigh on the wider economy, which grew by 1.8% in 2016. \u201cThanks to the rise in inflation, household finances are now facing headwinds rather than tailwinds and this is principally why we are expecting a year of relatively subdued GDP growth of 1.7% over 2017 as a whole,\u201d Shaw said. The first estimate suggested that growth in consumer-facing businesses slowed sharply in the period January to March. Growth in the service sector, which includes hotels, bars and restaurants, slowed to 0.3% from 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth in industrial production and construction output also slowed over the period, to 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said there was a chance that growth could be revised down in the second estimate. \u201cIf anything the risks look to be slightly slanted to the downside rather than the upside,\u201d he said. Separate ONS data due on Tuesday will give the first insight into the state of the public finances after the new fiscal year got underway in April. The figures are expected to show the government borrowed \u00a39.5bn last month, up from \u00a39.1bn in the same month a year earlier. It would be the highest level of borrowing in the month of April since 2015. In the 2016-17 financial year to the end of March, borrowing fell by \u00a320bn to \u00a352bn after economic growth helped drive tax receipts higher, narrowing the gap between what the government spends and earns. It was the lowest deficit since 2007-08, and meant that chancellor Philip Hammond essentially met his \u00a351.7bn target, set by by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, at the time of the budget in March. However, the OBR expects borrowing to rise again this year, to \u00a355.2bn, partly owing to one-off factors but also because of slowing growth as consumers rein in spending in response to rising shop prices.",

      "bodyText": "Shell shareholders including the Church of England, European pension funds and Dutch activists will send a signal to the board of the Anglo-Dutch company this week by voting for it to set new climate change goals. The challenge comes from a Dutch group of retail investors, who have tabled a resolution for Shell\u2019s annual general meeting on Tuesday, asking the company to establish carbon emission reduction targets. \u201cA large group of institutional investors will make their dissatisfaction with the company\u2019s position evident by voting for this resolution,\u201d said Mark van Baal of Follow this. The Church of England is among investors supporting the proposal, along with several European pension funds. \u201cI\u2019m not expecting that it will pass but the resolution is well-worded and we support its intent \u2013 it\u2019s something the board should be taking note of,\u201d said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for church commissioners at the C of E. Shell\u2019s board has asked shareholders to vote against the resolution, which to pass would require 75% to vote in favour. Shell argued that unilaterally setting targets would harm the company and that the emissions from the burning of its oil and gas were largely covered by country\u2019s individual climate plans under the Paris accord. Independent European proxy advisory group ECGS recommends investors back the climate resolution, but major advisers Glass Lewis and ISS oppose it. The Guardian understands no major institutional investors intend to support it. A Shell spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased the key proxy agencies share the view of Shell\u2019s board of directors that the resolution is not in the best interests of the company, its shareholders or the fight to tackle climate change. \u201cThe only realistic way that Shell could reduce its customers\u2019 emissions would be by reducing the volume of products we sell to them. This would simply drive customers to other suppliers, make no real difference to overall emissions, damage our business and undermine our efforts to play an active role in the energy transition.\u201d Separately, the UK-based investment group Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants (Pirc), which represents around 1% of shareholders, has urged investors to reject both the directors\u2019 pay last year and Shell\u2019s future remuneration policy. CEO Ben van Beurden\u2019s total pay was \u00a37m in 2016, up 60% from \u00a34.7m in 2015, which Pirc said was excessive at 453% of his salary. ISS has also raised concerns over the \u00a31.94m payout for a former chief financial officer, Simon Henry, which it said was not in line with practice in the UK. However, overall it backed the remuneration for last year. Pirc said the future pay policy was not without concerns for shareholders because when directors leave they would receive an automatic payout linked to their annual bonus, but on balance it backs supporting the policy in a binding vote. Activists are also expected to use the AGM as an opportunity to pose questions about an Italian investigation into an allegedly corrupt oil deal by Shell in Nigeria. The meeting comes two days before major oil-producing countries meet in Vienna to decide whether to extend production cuts for a further nine months in an effort to shore up the oil price, which is hovering around $50 a barrel.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer will report a fresh slump in clothing sales on Wednesday after a revival at Christmas proved short-lived. The disappointing finish to the year will be revealed alongside a sharp fall in annual profits. Hopes that M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe had come up with a winning formula for the UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer were raised after it recorded its first underlying growth in nearly two years over the key festive quarter. But with rivals such as Next reporting moribund sales as rising living costs force Britons to tighten their belts, M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and homewares sales are expected to have tumbled more than 3% in the first three months of 2017. Its food business is also expected to post a small decline in underlying sales. Investec analyst Kate Calvert has pencilled in pre-tax profits of \u00a3603m for the year to 31 March \u2013 down from \u00a3690m a year ago as the combination of rising costs and falling sales eats into the company\u2019s profitability. \u201cM&amp;S is playing catch up in a difficult mid-market position,\u201d said Calvert who said the collapse in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote would add to the pressures faced by management this year as the cost of imported goods rises. Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive in April 2016, is seeking to revive the declining profits of the 132-year-old retailer. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm, which under predecessor Marc Bolland relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers. The M&amp;S lifer initially concentrated on lowering clothing prices and running fewer promotions while promising female shoppers wearable rather than catwalk fashions. He upped the ante in the autumn, unveiling a five-year plan to slash the amount of trading space devoted to clothing by 10% and instead focus on the expansion of its upmarket food halls. Rowe also pulled the plug on 53 company-run stores in loss-making overseas markets including China, France, Belgium and Poland. The shake-up of M&amp;S\u2019s UK chain involves the closure of 30 of its 304 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homeware and food \u2013 while another 45 are being converted into food-only shops. Last month it confirmed the first wave of closures would be in Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington and Wokingham. The Guardian also revealed plans to trial an online grocery shopping service this autumn. Some analysts have argued that Rowe\u2019s plans are not radical enough at a time when high street sales are transferring to the internet and nimbler rivals such as Zara and Primark are stealing its customers. Veteran retail analyst Tony Shiret said M&amp;S was \u201cstill in denial\u201d about the scale of the store closures required \u2013 pointing to Mothercare which last week said it would close up to 70 of its 152 UK stores as it adapts to a digital age. \u201cThere is no point opening new physical space,\u201d he said. The retailer\u2019s turnaround plan is expected to evolve in the coming months following a series of high profile senior appointments. It has hired retail turnaround expert Archie Norman to succeed Robert Swannell, who is retiring as chairman after seven years in the role while Jill McDonald has been poached from car parts and bike retailer Halfords, to the new role of managing director of its clothing, home and beauty business.",

      "bodyText": "Roll the clock back a year and Britain was in the middle of the EU referendum battle. The remain side was warning about the economic consequences of Brexit; the leave side was extolling the benefits of taking back control. Leave won decisively but narrowly enough to give the remainers hope that the public would rethink its decision. The general election campaign has exposed that hope as a fantasy. Brexit is accepted as a political given by both the Conservatives and Labour. The Liberal Democrats have struggled despite promising to hold a second referendum. Britain will indeed \u201ctake back control\u201d in early 2019. And then what? Much of the focus since the referendum has been on what sort of trade arrangements a Brexit Britain will have. The real focus should be on sorting out the long-term weaknesses of the economy. Countries with successful economies find markets for their exports no matter whether they are part of a single market or customs union. The real challenge is different. Britain, in the aggregate at least, cannot produce the wealth it is going to need to meet the challenges of an ageing population. This would be the case in or out of the EU. Leaving simply means that the challenge cannot be ducked as it has been in the past. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has highlighted the extent of the demographic pressures and what they mean for the public finances. Over the next five years, the population of the UK is expected to rise by 3%, but there will be a 9% increase in the number of people over 65 and a 15% increase in those over 85. More old people means higher pension costs despite the increase in the official retirement age and higher health costs, because the average 90-year-old costs eight times as much to treat each year as the average 30-year-old. The share of national income accounted for by pensions has just about doubled since the second world war to 12% of GDP, and is expected to increase by a further seven percentage points over the next half a century. In the post-1945 period, the rise in pension and health spending was matched by a decline in outlays on defence and debt interest. Today, there is no low hanging fruit to be picked, leaving the IFS to conclude that the choice is between increasing the size of the state, reducing spending on pensions and health, or cutting back elsewhere. The slower the economy grows the tougher these choices become. Getting the big picture right is part of the story, and the mix of ultra-low interest rates and austerity used since 2010 has not worked. But to a large extent, raising Britain\u2019s game is a local rather than a national issue. Research by the Centre for Cities thinktank shows that productivity in the greater south-east (which includes London) is higher than it is Germany. The problem is that it takes a worker in the north and the Midlands five days to produce what a worker in the greater south-east can produce in three-and-a-half days. The disparity is particularly marked in urban areas. Cities in the greater south-east are 50% more productive than those in the north. Were the gap to be closed, the north\u2019s economy would be \u00a3154bn bigger. That\u2019s the equivalent of adding three more cities the size of Manchester to the northern economy, and potentially a lot of extra resources available for health and pensions. This is a long-standing problem. Work by Steve Fothergill and Christina Beatty at Sheffield Hallam University has shown how the UK\u2019s old manufacturing heartlands have never really recovered from the deindustrialisation of the 1980s and, to make matters worse, have been at the sharp end of the welfare cuts introduced since 2010. The unemployment rate has come down but the jobs that have been created have tended to be in low-wage sectors such as distribution and call centres. Unsurprisingly, there has been an exodus of the young and talented to the more prosperous parts of the country. Those left behind voted in their droves for Brexit because they felt, rightly, that the economy was not working for them. Peter Kenway of the New Policy Institute observes that Britain\u2019s industrial strategy for the past three decades has been membership of the EU, which has ensured access both to the single market and to labour, which has flowed to the parts of the country that have needed it. This has resulted in faster growth and stronger support for remain in the greater south-east but has brought its own regional problem: a housing shortage. The Brexit-voting parts of the country, by contrast, have not reaped the same benefits. Indeed, they have probably suffered as a result of the concentration of growth in London and the south-east. Why? Because the flow of global capital into the City has pushed up the value of the pound, making life harder for exporters in regions that still rely heavily on manufacturing. Because London\u2019s success has meant it has had first claim on money for infrastructure. And because the brain drain has left cities in the north such as Liverpool and Stoke with large numbers of poorly skilled adults trying to find jobs where opportunities are limited. The problems have been confounded by the unwillingness, at least until recently, to cede any control over the purse strings. Local government has been at the sharp end of austerity. So what might a new northern-focused industrial strategy look like? It should start by seeking to to do no more harm. That means reversing the welfare cuts that are sucking spending power out of communities already suffering from a lack of effective demand. It also means welcoming \u2013 and trying to lock in \u2013 a more competitive exchange rate. If the government is serious about reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, Britain cannot afford to have 5 million adults \u2013 around one sixth of the employed labour force \u2013 lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills. The West Midlands, for example, has been doing well in the past few years but is being held back by a shortage of skills. But boosting skills doesn\u2019t help the less productive regions if all the newly qualified people head south looking for jobs because there are none available where they live. In parts of the north, higher spending on local infrastructure projects would help by linking smaller towns and cities to the big urban centres. The recognition in the Tory manifesto that the government should both identify the growth industries of the future and seek to locate them across the whole country was welcome. Welcome but belated. The Conservatives effectively left large chunks of Britain to rot in the 1980s. Whichever party forms the next government now has a massive catch-up jobs on its hands. And precious little time.",

Over the next five years, the population of the UK is expected to rise by 3%, but there will be a 9% increase in the number of people over 65 and a 15% increase in those over 85.</p> <p>More old people means higher pension costs despite the increase in the official retirement age and higher health costs, because the average 90-year-old costs eight times as much to treat each year as the average 30-year-old. The share of national income accounted for by pensions has just about doubled since the second world war to 12% of GDP, and is expected to increase by a further seven percentage points over the next half a century. In the post-1945 period, the rise in pension and health spending was matched by a decline in outlays on defence and debt interest. </p> <p>Today, there is no low hanging fruit to be picked, leaving the IFS to conclude that the choice is between increasing the size of the state, reducing spending on pensions and health, or cutting back elsewhere. The slower the economy grows the tougher these choices become.</p> <p>Getting the big picture right is part of the story, and the mix of ultra-low interest rates and austerity used since 2010 has not worked.<br></p> <p>But to a large extent, raising Britain\u2019s game is a local rather than a national issue. Research by the Centre for Cities thinktank shows that productivity in the greater south-east (which includes London) is higher than it is Germany. The problem is that it takes a worker in the north and the Midlands five days to produce what a worker in the greater south-east can produce in three-and-a-half days.</p> <p>The disparity is particularly marked in urban areas. Cities in the greater south-east are 50% more productive than those in the north. Were the gap to be closed, the north\u2019s economy would be \u00a3154bn bigger. That\u2019s the equivalent of adding three more cities the size of Manchester to the northern economy, and potentially a lot of extra resources available for health and pensions.</p> <p>This is a long-standing problem. <a href=\"https://www4.shu.ac.uk/research/cresr/sites/shu.ac.uk/files/cresr30th-jobs-welfare-austerity.pdf\">Work by Steve Fothergill and Christina Beatty</a> at Sheffield Hallam University has shown how the UK\u2019s old manufacturing heartlands have never really recovered from the deindustrialisation of the 1980s and, to make matters worse, have been at the sharp end of the welfare cuts introduced since 2010. </p> <p>The unemployment rate has come down but the jobs that have been created have tended to be in low-wage sectors such as distribution and call centres. Unsurprisingly, there has been an exodus of the young and talented to the more prosperous parts of the country. Those left behind voted in their droves for Brexit because they felt, rightly, that the economy was not working for them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.npi.org.uk/files/4414/9451/3688/An_Industrial_Strategy_for_a_post-Brexit_Britain.pdf\">Peter Kenway of the New Policy Institute observes that Britain\u2019s industrial strategy</a> for the past three decades has been membership of the EU, which has ensured access both to the single market and to labour, which has flowed to the parts of the country that have needed it. This has resulted in faster growth and stronger support for remain in the greater south-east but has brought its own regional problem: a housing shortage. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Brexit-voting parts of the country, by contrast, have not reaped the same benefits. Indeed, they have probably suffered as a result of the concentration of growth in London and the south-east. Why? Because the flow of global capital into the City has pushed up the value of the pound, making life harder for exporters in regions that still rely heavily on manufacturing. Because London\u2019s success has meant it has had first claim on money for infrastructure. And because the brain drain has left cities in the north such as Liverpool and Stoke with large numbers of poorly skilled adults trying to find jobs where opportunities are limited. The problems have been confounded by the unwillingness, at least until recently, to cede any control over the purse strings. Local government has been at the sharp end of austerity.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> So what might a new northern-focused industrial strategy look like? It should start by seeking to to do no more harm. That means reversing the welfare cuts that are sucking spending power out of communities already suffering from a lack of effective demand. It also means welcoming \u2013 and trying to lock in \u2013 a more competitive exchange rate.</p> <p>If the government is serious about reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, Britain cannot afford to have 5 million adults \u2013 around one sixth of the employed labour force \u2013 lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills. The West Midlands, for example, has been doing well in the past few years but is being held back by a shortage of skills.</p> <p>But boosting skills doesn\u2019t help the less productive regions if all the newly qualified people head south looking for jobs because there are none available where they live. In parts of the north, higher spending on local infrastructure projects would help by linking smaller towns and cities to the big urban centres. The recognition in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto\">Tory manifesto</a> that the government should both identify the growth industries of the future and seek to locate them across the whole country was welcome.</p> <p>Welcome but belated. The Conservatives effectively left large chunks of Britain to rot in the 1980s. Whichever party forms the next government now has a massive catch-up jobs on its hands. And precious little time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On 24 June last year, the few hundred residents of a temporary village, hidden from view in the middle of a West Sussex soft fruit farm, received letters. They were signed by David Kay, the managing director of the Hall Hunter Partnership, a business that grows 10% of the UK\u2019s strawberries, 19% of its raspberries and a whacking 42% of its blueberries across thousands of acres, of both glasshouses and polytunnels. The recipients were his seasonal workforce, some of the 3,000 pickers from Bulgaria, Romania and elsewhere who come here each year to get the harvest in, and without whom the business would simply not exist. \u201cI wanted them to know that in the face of the vote for Brexit we would hang together as a family,\u201d he says now, standing amid the mobile homes his workers live in during the summer months. The dwellings come dressed with satellite dishes pointed at news channels in Bulgaria, and pylons delivering high-speed wifi. Some have planted gardens. Tesco Direct delivers their groceries; coaches take them out on excursions.\u201cI\u2019m responsible for both a fruit farm and 2,100 beds,\u201d Kay says. \u201cThat morning I met a lot of very sad and confused workers. For me, personally, it was a shock.\u201d Kay may have wanted to reassure his employees in the immediate aftermath of the vote, but 11 months on their status is no clearer. Indeed, this tidy little village could now stand as a blunt symbol for one of the most serious but little talked about issues arising from the Brexit negotiations: the continued ability of this country to feed itself, if the deal goes wrong. Opponents of EU membership talked during the referendum campaign about sovereignty and control. They railed against the free movement of labour. What they didn\u2019t mention is the way the British food supply chain has, over the past 30 years, become increasingly reliant on workers from elsewhere, both permanent residents and seasonal labour. Last month, as parliament wrapped up for the general election, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee quietly published a short paper called Feeding the Nation: Labour Constraints. As it reported, around 20% of all employees in British agriculture come from abroad, these days mostly Romania and Bulgaria, while 63% of all staff employed by members of the British Meat Processors Association are not from the UK. Around 400,000 people work in food manufacturing here, and more than 30% of those are also from somewhere else. If free movement of labour stops, the British food industry won\u2019t just face difficulties. Some parts will shudder to a halt. Shelves will be emptied. Prices will shoot up. And right now, none of those charged with negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the EU are making promises that this scenario will be averted. Many of them aren\u2019t even engaging with the issue. The soft-fruit business of which Hall Hunter is a part is right at the sharp end of that. \u201cFrom February to November we need 29,000 seasonal workers across the sector,\u201d says Laurence Olins, chair of British Summer Fruits, the crop association for berries, which account for one in every \u00a35 spent on fruit in the UK. \u201cAnd 95% of those are non-UK EU citizens.\u201d The industry has tried to get UK nationals to do the work but they\u2019re simply not interested. \u201cOur hope is for some sort of permit scheme,\u201d Olins says. \u201cBut if, say, we get only half the permits we need, we will simply have only half the size of the industry.\u201d The 29,000 non-UK workers they have are therefore vital. And, what\u2019s more, the number required is growing. Kay agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with job centres and with ex-prisoners, but British people don\u2019t want to do these jobs.\u201d Instead, he says, he gets a steady supply of highly educated and motivated eastern Europeans, most of whom have some connection to farming because their families still have smallholdings. \u201cWe have a return rate of 76% each year,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich means we retain a skills base \u2013 70% of our management arrived here as pickers and worked their way up the ranks.\u201d He shows me a list of the 20 most important people in the company and it\u2019s littered with Slavic surnames \u2013 20 nationalities are represented on site. Some have settled here, put their kids into schools and taken UK citizenship. But many more are just seasonal, coming and going at short notice. Every single one is interviewed for a job by a member of Kay\u2019s team; they run temporary recruitment centres in town halls and civic libraries across eastern Europe. At the farm, amid glasshouses of glossy strawberries planted at shoulder height for easy picking, I meet Zyulfie Yusein, 29, and Nikoloy Kolev, 34. Both are from Bulgaria. Both are graduates. Both first came here to earn a little money as students, returning home with their earnings. Over the years, they\u2019ve stayed longer and longer. \u201cIt\u2019s a great job,\u201d says Yusein. Kolev agrees. \u201cWe work as a team and the team is like family.\u201d But both say the Brexit vote has changed everything. \u201cI worry about the future,\u201d Yusein says. \u201cMy friends worry too. The vote made me feel unsafe.\u201d Kolev says, \u201cGoing back is not an option but what am I going to do?\u201d They are warm, bright, friendly people, but the tension just beneath the surface is palpable. They are already experiencing the downside. The Brexit vote has weakened the pound by up to 20%. Their salaries are worth far less at home than once they were. And the message is getting back to their friends. \u201cSome of the seasonal labour is choosing not to come to the UK because of the value of sterling,\u201d Olins says. \u201cIf you can go to work in a Euro country like Spain, rather than Britain, it\u2019s worth doing so.\u201dThere used to be 10 applicants for every picking job in the UK. Now there are three. \u201cThe candidates we\u2019re getting are older, they have fewer skills, their English is worse.\u201d Is that just down to Brexit? \u201cThe media in the home countries has been reporting attacks on immigrants to the UK,\u201d he says. The mood here has changed. And it risks imperilling the harvest British citizens don\u2019t want to help bring in. On 26 July, 2016, a little over a month after the referendum vote, representatives of more than 40 food and drink associations gathered in the meeting room on the sixth floor of the Food and Drink Federation\u2019s HQ on London\u2019s Bloomsbury Way. Here were representatives of the British Poultry Council and the Federation of Bakers, the British Growers Association, the National Association of Cider Makers and many more besides. They were joined by civil servants from Defra, the Food Standards Agency, the Department for Business, David Davis\u2019s Brexit department and HMRC. The meeting had been called by Ian Wright, a former executive at drinks company Diageo who now heads the Food and Drink Federation. The meeting was to coordinate a response to Brexit. And top of the agenda was the issue of labour. The same group has met every month since. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we started out with a degree of surprise at all levels,\u201d Wright says. \u201cVery few ministers or civil servants understood the nature of the food-chain workforce.\u201d He believes they have managed to get the message across, but that\u2019s a very different thing to dealing with the issue, given the refusal by Downing Street to be drawn on their negotiating positions. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s a great deal of work going on to define the choices the prime minister will have to take to sustain the variety and complexity of the food supply chain.\u201d The alternative, he says, is fewer choices for consumers or sources of labour from outside the EU. Early in this election campaign Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, made a commitment to guarantee the rights of the estimated 3.9 million EU citizens living in the UK on day one of a Labour government. David Davis met this with a soothing assertion of a swift deal to secure those rights. That\u2019s not surprising. The non-UK citizens here are mostly of working age and economically active. The 900,000 UK citizens in Europe are mostly pensioners living out their retirement on the sun belt in increasingly poor health. Theresa May\u2019s government is desperate not to have them sent back for fear of the pressure they will place on the NHS. But what matters is not those living here full-time but the seasonal workforce that comes and goes. Until 2013, there was a seasonal-labour permit scheme which, ironically, was abolished, because the EU free movement system was deemed to be working so well. A replacement would be needed. Pushed for a number of permits required, Wright suggests \u201caround half a million\u201d. Hard-line Brexiters, committed to an end to the free movement of labour, might well find this unpalatable. Indeed, one of the big food-sector bodies told me they received off-the-record calls from civil servants warning them to shut up, because they had been quoted in newspapers talking about the seriousness of the labour supply to the food chain. \u201cWe were told we would just enrage the hard-line Brexiteers,\u201d a member of the body told me. The problem is compounded because some sectors need a huge mass of workers. Others need very few. In some areas of the food chain, it can be down to just a few dozen people who keep the whole thing running. For example, under Food Standards Agency rules, an abattoir in England, Wales or Northern Ireland cannot operate unless the animals on the way to slaughter are overseen by one of their vets. This is work British vets don\u2019t want to do. They would rather be out on the farm with livestock in the prime of their lives, or dealing with domestic pets. As a result, at least 85% of vets in British abattoirs are not from the UK. Apparently, the majority are Spanish. And if they couldn\u2019t get into the country to do the job, the meat supply chain would collapse. While Ian Wright is good at the diplomatic phrase, others feel less constrained. In the months running up to the Brexit referendum, Tim Lang, professor of food policy at London\u2019s City University, co-authored a briefing paper on Britain\u2019s dependency on EU member states for its food. It dealt in detail with seasonal labour from the EU. He can be forgiven for wondering why he bothered. \u201cThe civil service is dispirited and uncertain of what they\u2019re doing because they haven\u2019t been given any signals,\u201d Lang says now. \u201cThere\u2019s not a bleep about food policy coming from ministers. There has been a stunning silence from Andrea Leadsom, the Defra minister, on this matter of national importance. Basically, if on March 31, 2019, migrant labour is not sorted the food system is fucked.\u201d And then he says, \u201cI hope those who voted Brexit and who still want to eat British are prepared to go to Lincolnshire in winter to pick vegetables.\u201d Or as Wright puts it, \u201cFood is at the heart of national security. If you can\u2019t feed a country you haven\u2019t got a country.\u201d For five years as a food reporter for the BBC\u2019s One Show, I used to travel the country from one strip-lit food production unit to another, looking at exactly where our food came from. The ethnic mix was always striking. The media were forever talking about a British food revolution; of a homegrown improvement in quality at both small and large scale. And the companies were indeed British, but so many of the people doing the actual producing were not. I visited cake factories where the health and safety notices were in both English and Polish; was given tours of vegetable processing plants where the floor managers needed a smattering of four eastern European languages to get by. I take a train north from Hall Hunter\u2019s fruit farm, to the North Yorkshire home of Heck Sausages, run by Debbie and Andrew Keeble. In just four years their innovative range of gluten-free sausages \u2013 from pork and apple, through square to non-meat alternatives \u2013 has been stocked by all the major supermarkets. Their turnover is projected to reach \u00a318m this year and they are about to move into a new plant which will enable them to run multiple production lines. The only issue is workforce, which will have to double. Of the 60 people currently working in production, 85% are from eastern Europe; like Hall Hunter, Heck can\u2019t get British people to do the work. I ask Debbie Keeble what an end to free movement of labour would mean to her business. \u201cIt would be cataclysmic,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one here will take these jobs.\u201d The Heck factory is in an area that voted strongly for Brexit. \u201cDuring the referendum, campaigners were going on about people coming over here taking our jobs. Well, they\u2019re not, because nobody here applies for them.\u201d Mostly she says it\u2019s word of mouth, with new employees coming either directly from Latvia or Romania or from within the communities in the UK. I talk to one young Romanian woman, Georgeta Iclodean, who talks about getting increasing amounts of hassle from Border Agency officials when she re-enters Britain. \u201cI make sure to have all my papers with me now,\u201d she says. I meet 34-year-old Vladim Protasovs from Latvia who came to Heck in 2014 and has risen to be one of the line managers. \u201cI like working in the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big difference from Latvia.\u201d But Brexit has changed everything. \u201cMy children are settled in school here,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we had to go back it would be so hard, not just for me but for them. There\u2019s lot of people who want to come from Latvia to work in the UK, but they are worried. I call my friends to say there are jobs but they don\u2019t want to come.\u201d Then he says: \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d It\u2019s a good question. The truth is nobody knows, not the business leaders, not the diplomats and certainly not the politicians. The prime minister and her team have portrayed negotiations as a game of poker, used the language of hands unrevealed and bluffs, while failing to recognise that the analogy doesn\u2019t work; poker is a winner-takes-all game and Britain cannot afford to lose everything. The Brexit deal isn\u2019t just about vague concepts of nationhood. It isn\u2019t simply about international standing or the ebb and flow of trade.It\u2019s about the lives of individual people like Protasovs and Iclodean, Yusein and Kolev; the ones prepared to do the back-breaking jobs British people are not. What\u2019s more, this is not just their crisis, to be worked out in anguished letters home. It\u2019s ours too. Because without them and the half a million seasonal workers like them, our very ability to feed ourselves, at a price we can all afford, is in peril. In the forthcoming Brexit negotiations that is what\u2019s really at stake.",

And, what\u2019s more, the number required is growing.</p> <p>Kay agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with job centres and with ex-prisoners, but British people don\u2019t want to do these jobs.\u201d Instead, he says, he gets a steady supply of highly educated and motivated eastern Europeans, most of whom have some connection to farming because their families still have smallholdings. \u201cWe have a return rate of 76% each year,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich means we retain a skills base \u2013 70% of our management arrived here as pickers and worked their way up the ranks.\u201d He shows me a list of the 20 most important people in the company and it\u2019s littered with Slavic surnames \u2013 20 nationalities are represented on site.</p> <p>Some have settled here, put their kids into schools and taken UK citizenship. But many more are just seasonal, coming and going at short notice. Every single one is interviewed for a job by a member of Kay\u2019s team; they run temporary recruitment centres in town halls and civic libraries across eastern Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a9b584b275a1be83f12c7656b48582b4f1e7fa0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9b584b275a1be83f12c7656b48582b4f1e7fa0/0_423_4961_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heck Sausages in Yorkshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Heck Sausages in Yorkshire, 85% of the workers in production come from eastern Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the farm, amid glasshouses of glossy strawberries planted at shoulder height for easy picking, I meet Zyulfie Yusein, 29, and Nikoloy Kolev, 34. Both are from Bulgaria. Both are graduates. Both first came here to earn a little money as students, returning home with their earnings. Over the years, they\u2019ve stayed longer and longer. \u201cIt\u2019s a great job,\u201d says Yusein. Kolev agrees. \u201cWe work as a team and the team is like family.\u201d But both say the Brexit vote has changed everything. \u201cI worry about the future,\u201d Yusein says. \u201cMy friends worry too. The vote made me feel unsafe.\u201d Kolev says, \u201cGoing back is not an option but what am I going to do?\u201d They are warm, bright, friendly people, but the tension just beneath the surface is palpable. They are already experiencing the downside. The Brexit vote has weakened the pound by up to 20%. Their salaries are worth far less at home than once they were.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/13/uk-labour-shortages-brexit-as-eu-worker-numbers-fall\">And the message is getting back</a> to their friends. \u201cSome of the seasonal labour is choosing not to come to the UK because of the value of sterling,\u201d Olins says. \u201cIf you can go to work in a Euro country like Spain, rather than Britain, it\u2019s worth doing so.\u201dThere used to be 10 applicants for every picking job in the UK. Now there are three. \u201cThe candidates we\u2019re getting are older, they have fewer skills, their English is worse.\u201d Is that just down to Brexit? \u201cThe media in the home countries has been reporting attacks on immigrants to the UK,\u201d he says. The mood here has changed. And it risks imperilling the harvest British citizens don\u2019t want to help bring in.</p> <p>On 26 July, 2016<strong>, </strong>a little over a month after the referendum vote, representatives of more than<strong> </strong>40 food and drink associations gathered in the meeting room on the sixth floor of the Food and Drink Federation\u2019s HQ on London\u2019s Bloomsbury Way. Here were representatives of the British Poultry Council and the Federation of Bakers, the British Growers Association, the National Association of Cider Makers and many more besides. They were joined by civil servants from Defra, the Food Standards Agency, the Department for Business, David Davis\u2019s Brexit department and HMRC. The meeting had been called by Ian Wright, a former executive at drinks company Diageo who now heads the Food and Drink Federation. The meeting was to coordinate a response to Brexit. And top of the agenda was the issue of labour. The same group has met every month since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve worked with job centres and with ex-prisoners, but British people don\u2019t want to do these jobs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we started out with a degree of surprise at all levels,\u201d Wright says. \u201cVery few ministers or civil servants understood the nature of the food-chain workforce.\u201d He believes they have managed to get the message across, but that\u2019s a very different thing to dealing with the issue, given the refusal by Downing Street to be drawn on their negotiating positions. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s a great deal of work going on to define the choices the prime minister will have to take to sustain the variety and complexity of the food supply chain.\u201d The alternative, he says, is fewer choices for consumers or sources of labour from outside the EU.</p> <p>Early in this election campaign Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, made a commitment to guarantee the rights of the estimated 3.9 million EU citizens living in the UK on day one of a Labour government. David Davis met this with a soothing assertion of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/26/david-davis-promises-swift-deal-to-protect-eu-citizens-in-uk\">a swift deal to secure those rights</a>. That\u2019s not surprising. The non-UK citizens here are mostly of working age and economically active. The 900,000 UK citizens in Europe are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/27/fewer-britons-in-rest-of-europe-than-previously-thought-ons-research\"> mostly pensioners living out their retirement on the sun belt</a> in increasingly poor health. Theresa May\u2019s government is desperate not to have them sent back for fear of the pressure they will place on the NHS.</p> <p>But what matters is not those living here full-time but the seasonal workforce that comes and goes. Until 2013, there was a seasonal-labour permit scheme which, ironically, was abolished, because the EU free movement system was deemed to be working so well. A replacement would be needed. Pushed for a number of permits required, Wright suggests \u201caround half a million\u201d. Hard-line Brexiters, committed to an end to the free movement of labour, might well find this unpalatable. Indeed, one of the big food-sector bodies told me they received off-the-record calls from civil servants warning them to shut up, because they had been quoted in newspapers talking about the seriousness of the labour supply to the food chain. \u201cWe were told we would just enrage the hard-line Brexiteers,\u201d a member of the body told me.</p> <p>The problem is compounded because some sectors need a huge mass of workers. Others need very few. In some areas of the food chain, it can be down to just a few dozen people who keep the whole thing running. For example, under Food Standards Agency rules, an abattoir in England, Wales or Northern Ireland cannot operate unless the animals on the way to slaughter are overseen by one of their vets. This is work British vets don\u2019t want to do. They would rather be out on the farm with livestock in the prime of their lives, or dealing with domestic pets. As a result, at least 85% of vets in British abattoirs are not from the UK. Apparently, the majority are Spanish. And <a href=\"https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/bva-community/bva-blog/brexit-through-the-eyes-of-a-spanish-vet/\">if they couldn\u2019t get into the country to do the job</a>, the meat supply chain would collapse.</p> <p>While Ian Wright is good at the diplomatic phrase, others feel less constrained. In the months running up to the Brexit referendum, Tim Lang, professor of food policy at London\u2019s City University, co-authored a briefing paper on Britain\u2019s dependency on EU member states for its food. It dealt in detail with seasonal labour from the EU. He can be forgiven for wondering why he bothered. \u201cThe civil service is dispirited and uncertain of what they\u2019re doing because they haven\u2019t been given any signals,\u201d Lang says now. \u201cThere\u2019s not a bleep about food policy coming from ministers. There has been a stunning silence from Andrea Leadsom, the Defra minister, on this matter of national importance. Basically, if on March 31, 2019, migrant labour is not sorted the food system is fucked.\u201d And then he says, \u201cI hope those who voted Brexit and who still want to eat British are prepared to go to Lincolnshire in winter to pick vegetables.\u201d Or as Wright puts it, \u201cFood is at the heart of national security. If you can\u2019t feed a country you haven\u2019t <em>got</em> a country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"79fd232efbf9689f9461dd20408cd6fd1c04fc77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79fd232efbf9689f9461dd20408cd6fd1c04fc77/0_602_3744_4680/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hall Hunter\u2019s farms rely on EU workers.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hall Hunter\u2019s farms rely on EU workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Lake for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For five years as a food reporter for the BBC\u2019s <em>One Show</em>, I used to travel the country from one strip-lit food production unit to another, looking at exactly where our food came from. The ethnic mix was always striking. The media were forever talking about a British food revolution; of a homegrown improvement in quality at both small and large scale. And the companies were indeed British, but so many of the people doing the actual producing were not. I visited cake factories where the health and safety notices were in both English and Polish; was given tours of vegetable processing plants where the floor managers needed a smattering of four eastern European languages to get by. </p> <p>I take a train north from Hall Hunter\u2019s fruit farm, to the North Yorkshire home of Heck Sausages, run by Debbie and Andrew Keeble. In just four years their innovative range of gluten-free sausages \u2013 from pork and apple, through square to non-meat alternatives \u2013 has been stocked by all the major supermarkets. Their turnover is projected to reach \u00a318m this year and they are about to move into a new plant which will enable them to run multiple production lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fd16a1c0a510a8e38402640418161928226445b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fd16a1c0a510a8e38402640418161928226445b/0_676_4961_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Keeble from heck sausages\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Keeble of Heck.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The only issue is workforce, which will have to double. Of the 60 people currently working in production, 85% are from eastern Europe; like Hall Hunter, Heck can\u2019t get British people to do the work. I ask Debbie Keeble what an end to free movement of labour would mean to her business. \u201cIt would be cataclysmic,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one here will take these jobs.\u201d The Heck factory is in an area that voted strongly for Brexit. \u201cDuring the referendum, campaigners were going on about people coming over here taking our jobs. Well, they\u2019re not, because nobody here applies for them.\u201d</p> <p>Mostly she says it\u2019s word of mouth, with new employees coming either directly from Latvia or Romania or from within the communities in the UK. I talk to one young Romanian woman, Georgeta Iclodean, who talks about getting increasing amounts of hassle from Border Agency officials when she re-enters Britain. \u201cI make sure to have all my papers with me now,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I meet 34-year-old Vladim Protasovs from Latvia who came to Heck in 2014 and has risen to be one of the line managers. \u201cI like working in the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big difference from Latvia.\u201d But Brexit has changed everything. \u201cMy children are settled in school here,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we had to go back it would be so hard, not just for me but for them. There\u2019s lot of people who want to come from Latvia to work in the UK, but they are worried. I call my friends to say there are jobs but they don\u2019t want to come.\u201d</p> <p>Then he says: \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d It\u2019s a good question. The truth is nobody knows, not the business leaders, not the diplomats and certainly not the politicians. The prime minister and her team have portrayed negotiations as a game of poker, used the language of hands unrevealed and bluffs, while failing to recognise that the analogy doesn\u2019t work; poker is a winner-takes-all game and Britain cannot afford to lose everything.</p> <p>The Brexit deal isn\u2019t just about vague concepts of nationhood. It isn\u2019t simply about international standing or the ebb and flow of trade.It\u2019s about the lives of individual people like Protasovs and Iclodean, Yusein and Kolev; the ones prepared to do the back-breaking jobs British people are not. What\u2019s more, this is not just their crisis, to be worked out in anguished letters home. It\u2019s ours too. Because without them and the half a million seasonal workers like them, our very ability to feed ourselves, at a price we can all afford, is in peril. In the forthcoming Brexit negotiations that is what\u2019s really at stake. </p>",

That was the slightly bizarre line pulled from a study being punted around by Marks &amp; Spencer earlier this month, as it took time off from running a clothing business that for 133 years has largely stuck to familiar patterns. Still, as we await the group\u2019s results this week, M&amp;S is going through one of its periodic attempts to do things differently by updating itself. Its newish chief exec, Steve Rowe, is to be joined by a fresh chairman, former Asda chief executive Archie Norman. Meanwhile, the retailer is also poaching Halfords boss Jill McDonald to run the clothing business \u2013 the improvement of which is Rowe\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority\u201d as well as it being something of a family dominion. Not only did Rowe once have that job himself, but so did his father Joe \u2013 whose tenure as an M&amp;S director is perhaps best remembered for his decision to tell the 1999 annual meeting: \u201cMy wife, who is 52 I think, buys her underwear from M&amp;S and I have to say it does look quite sexy.\u201d Or as Rowe fils\u2019 new research put it: \u201cThe average person in Britain makes 15 decisions on autopilot a day ... without truly thinking about them\u201d. If only more people would buy M&amp;S clothing using the same rationale. Halfords lacks a spare boss Jill McDonald will not be joining M&amp;S until October, at the end of her notice period as boss of the bike-shop-cum-car-accessory-store Halfords. The chain has been shifting a few more chamois leathers under her two-year command and who gets to grab the handlebars when she dismounts is likely to be the main focus during its results this week. The trading numbers are already a given \u2013 seeing as the company tried to soften the blow of news of McDonald\u2019s departure by announcing that results were expected to be in line with market predictions. But that didn\u2019t stop the shares from slipping, as investors fretted that, despite the company making a lot of progress over the past few years, it keeps hiring decent chief execs who end up getting poached. McDonald\u2019s predecessor Matt Davies began the company\u2019s so-called transformation (currently dubbed \u201cMoving Up a Gear\u201d), only to leave in 2015 to go and run Tesco\u2019s UK and Ireland stores. Now McDonald is defecting too. As Liberum puts it: \u201cSecuring a credible replacement with relevant expertise will be critical in order to maintain the market\u2019s confidence in the strategy and growth prospects\u201d. Developing. Co-ops in cyberspace? How does Twitter start to handle all of that hate speech and abuse that constantly seems to swamp its platform, as well as possibly finding new revenue sources and innovating? No, not by hiding the phone of the US commander in chief. The answer, at least according to a couple of Twitter shareholders, is to take the company off the stock exchange and convert it into a co-operative. At this week\u2019s annual meeting, shareholders will get to vote on a proposal that the firm starts to \u201cprepare a report on the nature and feasibility of selling the platform to its users via a co-operative or similar structure with broad-based ownership and accountability mechanisms\u201d \u2013 and you can quickly guess what the board reckons to all that. Still, Wall Street lawyers being Wall Street lawyers, the response is tedious and lengthy, employing phrases such as: \u201cOur directors and management are constantly seeking to maximise long-term stockholder value and do so by evaluating all opportunities to strengthen and focus our business.\u201d All of which might be overkill \u2013 when 140 characters would probably have sufficed \u2013 as even the campaign organisers don\u2019t sound hopeful. Their motion needs 50% support to be carried, but the petition\u2019s website states glumly: \u201cEven with 3%, we can learn and re-submit next year.\u201d",

A recent exception was Tony Blair, who \u2013 for a time \u2013 achieved rock star status with the media. Many reports have suggested that when presented with individual Labour policies \u2013 in what one might call a \u201cblind tasting\u201d \u2013 respondents have been much more enthusiastic than when the names of Corbyn and some of his colleagues come up. One peculiarity of this campaign is that policies such as caps on the charges made by energy suppliers were derided by the Conservatives when propagated by Corbyn\u2019s predecessor, Ed Miliband, but have now been brazenly filched by Theresa May. This is in accordance with the first law of Conservative dynamics: do anything to stay in, or regain, power. However, I did not get where I am today by going into every detail of political manifestos. What I find interesting about the broad thrust of the manifestos of both main parties is that, in their own way, the Conservatives and Labour are slowly abandoning the pretence that we can have Scandinavian levels of public service with US levels of taxation. I am not sure that this applies to the lunatic fringe of Tory Brexiters. They want to turn this country into a low-tax, Singapore-style entrepreneurial fantasy. (In my experience, these people have no idea of the history of Singapore, let alone how state-controlled it actually is.) In the past Labour has tied itself in knots with commitments ruling out increases in principal tax rates, resorting to all manner of subterfuge instead. The Tories have been no better. In which context, younger readers may be amused to learn that, during the 1979 election, there were persistent rumours that the Tories planned to double the rate of VAT from 8% to 16%. These were strenuously denied. Guess what? When they came in, they raised it to 15%. When May stated on 30 April that \u201cwe have absolutely no plans to increase the level of tax\u201d it was time to start counting the spoons. It reminded some of us of George Bush Sr\u2019s remark: \u201cRead my lips. No new taxes.\u201d Bush\u2019s words were widely misinterpreted: in fact, they left ample scope for raising the level of existing tax rates. In May\u2019s case, the sceptical listener will have rightly thought: \u201cAh, yes. No plans until after the election.\u201d May went on: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make specific proposals on taxes unless I\u2019m absolutely sure that I can deliver on those.\u201d Note what journalists tend to call the \u201cvertical pronoun\u201d: that regal \u201cI\u201d. No wonder there has been intense speculation about the chancellor\u2019s future. Philip Hammond had made the point that running the economy demanded flexibility in tax policy. He knew all too well that the practice of ruling out increases in specific tax rates restricted the Treasury\u2019s room for manoeuvre. He seems to have made his point, but May is by all accounts someone who bears grudges. Tory chancellors have a habit of falling out with their prime ministers. Nigel Lawson fell out with Mrs Thatcher. Norman Lamont fell out with John Major. George Osborne fell out with May many times when she was home secretary but did not get the chance to confront her over policy when she became prime minister because she sacked him on day one. Didn\u2019t get a chance as chancellor, that is. As editor of the London Evening Standard, he falls out with May almost daily. Although he did not stand up against the very idea of that stupid referendum on Brexit when in cabinet, he is doing his best to atone for it now. In an unsigned editorial last week Osborne revealed that no one else in the cabinet, not even the extreme Brexiters, agreed with May\u2019s manifesto aim to reduce net immigration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d. For Osborne, this policy is not only unachievable but also \u201ceconomically illiterate\u201d. Quite right. When one considers the needs of the health service, education, research institutes and hosts of businesses, it is insane \u2013 but, I fear, all too typical of the absurdity and self-harm of the whole Brexit venture. It is depressing to hear there are people who say they voted Remain but who now say \u201cwe might as well get on with it\u201d. Get on with heading for the economic cliff? Are they men, women or mice? We should be told. Meanwhile, as leader of what has become the Conservative and Ukip party, May continues to pursue net immigration targets that she failed to achieve during all those years as home secretary. In a perceptive review of a recent biography of May, the writer David Runciman warned us that her main object as prime minister is to concentrate on this chimera of drastic cuts in immigration. It is utterly shameful that she is thus prepared \u2013 in her chancellor\u2019s words before article 50 was invoked \u2013 to make the country poorer by sacrificing our membership of the European customs union and the single market. The irony is that, however sincere she may be in wanting to change the \u201cnasty party\u201d into a more caring government, the impact of Brexit on the nation\u2019s finances will almost certainly frustrate her ambition. It will aggravate the ills of an economy that is already experiencing stagnant incomes and the continuing effects of a misconceived austerity policy. Finally, I note that the Brexiters, and others, are seizing on any emollient statement from Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator on the other side. Well, I wonder. President de Gaulle made it difficult for us to join the EU and the French and the others are unlikely to make it painless for us to leave. Will this country ever wake up?",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A credit crunch is brewing and when it happens, the UK is going to get hurt. That is the message emerging from senior executives in the financial services industry, who do not think Britain has changed that much since the 2008 credit disaster and the devastating crash that followed. Three developments lie at the heart of this disturbing analysis: spectacular growth in the sale of second mortgages, car loans and credit cards. Second mortgages are widely seen as a signal of consumers taking on risky levels of debt that leave them vulnerable to a downturn in the economy. It was the same before the last banking crash. Tens of thousands of households, many of them struggling to pay monthly mortgage payments, used second mortgages to bypass borrowing limits set by their mortgage lender. The latest industry figures show the number of people opting to saddle themselves with a second mortgage leapt 22% in March to its highest level since 2008. Car loans are already on the regulator\u2019s radar. Like second mortgages, they are considered secured credit on the basis that lenders have a claim against an asset when borrowers can no longer pay monthly instalments. But cars depreciate from the moment they are bought, so they rank low down the scale of secure credit. And loans have turned in recent years into leases that have customers renewing contracts every three years, keeping them in effect permanently hooked. The main consumer regulator for the financial services industry, the Financial Conduct Authority, is reviewing the market for car leasing, which now accounts for more than 90% of car sales, to check for mis-selling to poorer households who will be vulnerable to default. The Bank of England is also on the case. More importantly, it is also looking at the big picture and what happens if unemployment suddenly rises and a large number of households default on payments. Officials at the Bank have a growing list of concerns. Not only is there the second mortgage problem and the number of car loans: figures show consumer spending on unsecured credit has also rocketed in the last year. In March alone, the amount UK consumers owed on loans and cards grew by \u00a31.9bn, the highest figure in 11 years. Households are known to have increased their reliance on short-term unsecured loans to buy cars and furniture, and to kit out new kitchens. Some use them to maintain their lifestyle in the face of a decade of flat wages. Unfortunately, another group use credit to pay the monthly rent. Shelter, the homelessness charity, says one in three renters \u2013 around half a million people \u2013 on low incomes are having to borrow money to pay the rent. It said the borrowing is often from family and friends, but also on credit cards and through loans. The Bank has warned about consumer credit and has attempted to allay fears that the credit industry is out of control with a review to consider possible restrictions. Talk to financial services industry executives, though, and you get a hollow laugh. Regulators are compromised by the need to keep credit flowing. Why? Because credit has kept the economy in fourth gear for the last two year. Step on the credit brake and the economy will inevitably slow. A sign of regulators\u2019 weakness can be found in the relentless teaser interest rates and interest-free periods that lenders use to win customers. Ferocious competition among lenders \u2013 encouraged in the name of free-market efficiency \u2013 has resulted in interest-free periods on credit cards that last more than three years. The financial advice charity StepChange says 8.8 million people are showing signs of financial difficulty and risk falling into serious hardship. With the regulators afraid to \u201cpull the punch bowl away in the middle of the party\u201d, as former Bank governor Lord King put it as he surveyed the wreckage caused by the 2008 crash, those at risk must fear another credit crunch looming into view. RBS and LLoyds \u2013 different, and yet sharing so much Try as they might, the UK\u2019s two big high street lenders cannot put the financial crisis behind them. Last week, when Lloyds Banking Group was congratulating itself over its return to the private sector, it was still being haunted by the fraud perpetrated at the Reading branch of HBOS, the hotshot lender it rescued in 2008. To add to the pressure, Noel Edmonds, the TV celebrity, is leading the campaign for compensation for the victims of the fraud which took place in the run-up to the financial crisis. This week, Royal Bank of Scotland will be transported back to those calamitous days of 2008. A high court judge will begin hearing a claim for compensation from investors who backed a \u00a312bn cash call by RBS in April 2008 \u2013 only for the Edinburgh-based institution to be bailed out by taxpayers six months later. As a result of the lawsuit, disgraced former RBS boss Fred Goodwin is scheduled to give evidence to the court, along with former boardroom colleagues, including Sir Tom McKillop. Unless RBS can clinch a last-minute settlement with the remaining shareholders \u2013 some 87% of them have already agreed to a deal \u2013 the case will open on Monday. It will, as the current RBS chief executive Ross McEwan put it, \u201ctake the organisation back to 2008\u201d. As it is, McEwan is still grappling with problems that date back a decade: the multibillion-pound penalty from the US authorities over the mis-selling of mortgage bonds, and disposal of 300 branches demanded by the EU as punishment for its bailout. Until these are sorted, there is little chance of the government selling off its RBS shareholding of more than 70% \u2013 a constant reminder of the 2008 meltdown. But while this appears to set RBS apart from a Lloyds now freed from taxpayer support, the two banks\u2019 fortunes are more closely tied than ever. In their efforts to throw off the 2008 crisis, they have abandoned their international ambitions and focused on the UK \u2013 just at a time when Brexit is threatening the economy. Got a Basquiat in the loft? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and when the beholder is a billionaire, it commands a hell of a price. Japanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa has splashed $110.5m on a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat just a year after spending $57m on another of the artist\u2019s works. These sums paint a clearer picture of Maezawa\u2019s personal taste than they do of the state of the art market, which has cooled since the heady days of 2015. That year saw two works, by Willem de Kooning and Paul Gaugin, smash records by hitting the $300m mark. Since then, there has been nothing to trouble the top 10 biggest sales. But if there\u2019s one thing the super-rich enjoy more, it\u2019s outdoing each other in the extravagance stakes. Now might be the time to explore the attic for those long-lost masterpieces. Any of us could be just a rare Rothko away from early retirement.",

A high court judge will begin hearing a claim for compensation from investors who backed a \u00a312bn cash call by RBS in April 2008 \u2013 only for the Edinburgh-based institution to be bailed out by taxpayers six months later.</p> <p>As a result of the lawsuit, disgraced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/19/rbs-fred-goodwin-court-bank-bailout-shareholders\" title=\"\">former RBS boss Fred Goodwin is scheduled to give evidence</a> to the court, along with former boardroom colleagues, including Sir Tom McKillop. Unless RBS can clinch a last-minute settlement with the remaining shareholders \u2013 some 87% of them have already agreed to a deal \u2013 the case will open on Monday. It will, as the current RBS chief executive Ross McEwan put it, \u201ctake the organisation back to 2008\u201d.</p> <p>As it is, McEwan is still grappling with problems that date back a decade: the multibillion-pound penalty from the US authorities over the mis-selling of mortgage bonds, and disposal of 300 branches demanded by the EU as punishment for its bailout. Until these are sorted, there is little chance of the government selling off its RBS shareholding of more than 70% \u2013 a constant reminder of the 2008 meltdown.</p> <p>But while this appears to set RBS apart from a Lloyds now freed from taxpayer support, the two banks\u2019 fortunes are more closely tied than ever. In their efforts to throw off the 2008 crisis, they have abandoned their international ambitions and focused on the UK \u2013 just at a time when Brexit is threatening the economy.</p> <h2>Got a Basquiat in the loft?</h2> <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and when the beholder is a billionaire, it commands a hell of a price. Japanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa has splashed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/19/jean-michel-basquiat-110m-sothebys\" title=\"\">$110.5m on a painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> just a year after spending $57m on another of the artist\u2019s works.</p> <p>These sums paint a clearer picture of Maezawa\u2019s personal taste than they do of the state of the art market, which has cooled since the heady days of 2015. That year saw two works, by Willem de Kooning and Paul Gaugin, smash records by hitting the $300m mark. Since then, there has been nothing to trouble the top 10 biggest sales. But if there\u2019s one thing the super-rich enjoy more, it\u2019s outdoing each other in the extravagance stakes.</p> <p>Now might be the time to explore the attic for those long-lost masterpieces. Any of us could be just a rare Rothko away from early retirement.</p>",
