      "bodyText": "The inquiry into the west coast mainline franchise competition has demanded a trawl of Department for Transport emails to search for rumoured \"anyone but Branson\" comments after finding that bidding companies were treated differently. The DfT's permanent secretary, Philip Rutnam, told MPs that although he had no evidence of such emails, both the inquiry, led by Sam Laidlaw, and the civil service's own internal staff investigation would be checking the correspondence. Virgin has long suspected that antipathy towards it played a part in the award of the lucrative London-Manchester-Glasgow train service to FirstGroup before the franchise competition was aborted. Rutnam said he knew of no bias or impropriety, and he \u2013 not ministers \u2013 had taken the \"precautionary\" decision to suspend three civil servants. Questioned by the Commons transport select committee as to why ministers had defended the process as \"robust\" despite apparent early warnings that it was awry, Rutnam said that while he \"would expect that\" problems would be relayed to ministers, he could not say if they had been alerted in this case. Rutnam said that even he himself, as the senior civil servant in the department, was debarred from the decision-making process under confidentiality rules. But he believed that the mistakes now highlighted had been \"textbook errors\", and added: \"I thought, where is the quality assurance process?\" He also questioned whether the rules on anonymity were helpful in the procurement process. Facing MPs alongside Rutnam at the select committee, the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, admitted that \"things went very badly wrong\" and that the total cost of the debacle would rise far beyond the \u00a340m already earmarked to compensate bidders. He said the extra costs would include reimbursing FirstGroup and also Directly Operated Railways for preparatory work done before the decision was made to allow Virgin to continue running the line when its contract expires in December. He did not rule out legal action from FirstGroup, whose shares dropped 20% when the award was overturned. Despite the shock to his company, FirstGroup's boss, Tim O'Toole, made a robust defence of rail franchising and the privatised system. Speaking at the Guardian's annual George Bradshaw address, O'Toole said the rail industry had to \"confidently defend the current business model even in the wake of the current fiasco\". He said: \"The rail franchising system has produced spectacular growth and the structure going forward must do the same.\" He warned that the call for shorter franchises \u2013 reiterated this week by Labour's Alistair Darling \u2013 was a \"kneejerk reaction\" and said it should be \"tempered by the effort to preserve the advantages of longer franchises\". The interim report released this week by Laidlaw, Centrica's chief executive, found that the overstretched department breached its own guidelines and continued to run the franchise competition even after it became aware of problems that made a legal challenge likely. His final report is due by the end of November. Virgin is negotiating terms of its contract extension for the next 14 months while a two-year franchise is awarded. The government plans to run a long-term competition in that time.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australian-owned Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks slumped to a loss in the last 12 months, weighed down by losses on commercial property loans which have turned sour. In the midst of a programme to cut 1,500 jobs by 2015, the banks reported a \u00a3183m loss in the year to the end of September and put pressure on its Australian parent company National Australia Bank (NAB), which suffered its first drop in profits since 2009. Some 468 UK jobs have already been axed in the cost cutting programme and the group chief executive, Cameron Clyne, acknowledged \"ongoing challenges\" in the UK market were dragging down the overall group. \"The group has taken action on several key issues during the year. While the Australian and New Zealand businesses performed well, ongoing weak economic conditions in the UK led to our decision in April to restructure and re-focus UK banking,\" he said. Once regarded as a potential major competitor to the traditional big four players on the UK high street, NAB is now scaling back in the UK and no longer cited as a potential bidder for branches being put up for sale. The bad debt charge for the UK business reached \u00a3631m, a rise of nearly 90%, and was largely due the fall in commercial property prices on which the bank had granted loans in the run up to the 2008 crisis. David Thornburn, chief executive of Clydesdale and Yorkshire, insisted the bank was improving: \"We are making progress with implementing our strategy to become a stronger and more competitive business in what remains a very difficult economic environment.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unemployment in the eurozone has risen to a new record, with more than one in four out of work in Spain and Greece. There are now 18.49 million people without jobs in the 17 countries sharing the euro, said the European statistics office Eurostat on Wednesday with an extra 146,000 joining the ranks of the unemployed last month. Youth unemployment \u2013 joblessness among under-25s \u2013 rose to 23.3%, up from 21% during the same month a year ago. The prospect of high and rising unemployment, especially among younger workers, is expected to persuade the European Central Bank to cut interest rates in the new year from the current record low of 0.75% to support the flagging economy, which probably slumped back to recession in the third quarter, analysts said. But in contrast to the hope of stimulus from the ECB, Brussels and most eurozone governments have put cuts in spending ahead of schemes to create jobs, despite predictions that the situation will worsen over the coming months. Portugal's right of centre administration on Wednesday pushed through its third attempt at a budget for 2013, which is expected to lead to a third year of contraction and rising unemployment. Likewise Greece's coalition government published \u20ac13.5bn of spending cuts and tax rises that will result in a sixth year of falling GDP and and increase in the jobless rate. Eurostat said the jobless rate across the eurozone increased to 11.6% in September, the highest on record, from a revised 11.5% in August. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.4%), Luxembourg (5.2%), Germany and the Netherlands (both 5.4%), which are near full employment. Spain (25.8%) and Greece (25.1% in July) had the highest unemployment in the eurozone, while France looks much like Italy (both at 10.8%), with a steady rise in joblessness. August data for Greece will be published next week, although the true picture is probably worse than the official figures show as a growing number of Greek workers remain nominally employed but have not been paid for some time. Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the jobless data was \"dismal\", adding: \"Eurozone labour markets remain under serious pressure from ongoing weakened economic activity and low business confidence.\" Youth unemployment also hit a new high in Spain with 54.2% of under-25-year-olds out of work, up from 53.8%. Across the whole 27 nation European Union, 25.751 million men and women were without jobs last month \u2013 an increase of 169,000 from August \u2013 while the unemployment rate stayed at 10.6%. By comparison, the unemployment rate was 7.9% in the UK, 7.8% in the US and 4.2% in Japan in September. There was some good news for the eurozone though \u2013 inflation eased to 2.5% in October, from 2.6%. Energy prices continued to rise, by 7.8%, but by less than the month before, when they climbed by 9.1% year-on-year. Food became dearer, however, with prices up 3.2% compared with 2.9% in September. Andrea Broughton, an economist at the Institute for Employment Studies said: \"Given the ongoing financial difficulties of the European Union and the likelihood of continuing job losses in the public sector as austerity measures begin to bite, overall unemployment levels and youth unemployment in particular are likely to carry on rising for the foreseeable future.\" She said a north-south split, which has dramatically opened up since the banking crash, would get worse. \"The trend is not upwards in all countries \u2013 unemployment levels actually decreased in seven member states on a year-on-year basis, including in Lithuania and Latvia, where it may be that the worst effects of the crisis are over. In Germany, although the economy is slowing there are as yet no adverse effects on unemployment, which has fallen on a year-on-year basis.\" In some countries the unemployment figures are depressed by a rise in emigration. Ireland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have seen a strong rise in the number of people, mainly young, seeking work abroad. Roughly 370,000 people emigrated from Spain in 2011, 10 times more than before the banking crisis hit the country in 2008. Although about 86% of them were naturalised immigrants born abroad, there is also a growing number of native Spaniards saying \"ya basta\" (\"enough is enough\"). More than 50,000 left last year, up 80% since before the crisis hit.",

Heathrow, which has shed its former BAA title, said the \u00a3257m deal with China Investment Corporation (CIC) would help ensure the airport retains its position as \"one of the best infrastructure assets in the world\". The deal involves acquiring a 5.7% stake from Ferrovial, with the remaining shares bought from other investors in Heathrow's holding company. CIC has about $410bn of assets under management and its investments include shareholdings in the Morgan Stanley investment bank. Ferrovial, whose reputation as an airport owner in the UK has been dented by crises such as the 2006 security scare and the 2010 snow crisis, said it remained committed to Heathrow, but the deal represents another significant chunk of a shareholding that once stood at 55%. \u00cd\u00f1igo Meir\u00e1s, chief executive of Ferrovial, said: \"This sale of a stake in Heathrow Airport Holdings is a further part of Ferrovial's investment diversification strategy.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain big banks made \"constant threats\" to flee the UK if the government forced them to split high street divisions from their casino banking arms. Martin Taylor, a former chief executive of Barclays and a member of the government-commission review of the banking industry, told MPs that the nations' big banks repeatedly threatened \"to leave the country if they didn't like what we came up with\". Taylor, who ran Barclays between 1994-8, said ringfencing high street from investment banking would provide as much consumer protection in the event of another financial crisis without risking an exodus of the banks. \"Had we mandated the full split I think one or two banks could reasonably have asked themselves whether they would want to move,\" he told the parliament commission on banking. \"A ringfenced bank would be as easy to supervise as a separated retail and commercial bank.\" Taylor said that keeping both parts of a bank within a group structure would also enable the investment banking arm to rescue the high street division if it got into financial difficulties. \"Retail banks go bust as frequently as investment banks... if you have a full split you remove the possibility [that the investment banking division could save the high street banking arm].\" However, Lord Lawson, a former chancellor who is sitting on the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said there were \"huge risks\" that a ringfence could be permeated over time. \"Some of us find it difficult to conceive how there can be two diametrically opposed cultures within one and the same institution and with, incidentally, one and the same group of shareholders,\" Lawson said. Taylor said he would fully support enforcing a split in the future if the proposed ringfencing arrangements failed. \"If you give the regulators the powers that the draft bill foresees, you would have some pretty strong defences. But defences need keeping up,\" he said. George Osborne, the chancellor, accepted the majority of the Sir John Vickers' independent commission on banking report's proposals, but watered down recommendations on how much capital lenders must hold. Taylor said the relaxation of Vicker's proposed 4% capital buffer requirements was a \"big mistake\". \"I understand why the government is not keen to do it as there is an international argument at the moment. People are struggling to hold the line at 3% with Basel III meaning organisations can be 33 times geared. I think we are making a big mistake,\" he said. Earlier this month Paul Volcker, a former head of the US central bank and an adviser to president Obama, told the inquiry that the ringfencing plan was doomed to failure. He said ringfecning would encourage bosses to seek loopholes to take bigger risks. \"When you adopt a ringfence, pressures from inside the organisation tends to weaken the restrictions,\" Volker said. \"I'm not saying it will be totally ineffective, but the Vickers report says it is going to have a ringfence with exceptions, and once you go down that road of having exceptions the [banking] organisation is going to push for more exceptions and widen the limits.\"",

      "body": "<p>Britain big banks made \"constant threats\" to flee the UK if the government forced them to split high street divisions from their casino banking arms.</p> <p>Martin Taylor, a former chief executive of Barclays and a member of the government-commission review of the banking industry, told MPs that the nations' big banks repeatedly threatened \"to leave the country if they didn't like what we came up with\".</p> <p>Taylor, who ran Barclays between 1994-8, said ringfencing high street from investment banking would provide as much consumer protection in the event of another financial crisis without risking an exodus of the banks.</p> <p>\"Had we mandated the full split I think one or two banks could reasonably have asked themselves whether they would want to move,\" <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=11668&amp;st=09:31:10\" title=\"\">he told the parliament commission on banking</a>. \"A ringfenced bank would be as easy to supervise as a separated retail and commercial bank.\"</p> <p>Taylor said that keeping both parts of a bank within a group structure would also enable the investment banking arm to rescue the high street division if it got into financial difficulties. \"Retail banks go bust as frequently as investment banks... if you have a full split you remove the possibility [that the investment banking division could save the high street banking arm].\"</p> <p>However, Lord Lawson, a former chancellor who is sitting on the parliamentary commission on banking standards, said there were \"huge risks\" that a ringfence could be permeated over time.</p> <p>\"Some of us find it difficult to conceive how there can be two diametrically opposed cultures within one and the same institution and with, incidentally, one and the same group of shareholders,\" Lawson said.</p> <p>Taylor said he would fully support enforcing a split in the future if the proposed ringfencing arrangements failed. \"If you give the regulators the powers that the draft bill foresees, you would have some pretty strong defences. But defences need keeping up,\" he said.</p> <p>George Osborne, the chancellor, accepted the majority of the Sir John Vickers' independent commission on banking report's proposals, but watered down recommendations on how much capital lenders must hold. Taylor said the relaxation of Vicker's proposed 4% capital buffer requirements was a \"big mistake\".</p> <p>\"I understand why the government is not keen to do it as there is an international argument at the moment. People are struggling to hold the line at 3% with Basel III meaning organisations can be 33 times geared. I think we are making a big mistake,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this month Paul Volcker, a former head of the US central bank and an adviser to president Obama, told the inquiry that the ringfencing plan was doomed to failure. He said ringfecning would encourage bosses to seek loopholes to take bigger risks.</p> <p>\"When you adopt a ringfence, pressures from inside the organisation tends to weaken the restrictions,\" Volker said. \"I'm not saying it will be totally ineffective, but the Vickers report says it is going to have a ringfence with exceptions, and once you go down that road of having exceptions the [banking] organisation is going to push for more exceptions and widen the limits.\"</p>",

Two months ago the UK's second largest clothing retailer worried investors when it said trading during the closing weeks of the summer had been \"unusually quiet\" and the subsequent improvement added to optimism the retail sector is bouncing back from a weak summer. Once the Olympics finished and the weather changed \"things suddenly got back to normal\", said Wolfson, although he cautioned the pattern of consumer spending remained volatile and predicted a slow recovery: \"It very hard to read but our best guess is not much has changed or will change in the run up to Christmas in terms of consumer confidence. I don't think we'll see a light bulb moment.\" The Heseltine study calls on the government to align the country's \"huge infrastructure demands\" with the interests of \"hungry institutional funds\" and to \"clarify urgently\" its position on airport capacity in the south east so investors know where they stand. \"It is not acceptable for big decisions to be sidelined for three years because it is politically expedient,\" said Wolfson, referring to the runway debate. \"It is very strange to think about something for the same amount of time as it would take to build it.\" Total Next sales rose by a better-than-expected 2.7% in the 13 weeks to 27 October, with its shops 1.1% ahead. However, growth at its home shopping arm Directory slowed sharply with sales up 5.6%, compared with 13.3% in the first half. Wolfson said the Directory business had faced tough sales comparisons with a year ago when moving the cut-off time for next day deliveries from 7pm to 9pm delivered a substantial boost. Its growth had slowed to a \"more sustainable level\", he said. Analysts said it was a \"quarter of two halves\", with sales down in August as many people stayed at home to watch the London Olympics. But improving confidence and colder weather, prompting shoppers to buy knitwear and warmer jackets, led to sales bouncing back in the autumn. \"Bears will point to the slowdown in Directory sales and bulls to the impressive pickup in retail sales,\" said Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche. \"We are big fans of this blue blood multichannel retailer.\" The shares closed down 1% at \u00a335.66.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays has revealed that an investigation into the way it had raised cash from Middle Eastern investors during the 2008 banking crisis has crossed the Atlantic. It also admitted it had sunk to a loss in the third quarter of the year, and its battered reputation took a further hit when a US regulator threatened a $470m penalty (\u00a3290m) over allegations that Barclays attempted to manipulate the Californian energy price. The bank said US regulators are now looking at the fundraising from Middle Eastern investors that saved the bank from a government bailout at the time of the meltdown. That deal is also being investigated by the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Fraud Office. Antony Jenkins, promoted to chief executive after Bob Diamond (pictured below) left in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, conceded that the bank still had more to do to bolster its reputation, which has taken numerous hits in recent months. Barclays was one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index, ending almost 5% lower at 227p even before the US energy regulator proposed the \u00a3290m fine. The bank has provided little detail about an ongoing inquiries by the FSA about disclosures the bank made about its 2008 fundraisings, and the US authorities \u2013 the department of justice and US securities and exchange commission (SEC) \u2013 are now investigating whether these fundraisings were \"compliant\" with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Barclays said it was \"fully co-operating\" with the two regulators. The bank admitted in July that its finance director, Chris Lucas, and three others were being investigated by the FSA for two fundraisings that took place to help the bank avoid a bailout by the taxpayer in 2008 and has since admitted the SFO is also investigating. The latest admissions come in a week in which a high court judge has ruled that Diamond and other bankers should be brought before the court to explain what they knew about Libor rigging. The case, about the alleged mis-selling of interest rate swaps, was brought largely by the independent operator Guardian Care Homes. Jenkins, presenting his first set of results since replacing Diamond at the start of September, refused to reveal how many Barclays staff had been fired, suspended or disciplined as a result of the alleged manipulation of Libor. He said bonuses had been clawed back from the individuals involved. However, he did not go so far as to say whether this included Diamond and Jerry del Missier, the chief operating officer who also quit after a \u00a3290m fine was imposed on Barclays. In the third quarter the bank made a \u00a347m loss, which had been expected after the bank set aside another \u00a3700m to cover the cost of PPI mis-selling claims, taking its bill to \u00a32bn. Over the nine months to the end of September, profits were down 86% to \u00a3712m as a result of the PPI charge and the fluctuations in the cost of buying back its own debt, which has led to a \u00a34bn charge. Stripping these out, the bank focused on an 18% rise in adjusted profits to \u00a36bn. A year ago, profits were \u00a35bn over the same nine-month period and in the third quarter reached \u00a32.4bn \u2013 although stripping out a gain on the value of its own debt and other one-off items, profit had beenthis fell to \u00a31.3bn a year ago. Jenkins defended the performance of the investment bank, known as Barclays Capital until a rebranding exercise, which reported a slowdown in the third quarter when rivals were stronger. Even so, the investment bank continued to generate the bulk of the profit, generating \u00a33.2bn in the first nine months, up 19%, while the retail and business banking business which Jenkins ran until his promotion, suffered a 5% slump in profits to \u00a31.4bn. The corporate bank slumped to a \u00a36m loss. Analysts at UBS said that \"short-term share price movements\" would be influenced by the disclosure of the new regulatory investigations and the slightly more sober outlook statement. The performance of the investment bank disappointed Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, who said that \"\"We were disappointed to find that total income in the investment bank fell short of market expectations, following a strong showing elsewhere in the industry\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "General Motors has become the latest mass-market car manufacturer to signal an accelerating decline in the European market by posting an increased third quarter loss of $500m (\u00a3310m). The US car maker said the loss at its continental unit, on an earnings before interest and tax basis, had increased from $300m in 2011. It forecast that annual losses could be more than double last year's and reach $1.8bn. Dan Akerson, chief executive of the world's largest automotive company, admitted that Europe, where GM owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, was one of three \"tough issues\" facing the business. Overall, GM said a strong US performance helped produce a company-wide profit of $2.3bn compared with $2.2bn for the same period last year. GM's announcement of European losses came a week after US rival Ford announced the closure of three sites in Europe including a Transit van plant in Southampton and a panel-stamping facility in Dagenham, Essex. With the Southampton and Dagenham closures costing up to 1,400 jobs, Ford said it had been forced to act by rising losses that will reach $1.5bn this year. Earlier this week the boss of Fiat, Sergio Marchionne, said the Italian company would try to avoid \"carmageddon\" by focusing on exports instead of closing plants, even though its European facilities are operating at only 45% of full capacity. GM said it will shed 2,600 staff across Europe this year - around 200 in the UK - and will not break even until the middle of the decade. The company is expected to shut its plant in Bochum, Germany, as part of plans to reduce capacity in a European car market that has been saddled with too many factories in the wake of the credit crunch. However, GM said this year that it would save the Ellesmere Port plant on the Wirral, by allocating production of the next-generation Astra car to the factory. Ellesmere Port employs 2,100 people directly.",

According to the consumer surveys, we are spending more in the shops and borrowing more on unsecured credit than at any time since the beginning of the year. But the surveys also said consumer confidence in the outlook for the economy had fallen.

That's the view of several leading economists, who warn that a triple-dip is a strong possibility after the UK recovered in the third quarter of the year \u2013 but only due to the Olympics and special factors that disguised the weak state of the economy. Britain looks and behaves much like an ocean liner holed below the waterline and listing while the crew patch the damage and work the pumps.

      "bodyText": "In takeover news, credit card protection firm CPP Group has confirmed an approach by US rival Affinion, while Irn Bru maker, AG Barr, and drinks firm Britvic have been granted a one month extension on their planned merger. CPP Group has had a terrible year so far. Shares have plunged 75% this year for the identity theft protection firm after it was investigated by the Financial Services Authority over misselling. The regulator could still hit it will a large fine with discussions between the company and FSA continuing. At its last update to the stock market, the firm said: We continue to have constructive discussions with the FSA with a view to bringing its investigation to a conclusion. At this stage, however, there continues to be uncertainty about the duration and outcome of the investigation. While in August, chief executive Paul Stobart said: Our experiences since the announcement of the FSA investigation in March 2011 - both regulatory and the effects of economic conditions - continue to overshadow the Group. Therefore, because of the huge shareprice drop, any bid could be an attempt to get the company on the cheap, which the board may well reject. In a statement, the company said today: The Board of CPP confirms that it has received an initial, preliminary approach from Affinion Group Inc, which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the Group. It should be noted that the approach is at a very early stage and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms of any such offer, should one be forthcoming. Shares jumped 7.8p, 37%, to 28.3p on news of a possible takeover. Meanwhile, over at Britvic and AG Barr, both companies have been given an extra month of courting to cement their relationship. A deadline of 5pm today has been extended until November 28th, the second such extension since both companies confirmed they were in discussions in September. The \u00a31.4bn merger is making \"substantial\" progress, but seemingly not quite enough to be completed. In a joint statement they said: Substantial progress has been made and the two parties are now at an advanced stage of discussions, which are ongoing. It has been a tough year for Britvic, which had to recall its Robinsons Fruit Shoot children's drink over faulty bottle caps. Revenues were hit by 2%. Both companies have also blamed bad weather for lower-than-expected profits but hope the merger will create one of the biggest drinks' firms in Europe, selling Robinsons, Tango, J20, Iru Bru, as well as Pepsi and 7UP in the UK. Shares in Britvic were down 0.4p at 359.6p, and AG Barr was down 6p at 442p.",

      "bodyText": "Europe has a dark history when it comes to unemployment. Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 unemployment in Germany was around 5%. By 1930 it was 15%. By 1932 it was 30%. We all know what happened in 1933. The weaker countries of the eurozone today have yet to reach those levels of joblessness but the latest data shows they not all that far away. Spain and Greece both have more than a quarter of the workforce kicking their heels, with youth unemployment well above 50%. These are staggering and deeply worrying figures. And they are going to get worse. When the financial crisis erupted more than five years ago Europe prided itself that the problem had originated in the deregulated American economy, and took pride in contrasting its social market economy with the devil-take-the-hindmost approach favoured on the other side of the Atlantic. In reality, Europe's banks were loaded up with the derivatives that collapsed in price when the bubble burst in the US real estate market. Europe now has a network of zombie banks kept afloat only thanks to the efforts of the European Central Bank and the network of individual national banks. A sharp contraction in bank lending has led to weaker activity, putting pressure on public finances and leading to higher debt levels. America faced similar pressures but has responded in a quite different way. The champions of laissez-faire have pulled every lever, tried experimental policies when conventional approaches have struggled to gain traction, and made it clear that they will continue intervening until unemployment comes down to a more acceptable level. A big drive to reduce the US budget deficit is due to kick in next year but few doubt that the Americans will step back from the so-called fiscal cliff until recovery is well embedded. Europe by contrast has played it by the book, with disastrous results. It has fretted too much about an imaginary inflation threat. It has failed to comprehend that the sovereign debt problem is the symptom of a banking crisis. And most bone-headedly of all, it has insisted on sucking even more demand out of the single-currency area through pro-cyclical austerity programmes. The co-ordinated nature of these budget cuts has resulted in the impact on growth and jobs being magnified. Bizarrely, while the allegedly laissez-faire Americans have been acting like devotees of the social market, the Europeans have been acting as if Keynes never lived. So here's the position. Europe is now locked into a double-dip recession that is affecting the core countries as well as the weak nations on the periphery. Unemployment is on the rise in both Germany and France; eurozone joblessness rose for a 17th month in September and the rate is now at 11.6%, a monetary union record. Growth prospects are being strangled by a combination of rising unemployment, rock-bottom consumer and business confidence, and budget cuts. The giant sucking sound is of Europe disappearing down its own self-imposed deflationary plughole. Is there an alternative? Of course there is, although it means European policymakers starting to act like the terrible Anglo-Saxons in Washington. It means the ECB adopting a much more expansionary monetary policy. It means delaying co-ordinated fiscal tightening. And it means using the European Investment Bank as the vehicle for an infrastructure-led stimulus policy. The question is whether Europe's policymakers have the flexibility and the imagination to change course. If they haven't, the risk is of deepening economic distress, the fostering of political extremism and the replacement of the social market ideal with something far, far nastier.",

According to the New York Times, NYSE created an emergency response team or 30 staff, who have been sleeping in the Manhattan headquarters, running trail sessions yesterday afternoon. They have talked with more than 400 regulators, traders and officials ahead of today and pulled in Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, stuck in California by the storms, to host a conference call with banking regulators. The actual trading floor remained unscathed, as did its electronic systems, but some traders are struggling to hook up to the big board due to servers and computers being down, with one building nearby which houses several firms being severely damaged. However, most major Wall Street firms have backup trading floors. Two Citigroup buildings were without power, with a memo to staff saying one had sustained \"severe flooding and will be out of commission for several weeks.\" JP Morgan employees based outside the city were working in New Jersey, while with the bank's main trading floor in Midtown did not suffer any major damage and will open. Credit Suisse's main offices were running on backup generators, with bosses offering buses and hotels for some staff, with others working from New Jersey. Goldman Sachs, based downtown in the worst affected area, managed to maintain power, due to its backup generator, however, few staff turn up to work. The headquarters will be open today, after employees were put up in hotels overnight. And so, this morning, 200 traders will be on the NYSE trading floor, buying and selling shares, in the hope of maintaining business as usual. It was the first time trading was suspended for two consecutive days due to weather conditions since 1888.",

      "bodyText": "Our Politics Live blog is covering all the reaction and analysis to tonight's vote on the EU Budget. So (for the second time tonight) I\"m going to say goodnight! Kate Hoey, one of the Labour MPs who called for an In-Out referendum this afternoon, just told Sky News that the government's defeat should trigger a thorough reassessment of Britain's position in Europe. Breaking: the UK government has been defeated over tonight's vote on the EU budget. 307 MPs voted in favour of an amendment that said the EU budget should be cut in real terms. 294 MPs opposed the motion. Politically, that's a blow to David Cameron. In terms of Europe, it doesn't make a huge difference in the short term -- Cameron can still argue for the EU budget to only rise in line with inflation (while the EC wants a inflation-busting increase). It also shows that euroscepticism is alive, well and on the charge in Westminster, at a time when the push for European integration is raising new concerns over Britain's position, and future, in the EU. Some lobby journalists reckon the UK government may just survive the vote on the EU budget, although as I blogged at 5.28pm there was plenty of euroscepticism in the House of Commons tonight. The other big news tonight is the vote in the House of Commons over the EU budget. MPs have just finished debating, and are voting now.... That's being covered minute-by-minute by our Politics Live blog, and speculation is growing that the government could lose. Many MPs have demanded that in the current economic crisis, any increase in the EU budget is unacceptable. The results of the vote are due in just a few minutes... The Financial Times argues tonight that the economic projections in Greece's budget for 2013 (see 11.48am) are the final proof that it will miss the targets under its current bailout: Here's the story: New debt forecasts dash Greece hopes And here's a flavour: The magnitude of Greece\u2019s fiscal challenge was painted in sharp relief yesterday as Athens unveiled new budget projections exceeding the worst-case scenarios envisioned by international lenders when they agreed an \u20ac174bn rescue eight months ago. Instead of Greece\u2019s debt peaking at 167 per cent of economic output next year, as predicted in the March bailout agreement, it will hit 189 per cent and climb to 192 per cent in 2014, according to projections presented to the Greek parliament. The new projections all but dash hopes Greek debt would come down to 120 per cent of GDP by 2020 \u2013 once held out as the standard for a manageable debt load \u2013 and senior EU officials acknowledged they may have to give Athens more leeway to hit that target under a revised rescue currently being negotiated. Our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith says while today\u2019s Euro group\u2019s assessment of the country\u2019s fiscal progress (see 2.55pm) has been formally welcomed, Greek officials are also expressing consternation that the worst is far from over. Helena writes: The failure of senior cadres in both the socialist Pasok and Democratic Left parties to back the governing coalition\u2019s endorsement of a major privatizations bill in parliament today has clearly unnerved officials. One source at the finance minister conceded that the abstentions could be a precursor of the way the vote will go next week when the long-awaited \u20ac13.5bn austerity package is also put before the 300-seat House. \u201cAfter today it\u2019s not certain it will be passed even if that scenario is not one we want to talk about,\u201d he said. Evangelos Venizelos is now working around-the-clock to try and persuade his own MPs to back the measures but tensions are such that the party\u2019s own survival is at stake. Venizelos, the former finance minister, says the \u201cmost important negotiations will take place between Greece and its European partners [at the Eurogroup on November 12] and will finish in the wee hours of November 13,\u201d over how to put Greece on a sustainable path and ensure growth. There were protests in Lisbon today as the Portuguese parliament approved the 2013 budget. Here's a few snaps: I mentioned this morning (see 7.57am) that JP Morgan has created a new term - Grimbo - to describe the limbo in which Greece is now trapped. Well, regular reader James Wilkins has a better idea: How about \u2018Grombie\u2019 for a country that is past saving ( as in zombie bank) Unfortunately the Eurozone favours zombie banks over Grombies. Some late bad news from Dublin, via Henry McDonald: As darkness falls on Hallowe'en (an Irish invented festival by the way) in Dublin there are ghoulish warnings about job losses in the telecommunications industry. Eircom - one of the biggest players in the internet and mobile phone sector in the Republic - has now confirmed that it is seeking 2,000 redundancies across the state. It is not yet clear if these will be part of a voluntary redundancy scheme but with nearly 15 per cent of the Irish workforce already on the dole it is another nightmare for the Irish people and its government. In Westminster, MPs are holding a fiery debate over the EU budget. While David Cameron had won early plaudits for his insistence that the budget should be pegged to inflation, he now faces a battle with eurosceptic members of his own party who want an actual cut in real terms. The idea of sending more precious pounds to Brussels has enraged Bill Cash, who just blashed Europe's approach to spending, saying: The money comes from our constituents, it comes from taxpayers. It doesn't grow on trees.....And they don't understand that. I hope that's clear to anyone who wondered how the monetary system worked.... Cash went on to urge Cameron to allow the rest of Europe to form a federal state, but to stand on the sidelines. Cameron has tried to calm the situation, saying today that At best we would like it [the budget] cut, at worst frozen Anyway, the result of tonight's vote will depend on whether Labour decides to vote with the Tory rebels, which will itself depend on whether the parliamentary maths adds up..... Kate Hoey, a Labour MP, is now arguing that parliament is behind public opinion over the issue of Europe, and believes an in-out referendum is needed. Douglas Carswell, the Conservative MP who is pushing a private member's bill calling for a referendum, believes that parliament will vote in favour of cutting the EU budget. Protestors are gathering outside the Athens University this evening for a demonstration: Open Europe, the think tank we often quote in the blog, has opened a new office in Berlin today. The goal is to \"inject fresh thinking into the German debate about the future direction of the EU\". Here's some more details: And ReDefine, another influential thinktank (run by Sony Kapoor), has also been busy: Here's a video clip about today's events in Greece. Protests have been taking place in several European cities today. In Athens, residents from towns in northwestern Greece gathered outside parliament and threw icecubes onto the road in a demonstration against a tax hike on heating fuel. Here's a couple of photos: Meanwhile, over in Barcelona a protest organised by unions resulted in demonstrators pushing into retail stores, and upsetting the shelves in Zara. Over in Portugal, the Lisbon parliament has passed the 2013 budget, despite public anger over the austerity measures contained in it. Now we wait to see if there is a legal battle over the programme (see 8.36am for more) A few thoughts about the statement issued by the eurogroup (see 14.55pm) 1) The eurozone finance ministers don't believe Greece has reached a full and final deal with the troika, despite Antonis Samaras's comments yesterday that negotiations were over. They see \"remaining issues\" 2) It is not certain that the meeting on 12 November will deliver a deal on Greece, with ministers saying they will \"seek to conclude\" on the programme. 3) What happened to the idea of a meeting on 8 November, as the draft statement published by Dow Jones suggested? (see 1.21pm) The Eurogroup has also issued a statement after their phone chat. And it appears that eurozone finance ministers have toned down the content compared to the draft version that Dow Jones had earlier (see 1.21pm) Here's the text, attributed to Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the eurogroup: The Eurogroup took note of the progress made towards a full staff level agreement between Greece and the Troika on updated programme conditionality, including ambitious and wide-ranging measures in the areas of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, privatisation and financial sector stabilisation. We called on the Greek authorities to solve remaining issues so as to swiftly finalise the negotiations with the Troika institutions. The Eurogroup expects to further discuss the Greek adjustment programme at its next regular meeting on 12 November on the basis of the relevant programme documentation and seek to conclude on the programme, subject to the completion of prior actions by the Greek authorities and of national procedures in Member States, in line with the established practice. One more line from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble -- he told a news conference that euro zone finance ministers are unlikely to receive the troika's report on Greece before November 11th or 12th. Safely after the US elections, in other words. Sch\u00e4uble also repeated his opposition to public creditors taking a haircut on their Greek bonds, arguing that this would be illegal (as they'd be monetising Greece's debts). The eurozone finance ministers have indeed finished their teleconference, and Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has lost little time in briefing the media. Reuters has the snaps: \u2022 SCHAEUBLE SAYS AFTER PHONE CALL WITH EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS ON GREECE BUT NO DEAL YET \u2022 SCHAEUBLE SAYS NO CONCRETE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CYPRUS YET, WILL PROBABLY NOT START UNTIL 2013 Eurozone finance ministers have concluded their discussions on Greece, according to the FT's Peter Spiegel, who anticipates an official statement shortly (not just the draft version which hit the newswires this morning) Back to Greece, where the country's two biggest union groups have called a new two-day strike for next week. GSEE (which represents the private sector) and ADEDY (the public sector union) jointly announced a 48h strike starting on Tuesday 6th November. The stoppage is an attempt to prevent MPs approving the \u20ac13.5bn package of austerity measures, when it comes to a vote next week. Ilias Iliopoulos, general secretary of ADEDY, said: We will strike to stop the measures from being voted in parliament. We won't allow the government to hurt Greek people any more. Amid the gloom in Greece, we have some good news for hard-pressed Irish taxpayers - from the bank that alost bankrupted Ireland. The cost of rescuing the now-nationalised Anglo Irish Bank will now be \u20ac25 billion, the chairman of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Alan Dukes disclosed today. This figure is far lower than previous estimates for the cost of bailing out Anglo which ranged from \u20ac29 to \u20ac34bn euros. As Henry McDonald, our correspondent in Dublin, explains: All this matters to Europe because the Republic's government is seeking funds from the EU to ease the burden of the country's banking debts. Dukes, a former minister in a previous Fine Gael-Labour coalition, told the Irish parliament's powerful Finance Committee that the IBRC (formerly Anglo Irish Bank) has cut staff numbers at the now state owned bank by 50% from its peak level in 2008. While the cost of ressurecting one Irish zombie bank is less than first feared another foreign bank in the Irish market has some grim news about consumer spending coming up to Christmas. The KBC bank along with the Economic and Social Research Institute has found that consumer sentiment is barely up from a low point in September. In their montly snapshot of consumer's intentions that just over 60% of Irish consumers were optimistic about their spending power. The bank and the ESRI predict another tough Christmas period for shoppers and retailers alike, coming as it does in the same month as yet another austerity, cost cutting budget. Over in New York, trading has begun on Wall Street after the two-day suspension caused by Superstorm Sandy. Mayor Michael Bloomberg rang the opening bell, to more enthusiastic applause than usual from the assembled traders (I thought, anyway). Despite the devastation caused to parts of the east coast of the USA, the markets are calm with the blue chip index rising in early trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 64 points at 13171, +0.49% A draft statement from the Eurogroup has emerged, as finance ministers hold their telephone conference call They say that they are ready to call a meeting on 8 November to consider the situation in Greece,as long as \"documentation\" is available showing Greece has complied with its obligations. They would then meet again on 12 November to formally approve its next aid tranche (worth \u20ac31.5bn). The statement also urges Greece to take the \"prior actions\" it has agreed to. The call began shortly after Greece published its 2013 budget, which contained new economic forecasts that were even less rosy than a month ago (see 11.48). [the draft statement came via Dow Jones, btw - the call appears to be continuing] The word from Greece is that the parliament has now passed a bill on privatisations, after what Dow Jones newswires dubbed a 'fractious' session. The voting saw 15 socialist members of the coalition fail to support the party line, though, according to Theodora Oikonomides. On GDP, the Greek government's medium-term economic plan plots a return to growth in 2014. 2013: -4.5% 2014: +0.2% 2015: +2.5% 2016: +3.5% That's from the Greek 2013 budget (see 11.48am onwards): City traders and economists are sceptical about the forecasts in today's budget, as these tweets show: The 2013 Greek budget predicts an unemployment rate of 22.8% in 2013, falling to 21.4% in 2014, 19.7% in 2015, and 17.1% in 2016. However, today's eurozone jobless data shows that the Greek jobless rate hit 25.1% in July, so the targets are clearly extremely stretching. Blogger and commentator Yiannis Mouzakis has rapidly analysed the 2013 Greek budget and tweeted the key charts, along with helpful explanations in Engish. Over in Greece, the details of the 2013 Budget are being digested after finance minister Yannis Stournaras presented them to MPs this morning. The mood is extremely sombre, as the budget is packed with fresh evidence that Greece's economy is on a sharp downward spiral. Here are the key points: \u2022 the budget predicts that government debt will hit 189.1% of gross domestic product in 2013. The budget deficit is forecast at 5.2% of GDP, compared with the 4.2% deficit predicted a month ago. \u2022 The revisions mean that Greece no longer expects to post a surplus excluding debt costs of 1.1% of GDP next year. It now only expects a primary surplus of 0.4%. \u2022 The budget also forecasts the Greek economy contracting by 4.5% in 2013, from 3.8% in the previous draft. That means that Greek GDP will have slumped by 21.5% since 2008 by the end of next year. A true depression. The full budget is online here (in Greek), and here's the front page: Reaction to follow.... City economists believe eurozone unemployment will continue to climb as the region's economic crisis continues. Here's some early reaction: Ben May of Capital Economics: With survey measures suggesting that firms are becoming more reluctant to hire, the eurozone unemployment rate looks set to rise further, placing more pressure on struggling households. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The eurozone unemployment data for September are both disappointing and worrying... and highlights that eurozone labour markets remain under serious pressure from ongoing weakened economic activity and low business confidence As usual, the unemployment data gives a clear picture of the economic divergences across Europe -- with Spain's jobless rate nearly six times higher than Austria. The lowest rates: Austria: 4.4% Luxembourg: 5.2% Germany: 5.4% The Netherlands: 5.4% The highest rates: Spain: 25.8% Greece: 25.1% (for July: September's data isn't available yet) Latvia: 15.9% (for Q3) Portugal: 15.7% The true picture in Greece is probably worse, as a growing number of workers are still officially employed but have not been paid for some time. There are now 18.49 million people out of work in the euro area, with an extra 146,000 joining the ranks of the unemployed in September (Eurostat reported). Across the whole European Union, there are now 25.751 million men and women out of work, up by 169,000 since August. You can download the official release on eurozone unemployment from Eurostat's web site (pdf). Breaking: the Eurozone unemployment rate has hit a new record high. Eurostat has reported that the jobless total hit 11.6% in September,. That's up from 11.5% in August - which has itself been revised up from the previous reading of 11.4%. Further evidence that the euro jobless crisis is accelerating. More to follow! Over in Greece, finance minister Yiannis Stournaras is submitting the 2013 budget to parliament. Interesting comments from Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, this morning. Speaking in the Madrid parliament, Rajoy said that the eurozone crisis could only be solved through solutions at domestic and regional level. Rajoy, who has been prevaricating over whether to ask for financial help for weeks, then went on to criticise the EU for its own slow progress. Here are the key quotes: Overcoming the crisis depends on national reforms but also European policies The European Union is moving, but at a pace that can seem desperately slow to some of us. Rajoy may have been thinking of the plans for a new single banking supervisor, which will not be fully operational until well into 2013... Today's jobless figures for the eurozone, due out at 10am GMT, could make grim reading, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports: The unemployment rate is expected to have risen again, to a record 11.5%. In Italy, the rate is forecast to hit 10.8% from 10.7%. It's also a key day in Portugal, where the Lisbon parliament will vote on its latest austerity package, and probably spark a legal battle. The 2013 budget includes hefty increases in income tax, as well as higher property taxes and a levy on financial transactions. The budget has been dogged by legal challenges and public protests. A plan to hit workers with a massive increase in social security payment was abandoned after mass protests, while a plan to cut civil servants' benefits was blocked by Portugal's constitutional court. Despite public anger, the reworked budget is likely to go through. However, political experts say the new budget is almost certain to be challenged in court. Pedro Magalhaes, political scientist at the Social Sciences Institute of the Lisbon University, said: If the court finds something unconstitutional, it could still be something relatively easy to fix, or alternatively it could shoot down the budget and cause a political crisis. Here's the full story: Portugal to introduce higher taxes to meet EU bailout terms Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal confirms that we shouldn't expect finance ministers to take a decision on whether to grant Greece more time to hit its debt sustainability targets: With Greece seemingly clinging onto its place in the eurozone for longer than some had expected, talk of Grexit (Citi's slightly clunky term for a Greek exit) has faded away. Instead, JP Morgan have come up with a new term: Grimbo. Jamie McGeever of Reuters explains: This is not a welcome development, frankly. But how long until Grimbo is cancelled? Eurozone finance ministers are not expected to take any big decision on Greece on this morning's conference call. EU officials have been briefing that the talks will consider Greece's compliance with its aid programme One told Reuters: It will be just taking stock of the situation regarding the Greek assistance programme. There will be no decisions since there is no Troika report yet. The call could still be interesting, though, as national governments are likely to leak the details, so we should discover who's taking a particularly hard line and who is open to granting Athens more time. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis, and other events in the world economy. Greece is in the spotlight today. Finance ministers from across the eurozone are due to hold a teleconference call this morning (at 11.30am GMT) to discuss Athens' progress on its performance against its aid targets. The call comes as the political battle over Greece's \u20ac13.5bn austerity package intensifies. Having concluded its negotiations with the troika on Tuesday (see yesterday's blog), the government must now get the controversial and unpopular programme through parliament. Encouragingly for prime minister Antonis Samaras, the indications are that one junior partner - the left-wing Pasok - will support the package. According to Reuters overnight, \"an overwhelming majority of Greek Socialist lawmakers\" have agreed to support it. \"The overwhelming majority of Pasok lawmakers are in favour of the package,\" one of the party officials said, adding that just two of the 33 Pasok lawmakers would vote against the package, while another two had yet to decide. That would mean that Democratic Left, the third party in the coalition, could not block the austerity package. It is still refusing to support the labour market reforms which the troika insists on. There should be action in the Greek parliament today, with MPs due to vote on a privatisation bill and start consider the 2013 budget. And we're also expecting protests on the streets of Athens tonight, as unions continue to demonstrate against Samaras's government and the troika. And with new eurozone unemployment data due this morning, and the Portuguese parliament voting on its own austerity budget, we have a lively day ahead....",

      "bodyText": "Consumers shrugged off concerns about the state of their finances to spend more freely in the shops last month, according to two surveys providing mixed messages about the state of the economy. Hopes that the UK might be on the road to recovery were boosted by the latest snapshot of high street spending from the CBI showing the strongest retail sales growth since the summer coupled with a belief among shops and stores that business in November would also be brisk. But a separate report from GfK showed already fragile consumer confidence weakening by two points to -30 as the short-term fillip from the Olympics faded. Nick Moon, Managing Director of Social Research at GfK, said: \"Just as the economy moves out of recession consumer confidence dips again. While we are not quite back to the levels of this time last year, the index has not been this low in six months. \"While the Olympics are thought to have boosted GDP in the last quarter, the late Summer boost in consumer sentiment has now faded. The government will be concerned that the economic bounce will follow a similar path and deflate during the Autumn.\" Moon added: \"The fragility of the recovery is underlined by the fact that people are more worried about their own financial situation over the next 12 months. This certainly doesn't suggest there will be a spending boom on the back of the official emergence from recession.\" The CBI survey showed consumers responding to falling inflation by spending far more in October than had been expected. Almost half of retailers questioned (47%) said business was up last month on a year earlier, while 17% said sales were down. The balance of +30 points was the highest since June, when spending was lifted by the extra bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee. Retailers were confident that business would remain brisk in November as the build-up to the key Christmas period began. Anna Leach, the CBI's head of economic analysis, said: \"It is great news that last month's sales growth has continued into October, at a much faster pace than expected, and that this momentum is expected to continue next month too. \"Falling inflation has somewhat eased pressures on family budgets, so that households are a little more willing to spend. But there's still a risk that ongoing uncertainty over the global economic outlook could dent consumer confidence, hitting prospects for the retail sector, while the scope for inflation to fall further is limited.\" The CBI said there was an across-the-board pickup in spending, led by clothes stores and furniture and carpets outlets. Clothing posted its first year-on-year sales growth in three months, while supermarkets also reported the sixth consecutive annual increase in volumes. Despite the sales growth, retailers still said trade was poor for the time of year. Of the 69 retailers polled, 16% said activity was good for the time of year while 23% said it was disappointing. The balance of \u20137 points was the least negative since April, the employers' organisation said.",
