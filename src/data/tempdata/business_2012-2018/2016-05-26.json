      "bodyText": "How far will the government \u2013 a month before a referendum, and facing accusations of being asleep to the crisis in the steel industry \u2013 go to save Tata Steel UK? Here\u2019s one answer: it could change the law to allow the company\u2019s pension fund liabilities to be indexed at a lower rate of inflation, thereby making it more likely that a buyer will appear or that Tata decides to keep its operation. Viewed in isolation, the idea would be a reasonable fudge. No buyer in its right mind would take on the British Steel \u00a315bn pension scheme with a current deficit of \u00a3700m. And if the scheme fell into the Pensions Protection Fund lifeboat, pensioners would be worse off because a 10% haircut applies. A switch from retail price index (RPI) to consumer price index (CPI) benchmarking would impose lesser pain on members and, since the benefits system largely uses CPI as a benchmark these days, it could be argued such a switch is fairish. The gain is the survival of 11,000 jobs. But can such a shuffle really be viewed in isolation? The business secretary, Sajid Javid, insisted so, saying the consultation is \u201cvery much about this scheme\u201d. Tata pushed the same line: the British Steel scheme said pension increases would be provided so long as they were affordable, thus a change in the law would let \u201cthis unusual rule\u201d operate as intended without implications elsewhere. That sounds suspiciously like wishful thinking. Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat former pensions minister, is surely right to fear that \u201crushed legislation could open the floodgates to employers who may wish to walk away from pension schemes rather than honour their pension promises\u201d. Quite. Many companies are toiling under the weight of the defined benefit pledges made decades ago. Once a government has accepted the principle that obligations can be tweaked, where does the process stop? If British Steel is a one-off, let\u2019s hear a definition of exceptional. These are deep and murky waters and the government has given itself only two months to negotiate a safe passage. This smells like trouble. Bramson is charged with re-energising Electra Neil Johnson has been chairman of FTSE 250 investment trust Electra Private Equity for only a fortnight. Never mind, he\u2019s a fast mover. He\u2019s decided Electra requires a chief executive to lead the already under way strategic review and has found just the chap. As luck would have it, he\u2019s already camped in Electra\u2019s boardroom. Yes, it\u2019s Edward Bramson, the quiet financier whose Sherborne investment vehicle owns almost 30% of Electra. That stake was big enough (just) to ensure Bramson last year won, at the second attempt, his bitterly fought battle to get on the board. Bramson is not, then, a figure of unity. Johnson is honest enough to admit that he got the job on an interim basis \u201cbecause he\u2019s there\u201d, and thus can complete the review by the autumn. But one decision seems to have been half-made already: Electra Partners, the outside outfit managing the mid-market fund, has been served a \u201cnotice of termination\u201d after 40 years. It\u2019s just a pragmatic step, says Johnson; Electra Partners\u2019 services could still be retained. Well, we\u2019ll see. The reality is that Electra Partners\u2019 princely fees could probably be squeezed harder. On the other hand, the firm has done a decent job of churning out double-digit returns for Electra\u2019s shareholders. That record is, at least, demonstrable. With Bramson, nobody knows what\u2019s in store. He\u2019s spoken in the past of \u00a31bn of value to be unlocked from a \u00a31.3bn fund, but never explained how such a feat could be performed. The shares fell 3.6% on understandable scepticism. Mike Ashley should now head directly to Westminster Well played, Iain Wright, chair of the business, innovation and skills select committee, who has told Mike Ashley to cease his silly games and just turn up in Westminster on 7 June. The Sports Direct founder had been trying to make his appearance conditional on the MPs first making a trip to the company\u2019s warehouse in Derbyshire. A Commons inquiry can\u2019t demean itself by submitting to such dealmaking. Talk to us and then we\u2019ll decide if we want to see your warehouse, Wright has said. That is the correct arrangement. \u201cI am sure that neither of us wants to engage in a potentially lengthy and public process that would follow any non-attendance,\u201d he adds. Ashley \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may still opt for belligerence and continue to grumble about a \u201cmedia circus\u201d. He should relax. Dominic Chappell, the BHS bankrupt, is up before the committee the next day and is now the headline act.",

It\u2019s just a pragmatic step, says Johnson; Electra Partners\u2019 services could still be retained.</p> <p>Well, we\u2019ll see. The reality is that Electra Partners\u2019 princely fees could probably be squeezed harder. On the other hand, the firm has done a decent job of churning out double-digit returns for Electra\u2019s shareholders.</p> <p>That record is, at least, demonstrable. With Bramson, nobody knows what\u2019s in store. He\u2019s spoken in the past of \u00a31bn of value to be unlocked from a \u00a31.3bn fund, but never explained how such a feat could be performed. The shares fell 3.6% on understandable scepticism.</p> <h2>Mike Ashley should now head directly to Westminster</h2> <p>Well played, Iain Wright, chair of the business, innovation and skills select committee, who has told Mike Ashley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/mps-mike-ashley-not-visit-sports-direct-head-office\">to cease his silly games and just turn up in Westminster on 7 June</a>. The Sports Direct founder had been trying to make his appearance conditional on the MPs first making a trip to the company\u2019s warehouse in Derbyshire.</p> <p>A Commons inquiry can\u2019t demean itself by submitting to such dealmaking. Talk to us and then we\u2019ll decide if we want to see your warehouse, Wright has said. That is the correct arrangement.</p> <p>\u201cI am sure that neither of us wants to engage in a potentially lengthy and public process that would follow any non-attendance,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>Ashley \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may still opt for belligerence and continue to grumble about a \u201cmedia circus\u201d. He should relax. Dominic Chappell, the BHS bankrupt, is up before the committee the next day and is now the headline act.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Portuguese-backed consortium close to deal for BHS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A Portuguese-backed consortium is closing in on a deal to rescue BHS and its 11,000 employees. The consortium, which is led by Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell, is understood to have already paid part of the sale proceeds to show its determination to complete a deal. Talks over a deal, which is likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds and include all of BHS\u2019s 164 stores, are set to continue on Friday and Monday. An announcement is now not expected until the middle of next week. Liquidators have been lined up in case the talks break down, in which case all 11,000 BHS workers would lose their jobs. However, sources close to the talks are far more hopeful of reaching an agreement than they were earlier in the week, when BHS looked close to collapse as the consortium and the administrators struggled to agree terms. The administrators were ready to appoint liquidators on Friday if a rescue deal was not in place, but they are likely to hold off now that progress has been made. Tufnell is a former managing director of Mothercare and Burton. He is working alongside Nick de Scossa, a Switzerland-based banker, and Jos\u00e9 Maria Soares Bento, who is thought to be working with a wealthy family in Portugal. Mystery still surrounds the identity of the family, but City sources say it is the Soares dos Santos family. The family controls Jer\u00f3nimo Martins, the Portuguese supermarket group, although any potential investment in BHS will probably be through SFMS, the family holding company. Representatives of the Dos Santos family have said they are not involved in talks to rescue BHS. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Sir Philip Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by three-time bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. The demise of BHS is being investigated by MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee and the work and pensions committee. The MPs have written to Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail business, and Anthony Gutman, the co-head of investment banking in Europe at Goldman Sachs, to seek more information about the events leading up to Retail Acquisitions buying BHS. Gutman told MPs at a hearing on Monday that he had warned Arcadia that Chappell had a history of bankruptcy and lacked retail experience. The MPs have asked Arcadia for the contract of the sale of BHS, the minutes of key board meetings that discussed the sale and the business plan presented by Retail Acquisitions. Gutman has been asked to disclose the details of the meetings he attended and answer six additional questions, such as whether he feared that working on the deal could damage the reputation of Goldman Sachs. Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said: \u201cWe have already asked nearly 1,000 questions in our hearings. So far, they have prompted more questions than answers. \u201cThese requests for information are the first steps of the next stage of our inquiry. We expect these documents to shed further light on the sorry tale of BHS before our sessions with Dominic Chappell and Sir Philip Green. Yet, despite all the complexities, it is now clear that Sir Philip called all the main shots.\u201d Chappell and the directors of Retail Acquisitions are scheduled to give evidence to MPs on 8 June, while Green will be questioned on 15 June. The Portuguese-backed consortium has emerged as BHS\u2019s best hope of a rescue deal after other parties either submitted lower bids or backed away. They registered a new vehicle, called Richess Group Limited, at Companies House on 12 May, with Tufnell, De Scossa and Soares Bento named as directors. Among the other bidders, John Hargreaves, the founder of Matalan, is thought to have balked at the cost of replenishing BHS\u2019s stock, while Crown Crest, the parent company of Poundstretcher, and Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct had their proposals rejected. Other interested parties submitted bids for small groups of BHS stores, but administrator Duff &amp; Phelps has been pushing for any buyer to acquire all the retailer\u2019s shops.",

      "bodyText": "MPs investigating controversial business practices at Sports Direct have told its founder, Mike Ashley, they will not visit the company\u2019s headquarters before next month\u2019s select committee hearing and made it clear they still expect him to show up at Westminster. The billionaire had attached the condition to his appearance in a verbose exchange of letters with Ian Wright MP, who chairs the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee. Ashley said he wanted the committee to see the \u201cexact physical conditions\u201d experienced by its staff as well as recent changes made to working practices. He had even offered to fly the MPs to the company\u2019s base in Shirebrook, Derbyshire in his personal helicopter. Ashley has locked horns with the politicians, describing them as \u201ca joke\u201d when they took the unusual step in March of issuing a summons for him to appear in front of them next month. They have been trying to quiz him about Sports Direct, following a Guardian investigation last year that found workers at the sportswear group\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse were receiving, in effect, rates of pay below the minimum wage. In a strongly worded reply, Wright says: \u201cYou will appreciate that parliamentary committees, including this one, do not accept that witnesses attach conditions to attending in response to a summons. We therefore still expect to welcome you to the committee on 7 June.\u201d Sports Direct said the MPs\u2019 decision not to visit Shirebrook was unfair and that Ashley would now seek legal advice to determine his position. In his letters to the committee Ashley questions its powers and is keen to establish the penalty should he ignore the summons. \u201cI am concerned the company (or myself) should not be unfairly subjected to a media trial,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis should not mean that I am at risk of being sanctioned (if there is power to sanction at all) for contempt of parliament.\u201d In his reply Wright said he was sure they both wanted to avoid a \u201cpotentially lengthy and public process that would follow any non-attendance\u201d. He said the committee had a number of questions it wanted to ask Ashley on the public record about the treatment of workers at Sports Direct and about the scope, progress, and timetable of the review of working practices he announced in December. Sports Direct has issued several profit warnings this year with Ashley complaining the fallout from the Guardian investigation was hurting trade. MPs will also hear from representatives of the Unite union including Steve Turner, its assistant general secretary. Previously Unite has accused the retailer of operating \u201cDickensian\u201d working practices at Shirebrook. The committee has also invited representatives of the employment agencies who supply labour to Sports Direct at the warehouse: Andy Sweeney of The Best Connection and Jon Taylor and Paul Beasley, the joint chief executives of Transline Group. A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe are disappointed that members of the committee have chosen not to visit Shirebrook in order to see working conditions with their own eyes, as we continue to believe that this is obviously the best way forward. \u201cThe committee are well aware that Mike Ashley\u2019s proposal to attend Westminster on 7 June was made on the understanding that MPs would visit Shirebrook on any day in advance of 6 June. The committee are clearly being unfair, Mike will therefore now seek legal advice with regard to his position in relation to 7 June.\u201d",

Ashley said he wanted the committee to see the \u201cexact physical conditions\u201d experienced by its staff as well as recent changes made to working practices. He had even offered to fly the MPs to the company\u2019s base in Shirebrook, Derbyshire in his personal helicopter.</p> <p>Ashley has locked horns with the politicians, describing them as \u201ca joke\u201d when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sports-directs-mike-ashley-to-be-formally-summoned-before-mps-business-committee-treatment-of-workers\">took the unusual step in March of issuing a summons</a> for him to appear in front of them next month. They have been trying to quiz him about Sports Direct, following a Guardian investigation last year that found workers at the sportswear group\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse were receiving, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">in effect, rates of pay below the minimum wage</a>. </p> <p>In a strongly worded reply, Wright says: \u201cYou will appreciate that parliamentary committees, including this one, do not accept that witnesses attach conditions to attending in response to a summons. We therefore still expect to welcome you to the committee on 7 June.\u201d</p> <p>Sports Direct said the MPs\u2019 decision not to visit Shirebrook was unfair and that Ashley would now seek legal advice to determine his position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/23/rangers-launches-legal-action-against-sports-direct-mike-ashley\">Rangers launch legal action against Sports Direct and Mike Ashley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his letters to the committee Ashley questions its powers and is keen to establish the penalty should he ignore the summons. \u201cI am concerned the company (or myself) should not be unfairly subjected to a media trial,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis should not mean that I am at risk of being sanctioned (if there is power to sanction at all) for contempt of parliament.\u201d</p> <p>In his reply Wright said he was sure they both wanted to avoid a \u201cpotentially lengthy and public process that would follow any non-attendance\u201d. </p> <p>He said the committee had a number of questions it wanted to ask Ashley on the public record about the treatment of workers at Sports Direct and about the scope, progress, and timetable of the review of working practices he announced in December. Sports Direct has issued several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/23/sports-direct-clarifies-earnings-after-profit-warning-sinks-shares-mike-ashley\">profit warnings </a>this year with Ashley complaining the fallout from the Guardian investigation was hurting trade.<br></p> <p>MPs will also hear from representatives of the Unite union including Steve Turner, its assistant general secretary. Previously Unite has accused the retailer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/09/sports-direct-investors-revolt-against-chairman-and-pay-policy\">operating \u201cDickensian\u201d working practices at Shirebrook</a>. The committee has also invited representatives of the employment agencies who supply labour to Sports Direct at the warehouse: Andy Sweeney of The Best Connection and Jon Taylor and Paul Beasley, the joint chief executives of Transline Group.</p> <p>A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe are disappointed that members of the committee have chosen not to visit Shirebrook in order to see working conditions with their own eyes, as we continue to believe that this is obviously the best way forward. </p> <p>\u201cThe committee are well aware that Mike Ashley\u2019s proposal to attend Westminster on 7 June was made on the understanding that MPs would visit Shirebrook on any day in advance of 6 June. The committee are clearly being unfair, Mike will therefore now seek legal advice with regard to his position in relation to 7 June.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Government plans to overhaul the pension scheme behind Tata Steel have been supported by the trustees despite warnings that the move would set a dangerous precedent. Allan Johnston, chairman of the board of trustees of the British Steel pension scheme, welcomed the government\u2019s decision to consult on a shakeup of the scheme as it would be a better outcome for members than entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), where Tata Steel workers would suffer a 10% cut to their benefits. The pension scheme is regarded as a major hurdle to a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK, which employs 11,000 people. The latest figures show it has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and the deficit has ballooned to \u00a3700m, up from \u00a3485m last year. The government has estimated it would cost \u00a37.5bn to buy out the scheme\u2019s benefits. If the pension scheme can be restructured, the government believes Tata Steel can be persuaded to keep its UK business, which includes the Port Talbot works in south Wales and about a dozen other sites. Under the government\u2019s plan, drawn up with trustees, the scheme would be spun off into a new financial vehicle and benchmarked against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI), potentially saving billions of pounds in future liabilities. A consultation period has started and will end on 23 June. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said the trustees had asked the government to make the scheme exempt from legislation in the 1995 Pensions Act, which blocks such changes being made to a scheme. \u201cThe scheme\u2019s trustees have come forward and asked us to look at current legislation,\u201d Javid told MPs. \u201cThe scheme trustees have put forward this proposal and it is only right that we consider it.\u201d However, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the plans \u201crisk setting a very worrying precedent\u201d and questioned whether the government can ensure that any changes to pension laws are \u201csafely ringfenced\u201d. Javid has insisted the circumstances facing Tata Steel, whose pension scheme has 130,000 members, are \u201cunique\u201d. Johnston said trustees supported government plans. He said: \u201cThe trustee of the British Steel pension scheme welcomes the government\u2019s decision to consult on changes to the law applying to the scheme. \u201cThe trustee will be writing to members over the coming days to make clear its belief that, with government support, it should be possible to modify benefits so as to allow the scheme to remain outside the Pension Protection Fund indefinitely and on a low-risk basis. Although this would entail future pension increases being cut back from their current levels, benefits would be more generous than those provided by the PPF for the vast majority of scheme members.\u201d Tata Steel also backed the proposals, saying they would \u201csignificantly improve the funding position and risk associated with the British Steel pension scheme\u201d. Trade unions representing steelworkers said entering the PPF would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d because of the cut to workers\u2019 benefits and welcomed the consultation. However, they warned that Tata Steel still has \u201csignificant legal, social and moral responsibilities\u201d to its workers. The Community, Unite and GMB unions said: \u201cIt is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. \u201cWe will seek to work constructively with the UK government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. \u201cWe need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities.\u201d Ministers have been warned not to rush into far-reaching changes to pensions law in an attempt to save Tata\u2019s UK steelmaking assets. Owen Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThere needs to be far greater clarity over how many people may lose out as a result of these proposed new arrangements and how much they stand to lose. \u201cWe also need certainty over exactly what kind of precedent these measures will create and how sure the government is that these arrangements are applicable only to the unique set of circumstances facing the steel industry.\u201d However, pensions analysts said the move could help struggling firms who have found it difficult to restructure expensive pension schemes. Tom McPhail, the head of retirement policy at financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cIn this case, a change of escalation rates could be the least worse solution. But the potential deal on British Steel could rip a hole in one of the most fundamental principles of pension provision. It is well established that pension benefits, once granted cannot be taken away. \u201cThe government should be very cautious about sacrificing such a principle in pursuit of short-term interests, even if there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake. \u201cHaving said that, it may be a blessing in disguise. Some final salary schemes have become unsustainably expensive. The bulk of employer pension funding is being used to prop up these schemes, at the expense of younger employees in defined contribution pensions. A review of how we treat final salary guarantees could ultimately unlock better long-term pension provision.\u201d Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker has promised that the EU will \u201cstep up\u201d its measures to defend the steel industry against dumping. The European commission president said the issue would be part of any decision on granting China \u201cmarket economy status\u201d, something Britain had pushed for vocally but which the steel industry has warned could further inhibit its ability to compete. Juncker\u2019s words came after the prime minister, David Cameron, said he could still offer \u201cno guarantees\u201d about the future of the Port Talbot site, which is one of a number threatened by Tata\u2019s decision to sell its British assets. The Indian company was expected to announce a shortlist of companies bidding to purchase its UK arm after a board meeting on Wednesday but failed to do so. Eight companies are thought to be in the running. It is believed that one option on the table is for Tata to take on investment support offered by the British government and maintain its operations.",

    "webTitle": "McDonald's CEO: robots won't replace workers despite tech opportunities", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McRobots are not coming to a McDonald\u2019s near you just yet, according to Steve Easterbrook, the company\u2019s chief executive officer. His comments came two days after one of the fast-food giant\u2019s former US chief executives suggested that a minimum wage of $15 an hour could lead to McDonald\u2019s replacing its workers with robots. Easterbrook was speaking at the company\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting when he said that technology is not likely to lead to \u201cjob elimination\u201d at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a topic of discussion right now,\u201d he said, when asked by one of the shareholders if the higher minimum wage would lead to shift to more automated services. McDonald\u2019s is in a service business and \u201cwill always have an important human element\u201d, Easterbrook said. \u201cIf we were able to automate certain non-value-added processes in the restaurant, we would do that because that\u2019s a smart thing to do. But then that gives us more opportunity to bring back that manpower to the front of the house where we can offer a better dining area experience,\u201d Easterbrook said. McDonald\u2019s expects to roll out table service at 400 stores in the UK by the end of this year. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as being a risk to job elimination. It might change the nature of the jobs in our restaurants.\u201d Earlier in the meeting Easterbrook said that the strategy at the core of the company\u2019s turnaround plan was putting customers \u201cback at the center of everything we do\u201d and adapting to customers instead of asking customers to adapt to the company. \u201cFrankly, technology is something that our customers are embracing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to adapt to that. It is not actually meant to be labor replacement. We can just reapportion that labor into that more service-oriented roles,\u201dhe said. Two days before the shareholders\u2019 annual meeting, former US boss Ed Rensi told Fox Business that \u201cit\u2019s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who\u2019s inefficient, making $15 an hour bagging french fries\u201d. Easterbrook did not address the potential effects of a higher federal minimum wage or the Fight for $15 protests taking place outside the meeting. Not everyone, however, was thrilled with all of McDonald\u2019s updates. Albert, a 76-year-old McDonald\u2019s stockholder with bad vision, told Easterbrook that the electronic menu boards at his local store were not customer-friendly. \u201cThe menu is small,\u201d he said, pointing out that calorie count and prices are right next to each other and are hard to tell apart. \u201cThen it flashes \u2013 on and off. It keeps changing the menu, so by the time I focus on the menu and get halfway down, it changes and disappears! Then I have to wait another 15 to 20 seconds till it comes back and the person at the register is going: \u2018May I help you? May I help you?\u2019\u201d he said, to laughter from the room. \u201cIt\u2019s pressure. If you could stop that \u2026 I don\u2019t care about the calories, it\u2019s too much to read and too fast.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up. A quick recap: MPs have urged Sajid Javid to treat cautiously, after the business secretary confirmed that the government is considering cutting the pension entitlements of British Steel workers. During an urgent statement in parliament, MPs from across the House warned of the risk that other organisations try to follow suit, potentially hitting millions of workers in the pocket. During the session, Javid explained that the scheme\u2019s Trustees had proposed shifting the scheme to a lower inflation rate [from RPI to CPI], to cover its \u00a3700m deficit. He also promised not to be hasty, despite giving just four weeks to consult on the proposal. Jo Stevens, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, said it was a \u201cpotentially very risky and precedent-setting proposal\u201d. Neil Gray, the SNP\u2019s employment spokesman, said the \u201cincredibly sensitive\u201d pensions issue must be \u201chandled with extreme care\u201d by the Government. Otherwise, he fears it could create: \u201ca very dangerous precedent that undermines workplace pensions and incentives to save to secure dignity in retirement\u201d. And Frank Field, who chairs parliament\u2019s pensions committee, warned that \u201cthousands of other schemes\u201d are in a similar predicament. Javid had just returned from meeting with Indian conglomerate Tata. He told MPs that there are seven credible bidders interested in buying Tata\u2019s assets. But he refused to comment on rumours that Tata is now considering keeping its plants, if the proposal for pension cuts is accepted. Full coverage of the session, complete with questions from a stream of MPs, starts here. Unions representing Britain\u2019s workers have welcomed the government\u2019s decision to launch a consultation today. They said it would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d if the scheme had to be rescued by the Pensions Protection Fund. One expert has predicted that the proposed change to inflation indexing would save the scheme \u00a32.5bn, and steadily eat into a pensioners\u2019 income. Here\u2019s our latest story on the Steel crisis, which will be updated later: And in other news.... Economists are worried that Britain\u2019s economy suffered a drop in business spending in the last quarter, dragging growth down to 0.4%. Britain\u2019s EU referendum appears to be partly to blame, along with the financial market turmoil in January and the slowing global economy. In another worrying sign, the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training has jumped. The oil price has fallen back below $50 per barrel, after setting a new 2016 high this morning. And in the eurozone, French protesters have scuffled with police, as dock workers set off smoke bombs and union activists disrupted fuel supplies and nuclear plants. It\u2019s all part of a new protest against labour market reforms, giving Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government another headache. Shifting the British Steel pension scheme from the Retail Prices Index to the Consumer Prices index, as the Trustees have proposed, would wipe \u00a32.5bn of its liabilities. So says Clive Fortes, Partner at Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy firm. Fortes explains: \u201cIn 2011 the Government changed statutory pension increases from RPI to CPI. If CPI is used, pension entitlements increase by around 1% less per annum than under CPI. Over a 15-20 year period, that\u2019s a 15-20% reduction on the size of an individual\u2019s pension. \u201cWhether or not a scheme has the flexibility to adopt CPI comes down to how the lawyer wrote scheme rules before 2011. Some schemes, such as British Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, clearly don\u2019t. There\u2019s a \u2018scheme rules lottery\u2019 in respect of RPI and CPI. And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer: \u201cFor a British Steel pensioner with a \u00a35,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI will see them \u00a350 worse in year one, \u00a3100 in year two and so in. Over a typical pensioners\u2019 lifetime this is a loss of \u00a315,000 of lifetime savings. On the plus side, this only one third of the average loss on falling in to the Pension Protection Fund. The government\u2019s proposed changes to the British Steel pension scheme could prompt a row with the European Union, according to the Financial Times. It says: If the government legislates to amend the rules governing one pension fund \u2014 for a struggling industry \u2014 it could raise alarm bells in Brussels: it is likely to be seen as state aid by EU officials. This won\u2019t be a problem, though, if Britain votes to leave the EU next month (on the day the consultation closes). The FT also flags up the winners and losers from the plan: In the 40-page consultation document it emerged that not all members of the scheme would be better off under the proposals. Some 5,800 would be worse off, 70,000 would be in the same situation and 40,000 would be in a better situation. (that\u2019s compared to entering the Payment Protection Fund, which would also prompt a cut to benefits) Parliament\u2019s Business, Innovation and Skills committee has just moved a step closer to getting Mike Ashley, boss of Sports Direct, to testify before them. The committee has written to Askley, declining his invitation to visit his Shirebrook warehouse. Instead, they expected to see the retail titan in their committee room on June 7 to face questions about working conditions at Sports Direct. Committee chairman Iain Wright also warns Ashley that they may also hear some critical comments about working practices (something the Guardian exposed last year). Here\u2019s the full letter: Britain\u2019s steel union have welcomed the government\u2019s decision to open a consultation on making changes to the British Steel pension scheme. They confirm that the deficit - now \u00a3700m, it appears \u2013 is a serious hurdle to finding a buyer for Tata\u2019s operations in the UK. Crucially, they warn that it would be a disaster if the scheme fell into the Pension Protection Scheme \u2013 the lifeboat for failed pension scheme. Here\u2019s the full statement: The steel trade unions \u2013 Community, Unite and GMB \u2013 have been in dialogue with the UK Government and Tata Steel for a number of weeks to secure a sustainable future for our industry. A number of bidders have made it clear that the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK. There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata\u2019s assets would involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided. We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities. It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have worked and continue to work within it. As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK\u2019s entire industrial base. The steel industry\u2019s highly skilled and dedicated workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable future for the industry will be built. The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason. The prospect of workers\u2019 pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to reconsider selling its UK assets at all! That\u2019s according to The Times, which reported today that: The sale of Tata Steel\u2019s UK assets has been thrown into confusion after speculation that the business secretary has offered Tata a deal so attractive that it may yet keep Port Talbot and a dozen other facilities around the country. One of those sweeteners is said to include an accommodation to downgrade the retirement benefits of members in the British Steel Pensions Scheme to try to keep a lid on the \u00a315 billion fund\u2019s \u00a3485 million deficit. But some ministers are apparently fighting the proposal, fearing that it would open a \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d and prompt other companies to cut entitlements too. My colleague Graham Ruddick sums up the key exchange from the steel session (which starts back at noon BST) Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said the trustees had asked the government to make the scheme exempt from legislation in the 1995 Pensions Act. \u201cThe scheme\u2019s trustees have come forward and asked us to look at current legislation,\u201d Javid told MPs. \u201cThe scheme trustees have put forward this proposal and it is only right that we consider it.\u201d However, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the plans \u201crisk setting a very worrying precedent\u201d and questioned whether the government can ensure that any changes to pension laws are \u201csafely ring-fenced\u201d. Here\u2019s our latest story on the issue: In Yes Minister, Jim Hacker defined a dangerous precedent thus: \u201cIf we do the right thing this time, we might have to do the right thing again next time.\u201d But several MPs who spoke in parliament this lunchtime are worried that the government\u2019s plans for British Steel could create the wrong sort of precedent, and hurt millions of workers in the pocket. And I think they\u2019re right to be concerned. As Sajid Javid pointed out, the suggestion to switch inflation linking from RPI to the (lower) CPI rate came from the British Steel trustees themselves. Other trustees wrestling with similar pension deficits are likely to be pondering whether a similar shift could work for them. Javid pointed out that the only thing preventing the British Steel trustees is current legislation (pesky laws, eh?). And we must assume that this legislation could be changed, if the consultation backs the plan. I say if, but the Trustees have already concluded that the change would mean workers are either better off, or no worse off, than other options. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle didn\u2019t let Javid off lightly, though \u2013 reminding the House of the minister\u2019s failure to fly to Mumbai in March, when Tata decided to pull out of the UK. Eagle also put her finger on a serious concern -- the government\u2019s consultation closes in four weeks time. Is that really enough time to consider such a serious issue? And how much time will be spent deliberating? Tata are clearly determined to get a sale quickly, so there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the government. On a brighter note, Javid had just returned to the UK from Mumbai, where he met with Tata\u2019s top brass. He still seems optimistic that a deal will be found, with seven credible bidders showing serious interest. But still..... the precedent of changing pensions rules to that workers get less than they were promised has clearly worried MPs on both sides of the house. Several members pushed Javid to confirm that any changes would just be ringfenced to British Steel, not used as a template for other companies. The business secretary did indeed give that assurance, but some MPs looked pretty concerned. Not just Labour -- Conservative Julian Knight pointed out that there is a fundamental principle here. Pensioners are entitled to receive what they were promised when they paid into a scheme. Javid also appeared to indicate that steel workers wouldn\u2019t get a ballot on the changes. And finally, Labour MP Madeleine Moon of Bridgend says that other companies are already poaching skilled steel workers. Q: Shouldn\u2019t the government give an assurance that public sector contracts will always demand a high percentage of British steel, to underpin confidence? Javid says that the government has already allowed economic and social factors to be taken into account. And he repeats that the government\u2019s promise of financial help has also provided confidence. And that is the end of the session Geriant Davies, Labour Co-operative MP for Swansea West, tells the house that he warned the government that minimum carbon pricing would hurt the steel industry. Javid agrees that energy costs are important, but not the only factor facing steel plants. Q: Does the government still want to grant China \u2018market economy status\u2019 (which the European Parliament voted against this month) Javid says the European Commission is considering the issue, but it wouldn\u2019t prevent tariffs being imposed on Chinese steel. Clive Betts MP asks the government to act on energy costs, which mean steel works pay 85% more than German rivals. Javid repeats that the government has already acted on this issue, and is prepared to do more. Sue Hayman MP asks the business secretary to reassure steel workers that they will get their full pensions. Sajid Javid agrees that steel workers have worked hard for their pensions, so the government must do everything possible to find the best outcome. The SNP\u2019s Margaret Ferrier asks about proposals to change the \u2018lesser duty rule\u2019, which allows Chinese steel firms to sell their products in the UK without a hefty tariff. Javid says there are ways to improve the lesser duty rule, but doesn\u2019t believe it should be scrapped. Labour\u2019s Paul Flynn says he\u2019ll soon qualify for a pension after 30 years in the steel industry, but it will be dwarfed by House of Commons pension. Isn\u2019t it repugnant that workers in such a dangerous, skilled, industry are being asked to pay to cover their pension deficit? Javid says the government will leave no stone unturned to find a buyer for Tata\u2019s UK assets. Richard Fuller, Conservative MP, makes an important point -- could any future surplus be transferred out of the pension fund? Javid agrees that pension benefits should always go to those who have paid in. Labour\u2019s David Anderson raises the issue of miners\u2019 pensions, saying retired workers are suffering from government decisions in the past. Javid says that the proposals on the table today are different to what happened in the 1990s. [some background: in 1994, the government took half of the surplus in the miners\u2019 pension scheme, but some workers then missed out on their half due to pension rules] Kevin Foster, Conservative MP, urges the government to ringfence any pension changes Javid repeats that this is a one-off situation. Javid then warns that unless changes are made, it\u2019s very likely that the British Steel pension scheme would have to be rescued by the Pension Protection Fund (which would also result in a cut to benefits). Q: Will any changes to the British Steel pension scheme be put to a ballot of members? Javid says that the Trustees already have the right to change the indexing, but they are prevented by legislation. It\u2019s important that full information is provided to members, he adds. So, no ballot? Asked again about steel-dumping, Sajid Javid says that British steel is the best in the world - and some companies have come to regret buying inferior foreign alternatives. Labour\u2019s Jessica Morden asks what the government is doing to reassure companies who buy British steel, such as Nissan (who have a plant in her constituency, Newport East). Sajid Javid says the government has been speaking to customers and telling them that British steel has a long-term future. Conservative MP Steve Double asks what impact the climate change levy introduced by Gordon Brown has had on the steel industry. Sajid Javid says the government is providing support and exemptions to help companies with energy costs. Kevan Jones MP raises the importance of Britain\u2019s steel industry to the defence sector. Javid says 95,000 tonnes of British steel will be used in the new Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. Q: Could potential bidders work in partnership to help the steel industry? Javid says that the field of seven bidders will be narrowed, and he\u2019s confident that Tata would be amenable if bidders wanted to work together. Asked about timings, Savid Javid says there is no deadline to find a buyer - but Tata want to move quickly. Redcar MP Anna Turley, says the government has acted disgracefully over the steel crisis and urges Javid not to inflict more pain on workers. (a steel plant in Redcar closed last autumn with the loss of 1,700 jobs). Sajid Javid says that more details about the proposed pension plans will be released soon, which should provide reassurance to workers. Conservative MP Mark Spencer wants reassurances that any deal will work, and that MPs won\u2019t be back discussing this issue in two years. Javid repeates that there is no deal yet, and any deal depends on the approval of the Pension Regulator. Dennis Skinner MP raises the issue of the miners\u2019 pension scheme, saying the \u201clousy rotten Tory government\u201d refused to provide any help. Javid says this doesn\u2019t have anything to do today\u2019s issue. Conservative MP Julian Knight says the government must retain the crucial principles that members always have the final say, and that pension promises are delivered. Javid agrees that the integrity of the pension system must be retained. He repeats that the pension scheme trustees believe that changing the inflation indexing is in the best interests of its members. Seema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble, asks what support is being given to steel workers and their communities. Javid says that the best support is the confidence that there is a long-term future for the UK steel industry. That includes the offer of hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, that could see the government buying a 25% stake. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens asks what discussions have taken place with the pensions regulator about this \u201cpotentially risky and precedent-setting proposal\u201d. Javid says discussions have taken place, and confirmed that they would need to have the regulator\u2019s full support. Labour\u2019s Tom Blenkinsop says his father in law is a British steel pensioner. Q: What would happen if the scheme were taken into the Pension Protection Fund? Sajiv Javid says that if this happened, workers would still get 100% of their pension but the indexing would probably move to the CPI inflation rate. Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government needs to get to the \u201croot of the problem\u201d, the dumping of Chinese steel. Q: Why can\u2019t the government impose higher tariffs, as the US just did? Javid says the government has acted when there is evidence of steel dumping. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, who represents Port Talbot, raises media reports that Tata could actually retain its UK assets. Javid declines to comment on these rumours, saying the government wants to work constructively with all potential bidders. Conservative David Mowat asks whether changing the benchmarking from RPI to CPI inflation will bring the British Steel pension scheme into surplus. Q: If not, could workers face a \u201cdouble-whammy\u201d if the scheme later moves into the Pension Protection Fund? The trustees believe it would bring the scheme into surplus, and make it stable, Javid replies. But the pension regulator would have to be satisfied first. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, points out that many other pension schemes are in deficit. It will be hard to \u2018gate\u2019 these plans just to the steel industry. He asks for a discussion after the recess, to consider the full impact of the proposed changes. Javid says he\u2019s happy to meet with Field to discuss the issue, and repeats that the government\u2019s plans are restricted to the steel sector. Tom Pursglove MP asks if the government knows whether more investment could come to steel works in his constituency, Corby. Javid says commercial details are sensitive, but there are seven serious bids on the table. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the business, innovation and skills committee,is also worried about the precedent issue. Q: Is this deal purely for steel, or is it being extended to other strategically important industries? And is the government\u2019s preferred option the 2012 deal for Royal Mail, which distinguished between past and future contributions? Javid says there is no deal yet, and no preferred option and no decision has been made. He repeats that the government is keen not to create a dangerous precedent. This is a unique case. Conservative MP David Davies, of Monmouth, commends Sajid Javid for his efforts to save the UK steel industry. But he urges the business secretary to proceed carefully Javid agrees that the government shouldn\u2019t be reckless, but points out that the trustee of the Pension Scheme has announced his support. SNP MP Neil Gray is disappointed by the lack of detail in the government\u2019s plans. Q: How would it affect current workers, and could it be a dangerous precedent? Javid says the government must tread carefully, and avoid creating any precedents that the House would regretted later. But it\u2019s right to listen to the Trustees\u2019 concerns. Onto questions. Pauline Latham, Conservative MP, asks about another crisis - the future of BHS. A company in her constituency, Courtaulds, which supplies the stricken retailer has gone into administration. Can the government help? Sajid Javid agrees to meet Latham to discuss Courtaulds. Sajid Javid defends the short length of the consultation - time is of the essence in the search for a buyer. He says the trustees of the British Steel pension fund approached the government, asking for changes to be made. Javid confirms that legislation in the 1995 pension act prevents the trustees from benchmarking pensions against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI). They want the government to allow a change. The trustees believe that, in almost every case, members would be better off, or no worse off, he says. But the government must assess whether it is the right thing to do - thus the consultation. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Angela Eagle, responds. She reminds the house that steel workers protested outside parliament yesterday. She\u2019s disappointed that Sajid Javid didn\u2019t give any more details about the pensions consultation in his statement. And is worried that the consultation will only run for four weeks. She says the business secretary was right to visit Mumbai this week -- a case of \u201cbetter late than never\u201d (a reference to his notorious trip to Australia when the steel crisis blew up) Eagle is worried that moving from the RPI inflation rate to the CPI version \u201crisks creating a very dangerous precedent\u201d. And it is currently illegal. She asks if the government can ring-fence any such move, to protect other workers. And finally, has the secretary of state considered the impact on the incentive to save, if pensions rights can be arbitrarily cut. The steel crisis is ultimately about the workers who make Britain\u2019s steel industry the best in the world, Javid continues. We will continue to fight for British steel for a long as it takes, he adds. Sajid Javid begins by telling MPs that he just returned from Mumbai a few hours ago. During his trip, he stressed the importance of Tata running a \u201cresponsible\u201d sales process for its UK steel operations. There are several credible bids on the table, which Tata is now considering closely. The government will continue its dialogue with Tata, and those bidders. Javid says it\u2019s not the government\u2019s job to pick a winner, but to help with the sales process and remove potential obstacles. That\u2019s why they have launched a consultation into the pension scheme today. Javid: Several credible bids for Tata\u2019s UK steel works Business secretary Sajid Javid is on his feet, updating the House of Commons on the British Steel pensions consulation. It\u2019s being streamed on the BBC\u2019s Parliament site. I\u2019ll cover the main points in this liveblog. One of the City of London\u2019s top experts on pensions is worried about the government\u2019s plan. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at financial service group Hargreaves Lansdown, says: In this case, a change of escalation rates could be the least worse solution. But the potential deal on British Steel could rip a hole in one of the most fundamental principles of pension provision. It is well-established that pension benefits, once granted cannot be taken away. The government should be very cautious about sacrificing such a principle in pursuit of short term interests, even if there are tens of thousands of jobs at stake. McPhail adds that a proper review of final salary guarantees is needed. The situation in the British steel pension fund is worse than first thought.... Opposition MPs have already criticised the government for suddenly launching this consultation, just before the House of Commons breaks for a recess. This one-month consultation is due to end on the same day as the EU referendum.... The trustee of the British Steel pension fund is backing the government over its plans to potentially cut pension payments to workers. Allan Johnston believes this would be a better outcome for members than entering the Pension Protection Fund (when there is an automatic 10% reduction to benefits) My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: The government believes if it can significantly restructure the pension scheme then Tata Steel can be persuaded to keep the business. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer and is looking at ways to restructure the pension scheme by reducing its liabilities by billions of pounds. However, there is a row within the government about Javid\u2019s plan to cut the scheme\u2019s liabilities by benchmarking it against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI) and spinning it off into a new financial vehicle. The Department for Work and Pensions is concerned that this could set a dangerous precedent for defined benefit pension schemes, also known as a final salary scheme. Here\u2019s the full story: There are important developments in the crisis gripping Britain\u2019s steel industry, which could hit pensioners in the pocket. The government has announced a new consultation into overhauling the British Steel Pension Scheme. That scheme, currently in deficit, is a stumbling-block to finding a buyer for several steel plants including the Port Talbot blast furnace. Pensions minister Stephen Crabb has told parliament in a written statement that: \u201cThe consultation includes a full range of options that consider whether and how the scheme could be separated from the existing sponsoring employer and whether it will be necessary to reduce the benefits within the scheme.\u201d The Scheme has liabilities of around \u00a315bn, and a deficit of around \u00a3700m \u00a3485m . Crabb\u2019s announcement is fuelling concerns that pensioners across the country could suffer, if benefits due to steel workers are cut. A former pensions minister, Steve Webb, has warned that the government was \u201cgoing down a very dangerous path\u201d in seeking to change the law. \u201cEveryone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers, well beyond the steel industry.\u201d Business secretary Sajid Javid is expected to update the House of Commons shortly... We should remember that Britain\u2019s service sector has been becoming increasingly dominant for decades, partly due to the sweeping changes during the Thatcher government: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that the UK economy has continued to slow in the current quarter. \u201cLooking ahead to Q2, the latest Services Index release showed services output falling in March providing a weak starting point for expansion. While early days, a run of weak activity surveys in April also casts a gloomy note, suggesting that the economy will see a further deceleration in growth. A cloudy international outlook and the prospect of rising inflation at home will present ongoing headwinds.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the 0.5% fall in business investment last quarter is a clear sign that Brexit fears are hurting the Britain\u2019s economy. He warns: \u201cGlobal concerns have eased more recently, but uncertainty related to the EU referendum could lead to a further moderation in growth in the second quarter as some businesses continue to defer investment and hiring decisions. But the economy should rebound in the second half of the year in the event of a vote to Remain. City traders agree. Joshua Mahony of IG says: The downward revision of GDP to 2% suggests that perhaps the recovery we have been looking for after 18 months of slowing growth just isn\u2019t there. Perhaps the most telling figure today was the Q1 business investment reading, which contracted for the second consecutive quarter. This is a clear indication of the fear that firms are experiencing regarding the effects of a Brexit and makes you wonder what this number would look like in the event the UK left the EU. Tom Floyd of Foenix Partners concurs: The weaker annual growth rate (2%) is further confirmation of the Brexit related negativity already embedded in the wider economy and aside from recent retail sales, continues a poor run of UK economic indicators. Anyone remember George Osbornes\u2019 \u201cMarch of the Makers\u201d? It seems to have taken a wrong-turning. Ms Lee Hopley, Chief Economist at EEF, says Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from problems overseas, and the EU referendum: \u201cThe data confirms a softer start to the year as households continue in the driving seat with their foot on the gas Business investment, however, slipped further and net trade again failed to support GDP growth. It\u2019s far from a surprising picture given the wobbly world economy at the start of the year is providing little impetus to export growth or, confidence amongst business to press ahead with big expansion plans. \u201cWhile the referendum is just another dampening factor in the mix, on the other side of it we\u2019ll need to see a more supportive external environment and a lot more certainty about the domestic industrial policy agenda to see a return of better balanced growth this year.\u201d Today\u2019s growth figures also confirm that Britain\u2019s service sector is outperforming everything else. Services output jumped by 0.6% during the last quarter, but construction shrank by 1.0% and manufacturing declined by 0.4%. The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar, following the news that business investment fell by 0.5% in the last quarter. Breaking: UK growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016, down from 0.6%, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s in line with the first estimate, released last month. But the annual growth rate has been revised down to 2%, from 2.1% initially. And business investment has fallen, for the first time in three years. Business investment fell by 0.5% during the quarter, driven by \u201cfalls in non-residential building\u201d, the ONS says. That may show that companies are more cautious about economic prospects and have been cutting back. That could be due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets, or the EU referendum. However, gross fixed capital formation growth (another measure of corporate investment) did rise by 0.5% in January-March after shrinking in the previous three months. The figures also show another deterioration in Britain\u2019s trade with the rest of the world. Exports declined in the last quarter, while imports rose. The trade balance deficit widened from \u00a316.4bn in Quarter 4 2015 to \u00a318.0 billion in Quarter 1 2016 . Following a 0.1% increase in Quarter 4 2015, exports decreased by 0.3% in the latest quarter, while imports increased by 0.8% in Quarter 1 2016 following a 0.9% increase in Quarter 4 2015. Nearly time for those UK growth figures.... Tomas Casasi-Klett, Professor at the University of St Gallen, says the world leaders gatherer in Tokyo have a lot to worry about. He argues that Shinzo Abe was right to warn of a potential Lehman Brothers moment today: The G7 will be about keeping all black swans at bay, starting with the Brexit one, we are at a point where the world is evermore fearful of a black swan, a Minsky moment*. A number of events could mirror the Lehmann trigger we saw in 2008, these include a Trump victory in November or unexpected economic volatility in China\u2019s markets. However, a Brexit is now the most immediate and plausible candidate for such a trigger - it would activate other triggers across the globe, a chain-reaction of sorts originating with British voters. [* - That\u2019s Hyman Minsky, the economist who showed that financial crises are caused after over-confident investors drive asset prices too high, using cheap credit to fuel speculative trading] Britain\u2019s EU referendum is just four weeks away, and City traders are getting nervous. The cost of hedging against wild swings in the value of the pound over the next month has jumped this morning. It hit its highest level since March 2009, in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Those contracts now cover the referendum day, and the day after, when the pound is likely to be volatile \u2013\u2013 whichever side wins. Shares in miners and oil producers are rallying this morning, following the jump in the oil price. The sight of Brent crude nudging over $50 per barrel is boosting confidence in the City, while a weakening US dollar is pushing up other commodity prices too. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, explains: Energy and Mining stocks are topping the FTSE this morning with gains of 2-3% after Brent Crude broke back above the symbolic $50/barrel 6-month highs overnight and an easing in US Dollar strength benefits the greenback-denominated raw materials space as a whole. But he also points out that a high oil price could encourage firms to boost oil production: Sceptics will point to the breakout by oil \u2013 inspired by a drop in US oil stockpiles on top of falling US output and global supply problems \u2013 as likely attracting shale/frackers back to idle rigs. Japan\u2019s PM, Shinzo Abe, has apparently warned G7 world leaders that we could suffer a crisis on the scale of Lehman Brothers in 2008. That\u2019s according to the Nikkei news agency The world economy is high on the agenda for the G7 meeting, with Abe pushing fellow leaders for \u2018flexible fiscal spending\u2019 (ie, higher government investment) and structural reforms. My colleague Claire Phipps is live-blogging the whole G7, here: Leaders have taken time out to plant a few trees. Maybe they wanted to show the \u2018green shoots of recovery\u2019, but frankly it looks more like a productivity problem -- nine world leaders to plant three trees?! Here\u2019s an example of the supply disruptions that has pushed the oil price up, from Reuters: A Nigerian youth group leader confirmed on Thursday that militants had attacked a Chevron oil facility in the Niger Delta. \u201cThe attack truly happened,\u201d Eric Omare, spokesman for the Ijaw Youth Council, said. A group called Niger Delta Avengers had claimed the attack late on Wednesday. Oil prices have hit their highest level of the year, after figures showed that the long-running glut in crude prices could finally be eroding. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has jumped over the $50 per barrel mark. This is the highest level since last November, and could herald higher energy costs and petrol prices. The move comes after data, released yesterday, which showed that US crude inventories fell last week. It appears that the industry\u2019s supply problems, particularly wildfires in Canada and outages in Nigeria, are now hitting home. And analysts are predicting that this means oil reserves will start to be eroded, if demand remains above supply. Citi explains: \u201cUS oil inventories have largely topped out and should decline through the summer.\u201d And if they\u2019re right, it will have implications for global inflation rates, and possibly nudge central bankers closer to raising borrowing costs (as cheap energy has been keeping the cost of living down). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a proper insight into the state of Britain\u2019s economy this morning, when the second estimate of GDP for the first quarter of 2016 is released, at 9.30am. The figures should confirm that growth slowed to just 0.4% in January-March, meaning Britain lagged behind the eurozone. But we\u2019ll also get much more detail, on how trade, investment and consumption changed during the quarter. Economists will be looking for signs that the slowdown in overseas markets, such as China, hurt the UK. We could also see some early impact from June\u2019s EU referendum. The figures are likely to show that, once again, Britain relied on domestic spending rather than exports to keep the economy moving. RBC Capital Markets explain: Private consumption growth is once again expected to make the main contribution to total growth with net trade likely being a drag. Expectations for business investment will also be muted given that the approaching EU referendum became a more high profile source of uncertainty during the period. Also coming up.... World leaders are gathered in Tokyo for the G7 meeting, so we\u2019ll see what Angela Merkel, David Cameron and the gang say about the global economy: And investors will also be watching Greece, following the agreement hammered out with euro ministers. Yesterday, the IMF cautioned that it still isn\u2019t yet ready to join the bailout; meaning more uncertainty for Athens over the next few months.",

Some schemes, such as British Airways, allow the flexibility to adopt CPI. Others, such as British Steel, clearly don\u2019t. There\u2019s a \u2018scheme rules lottery\u2019 in respect of RPI and CPI.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And what would it mean for an individual? Fortes has the answer:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cFor a British Steel pensioner with a \u00a35,000 per annum pension, a move to CPI will see them \u00a350 worse in year one, \u00a3100 in year two and so in. Over a typical pensioners\u2019 lifetime this is a loss of \u00a315,000 of lifetime savings.

A number of bidders have made it clear that the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) presents a major challenge to any sale. We also fully understand the great importance of this pension scheme to both current and former steelworkers and steel communities across the UK.</p> <p>There has been a lot of speculation that any sale of Tata\u2019s assets would involve the BSPS going into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The trade unions believe that such a move would be an unmitigated disaster. The PPF is a financial safety net but it would see every member of the scheme take an unnecessary cut in pension benefits. The financial health of the BSPS is such that going into the PPF can certainly be avoided.</p> <p>We welcome the announcement of a government consultation on the future of the BSPS and the trade unions will of course make a full submission in due course. It is important that all stakeholders continue to explore all available options that avoid the need for the scheme to go into the PPF, which would be the worst deal for scheme members. We will seek to work constructively with the UK Government and the scheme trustees to deliver the best possible deal for our members. We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities.</p> <p>It is important to remember that Tata Steel remains the employer and sponsor of the BSPS. They have significant legal, social and moral responsibilities with regards to the British steel industry and those men and women who have worked and continue to work within it.</p> <p>As we have done so throughout this process, we will continue to be led by our members in the steel industry. In the midst of this crisis and great uncertainty, they continue to produce world class steel that supports the UK\u2019s entire industrial base. The steel industry\u2019s highly skilled and dedicated workforce will surely be the foundation on which a sustainable, profitable future for the industry will be built.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/735800469847715840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: Joint statement on British Steel Pension Scheme from the steel trade unions <a href=\"https://t.co/SCuYDL9lIA\">https://t.co/SCuYDL9lIA</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveOurSteel?src=hash\">#SaveOurSteel</a></p>&mdash; Community union (@CommunityUnion) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CommunityUnion/status/735800469847715840\">May 26, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-26T14:22:51.633Z\">at 3.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57470033e4b006af16bc0aa1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-26T14:01:12.848Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The proposed pension changes are controversial for another reason.</strong></p> <p>The prospect of workers\u2019 pension rights being cut has prompted Tata to reconsider selling its UK assets at all!

      "bodyText": "Oil prices have broken through the $50 per barrel mark for the first time in almost seven months after storage figures suggested that the glut in global crude supplies was easing. Many analysts have predicted that the recovery, which will help the North Sea oil industry and could steady the global economy but hurt motorists through higher petrol costs, could be short-lived. The price of Brent crude edged up 0.9% to $50.2 a barrel, boosted by data from the US government showing a sharper than expected fall in crude stocks last week, and it later fell back slightly. It was Brent\u2019s highest price since early November, and a sign that supply disruption triggered by the wildfires in Canada\u2019s Alberta province and outages in Nigeria is starting to be felt across the global oil industry. The crude price, which compares with $118 nearly two years ago, was also helped by a fall in the price of the dollar. Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said that while a recovery in crude prices should be positive for the global economy, there were downsides. He said: \u201cThe recovery is, on balance, good news for the global economy and for equity prices. Prices in the $50-$60 range would be high enough to ease some of the pressure on producers, while still low enough to boost spending on other goods and services. \u201cHigher oil prices are clearly better news for producers, or mixed producers/consumers such as the US, than they are for consumers. In particular, the rebound in oil prices will sap some of the momentum from the economic recoveries in the eurozone and Japan.\u201d Jessop added that a rebound in oil prices would remove another reason for the Federal Reserve to delay raising US interest rates. But Sebastien Marlier, the senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, remained doubtful that the current rally would last: \u201cOverall, demand growth is still slower than last year. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Russia are still pumping at record levels and Iran has come back faster than many expected \u2026 A sustained recovery will more probably take hold in 2017-18.\u201d Chad Holliday, the chairman of Shell, told investors at a company meeting in London that it remained a \u201cvery demanding time for our industry\u201d, pointing out that 42 oil and gas companies filed for bankrupcy in the US last year. Ric Spooner, the chief market analyst at Sydney\u2019s CMC Markets, told Reuters that the world was still oversupplied with oil, even given increased demand and supply disruptions from Canadian wildfires and violence in Libya and Nigeria. \u201cCertainly [$50] is a psychological barrier. There is a momentum \u2013 people will try and push it up over that,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a practical point of view, will there or will there not be a sustainable increase above $50? At the $50-$55 range there has got to be a good chance of seeing the peak.\u201d US crude stocks fell at the steepest rate in seven weeks last week, by 4.2m barrels to 537.1m, much larger than the 2.5m-barrel drop analysts were expecting. The price of US oil futures also rose by 33 cents to $49.89 a barrel, the highest since October. Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cWhile oil inventory levels continue to remain high, the fact that we are now starting to see bigger than expected draws on a much more regular basis is helping keep the momentum behind the current rally sustained for now, as both Brent and US prices move in lockstep with each other.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Danish-based Dong Energy, a major investor in British offshore windfarms, is heading for the world\u2019s biggest stock market flotation so far this year with a price tag for the entire business of 106.5bn kroner (\u00a311bn). The group, which has been a flag carrier for companies moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy, expects to sell up to 17% of its shares, each priced between 200 and 255 kroner. The Copenhagen government, which owns 59% of Dong, said it wanted to retain a controlling half stake in a company that has invested in UK gas fields off the north of Scotland as well as windfarms such as London Array off the Kent coast. The float, to be completed on 9 June, comes amid a 75% rise in the oil price since January lows, which has helped lift the share prices and pushed up the valuation of renewable energy suppliers such as Vestas Wind Systems in Denmark. Thomas Thune Andersen, Dong\u2019s chairman, said it was the right time to find new shareholders for a company that reported a 35% increase in first quarter profits last month. \u201cOver the past decade, Dong Energy has transformed itself. It is now a financially secure, fast-growing, profitable business with a leading position in the exciting offshore wind sector. \u201cWe have built a strong and differentiated profile in renewable energy and made excellent progress towards becoming a leader among European energy companies in the transition to renewable energy. We look forward to welcoming new shareholders who can join us in our journey towards building a greener energy future.\u201d Morten Imsgard, an analyst at Sydbank in Denmark, said the pricing was at the high end of his expectations. \u201cIt is a company that is relatively complex to value. Because it\u2019s crucial what expectations you have as an investor on the offshore wind turbine sector,\u201d he told news agency Ritzau. It is not the first time Dong has tried to tap stock market investors. Three previous efforts were abandoned amid indications the IPO would not be successful. Dong, which was formed out of an oil and gas business plus a host of local Danish utilities, employs 700 people in Britain and has invested \u00a36bn in this country. The company has said it will double this spending by 2020 through constructing projects such as the Hornsea Project One windfarm off the east Yorkshire coast. That would become the world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm once completed in 2020 with a capacity of 1.2GW. Each turbine will be 190 metres tall \u2013 larger than the Gherkin building in London. The selling off of Dong stock has not been universally popular in Denmark, with an earlier disposal of a 18% stake to US investment bank Goldman Sachs triggering the exit from a coalition government of the leftwing Socialist People\u2019s party. If the float is successful it should dwarf that of China\u2019s Zheshang bank, which raised $1.9bn (\u00a31.3bn). Henrik Poulsen, the Dong chief executive, said he had been \u201cencouraged by the positive feedback we have received so far in the process from the investors that we have seen around the world over the past couple of months\u201d. Elchin Mammadov, a utility analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the proposed share prices were based on different sectors of the business: \u201cThe lower range represents where European oil and gas companies are trading, while the higher range corresponds to where utilities are valued at the moment.\u201d Dong\u2019s profits from renewables were 3bn kroner, with 2bn kroner from oil and gas, plus 1bn kroner from the electricity grid system it operates in Denmark, the company reported last month. Earnings from renewables, mainly offshore wind, had risen by more than 50% but group profits were bolstered by almost 2bn kroner of disposals.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Denys Henderson obituary", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Denys Henderson, who has died aged 83, was the man who oversaw the brave decision to break Britain\u2019s best known industrial icon, ICI, into two: a chemicals business, later sold off piecemeal; and an increasingly successful bioscience operation, which, as AstraZeneca, became one of Britain\u2019s two world-class pharmaceutical companies. Henderson would later recall that, as he pondered the decision to reverse the historic 1926 merger that had created ICI as a single British champion in the then expanding chemical industry, the eyes of previous chairmen seemed to bore through him from their portraits in the directors\u2019 corridor. His justification was value for shareholders, and the release of the home-grown pharmaceuticals division to grow and merge. Startling as it seemed at the time, the demerger would set a pattern endlessly repeated by other companies. But while pharmaceuticals prospered, the chemical business, buffeted by the competitive forces which troubled all western chemical companies, failed to restructure successfully and, after numerous disposals, was eventually bought by Akzo Nobel in 2007 for its paints business. The son of Scottish parents, Nellie (nee Gordon) and John Hartley Henderson, he was born in Sri Lanka. His father worked for a tea company, but soon returned to Aberdeen to set up a modest tea business of his own. Denys was educated in Aberdeen, at the grammar school and at the university, where he read law. National service as an army prosecuting solicitor was formative; he developed a quickness on his feet that became legendary, and a disinclination to settle for the life of a provincial solicitor. In 1957 he answered ICI\u2019s advertisement for lawyers. Henderson was soon a commercial assistant in various departments, at headquarters, at the paints division, then at the Billingham complex in Co Durham as assistant secretary of the agricultural division. In the same year he married Doreen Glashan, another child of the Scottish diaspora, brought up in Argentina. It was a strong partnership and she became a supportive and respected company wife. In 1974, a key promotion came to ICI general manager, commercial, handling relations with government; a traditional grooming ground. By 1977 Henderson was chairman of paints, appearing in television advertisements alongside the Dulux dog. But when he joined the ICI board in 1980, he found it in crisis. The traditionally dominant heavy chemicals divisions were labouring under the recession induced by the 1979 oil price shock and uncompromising Thatcherite policies. The board was unwieldy and change overdue. Henderson was one of those who backed change and chose the charismatic John Harvey-Jones as a reforming chairman. After early pain, with a loss declared and the dividend cut in 1982, and the board slashed by half and given a new strategic role, the company staged a remarkable recovery. Henderson claimed major responsibility for creating an acquisitions team to reshape the portfolio. In 1986 he became deputy chairman, and in 1987 the company\u2019s youngest ever chairman, after a string of acquisitions in the US. Business seemed buoyant. Change meant the company was now genuinely international, with three-quarters of its business and over half its employees outside Britain. It was the first UK company to post \u00a31bn profit; and in 1989 it reached \u00a31.5bn. But that was the peak. New acquisitions, such as advanced materials, agrochemicals and seeds, were not fulfilling their promise. The ICI board had spurned a chance to acquire Beechams and expand its successful pharmaceuticals. Plans to float its industrial chemicals business could never get the numbers to stack up. Henderson had to make reshaping work. He was brisk, ebullient, quick to react and competitive, but short of a masterplan. His outer confidence masked internal uncertainties, while his attention to detail seemed dour compared to Harvey-Jones\u2019s telegenic, if sometimes erratic, enthusiasms. Subordinates could smart under his brusque and unforgiving tongue. But he found an authentic style. Insisting that the company be more outward-looking, he set up a market focus unit. Television advertising with the slogan \u201cICI-world class\u201d stressed the company\u2019s international successes and boosted employee morale. Increasingly, he made himself publicly available to explain industry concerns. Early evening background chats over a glass of his favourite whisky with business commentators opened eyes to current issues and built a reputation for straighttalking. He was knighted in 1989, and was the first publicly to call the 1990 recession. By the time of the Maastricht negotiations of 1991 that would lead to the establishment of a single European currency, No 10 was channelling reporters to his door, as one of the few industrialists who could both back the European idea and handle John Humphrys. But by now, the fault-lines in the ICI structure were cracking open under the pressure of a new recession. With directors such as Ronnie Hampel urging more hands-on management structures and questioning the sprawling portfolio, Henderson established two reviews. The verdict: concentrate on fewer business sectors, and only those where the company could be among the best in the world. But ICI\u2019s travails had not gone unnoticed. Only weeks later, in May 1991, the legendary corporate raider James Hanson struck, buying 2.8% of ICI shares. A coordinated media campaign set out to portray ICI as a sclerotic giant, suitable prey for the nimble Hanson. It targeted Henderson specifically. \u201cTo the uninitiated, it seems obvious that the board of ICI should change its chairman,\u201d claimed the Times. The board was initially frozen, but Henderson came out fighting. He split his executive into two, one to fight the potential bid (the \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d), the other to maximise business performance. A two-pronged riposte to Hanson\u2019s propaganda used background briefings to emphasise the changes that seemingly hidebound ICI had been making, while questions were invited about Hanson\u2019s corporate governance and fitness to take over the UK\u2019s largest exporter and research-spender. Politicians were lobbied and the European parliament passed a motion supporting ICI. In a private meeting, even the then recently retired Margaret Thatcher pledged her ICI shares to Henderson. He defied advisers by publicly ruling out disposal of the pharmaceutical business. The battle was won by two events: the revelation, ferreted out by ICI\u2019s forensic examination of his accounts, that Hanson had used company money to buy racehorses, and a powerful performance by the ICI businesses declared that July. But the board was shaken. The famed synergy between its businesses had proved difficult to substantiate. More radical change was needed. Henderson requested a bright banker from Warburg\u2019s to look again at options. John Mayo hatched the plan to split the company in two \u2013 bioscience including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals under the name of Zeneca, and the rest. Its rationale was that the two strands were diverging; it was difficult for the same management to run both; freed up, they could realign in the coming shake-up of both pharmaceuticals and chemicals. While process teams laboured, Henderson lobbied directors and former chairmen. With few exceptions, they approved. Executive management of the two groups transferred to Hampel and David Barnes, but Henderson remained as chairman of both until 1995. His relations with the City were always double-edged. Early on in his chairmanship, he criticised its influence and was slow to sign up to the mantra of shareholder value. In retirement he remained critical of its high salaries. In the 1980s he had also turned important, if belated, attention to ICI\u2019s patchy environmental performance and appointed a director responsible. The company was one of the first to issue an annual environmental report. Increasingly he was seen as an elder statesman and was never short of job offers. Outside ICI, his directorships included Dalgety, RTZ and Schlumberger. From 1983, Henderson was an advocate of change on the stuffy and oversized Barclays board, where he was told his plainspeaking did not accord with the board\u2019s oblique way of doing business. He became chairman of the Rank Organisation in 1995, but structural difficulties and a poor choice of chief executive meant his tenure was not a success. In 1997, he was called back to sort out problems at Dalgety and secured a break-up of the company, pleasing investors. He headed the Crown Estate Commissioners (1995-2002), and later sat on the Qinetiq board (2003-05). From 1993, as chancellor, he presided over the successful growth of Bath University. He enjoyed time with his family, read widely, played undistinguished golf and swam every morning. In his 70s he cared devotedly for his wife after she suffered an aneurysm, but more recently his health and mental facility had declined. He is survived by Doreen, their two daughters, Nicola and Fiona, and six grandchildren. \u2022 Denys Hartley Henderson, businessman, born 11 October 1932; died 21 May 2016",

It was a strong partnership and she became a supportive and respected company wife.</p> <p>In 1974, a key promotion came to ICI general manager, commercial, handling relations with government; a traditional grooming ground. By 1977 Henderson was chairman of paints, appearing in television advertisements alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/house-and-homes-blog/gallery/2011/oct/27/50-years-dulux-dog-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the Dulux dog</a>. But when he joined the ICI board in 1980, he found it in crisis. The traditionally dominant heavy chemicals divisions were labouring under the recession induced by the 1979 oil price shock and uncompromising Thatcherite policies. The board was unwieldy and change overdue. Henderson was one of those who backed change and chose the charismatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/11/ici.bbc\" title=\"\">John Harvey-Jones</a> as a reforming chairman.</p> <p>After early pain, with a loss declared and the dividend cut in 1982, and the board slashed by half and given a new strategic role, the company staged a remarkable recovery. Henderson claimed major responsibility for creating an acquisitions team to reshape the portfolio. In 1986 he became deputy chairman, and in 1987 the company\u2019s youngest ever chairman, after a string of acquisitions in the US.</p> <p>Business seemed buoyant. Change meant the company was now genuinely international, with three-quarters of its business and over half its employees outside Britain. It was the first UK company to post \u00a31bn profit; and in 1989 it reached \u00a31.5bn. But that was the peak. New acquisitions, such as advanced materials, agrochemicals and seeds, were not fulfilling their promise. The ICI board had spurned a chance to acquire Beechams and expand its successful pharmaceuticals. Plans to float its industrial chemicals business could never get the numbers to stack up.</p> <p>Henderson had to make reshaping work. He was brisk, ebullient, quick to react and competitive, but short of a masterplan. His outer confidence masked internal uncertainties, while his attention to detail seemed dour compared to Harvey-Jones\u2019s telegenic, if sometimes erratic, enthusiasms. Subordinates could smart under his brusque and unforgiving tongue.</p> <p>But he found an authentic style. Insisting that the company be more outward-looking, he set up a market focus unit. Television advertising with the slogan \u201cICI-world class\u201d stressed the company\u2019s international successes and boosted employee morale. Increasingly, he made himself publicly available to explain industry concerns. Early evening background chats over a glass of his favourite whisky with business commentators opened eyes to current issues and built a reputation for straighttalking. He was knighted in 1989, and was the first publicly to call the 1990 recession. By the time of the Maastricht negotiations of 1991 that would lead to the establishment of a single European currency, No 10 was channelling reporters to his door, as one of the few industrialists who could both back the European idea and handle John Humphrys.</p> <p>But by now, the fault-lines in the ICI structure were cracking open under the pressure of a new recession. With directors such as Ronnie Hampel urging more hands-on management structures and questioning the sprawling portfolio, Henderson established two reviews. The verdict: concentrate on fewer business sectors, and only those where the company could be among the best in the world.</p> <p>But ICI\u2019s travails had not gone unnoticed. Only weeks later, in May 1991, the legendary corporate raider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/nov/03/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">James Hanson</a> struck, buying 2.8% of ICI shares. A coordinated media campaign set out to portray ICI as a sclerotic giant, suitable prey for the nimble Hanson. It targeted Henderson specifically. \u201cTo the uninitiated, it seems obvious that the board of ICI should change its chairman,\u201d claimed the Times.</p> <p>The board was initially frozen, but Henderson came out fighting. He split his executive into two, one to fight the potential bid (the \u201cDawn Patrol\u201d), the other to maximise business performance. A two-pronged riposte to Hanson\u2019s propaganda used background briefings to emphasise the changes that seemingly hidebound ICI had been making, while questions were invited about Hanson\u2019s corporate governance and fitness to take over the UK\u2019s largest exporter and research-spender. Politicians were lobbied and the European parliament passed a motion supporting ICI. In a private meeting, even the then recently retired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a> pledged her ICI shares to Henderson. He defied advisers by publicly ruling out disposal of the pharmaceutical business.</p> <p>The battle was won by two events: the revelation, ferreted out by ICI\u2019s forensic examination of his accounts, that Hanson had used company money to buy racehorses, and a powerful performance by the ICI businesses declared that July. But the board was shaken. The famed synergy between its businesses had proved difficult to substantiate. More radical change was needed.</p> <p>Henderson requested a bright banker from Warburg\u2019s to look again at options. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/aug/18/5\" title=\"\">John Mayo</a> hatched the plan to split the company in two \u2013 bioscience including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals under the name of Zeneca, and the rest. Its rationale was that the two strands were diverging; it was difficult for the same management to run both; freed up, they could realign in the coming shake-up of both pharmaceuticals and chemicals.</p> <p>While process teams laboured, Henderson lobbied directors and former chairmen. With few exceptions, they approved. Executive management of the two groups transferred to Hampel and David Barnes, but Henderson remained as chairman of both until 1995.</p> <p>His relations with the City were always double-edged. Early on in his chairmanship, he criticised its influence and was slow to sign up to the mantra of shareholder value. In retirement he remained critical of its high salaries. In the 1980s he had also turned important, if belated, attention to ICI\u2019s patchy environmental performance and appointed a director responsible. The company was one of the first to issue an annual environmental report. Increasingly he was seen as an elder statesman and was never short of job offers.</p> <p>Outside ICI, his directorships included Dalgety, RTZ and Schlumberger. From 1983, Henderson was an advocate of change on the stuffy and oversized Barclays board, where he was told his plainspeaking did not accord with the board\u2019s oblique way of doing business. He became chairman of the Rank Organisation in 1995, but structural difficulties and a poor choice of chief executive meant his tenure was not a success. In 1997, he was called back to sort out problems at Dalgety and secured a break-up of the company, pleasing investors. He headed the Crown Estate Commissioners (1995-2002), and later sat on the Qinetiq board (2003-05). From 1993, as chancellor, he presided over the successful growth of Bath University.</p> <p>He enjoyed time with his family, read widely, played undistinguished golf and swam every morning. In his 70s he cared devotedly for his wife after she suffered an aneurysm, but more recently his health and mental facility had declined.</p> <p>He is survived by Doreen, their two daughters, Nicola and Fiona, and six grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 Denys Hartley Henderson, businessman, born 11 October 1932; died 21 May 2016</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Debenhams has poached an Amazon executive to be its new chief executive, tasked with reviving the high street retailer. Sergio Bucher, who will take up the job in October, has been vice-president of Amazon\u2019s European fashion business since 2013. He previously worked at Puma, where he was general manager of retail and e-commerce worldwide. Before that, Bucher held retail roles at Nike and Spain\u2019s Inditex, the world\u2019s biggest fashion retailer, where he led the launch of its lingerie brand Oysho. Bucher joins with a cash and shares package worth up to \u00a33.84m in the first year and \u00a32.67m in the second year. He was a surprise choice, while Debenhams\u2019 trading director, Suzanne Harlow, missed out on the top job. Sir Ian Cheshire, who became Debenhams\u2019 chairman last month after running B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher for years, said: \u201cSergio\u2019s wealth of e-commerce expertise, international experience and clear leadership qualities stood out. I am confident we have the best possible person to realise the potential of \u2018new Debenhams\u2019 as a leading international multichannel retailer with a bright future.\u201d He added: \u201cHe is a retailer and loves shops and people. It\u2019s a real win for Debenhams.\u201d The group\u2019s current CEO, Michael Sharp, is to step down on 24 June. He announced his decision to leave last autumn after shareholders pushed for a change at the top following a series of poor results and profit warnings. Cheshire said Bucher\u2019s priority would be to \u201cstart with the customer, and we have to agree who our core customer is \u2026 and what does Debenhams do for that customer\u201d. He said the typical Debenhams customer was a 41-year-old woman who is interested in fashion, looking for newness and a broad choice of brands and likes to have a cup of coffee or glass of prosecco when she comes into Debenhams once a week. Cheshire added: \u201cIt\u2019s a much younger customer than the M&amp;S customer, and much more fashion-interested.\u201d His comments came a day after the Marks &amp; Spencer boss, Steve Rowe, vowed to focus on the retailer\u2019s most loyal group of shoppers, dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d \u2013 fiftysomething women who had been neglected as the firm chased younger shoppers. Talking about the challenges faced by high street chains, Cheshire said: \u201cClothing as a share of total consumer expenditure is going down over time.\u201d However, consumers were spending more on health and beauty, he said, with beauty spending going up by 3% or more, as well as food and gifts \u2013 trends that Debenhams wants to tap into. The department store has been courting younger customers by introducing Ed\u2019s Easy Diner, Costa Coffee and Patisserie Valerie into its shops. It has also brought in more brands and cut back on promotions, and wants to introduce more beauty services such as nail bars to offer \u201cexpress treatments\u201d. Retail consultant Richard Hyman said Bucher was an unconventional choice given his background in digital and working with big brands such as Puma and Nike. Hyman wrote on his blog: \u201cBut he will bring a totally different perspective to the business, and one likely to question and challenge everything. This [is] exactly what Debs needs \u2013 reinvention to carve out its own identity and set its own agenda.\u201d He said the clothing side, especially womenswear, was the main challenge, while the beauty division was doing well. Bucher\u2019s remuneration includes a basic salary of \u00a3700,000 and maximum bonuses equivalent to 350% of salary, or \u00a32.45m, in his first year, which drops to 250% of salary in subsequent years. He is entitled to a cash bonus of up to \u00a31.05m this year, which falls to \u00a3700,000 in the coming years. He will also receive a share bonus of \u00a31.4m for 2016, and \u00a31.05m in subsequent years. Bucher is to receive a one-off cash payment of \u00a3445,184 to compensate him for losing bonuses at Amazon. In addition, Debenhams will pay annual pension contributions of \u00a3140,000 and benefits worth \u00a318,375. For the first two years of his employment he will receive a housing allowance of \u00a360,000 after tax and relocation expenses of up to \u00a330,000 after tax. Sharp, the outgoing chief executive, will receive his full pay and benefits, a package worth \u00a3772,999, during his 12-month notice period until next March. Sharp has said the latest results proved Debenhams\u2019 strategy was working. The company beat City estimates with a 5.5% rise in pretax profits to nearly \u00a394m in the six months to the end of February.",

    "webTitle": "Number of UK 'Neets' increases for second consecutive quarter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of young people in Britain not in education, employment or training increased for a second consecutive quarter between January and March, to 865,000. The proportion of so-called Neets among 16- to 24-year-olds edged up 0.1 percentage points \u2013 or 2,000 people \u2013 to 12%, compared with the previous quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. Ian Brinkley, chief economic adviser at the Work Foundation thinktank, said the figures echoed broader trends in the UK economy. \u201cThe modest increase reflects the general slowdown in the labour market, with fewer job opportunities for young people seeking work,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile there are certainly some risks and headwinds lurking in the economic background, this alone is not sufficient to signal a reversal of the improvements that we have seen in the jobs market.\u201d Of the young people in the UK who were Neet between January and March, 44% were classed as unemployed because they were looking for work and available. The remaining 56% were economically inactive \u2013 either not looking for work, not available for work or both. The annual trend was more positive, showing a 69,000 drop in the number of Neets in the first quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier. Britain\u2019s Neet population has been steadily falling after hitting a peak of 1.25 million, or 16.9%, in the third quarter of 2011. However, the number has edged higher in the past two quarters. Unemployment was the driver of the increase in the number of Neets in the first quarter. The number of people in this category rose by 18,000, compared with the previous quarter, to 381,000. The number of economically inactive people within the younger age bracket fell by 15,000 to 485,000. \u201cIf the labour market weakness persists, then we can expect the number of economically inactive Neets to also increase,\u201d said Brinkley. \u201cSome inactive Neets are excluded from the labour market by multiple disadvantages and are likely to suffer long-term damage in terms of their economic and social progress as a result. Any increase in this extremely disadvantaged group would be very worrying, both for the individuals and for society as a whole.\u201d More younger men than younger women were unemployed in the first quarter, while the opposite was true for economic inactivity. Claudia Harris, chief executive of the Careers and Enterprise Company, said the UK needed to establish better links between schools, colleges and the workplace in order to deal with the issue of Neets over the longer term. She said: \u201cResearch by the Education and Employers Taskforce shows young people who have multiple encounters with business while at school are significantly less likely to be Neet, and earn on average 18% more than their peers who don\u2019t. Yet figures from GTI Trendence UK reveal that over a third (36%) of secondary school pupils have never been off-site to visit an employer.\u201d A separate report published by the ONS earlier this month showed Britain\u2019s employment rate hit a record high of 74.2% in March. The ONS said much of the rise in employment could be attributed to rules forcing women to retire later. In recent years, the government has pushed up the retirement age for women from 60, which has meant that thousands of people who would previously have retired are still working. The employment rate for women reached 69.2% in March, the highest since comparable records began in 1971.",

But out there in the high street or in the private world of online shopping, it is spend, spend, spend. That\u2019s the inescapable message from the government\u2019s second stab at estimating the growth rate of the economy in the first three months of 2016. The headline figure \u2013 gross domestic product was up 0.4% on the final three months of 2015 \u2013 was unchanged. But the breakdown was deeply troubling. What it showed was an economy unhealthily reliant on consumer spending. Real household spending was up 0.7% on the quarter and added 0.5 percentage points to the growth rate. In other words, the other components of growth \u2013 investment, trade and government spending \u2013 contributed -0.1 points to growth during the first three months of the year. That\u2019s largely because the goods that consumers buy have to come from somewhere. And, with manufacturing output down in four of the last five quarters, that means they are being imported. Net trade \u2013 the changing relationship between exports and imports \u2013 subtracted 0.4 points from the first quarter growth rate. Perhaps, though, the most worrying piece of new evidence about the state of the economy from the Office for National Statistics was the drop in business investment, which was down both over the quarter and over the year. Britain\u2019s recent economic history shows that growth cannot be long sustained on consumer spending alone, especially when households are running down their savings in order to do it. On the evidence so far, the economy looks likely to become even more unbalanced in the second quarter. Consumers have not been affected by the threat of Britainleaving the EU, while businesses are holding back on investment projects. The latest survey of consumer spending from Gfk highlights the point. Those questioned this month are more optimistic about their own finances and more willing to make a major purchase than they were as year ago. Where the warnings about Brexit do seem to have had an impact is on voter perceptions of the state of the wider economy. These are more negative than they were when the general election was fought in May 2015. Were it not for the referendum, some searching questions would be asked of the government. Whatever happened to growth based on investment and exports? Why is the economy so dependent on the consumer? Where is the promised renaissance of manufacturing? George Osborne promised a march of the makers. What he has delivered is a stampede of the spenders. The chancellor has warned that there will be a recession if Britain votes to leave the EU. As it stands, there is a good chance of a recession even if the UK votes to remain. Given the flurry of doom-laden warnings from the IMF, the OECD, the Treasury and the Bank of England, the Gfk survey suggests consumers are remarkably chipper. A remain vote could well prompt still higher spending. This is a cause for concern. Household debt levels are high and the level of property prices is only sustainable because interest rates are so low. Even a modest increase in the cost of borrowing from the Bank of England would have a significant impact. Moreover, the financial markets are not going to ignore the state of Britain\u2019s current account for ever. The deficit was 7% of GDP in the final three months of 2015, before the latest consumer spending spree. There are some shocking balance of payments figures lurking out there.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has rejected criticisms from the architect of banking reforms that it has watered down its approach to ensuring the UK\u2019s banking system is strong enough to withstand heavy losses. Sir John Vickers \u2013 appointed by the 2010 coalition government to design ways to avoid another taxpayer bailout of the system \u2013 has argued that Threadneedle Street is stepping back from his proposals for how much capital banks should hold. His independent commission on banking (ICB) devised the rules that require banks to erect a ringfence around their high-street operations to protect them from riskier investment banking operations. It also set out how much capital \u2013 shares and other financial instruments \u2013 banks should hold. Vickers has been arguing that the Bank of England has allowed banks to hold less capital than the ICB intended. In February, Vickers said: \u201cThe Bank of England proposal is less strong than what the ICB recommended.\u201d However, the Bank has held firm against his calls and is, with one exception, pressing ahead with its plans as it intended. \u201cHaving carefully considered the comments received during the consultation period, the committee decided to adopt as final a framework that was broadly the same as that on which it had consulted,\u201d the Bank said. It did, however, add a new idea intended to stop a ringfenced bank sapping a non-ringfenced bank of financial strength. The move is likely to have an impact on Royal Bank of Scotland as it has a large retail arm compared with its investment banking operations. This could push up slightly the amount of capital banks need. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) \u2013 set up to look for risks to the financial system \u2013 is requiring that regulators take account of the total amount of capital the overall banks hold, not just the ringfenced operation. After publication of the report, Vickers, warden of All Soul\u2019s College, Oxford, maintained his opposition: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the BoE has stuck to its soft policy on bank capital. Parliament gave the Bank scope to strengthen capital requirements a good deal further but it has fallen short.\u201d The debate is focused on systemic risk buffers \u2013 a cushion of capital that is used at times of stress. \u201cThe systemic risk buffer (SRB) augments the capital buffer of a ringfenced bank or large building society, enabling them to absorb greater losses before breaching their minimum capital requirements,\u201d the Bank said. Vickers has argued that the Bank has set these at a lower level than the ICB intended while the Bank argues that the overall level of capital in the system is much higher than Vickers intended at the time the ICB reported in 2011. The Bank said: \u201cThe overarching purpose of the SRB is to raise the capacity of ringfenced banks and large building societies to withstand stress, thereby increasing their resilience. This aim reflects the additional damage that these firms could cause to the economy in the event that they incur losses that deplete, or come close to depleting, their capital buffers, and in distress these institutions restrict the supply of critical economic functions, such as deposit taking, lending and payment services.\u201d As it published the outcome of a consultation into the SRBs \u2013 to which Vickers was one of five respondents \u2013 the Bank indicated it intended to stick with its view on capital. Vickers said the SRB should be set at 3% for all the ringfenced banks, but the Bank has introduced a graded approach and will only introduce the top level for ringfenced banks bigger than \u00a3755bn. No bank would currently fit into this level. Overall, the Bank has concluded its current regime is correct. \u201cThe FPC\u2019s view at its meeting on 13 May was that no new evidence had been presented since December to affect the committee\u2019s judgment on the overall level of capital,\u201d it said. The views on capital came as the governor of the Bank of England told George Osborne that he is keeping a close watch on the buy-to-let mortgage market and monitoring lenders for any threats to financial stability. In a letter to the chancellor, Mark Carney said he supported the need for the Bank to be given extra powers to clamp down on buy-to-let lenders as had been announced in the budget.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy grew at 0.4% in the first three months of the year, despite a slump in manufacturing and construction output that has dragged down GDP growth over the last year. Tumbling business investment, which recorded its first annual fall in three years, also restricted growth and fuelled concerns that businesses are holding back on plans to expand ahead of the EU referendum. The economy only expanded in the first quarter after increases in business services and government spending, especially on the NHS, and a surge in consumer spending, according to the second estimate of GDP by the Office for National Statistics. The figures, which confirm an earlier estimate that growth slowed down from 0.6% in the last quarter of 2015, will be leapt on by the Treasury as another sign of the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit debate affecting business confidence and investment. Most worryingly, business investment was estimated to have fallen by 0.5% in the first quarter as companies shelved plans to buy new equipment and build new offices and factory space. Household consumption, by contrast, increased by 0.7% on the previous quarter. Most economists blamed uncertainty over the referendum\u2019s outcome, weak overseas growth and financial market volatility for a slowdown that has been accelerating since last summer. Chris Williamson, chief economist of financial data provider Markit, said the UK economy presented a veneer of good health that masked \u201can unbalanced economy and a slowing pace of expansion, with the annual rate of growth slipping to the weakest for almost three years\u201d. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cNot only did GDP growth slow in the first quarter, but it was entirely dependent on the services sector on the output side and heavily reliant on consumer spending on the expenditure side, which will fuel concern over an unbalanced economy.\u201d Williamson said he was concerned that the pace of economic growth this coming year could easily slow further from last year\u2019s 2.2% expansion. He said the chances were growing that the Bank of England would be forced to shelve plans for a first interest rate rise since the financial crisis, leaving base rates at the record low of 0.5% well into 2017.",

      "bodyText": "Eurostar is to reward last-minute holidaymakers for their spontaneity with a new fare aimed at people who don\u2019t mind what time of day they travel. The Snap ticket will allow travellers to get to Paris or Brussels for \u00a325 each way, but time of travel will only be given 48 hours in advance. Passengers have to sign up via Facebook and specify whether they would prefer to travel in the morning or afternoon. The fare must be booked at least seven days before travel and once passengers have paid for their ticket they are locked in, even if they don\u2019t like their allocated departure time. That means anyone who chooses a weekday morning could end up on the first Paris train of the day at 5.40am, while anyone who opts for the afternoon might not reach the City of Lights until 11.32pm. The \u00a325 one-way price, based on a return journey, undercuts Eurostar\u2019s previous lowest fare of \u00a329 one way, and appears designed to increase occupancy of the firm\u2019s new trains. Eurostar\u2019s 10 e320 trains, so called because they can reach 320km/h (200mph), can carry 900 passengers, compared with the 750 in its original fleet. Offering passengers a financial incentive to be more flexible is also intended to help the company spread demand across its Channel tunnel services, helping it fill seats that would otherwise be empty. Eurostar hopes the service will be popular with those who have less rigid schedules, such as students and pensioners. Its commercial director, Nick Mercer, said its research had convinced the company there was a \u201cstrong appetite for spontaneous travel\u201d. Enticing last-minute travellers could also help Eurostar recover from a difficult period in which passenger numbers fell following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. It is also hoping for an increase in cross-Channel traffic from this summer\u2019s Euro 2016 football tournament in France. Eurostar was a joint venture between the French and Belgian railway services and a special-purpose vehicle called London and Continental Railways owned by the UK government until the Treasury took control of the UK\u2019s 40% stake in 2014. The institutional investors Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and Hermes Infrastructure bought the UK\u2019s stake last year in a deal worth \u00a3757m to the exchequer. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 May 2016. Because of an error in a press release from Eurostar, an earlier version said the new Snap fares \u201ccan only be booked in the week before travel\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "It was hardly a headline to set the pulse racing. \u201cAnalysing economic trends according to the situation in the first quarter: authoritative insider talks about the state of China\u2019s economy,\u201d read the front page of the Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece on the morning of Monday 9 May. Yet this headline \u2013 and the accompanying 6,000-word article attacking debt-fuelled growth \u2013 has sparked weeks of speculation over an alleged political feud at the pinnacle of Chinese politics between the president, Xi Jinping, and the prime minister, Li Keqiang, the supposed steward of the Chinese economy. \u201cThe recent People\u2019s Daily interview \u2026 not only exposes a deep rift between [Xi and Li] \u2026 it also shows the power struggle has got so bitter that the president had to resort to the media to push his agenda,\u201d one commentator said in the South China Morning Post. \u201cClear divisions have emerged within the Chinese leadership,\u201d wrote Nikkei\u2019s Harada Issaku, claiming the two camps were \u201clocking horns\u201d over whether to prioritise economic stability or structural reforms. The 9 May article \u2013 penned by an unnamed yet supposedly \u201cauthoritative\u201d scribe \u2013 warned excessive credit growth could plunge China into financial turmoil, even wiping out the savings of the ordinary citizens. As if to hammer that point home, a second, even longer article followed 24 hours later \u2013 this time a speech by Xi Jinping \u2013 in which the president laid out his vision for the Chinese economy and what he called supply-side structural reform. \u201cTaken together, the articles signal that Xi has decided to take the driver\u2019s seat to steer China\u2019s economy at a time when there are intense internal debates among officials over its overall direction,\u201d Wang Xiangwei argued in the South China Morning Post. Like many observers, he described the front page interview as a \u201crepudiation\u201d of Li Keqiang-backed efforts to prop up economic growth by turning on the credit taps. China\u2019s economy stabilised in the first quarter of this year as a record 4.6 trillion yuan (\u00a3477.3bn) of credit was released, leading some to question Beijing\u2019s commitment to structural reforms. China watchers have been left bamboozled at the mystifying way in which top-level policy making debates have played out in the pages of the party newspaper. Some read the articles as a sign relations between Xi and Li are breaking down and predict the latter could be replaced next year by the president\u2019s current anti-corruption tsar Wang Qishan. As evidence they point to the widespread suspicion that the first People\u2019s Daily article was the work of Liu He, a Harvard-educated economist who went to school with Xi during the 1960s and is now one of his closest advisers. Others believe the articles suggest major policy changes are imminent or are designed to remind provincial officials that a massive new stimulus campaign \u2013 similar to that seen during the global financial crisis in 2009 \u2013 is off the menu. \u201cThe very fact that this gets played out in the People\u2019s Daily leaves us all thinking, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u201d said Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism: the fragile financial foundation of China\u2019s extraordinary rise. \u201cYes, it\u2019s indicative of something \u2013 but like so much in China we are not exactly sure what it is indicative of.\u201d Bill Bishop, the publisher of Sinocism, a newsletter about China\u2019s politics and economy, admitted he was also struggling to untangle the \u201ccrazy speculation\u201d. \u201cWe all have to start exercising our atrophied Pekingology muscles to figure out what is really going on.\u201d Bishop said one plausible scenario was that Li would be sidelined from economic affairs at next year\u2019s 19th Communist party congress and replaced by Wang Qishan in a bid to advance painful but necessary economic reforms. \u201cFrom the perspective of reform, Wang has got a great reputation and in many ways would be much more effective within the bureaucracy. Certainly people are afraid of him.\u201d During a tour of China\u2019s northeastern rust belt this week, Xi reaffirmed his commitment to reforms. \u201cIf we hesitate in making decisions and do things halfway, we will lose this rare opportunity,\u201d he said, according to China\u2019s official news agency. Howie said he saw the battles over economic policy less as a boxing match, in which red and blue teams traded punches, and more as a raging forest fire where police officers and fire fighters were tripping over each other as they tried different techniques to extinguish the flames of a rapidly fading economy. \u201cThere is this mismatch of endeavours. They all understand they need to solve the problem. I just don\u2019t think they fully appreciate the coordination that is needed to solve it,\u201d the financial markets expert said. Howie said Li could not have been thrilled about having his policies rubbished so publicly by the president\u2019s team. \u201cClearly\u2026 [Xi] is saying: \u2018What\u2019s gone before isn\u2019t working. We can\u2019t continue to do it.\u2019 This is hardly rousing support for Li Keqiang and what has gone before.\u201d But he rejected the idea that a Tony Blair-Gordon Brown-style feud was playing out between China\u2019s two most powerful men. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is that vitriolic or open or contentious,\u201d he said. Bishop said he also believed there was more consensus over the economy than many outside observers admitted. \u201cThe idea that the leadership doesn\u2019t understand how bad the problems are and that foreign experts have a much better idea of what is going on in the Chinese system I think are hogwash. I think they are very clear how bad it is.\u201d Whatever the truth, the saga has underlined how under Xi, a centralising strongman president dubbed the \u201cChairman of Everything\u201d, China\u2019s already intensely secretive political system has become even more opaque. \u201cThe fact that we are even speculating about this is quite remarkable because frankly nobody has any idea,\u201d said Bishop. \u201cAnd I guarantee you that most people at the top level of Chinese government probably have no idea what is going to happen.\u201d",
