      "bodyText": "Vauxhall workers will hear on Monday that nearly a quarter of jobs at the company\u2019s Ellesmere Port site are being cut as the carmaker adapts to the decline of the traditional family car and rising costs. About 400 of the 1,800 jobs at the site are expected to go by Christmas, largely via voluntary redundancies, as demand for the Astra continues to slip in favour of chunkier and trendier SUVs. Under a proposal filed with the Unite union, the site in Cheshire will move to a single shift next year. The number of cars made there is expected to reduce from up to 150,000 per year to between 70,000 and 90,000. The move comes after the Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn owner PSA Group took over Vauxhall earlier this year and vowed to improve efficiency. PSA said manufacturing costs at Ellesmere Port were significantly higher than those of similar plants in France. The company said it \u201caffirms its commitment\u201d to the plant and developing the Vauxhall brand, which has made cars in the UK since 1903. It insisted the decision was not linked to Brexit, but was a response to challenging European market conditions and a declining passenger car market in which sales of five-door saloons and estate cars such as the Astra are falling. However, PSA made clear that future investments in the plant were on hold until negotiations on the UK\u2019s future with the European Union had become clearer. British carmakers are nervous about the prospect of tariffs or other trade barriers on British cars exported to the EU, which could deal a hammer blow to the sector. The falling value of the pound has already made it more costly to import components, the vast majority of which come from overseas. \u201cThe company has every confidence in the capability and skills of the Ellesmere Port workforce to deliver the necessary improvements in financial performance,\u201d PSA Group said in a statement. \u201cOnce it has enough visibility on the future trading relationship with the EU, and the plant competitiveness has been addressed, the company will be in a position to consider future investments.\u201d Unite said it would not comment until workers had been informed and it had considered the detail of the offer. Ahead of the buyout of Vauxhall\u2019s parent Opel in March, the PSA boss, Carlos Tavares, assured the UK government and Unite that jobs would be protected and production at Ellesmere Port would be guaranteed until at least 2021. He said manufacturing of the Vivaro van in Luton would be guaranteed until 2025. The former Nissan executive also said he was likely to carry out a major restructuring of General Motors\u2019 former European operations which included Vauxhall in the UK and Opel in Germany, similar to the one he oversaw at PSA, which nearly went bankrupt three years ago. GM\u2019s European car-making operation had been loss-making since 1999.",

      "bodyText": "Southern rail has been struck by delays again, but this time it is in adapting to the new pound coin. An unknown number of the operator\u2019s ticket machines will not be ready to accept the new coin on Monday when the old round pound is phased out. About 400m round pounds were thought to remain in circulation over the weekend after 60m were spent in the preceding week. Poundland said it had seen a \u201cnoticeable lift\u201d in the amount shoppers were spending in its stores on Saturday as Britons dug out old coins from the back of the sofa, coat pockets and handbags before the switchover. The retailer is among a handful of major chains which plan to continue to accept the old coins beyond midnight on Sunday, when it will cease to be legal tender. Round pounds might, however, come in handy in paying for train tickets and feeding parking meters and vending machines. Govia Thameslink, which operates the Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink franchise, admitted that an unknown number of its ticket machines would not be ready to accept the new coins. It said 99% of its stations would have at least one machine that took the 12-sided pound but four Southern stations would not have any machines capable of doing so until Friday. Some local authorities are also struggling to switch over their parking meters. Hammersmith and Fulham said all of its \u201ccity centre\u201d meters now accepted the new pound or cashless payment but those in some residential areas would continue to require the old coins while new cashless machines are introduced over the next few weeks. Glasgow and Greenwich, neither of which had fully installed machines capable of using the new pound when it came into circulation in March, both said all their machines had now been adapted. Glasgow residents, however, were complaining about being unable to use new pounds in its machines only last week. A spokesman for Glasgow council said: \u201cConverting or replacing parking meters to accept new coins is a major challenge, particularly when businesses and authorities across the country are working with the same suppliers in a relatively short period of time. \u201cWe initially concentrated on switching meters in our busiest streets and neighbourhoods, and also have in place fully cashless parking payments, so motorists never have to rely on having the right change.\u201d Luke Bosdet, a spokesman for the AA, said that areas where parking machines had not been adapted to the new pound in time should offer free parking. \u201cWhy should drivers have to find old pound coins when it\u2019s the council or their contractor which has failed to do their job properly?\u201d he said. Iceland and Aldi have said they will continue to accept round pounds for another fortnight, and Tesco has said it will do so for a week after Monday\u2019s deadline. Sainsbury\u2019s has said it would not accept the old coins at its tills after Sunday, but that shoppers would be able to donate them to this year\u2019s poppy appeal until 12 November. Contrary to recent reports, both Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s said all their trolleys had been updated in time for Monday\u2019s switchover. Most banks, including RBS, NatWest, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and Nationwide, will also continue to take old pounds as deposits into savings accounts, but they have different policies on how long for and whether they will exchange old coins for new ones. It will also be possible to deposit them into bank accounts via the Post Office. The new 12-sided, bi-metallic \u00a31 coin came into circulation on 28 March as part of efforts to cut back on counterfeits. The old pound, which has been in circulation since 1983, is one of the most counterfeited coins in the world. One in 30 are fake, according to the Royal Mint. The new coin has a number of hi-tech security features, including a panel similar to a hologram that changes when the coin is seen from different angles. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 October 2017. An earlier version said that Sainsbury\u2019s was still accepting the old pound coins at its tills until Monday. This has been corrected because customers could not spend an old pound coin in their stores after Sunday.",

The Liberal Democrat leader said a repeated failure to publish the minutes of board meetings amounted to \u201ca growing lack of transparency\u201d at both state-funded organisations. Network Rail\u2019s board meets eight times a year, but the most recent set of publicly available minutes are from a September 2016 meeting. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Cable wrote to its chief executive, Mark Carne: \u201cNetwork Rail is an organisation of crucial importance to the daily lives of millions of people and is owned by the taxpayer. Britain\u2019s railways are currently under extreme pressure, carrying more passengers than at any time since the 1920s, while Network Rail is being forced to restructure following cost overruns and delays to crucial projects. \u201cI appreciate such transparency results in political, media and public scrutiny that can be difficult for Network Rail. However, it is all for these reasons that it must show its commitment to openness and regularly publish minutes that explain the difficulties you face and the reasons behind executive decisions. Your organisation must not be secretive.\u201d A spokesperson for Network Rail said: \u201cThere has been an unfortunate delay in publishing our past board minutes which has been caused by several factors, both external and internal. For the future we expect more punctual publication.\u201d HS2 Ltd, the publicly funded company building Britain\u2019s new high-speed rail link, states online that the board \u201ctypically meets on a monthly basis\u201d. The latest available minutes are from its April 2017 meeting. \u201cHS2 is one of the most politically controversial infrastructure projects of recent times and must be opened up to public scrutiny,\u201d Cable said in a letter to the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Thurston. \u201cThis is not always comfortable \u2013 and can be problematic given the requirement to protect commercial interests \u2013 but is vital, particularly given construction of the first phase will soon start in earnest.\u201d A spokesperson for HS2 blamed staffing changes for the failure to publish minutes. \u201cWe are committed to being an open and transparent organisation and regularly publish huge amounts of information on how we are developing and delivering Europe\u2019s largest infrastructure project. \u201cIn this instance we have fallen short of this commitment due to staffing changes. We were aware of this issue and were in the process of improving our approach to ensure board minutes are published in a more timely fashion.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A \u00a3600m case is due to begin in the high court this week which is expected to lead to five former directors of Lloyds Banking Group being asked to explain the circumstances that led to the rescue of HBOS during the height of the financial crisis. The bank\u2019s former chair Sir Victor Blank and former chief executive Eric Daniels are among those named in the case brought by Lloyds shareholders who argue they would not have voted through the takeover of HBOS if they had been given the true picture of its financial health. The case names Blank, Daniels, the former finance director Tim Tookey, former head of retail Helen Weir and former head of wholesale banking Truett Tate as defendants, as well as the bank itself. Lloyds, which is also representing its former directors, is contesting the action by around 5,700 private investors and 300 corporate entities. Lloyds announced its takeover of HBOS in September 2008, just days after the collapse of Lehman Brothers had unleashed fear in the financial markets. The prime minister at the time, Gordon Brown, is said to have brokered the deal which required the government to override competition law on public interest grounds to \u201censure the stability of the UK financial system\u201d. The taxpayer took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds during the crisis, but that shareholding has now been sold off. The Lloyds shareholder action group is arguing that information about lifelines provided to HBOS from the Bank of England and Federal Reserve was not disclosed at the time they were asked to vote on the transaction. \u201cIt was a deal so bad that directors should never have recommended it,\u201d said a spokesperson for the action group. \u201cIn putting it to the vote, shareholders didn\u2019t have the right information. If they\u2019d been given the right information they wouldn\u2019t have voted for it on those terms.\u201d A spokesperson for Lloyds said: \u201cThe group\u2019s position remains that we do not believe there to be any merit to these claims and we will robustly contest this legal action\u201d. The case \u2013 which is due to begin on Wednesday \u2013 is also taking place at a time when Daniels, who left Lloyds in 2011, is suing the bank for hundreds of thousands of pounds in disputed bonuses in a separate legal case. He is reported to be taking action to claim performance bonuses that were not paid to him despite hitting targets. Lloyds said: \u201cAs this matter is a live legal issue it would be inappropriate to comment.\u201d Since leaving Lloyds, Daniels has taken roles at the peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle, the Mayfair-based investment bank StormHarbour and the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. Weir is Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s finance director and Tookey is in the same role at Old Mutual Wealth. The lawyers for the Lloyds shareholders are Harcus Sinclair and the funding is provided by Therium Capital Management, a specialist company which backs litigation . The case is starting a fortnight later than expected to allow a new judge, Justice Alastair Norris, to take over from Justice Christopher Nugee, who has a broken leg. All five former directors named as defendants are expected to give evidence over the case which is expected to run into next year. It comes after a settlement in June between shareholders in Royal Bank of Scotland and the Edinburgh-based bank over allegations they were misled about the health of the bank during its \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. Had the RBS case not been settled, it would have forced its former chief executive Fred Goodwin to defend his actions during the 2008 banking crisis in the high court.",

    "webTitle": "World Bank and IMF, put your money where your mouth is on Somalia", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is fair to say that Somalia was not top of the agenda at this year\u2019s annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Finance ministers and central bank governors were too busy chewing the fat over the state of the global economy and the threat posed by cybercrime to pay much attention to a poor country with a population of 14 million people in the Horn of Africa. Or, indeed, pay it any attention at all. Yet the decisions the IMF and World Bank make \u2013 or don\u2019t make \u2013 about Somalia matter. They obviously matter to the 400,000 Somali children with acute malnutrition and 3 million people living in crisis or emergency food security conditions. They also matter in a wider sense, because both institutions are keen to demonstrate that they are now truly progressive and dedicated to the elimination of poverty and tackling inequality. Somalia is a good test of whether the grand plans and the lofty rhetoric actually amount to anything, because this is a country that needs help \u2013 and it needs it now. Here\u2019s the position. Somalia narrowly averted a famine earlier this year thanks to an impressive humanitarian effort. The World Bank was part of the effort, because it managed to persuade its board to provide $50m (\u00a337m) from the crisis response window of the International Development Association (IDA), the part of the bank that provides grants and soft loans to the world\u2019s poorest countries. But the drought and near-famine have left Somalia\u2019s already weak economy in a parlous state. Farmers\u2019 goat herds have been wiped out, hunger is widespread and children are not going to school. The humanitarian effort has created the rudimentary infrastructure for a health system, but this will collapse unless the country is provided with some long-term, reliable funding. The World Bank has pledged to make a priority of helping fragile and conflict states, of which Somalia \u2013 the country where the battle between US forces and local militia spawned the film Black Hawk Down \u2013 is a classic example. When the bank was rattling the tin for a big increase in donor funding for the IDA, one reason it said it needed $75bn to spend over three years was so it could help countries like Somalia. There is, however, a problem. Somalia is not eligible for IDA funds because it owes the bank and the IMF just over $800m \u2013 part of a $5bn debt mountain owed to multilateral and bilateral creditors. These debts were incurred in the 1980s when most of Somalia\u2019s current population \u2013 70% of which is under 30 \u2013 was not even born. Creditors long ago realised they would never get their money back and 90% of the debt has been written off. So the obvious way forward would be for Somalia to get debt relief under the heavily indebted poor country initiative (HIPC) established by the IMF and World Bank in 1996. HIPC was designed to free poor countries from unpayable debts, but there were a few countries in which conflict, civil war or ungovernability meant they never qualified. Somalia was one of them. At an international conference hosted by Theresa May earlier this year, Somalia\u2019s president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, made a point of saying that debt relief and normal relations with the bank and the fund were a priority for his government. The two Washington-based multilateral organisations like Mohamed. They think he is changing Somalia for the better, implementing the right sort of reforms. In its latest health check, the IMF praised the \u201csignificant progress made in rebuilding the economy and restoring key economic and financial institutions in a difficult political and security environment\u201d. Somalia is in the second year of an IMF programme, but as things stand it will have to wait for another two years before it reaches decision point \u2013 the moment under HIPC when its debt arrears will be cleared. The fund wants Somalia to establish a longer track record of reform before it gives the green light to debt relief. This is the safety first approach, the old way of doing things, the path guaranteed not to cause any problems for the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, and the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, with their executive boards. It is also a fundamentally daft approach. By fast-tracking Somalia through the debt relief process, the two institutions would provide the country\u2019s government with extra resources that would help it improve the resilience of the economy and so make it more likely that the reform process will continue. There are officials in Washington, at the World Bank at least, who understand this. Somalia is on the radar of the bank\u2019s chief executive, Kristalina Georgieva, who wants to step up support for fragile states. In Somalia\u2019s case that could be done in one of two ways. The World Bank and the IMF could bring forward Somalia\u2019s decision point and write off its arrears, providing access to multi-year funding under the IDA. Alternatively, the bank could decide that Somalia is moving toward the point at which it will qualify for debt relief and so allocate a pre-arrears clearance grant. Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children, said: \u201cSomalia desperately needs predictable multi-year finance to underpin the investments in health, nutrition, education and livelihoods needed to escape the cycles of drought and hunger that blight so many lives. \u201cIt is frankly indefensible for creditors to obstruct that finance because of arrears on debts created 40 years ago through irresponsible borrowing and reckless lending. Why should Somalia\u2019s children be denied a future because of debts they played no part in creating?\u201d There is a precedent for the World Bank and the IMF getting a move on, because Liberia \u2013 which had arrears as deep as Somalia\u2019s \u2013 was fast-tracked in 2004. That, though, was with the support of the US treasury, which is not minded to be as generous to Somalia. In part, that\u2019s because the US is Somalia\u2019s biggest creditor and has not written off all of the debt. The biggest chunk of it is owed to the Pentagon, which demonstrates what the loans were for in the 1980s. So speeding up help for Somalia will only happen if Kim and Lagarde are prepared to have a fight with the US, something they are reluctant to do at a time when Donald Trump has the world\u2019s multilateral organisations in his sights. They would prefer to avoid a confrontation with the White House. Kim and Lagarde have made a big song and dance about how committed they are to tackling inequality. A test of that commitment is whether they are prepared to defend the weak against the strong. It means showing leadership by standing up for what is right. Talk, by contrast, is cheap. \u2022This article was amended on 17 April 2018 to change the amount owed by Somalia to the World Bank and IMF from \u201cjust over $300m\u201d to \u201cjust over $800m\u201d.",

In its latest health check, the IMF praised the \u201csignificant progress made in rebuilding the economy and restoring key economic and financial institutions in a difficult political and security environment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/globalisation-the-rise-and-fall-of-an-idea-that-swept-the-world\">Globalisation: the rise and fall of an idea that swept the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Somalia is in the second year of an IMF programme, but as things stand it will have to wait for another two years before it reaches decision point \u2013 the moment under HIPC when its debt arrears will be cleared. The fund wants Somalia to establish a longer track record of reform before it gives the green light to debt relief.</p> <p>This is the safety first approach, the old way of doing things, the path guaranteed not to cause any problems for the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, and the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, with their executive boards.</p> <p>It is also a fundamentally daft approach. By fast-tracking Somalia through the debt relief process, the two institutions would provide the country\u2019s government with extra resources that would help it improve the resilience of the economy and so make it more likely that the reform process will continue.</p> <p>There are officials in Washington, at the World Bank at least, who understand this. Somalia is on the radar of the bank\u2019s chief executive, Kristalina Georgieva, who wants to step up support for fragile states.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ec9e057ec8cceafd18d8ba9ac6e6814df479499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec9e057ec8cceafd18d8ba9ac6e6814df479499/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Displaced Somali women fill jerrycans at a water point in Mogadishu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Displaced Somali women fill jerrycans at a water point in Mogadishu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Somalia\u2019s case that could be done in one of two ways. The World Bank and the IMF could bring forward Somalia\u2019s decision point and write off its arrears, providing access to multi-year funding under the IDA. Alternatively, the bank could decide that Somalia is moving toward the point at which it will qualify for debt relief and so allocate a pre-arrears clearance grant.</p> <p>Kevin Watkins, the chief executive of Save the Children, said: \u201cSomalia desperately needs predictable multi-year finance to underpin the investments in health, nutrition, education and livelihoods needed to escape the cycles of drought and hunger that blight so many lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt is frankly indefensible for creditors to obstruct that finance because of arrears on debts created 40 years ago through irresponsible borrowing and reckless lending. Why should Somalia\u2019s children be denied a future because of debts they played no part in creating?\u201d </p> <p>There is a precedent for the World Bank and the IMF getting a move on, because Liberia \u2013 which had arrears as deep as Somalia\u2019s \u2013 was fast-tracked in 2004. That, though, was with the support of the US treasury, which is not minded to be as generous to Somalia. In part, that\u2019s because the US is Somalia\u2019s biggest creditor and has not written off all of the debt. The biggest chunk of it is owed to the Pentagon, which demonstrates what the loans were for in the 1980s.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So speeding up help for Somalia will only happen if Kim and Lagarde are prepared to have a fight with the US, something they are reluctant to do at a time when Donald Trump has the world\u2019s multilateral organisations in his sights. They would prefer to avoid a confrontation with the White House.</p> <p>Kim and Lagarde have made a big song and dance about how committed they are to tackling inequality. A test of that commitment is whether they are prepared to defend the weak against the strong. It means showing leadership by standing up for what is right. Talk, by contrast, is cheap. </p> <p>\u2022This article was amended on 17 April 2018 to change the amount owed by Somalia to the World Bank and IMF from \u201cjust over $300m\u201d to \u201cjust over $800m\u201d.</p>",

But consumers are stretched, banks are tightening lending and Brexit looks perilous for the economy. What does it all mean? Over to you, governor. Former Lloyds bosses in court If it sometimes feels like the financial crisis never really ended, get ready for a court case featuring some familiar characters. A group of Lloyds shareholders are suing the bank and its former management for \u00a3600m in losses they allege were caused by its rescue acquisition of HBOS at the height of the crisis. The case, due to start on Wednesday, is expected to force five ex-directors to give evidence. They include Sir Victor Blank, who was chairman at the time of the deal, and Eric Daniels, his chief executive. The shareholders \u2013 about 5,700 individuals and 300 companies \u2013 argue they would not have approved the takeover if they had known that HBOS was being propped up by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. Lloyds agreed to buy HBOS, the parent of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, in September 2008 in a deal brokered by Gordon Brown, then prime minister as the banking system neared collapse. The government took a 43% stake in the combined bank that has now been sold off. Fred Goodwin, the former Royal Bank of Scotland boss, escaped the witness box in June when RBS settled with shareholders. Blank and Daniels must hope the same happens to them. Energy firms feel the heat Parliament\u2019s select committees have become a valuable source of information about business and the economy. Committees\u2019 powers to punish witnesses who mislead or withhold information aren\u2019t clear, but most cough up what they are asked for. On Tuesday the business, energy and industrial strategy committee will seek answers on high household energy bills. Among the witnesses will be Sarwjit Sambhi, who runs British Gas\u2019s home business, and Dermot Nolan, chief executive of the energy regulator Ofgem. On Thursday the government\u2019s draft bill announced an absolute cap on 12m standard variable tariffs rather than one set at a percentage over the cheapest fixed deal. Some campaigners argued this would push all prices up towards the cap. The legislation is unlikely to take effect until next winter. A record 163,000 customers left the big six providers in September, prompting the industry to claim competition was flourishing. But Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee, warned: \u201cWe want to probe energy companies and the regulator about these proposals and ensure that the reality of a price cap can match the rhetoric by delivering lower bills for consumers and fixing the broken energy market.\u201d",
