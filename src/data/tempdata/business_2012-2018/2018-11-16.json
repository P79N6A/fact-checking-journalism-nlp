The publicly-listed newspaper publisher, which put itself up for sale last month in a last-ditch effort to save the business from going under, has gone into administration admitting that its shares are now worthless. Under the process, the group, which publishes more than 200 regional titles, will move into a newly incorporated company controlled by the bondholders who control its debt. The company was due to pay the bondholders about \u00a3220m in June next year. The company said that it had received offers for parts of its business \u2013 the owner of the Daily Mail had considered a bid for its crown jewel asset, the i \u2013 but \u201cnone of the offers received delivered sufficient value\u201d to save the company. \u201cThere were offers for the whole group, as well as for some individual titles,\u201d said David King, Johnston\u2019s chief executive. \u201cEach approach was examined carefully. Yet none of these offers, or combinations of offers, would have raised enough money to repay the \u00a3220m debt that we are obliged to settle in June 2019, nor did they allow the defined benefit pension scheme to remain attached to the company.\u201d King, who took over as chief executive after the surprise departure of Ashley Highfield after seven years in May, sent an email to the company\u2019s 2,000-plus staff saying their jobs are safe \u2013 for now. \u201cOur operations will continue uninterrupted and so it is important that you turn up for work as normal \u2013 your employment contract will be transferring to the new company and you will continue to be paid as normal,\u201d said King, in an email to staff seen by the Guardian. \u201cThe newspapers and websites will continue to be published as usual. As I have stressed on several occasions, our business is profitable with good margins. Our debt has constrained us.\u201d The bondholders have agreed to inject cash into the business to reduce its debt. King said that any staff who had shares in Johnston Press \u2013 as well as Christen Ager-Hanssen, who owns the Metro newspaper in Sweden and is the largest shareholder with a 25% stake \u2013 have lost their investments and the company will be de-listed from the stock exchange on Monday. \u201cDespite our attempts to engage, none of our shareholders has made any proposal to Johnston Press regarding the restructuring or refinancing of the bonds generally or submitted bids,\u201d said King. The company also said that 250 current and former Johnston Press staff are set to see the value of their pensions fall. Under the terms of the deal to shift the assets to a new company, Johnston Press\u2019s defined benefit schemes will not transfer and will shift to the government\u2019s Pension Protection Fund, resulting in lower payments.",

Johnson has hired John Gibson, who joined the American law firm Cohen &amp; Gresser in September after serving for five years at the fraud investigator. The SFO last month opened a criminal investigation into an individual after Patisserie Valerie revealed potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities. The chain was forced to correct its accounts, leaving it nearly \u00a310m in debt instead of having \u00a328m in the bank, as had been reported previously. The brand\u2019s parent company, Patisserie Holdings, suspended its chief financial officer, Chris Marsh, who was later arrested. The chief executive at the time, Paul May, resigned on Thursday. Johnson, as Patisserie Valerie\u2019s executive chairman, will probably be questioned by fraud investigators. There is no suggestion that Johnson has done anything wrong. The prominent investor, who is known for expanding the Pizza Express restaurant chain, has said he will stay in his role in spite of criticisms from other investors. Johnson holds a 37.1% stake in Patisserie Holdings. Johnson waived his \u00a360,000 salary and pumped \u00a320m in loans into the company as part of a rescue after the accounting errors were discovered. Patisserie Holdings\u2019 shares are currently suspended on London\u2019s junior stock market. Gibson has an intimate knowledge of the SFO\u2019s processes. He was a former case controller at the SFO, where he oversaw prominent inquiries such as the long-running investigation into ENRC, the controversial mining firm. Gibson\u2019s practice now focuses on cross-border corporate investigations and white collar defences, after more than 25 years as a barrister, according to Cohen &amp; Gresser\u2019s website. Patisserie Valerie announced the appointment of Stephen Francis as chief executive on Thursday. The firm hailed Francis as a turnaround specialist who led Tulip, a farmer and pork producer, back to profitability following big losses.

    "webTitle": "Britain's worst landlord to take nine years to pay off string of fines", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The fines cases heard at Highbury Corner magistrates court differ markedly. It may host hearings for north London residents being chased for non-payment of their TV licence fee \u2013 where penalties as low as \u00a355 prompt defendants to plead with magistrates to allow them to pay \u00a32.50 a week. Then there are more valuable outstanding fines claims, such as the case of Katia Goremsandu, a property owner once dubbed the \u201ccountry\u2019s worst landlord\u201d as a result of her multiple convictions for housing offences. In 2016 Goremsandu was found to be \u201cwilfully refusing\u201d to pay tens of thousands of pounds in fines, which had been levied for some of those housing offences, including leaving her tenants without heating or functioning fire alarms. The 68-year-old landlord has a multimillion-pound portfolio of at least 17 properties in London \u2013 including flats in luxury blocks in Westminster and Kensington that are valued at upwards of \u00a3500,000 each. But Goremsandu has been allowed a repayment deal that has almost nine years to run. According to the court she is paying off \u00a3100,000 of outstanding penalties at the rate of \u00a31,000 a month. Meanwhile, she has retained ownership of her entire property portfolio, according to documents filed with the Land Registry. Haringey council estimated in 2014 that Goremsandu\u2019s rental income was around \u00a3188,000 a year, including housing benefit payments. The landlord claimed in court papers last year that her annual rental income was \u00a3109,200. The landlord\u2019s repayment scheme has been agreed by the courts, despite earlier plans to compel her to sell her property to pay her fines. The forced sale proposal is contained within court filings made by Westminster and Haringey councils, as part of the London boroughs\u2019 successful joint application for a criminal behaviour order against the landlord last year, which prevents the landlord from managing property for 10 years. Goremsandu can, however, continue to rent out her properties through an agent. The repayment deal has only just come to light, as Westminster council spent months refusing to release its documents, only for the Guardian to win a court ruling in early November forcing the local authority\u2019s papers to be disclosed. The court papers also state that Goremsandu has \u201cat least 60 convictions\u201d for housing offences \u2013 far more than previously thought and dwarfing the seven convictions that led to her topping a list of landlords convicted for housing offences in 2014, a year in which she was convicted of 25 offences in Haringey alone. Joe Beswick, head of housing at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cUntil we introduce real protections for tenants, and proper means of enforcement, landlords like Goremsandu will continue to operate like this. \u201cThe fact that Goremsandu is able to continue earning huge sums annually despite gross malpractice is a clear example of the imbalance of power in our housing system. Landlords are reaping enormous financial rewards, benefiting from limited regulation and toothless enforcement, while tenants can be evicted without fault with just two months\u2019 notice.\u201d The papers also said that in 2016, when the balance of Goremsandu\u2019s fines stood at \u00a371,000, she was found to have \u201cwilfully refused to pay after she refused to voluntarily sell her properties to make payment\u201d, with the case adjourned to \u201callow time for the court collection agency to apply for and obtain an order for sale of [Goremsandu\u2019s] properties\u201d. A clerk at HM Courts &amp; Tribunal Service told the Guardian this week that Goremsandu is now making payments of \u00a31,000 a month, and has paid off \u00a340,345.50 of fines totalling \u00a3143,709.12. When contacted by the Guardian for comment, Goremsandu said: \u201cOh, go away please. Get lost.\u201d She claimed to the court that her properties had been damaged by her tenants and that she was a victim. A Westminster council spokesman said: \u201cThe case [against Goremsandu] was a result of a partnership with Haringey council to combat some of the worst abuses in the private rented sector. The resulting criminal behaviour order prohibited Katia Goremsandu from managing any property in either borough for a decade, which was a landmark result.\u201d He said the council had \u201cinitially checked\u201d Goremsandu properties the local authority had used to house homeless families and that the council had spent months fighting the release of its court files to protect the anonymity of witnesses. Most of the witnesses had been identified in open court. Haringey council and the London Collection and Compliance Centre, a division of HM Courts and Tribunals Service, did not comment.",

In a show of support for May, the CBI said the agreement reached between London and Brussels represented hard-won progress and that going backwards would damage Britain\u2019s prosperity. The intervention came as the decision by the environment secretary, Michael Gove to remain in the cabinet helped steady the pound in the currency markets and leave the FTSE 100 virtually unchanged. Even so, leading manufacturers \u2013 including Rolls-Royce and Airbus \u2013 made it clear they were stepping up their contingency plans in case the the UK left the EU without a deal next spring. May is hoping that backing from business will persuade her MPs to support her plan despite misgivings they might have about concessions made to the EU. In a statement, the CBI said its senior policy-making committee \u2013 which canvasses the views of 900 business leaders across Britain \u2013 had been unanimous in supporting the withdrawal agreement. \u201cWe are united in the view that the government\u2019s proposed deal represents hard-won progress. It requires all sides \u2013 including business \u2013 to compromise, but compromising is essential to avoid a damaging no-deal and move on to the future. For the sake of the prosperity of our country, we must not go backwards.\u201d The statement said the agreement had two economic benefits: avoiding a cliff-edge exit and paving the way for a long-term trade deal. \u201cNo deal is not an acceptable option. Firms are clear that no deal would badly damage our economy by disrupting supply chains, causing shortages and preventing vital services reaching people,\u201d the CBI said. The FTSE 100 closed 24 points lower at 7,014 but Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown, said the stock market was divided into \u201cBrexit beauties\u201d and \u201cBrexit beasts\u201d. \u201cThe beauties are stocks with lots of international revenue streams, like Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever and Diageo. The share prices of these companies tend to do well when Brexit looks like it may unravel in a disorderly fashion, because a falling pound boosts the value of the profits they make in dollars, euros, yen and yuan,\u201d Khalaf said. \u201cThe beasts, on the other hand, tend to see their shares sell off when the market thinks Brexit is heading down a dark alley. These are companies which are heavily plugged into the domestic UK economy, like the banks, Lloyds and RBS, the housebuilders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey, and the retailers M&amp;S and Next.\u201d Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said May\u2019s plan would involve the \u201csoftest of Brexits\u201d \u2013 an outcome that would be welcomed by member firms. He added, however, that the deal had no chance of succeeding. \u201cThat all falls down because it\u2019s got absolutely no chance whatsoever of happening\u201d, Wright told the Grocer magazine. \u201cI can\u2019t see the government surviving until next week as things stand, far less being able to see this through.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thursday was always going to be a hard act to follow after the dramatic events which sent the pound tumbling against the euro and the dollar and triggered a major sell-off of UK-focused shares. Sterling has not fully recovered its losses, but it has had a much better day, particularly against the dollar. The pound is currently trading up 0.7% against the dollar at $1.2860, and is roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1274. Having escaped the Thursday sell-off, the FTSE 100 is down 0.6% at 6,996.94, in line with all major European indices. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 is off 0.5% at 18,573.94. Investors are bracing themselves for the twists and turns to come, as Theresa May fights to keep her Brexit plan on the table amid mounting opposition from MPs in her own party. On that note, we\u2019ll close up. Thank you for reading the blog and for all the comments, do join us again on Monday. US markets have opened lower: Dow Jones: -0.4% at 25,196 S&amp;P 500: -0.5% at 2,717.65 Nasdaq: -1% at 7,188.42 Tech stocks are under pressure - hitting the Nasdaq in particular - after disappointing earnings from chip maker Nvidia. Data just out shows US industrial production grew by just 0.1% in October, following a 0.2% increase in September. Manufacturing output was slightly stronger, up 0.3% over the month, in line with September\u2019s growth according to the Federal Reserve. Manufacturing increased despite a 2.8% fall in car production. US futures are down, as traders digest a combination of weaker corporate earnings and trade tensions. The pound has recovered further ground against both the euro and dollar: +0.4% at \u20ac1.1320 +0.5% at $1.2843 Equity traders are feeling less chirpy, with all major European markets down this afternoon: FTSE 100: -0.7% at 6,987.15 Ireland\u2019s ISEQ: -0.4% at 5,934.01 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.3% at 11,316.97 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 5,010.33 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.4% at 18,826.70 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 9,044.50 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 357.59 Away from Brexit, the other B-word is almost upon us... Black Friday. The annual bargain shopping event is an import from America which traditionally falls on the day after Thanksgiving, meaning Black Friday falls on 23 November this year. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Amazon and a host of other retailers to fire the starting gun a week early. The online retailing giant, and chains including Argos and Currys PC World have lined up discounts on tens of thousands of products \u2013 from large-screen 4K HD TVs, wireless speakers, headphones to laptops - in a bid to entice shoppers from today. According to the consultancy GlobalData, UK consumers are expected to spend \u00a310.4bn during the Black Friday sales, which is 3.1% more than in 2017. The chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in 2019 have dropped according to traders. Money markets are now pricing in an 86% chance of a rate hike next year, down from 90% on Thursday. Before Thursday - and the wave of ministerial resignations over Theresa May\u2019s draft Brexit agreement - a rate rise before 2020 was fully priced in. Here are the biggest FTSE fallers this morning as it currently stands: The FTSE 100\u2019s earlier gains have evaporated as investors remain cautious against a backdrop of heightened political and Brexit uncertainty. Britain\u2019s leading index is down 7 points or 0.1% at 7,031.35, underperforming its European peers and with RBS and the house builders among the biggest losers for a second day. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 is just about hanging on, up 12 points or 0.1% at 18,674.57. David Madden analyst at CMC Markets, gives his take on how the markets are playing out: Stocks in Europe have bounced back today, but some of the major indices have given up some of the early gains. Theresa May had a disastrous day yesterday, and investors are still on edge over the political situation in the UK. Politics is also in focus in Italy as Rome and Brussels are still locked in a stand-off over the budget. For the time being, Brexit will grab more attention in the media, but the Italian problem could spark another round of the eurozone debt crisis. Sterling has received a boost from reports that Michael Gove will not be resigning as environment secretary, despite turning down the job of Brexit secretary. The pound is up 0.3% against both the euro and the dollar, at \u20ac1.1306 and $1.2807 respectively. In less encouraging news for Prime Minister Theresa May, bookmaker William Hill has stopped taking bets on the year that she will leave office... Annual inflation in the eurozone picked up to 2.2% in October, from 2.1% in September according to the statistics office Eurostat. It was no surprise, unchanged from the \u201cflash\u201d estimate published by Eurostat at the end of October. Energy prices, services, and food, alcohol and tobacco prices all contributed to the slightly higher inflation rate. Here is how inflation rates compared last month across the EU: Carsten Brzeski, chief economist of ING in Germany, says that Draghi opened the door for a longer period of low interest rates. When ECB President Maro Draghi gives a speech four weeks ahead of a crucial policy meeting, it is always worthwhile listening closely. It is too early to read any real changes in the ECB\u2019s anticipated path for monetary policy beyond the end of the net-QE purchases. However, Draghi at least just sent a clear signal of the ECB\u2019s willingness to err on the side of caution when it comes to the first rate hike. The risk that Draghi could go down in European history books as the first ECB president who never hikes rate is increasing. Draghi also took a very thinly veiled pop at Italy, which is pressing ahead with plans to increase spending despite its huge debt pile and major opposition from the EU. To protect their households and firms from rising interest rates, high-debt countries should not increase their debt even further and all countries should respect the rules of the Union. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has delivered the keynote speech at the European Banking Congress in Frankfurt. Striking a fairly cautious note, Draghi said that while a number of one-off factors had weighed on eurozone growth during the year - such as disruption to car production caused by new emissions tests - there were longer term factors to consider. He cited a slowdown in trade as a risk: Insofar as world trade stabilises at a lower level, its drag on growth could also be temporary. But there are two conditions that could make it longer-lasting. The first is if trade uncertainty rises and dampens euro area export performance, in particular owing to protectionism. The second condition is if uncertainty about external demand spills over into domestic demand through confidence and investment channels. While reiterating the ECB\u2019s intention to stop bond purchases by the end of the year, he also appeared to soften the Bank\u2019s message about the pace of tightening, saying there was so far little pass-through from higher wages to inflation. That is likely to push back intentions for the timing of the first rate hike. Draghi said: The nature of this forward guidance is contingent on economic developments and therefore acts as an automatic stabiliser. If financial or liquidity conditions should tighten unduly or if the inflation outlook should deteriorate, our reaction function is well defined. This should, in turn, be reflected in an adjustment in the expected path of future interest rates. Read the full speech here. Gains in both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 have narrowed on reports that it is looking likely Theresa May will face a confidence vote (triggered if Conservative MPs submit 48 letters to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee). The FTSE 100 is up 17 points or 0.3% at 7,055.26, while the FTSE 250 is up 0.2% at 18,694.71. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, says the pound is mirroring Theresa May in \u201ca display of (potentially brief) Brexit resilience.\u201d He explains: The pound is a bit like Theresa May at the moment. Seriously bruised by the fallout of the Brexit draft deal, shaken by a series of high profile resignations, but, for the time being (and however misguidedly), emboldened by a sense of resilience. All this is to say that sterling avoided another round of losses as Friday got underway. Of course, it is still very early in the day, with some key figures yet to fully reveal their allegiances. Most pressing, perhaps, is Michael Gove, the man who has reportedly rejected an offer to take over as Brexit Secretary because he would not be able to renegotiate the divorce deal. This leaves the prominent Leaver in a sticky situation, with rumours circulating that he may already have one foot out of the door, despite having provided support for May during Wednesday\u2019s marathon Cabinet sesh. The FTSE 250 is also up this morning, climbing 0.8% to 18,810 after Theresa May vowed to fight on with her Brexit plan, despite major opposition from within her own party. It doesn\u2019t reverse all of Thursday\u2019s losses, but the firms listed in the UK-focused index will be relieved nonetheless. Trading is underway across Europe and the FTSE 100 is up 50 points, or 0.7% in early trading. The index of the biggest UK-listed companies was spared the major sell-off on Thursday, largely because so many of the top 100 firms have a large proportion of earnings abroad. The UK focused firms were hit hard however, wiping billions off the market value of house builders and banks. Here\u2019s how it looks across Europe at the moment: FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,086.59 Ireland\u2019s ISEQ: +1.3% at 6,036.19 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 11,435.61 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 5,069.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 18,993.71 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 9,111.40 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 360.63 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has steadied this morning after a shocker of a day on Thursday which saw the currency plunge 1.9% against both the euro and the dollar, to lows of \u20ac1.1247 and $1.2722 respectively. Traders sold off sterling at a rapid rate as they digested the resignation of cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey, countless rumours of further potential resignations and, the prospect of a vote of no-confidence in the Prime Minister. Equity markets across Europe also fell sharply, with Irish stocks under particular pressure. UK-focused firms in the FTSE 100 suffered heavy losses - although the index itself closed up 4 points - and the domestic-focused FTSE 250 fell 1.3%. As Friday gets underway, politicians, investors and commentators are braced for another dramatic day - which may or may not materialise. As things stand the pound is steady, up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2795 and roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1280. Things looked similarly calm at this point yesterday...

      "bodyText": "A London-listed firm offering investors the chance to cash in on the royalties from songs by famous artists has struck a multimillion pound deal for a catalogue including the Justin Bieber remix of global hit Despacito. Hipgnosis Song Fund, founded by the Merck Mercuriadis, the former manager of mega acts including Sir Elton John, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Iron Maiden and Beyonc\u00e9, made its debut on the London stock exchange in July. The company, which aims to build a valuable portfolio of rights to songs that will generate good long-term returns for investors, has raised \u00a3200m to spend on catalogues. Hipgnosis has bought the song catalogue of the songwriter and producer Jason Boyd, better known by his professional name Poo Bear. He is one of Bieber\u2019s closest collaborators. The catalogue includes the English language version of Despacito featuring Bieber, sung by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Boyd has co-writer rights to nine of the 13 songs on Bieber\u2019s hit album Purpose, which has sold 14m copies worldwide, including What Do You Mean? and Where Are You Now? He has also had top-10 hits with artists including Usher, David Guetta, Chris Brown and Jennifer Lopez. \u201cIt\u2019s fortuitous to be able to acquire a song catalogue of this importance so early in its life,\u201d Mercuriadis said. \u201cIn a streaming world that is growing every day his songs are at the forefront. Despacito on its own was No 1 in more than 50 countries and is one of those truly rare songs that has united the globe.\u201d In the 1990s, punters were given the chance to invest in David Bowie\u2019s success by purchasing Bowie Bonds. These were 10-year premium bonds secured against Bowie\u2019s future royalty earnings from songs released prior to 1993, with an attractive interest rate of 7.9%. Prudential Insurance bought the whole issue for $55m. Bowie was followed by artists including Iron Maiden and James Brown. However, as music fans drifted away from record stores in the early 2000s, owners of Bowie Bonds saw their investment tank. \u201cSongwriters\u2019 rights have tended to hold their value over the past few decades while artists have suffered from issues including the decline of the CD,\u201d said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at MIDiA Research. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively safe place to put your money. The average investor can get a share of their favourite songs or band but they need to be careful. These sorts of rights are the most complex and difficult part of the music industry to understand, and a writer may only have a fraction of a fraction of the rights to a song they were involved with. There can be lots of others in the chain rinsing the royalty pie before it gets to you.\u201d Hipgnosis has already splashed out on a music catalogue from the writer of hits including Rihanna\u2019s Umbrella and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Single Ladies. The firm has an advisory board including Nile Rodgers, who has worked on albums such as David Bowie\u2019s Let\u2019s Dance and Madonna\u2019s Like a Virgin, and has appeared in this year\u2019s X Factor, helping and standing in for judge Robbie Williams.",

    "webTitle": "Former Co-op executive wins her equal pay and unfair dismissal claims", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A former executive at the Co-operative Group has won her equal pay and unfair dismissal claims against the company. Sam Walker, a company director in charge of HR, argued that she was dismissed after raising issues about her own pay and warning leading figures in the company that it could be paying men and women at a different rate for the same roles. The tribunal did not agree with Walker\u2019s claim that her sacking was a result of discrimination, but ruled that the Co-op \u201cdirectly discriminated against the claimant on the ground of sex\u201d, after deeming her work only \u201cpartially achieved\u201d when she had not been given an adequate year-end appraisal. The tribunal heard she was paid less than other board members in 2014 and told this was because she was newly promoted, but an independent assessment of executive roles by the Hay Group in January 2015 rated her role at least as high or higher than other male executives. The Co-operative Group will now face a legal bill, after an employment tribunal found in Walker\u2019s favour. The former executive said it was time for the company to carry out an extensive pay audit to ensure no other female employees were being discriminated against. She had asked for a pay audit on a number of previous occasions but the company had refused, she said. \u201cThe Co-op have been found wanting, and I want to see the organisation change as a result,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cGoing through this process has also revealed to me that the law is fundamentally flawed and must change. But more fundamentally, we need societal change: people shouldn\u2019t want to work for companies who treat their employees differently and are breaking the law. \u201cThis is a major victory for women, but my case proves that pay discrimination can happen to anyone.\u201d Walker said she first raised questions about equal pay in 2015 after comparing her salary to other male executives who sat alongside her on the board. The tribunal heard that senior executives had also questioned Walker\u2019s performance over the progress of a huge IT project called 1HR, but she argued she had brought in the \u201cright people\u201d to improve performance. Walker told the tribunal that the company went through a regrading exercise of all staff, and she told Richard Pennycook, then the chief executive, in 2016 that it was \u201cnot looking good\u201d from an equal pay perspective. \u201cI told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem, which not only exposed the business to legal claims but was inconsistent with the Co-op\u2019s declared values,\u201d she said. A spokesman for the Co-op said the tribunal had dismissed most of Walker\u2019s claims and held that her dismissal was not discriminatory. \u201cWhilst the tribunal upheld the unfair dismissal claim on procedural grounds, we are pleased it found the Co-op had substantial reasons for justifying the termination of Ms Walker\u2019s employment.\u201d The tribunal accepted that Walker was sacked as part of a proposed restructuring, but Walker said this never took place. The company said it was considering whether to appeal against the equal pay claim. \u201cWe maintain we did not pay Ms Walker unfairly and continue to believe we acted in the best interests of our Co-op and its members,\u201d said the spokesman. Walker said that she had used her savings and remortgaged her house to fund her three-year legal battle, which she described as \u201ca living hell\u201d. \u201cEverything about the system stops people claiming and protects companies and going through this is financially unrealistic for most people,\u201d she said. Walker was supported by the Fawcett Society and the former BBC correspondent Carrie Gracie, who won her equal pay battle with the corporation and donated her pay settlement to the Equal Pay Advice Service to support other women looking to make claims. \u201cI take my hat off to Sam Walker for having the courage to take on the Co-op, another supposedly values-led organisation, but it has been a savage ordeal that no woman should have to go through in 2018,\u201d said Gracie. \u201cMost of us live in a culture of pay secrecy, and there will be many more victims who have no idea they are being discriminated against. \u201cI hope this sends a message to employers to do right by the women in their organisation and if problems do occur to put their hands up and apologise rather than fighting them until the last breath.\u201d Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the high-profile case had played an important role in raising awareness about equal pay. \u201cThis case is hugely significant because it shows what is possible when women get the chance to challenge pay discrimination,\u201d she said. \u201cVery few women do; most are completely shut out. Pay discrimination can happen anywhere and that\u2019s why we have to support women on low incomes particularly.\u201d Walker said she was now determined to help other women with equal pay disputes, and she will speak alongside Gracie at the Fawcett Society\u2019s Know Our Worth conference on Saturday. \u201cAnyone thinking about doing it, I will help them prepare before they even make their claim,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a massive and growing network of strong women who are demanding change \u2013 if you think you have a case, come on, bring it on.\u201d",

The tribunal heard that senior executives had also questioned Walker\u2019s performance over the progress of a huge IT project called 1HR, but she argued she had brought in the \u201cright people\u201d to improve performance.</p> <p>Walker told the tribunal that the company went through a regrading exercise of all staff, and she told Richard Pennycook, then the chief executive, in 2016 that it was \u201cnot looking good\u201d from an equal pay perspective. \u201cI told him that I thought the Co-op had an equal pay problem, which not only exposed the business to legal claims but was inconsistent with the Co-op\u2019s declared values,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Co-op said the tribunal had dismissed most of Walker\u2019s claims and held that her dismissal was not discriminatory.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst the tribunal upheld the unfair dismissal claim on procedural grounds, we are pleased it found the Co-op had substantial reasons for justifying the termination of Ms Walker\u2019s employment.\u201d</p> <p>The tribunal accepted that Walker was sacked as part of a proposed restructuring, but Walker said this never took place.</p> <p>The company said it was considering whether to appeal against the equal pay claim. \u201cWe maintain we did not pay Ms Walker unfairly and continue to believe we acted in the best interests of our Co-op and its members,\u201d said the spokesman.</p> <p>Walker said that she had used her savings and remortgaged her house to fund her three-year legal battle, which she described as \u201ca living hell\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEverything about the system stops people claiming and protects companies and going through this is financially unrealistic for most people,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Walker was supported by the Fawcett Society and the former BBC correspondent Carrie Gracie, who won her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/29/bbc-reach-equal-pay-deal-with-former-china-editor-carrie-gracie\">equal pay battle </a>with the corporation and donated her pay settlement to the <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/equal-pay-advice-service\">Equal Pay Advice Service</a> to support other women looking to make claims.</p> <p>\u201cI take my hat off to Sam Walker for having the courage to take on the Co-op, another supposedly values-led organisation, but it has been a savage ordeal that no woman should have to go through in 2018,\u201d said Gracie. \u201cMost of us live in a culture of pay secrecy, and there will be many more victims who have no idea they are being discriminated against.</p> <p>\u201cI hope this sends a message to employers to do right by the women in their organisation and if problems do occur to put their hands up and apologise rather than fighting them until the last breath.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-smethers\">Sam Smethers</a>, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the high-profile case had played an important role in raising awareness about equal pay. \u201cThis case is hugely significant because it shows what is possible when women get the chance to challenge pay discrimination,\u201d she said. \u201cVery few women do; most are completely shut out. Pay discrimination can happen anywhere and that\u2019s why we have to support women on low incomes particularly.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said she was now determined to help other women with equal pay disputes, and she will speak alongside Gracie at the Fawcett Society\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/Event/know-our-worth-conference-2018\">Know Our Worth conference</a> on Saturday. \u201cAnyone thinking about doing it, I will help them prepare before they even make their claim,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a massive and growing network of strong women who are demanding change \u2013 if you think you have a case, come on, bring it on.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Riders for the collapsed food delivery company Foodora have asked the federal government to sue the firm\u2019s German parent after the administrators conceded the dispatchers were \u201cmore likely than not\u201d employees. On Friday, the Fair Work Commission also ruled a Foodora rider was an employee not a contractor, upholding a case of unfair dismissal and ruling the company should pay the worker $15,000 in compensation. The decision could have flow-on effects for other gig economy companies such as Uber, Uber Eats and Deliveroo. Other riders \u2013 many of whom sustained injuries on the job \u2013 are pursuing the German company Delivery Hero for $8.5m in unpaid wages and workers\u2019 compensation, and want the government to help. Foodora closed its operations in Australia in August and last week the administrators of the company admitted they probably owed the workers $5m because they had been incorrectly classed as independent contractors. The Transport Workers Union\u2019s Tony Sheldon said the administrators\u2019 admission was a \u201cbreakthrough decision\u201d that would have an impact across the world. \u201cThree out of four riders know of a rider that have been injured seriously, riding for companies like Foodora,\u201d he said. \u201cYet these companies continue to deny responsibility.\u201d Eyder, a former Foodora rider who declined to give his surname, said he had been refused compensation when he injured his shoulder on the job. \u201cWhen I had the accident on my motorbike, the first call from Foodora, they told me \u2018You are not an employee, you are a contractor\u2019. I couldn\u2019t work for three months, and when I came back to Foodora I lost all my performance [history]\u201d. Foodora requires riders to work consistently to rise up their priority list and Zede said he was dropped to the lowest grade. \u201cWhen I went to the office, they said they didn\u2019t care,\u201d he said. Under Australian labour law, independent contractors are not entitled to award wages, leave and other entitlements such as workers\u2019 compensation, which are available only to employees. Companies such as Foodora, Uber and Deliveroo class their workers as contractors, but riders, unions and the Fair Work Ombudsman have long argued that gig economy workers are employees \u2013 because of the long hours they put in and the high level of control the companies exert. Last week, the administrators of Foodora agreed, and on Friday, the Fair Work Commission ruled this was the case for one rider, Josh Klooger. Commissioner Ian Cambridge said the control Foodora exerted over Klooger\u2019s shifts and uniform made the relationship that of \u201cemployee and employer\u201d, and upheld Klooger\u2019s complaint of unfair dismissal. \u201cThe shifts\u2019 start and finish times and the particular geographical locations were fixed by Foodora \u2026 This process is similar to a variety of electronic and web-based systems that are frequently used to advise, in particular, casual employees of available shifts.\u201d The company\u2019s uniforms and branded carry bags meant \u201cFoodora presented [Klooger] to the world at large as an emanation of its business\u201d. \u201cThe correct characterisation of the relationship,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that of employee and employer\u201d. The commission ordered Foodora to pay Klooger $15,000 in compensation. Last week, Foodora\u2019s administrators estimated that, if paid the lowest casual rate, the riders would be entitled to $28m in wages, but were paid only $23m. However, the company also had other debts, and could not pay them all, the administrators said. It owed $2.1m in unpaid tax to the Australian Taxation Office, as well as $550,000 to Revenue NSW and an estimated $400,000 to Victoria and Queensland revenue. The administrators offered a $3m payout, towards all creditors \u2013 including the workers \u2013 to partially cover some of the debts. The creditors met on Friday and voted to approve the offer. Sheldon said the TWU wanted the federal government to pursue Delivery Hero for the full amount \u2013 estimated at $8.5m for wages and compensation for injury. \u201cWe expect the receivers to encourage national authorities to go and lay criminal charges against the German parent company,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a responsibility of companies to pay up, not just run out of the country when you act in such an indignified way by carrying out wage theft against these workers.\u201d The president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Michele O\u2019Neil, echoed the call, but said she was not confident the government would listen. \u201cWe see this government time and time again take the side of big business. But we won\u2019t stop making sure we call for them to do it, and campaign for them to do it\u201d. Sheldon said the riders voted for the $3m payout at Friday\u2019s meeting \u2013 \u201cthey have no choice. They have been stolen from and can\u2019t wait three years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading consumer group has called on banks to justify nearly 13,000 bank branch closures that have left millions of people struggling to access vital financial services across the UK. Figures compiled by the consumer charity Which? show that the UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years, from 20,583 in 1988 to 7,586 today. The loss of those sites has left 19% of the population more than nearly two miles away from their nearest branch, while 8% now have to travel more than three miles, with Scottish communities hardest hit by closures. Thinly-populated areas of Scotland account for 70 of the communities farthest from a branch, though Which? said the south-west and east of England had been \u201cdisproportionately affected\u201d given the size of regional populations. Among the towns and villages now lacking a single bank branch are Lymm in Cheshire, Sturminster Newton in Dorset, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Broseley in Shropshire. Ceri Stanaway, money editor for Which?, said: \u201cThe true scale of bank branch closures in recent decades is staggering and has left millions of people struggling to access the vital financial services and cash that they need. \u201cFor many there is simply no substitute for a dedicated branch and the wide range of services it offers, and many customers now face having to travel long distances if they are to avoid financial exclusion.\u201d Banks including RBS, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds have significantly reduced their bank branch footprint in recent years in an effort to cut costs amid a digital banking push. Those lenders have turned to the Post Office to offset closures, with postmasters across 11,547 sites offering basic transaction services in their stead. But Which? said customers are hesitant to use the Post Office\u2019s banking services, citing long queues, a lack of privacy to deal with financial affairs and concerns about a lack of financial expertise. Its survey showed that 60% preferred to deal directly with their bank. Post Office sites are also restricted in the services they can offer, with customers unable to open or close accounts, transfer money between accounts, request a debit card replacement or make a complaint about their bank. Stanaway said: \u201cWe want to see banks properly justifying the reasons for closure and taking into account their customers\u2019 needs before shutting their doors \u2013 and their customers out.\u201d The Post Office said in a statement that it took its responsibility \u201cvery seriously\u201d and was \u201cuniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country\u201d. But Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Post Office should be \u201cdoing more, to both improve its small business banking offer and make more firms aware of it\u201d. He added that bank branches were still \u201cvital\u201d to small business owners in areas where internet services were still lagging, or whose customers preferred to pay cash. \u201cBank branch closures damage high street footfall, restrict cashflow in local economies and force business owners to waste time travelling to and from their next nearest branch, which could be miles away. \u201cYes, small business owners need to consider alternative ways to bank, but the sheer pace of branch closures is frightening. Firms need time to adjust.\u201d",

Its survey showed that 60% preferred to deal directly with their bank.</p> <p>Post Office sites are also restricted in the services they can offer, with customers unable to open or close accounts, transfer money between accounts, request a debit card replacement or make a complaint about their bank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3705123590a4da1891becf45c03b24c63e13eae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3705123590a4da1891becf45c03b24c63e13eae/0_135_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A former Lloyds Bank branch in Great Yarmouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK has lost nearly two-thirds of its bank and building society branches over the past 30 years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stanaway said: \u201cWe want to see banks properly justifying the reasons for closure and taking into account their customers\u2019 needs before shutting their doors \u2013 and their customers out.\u201d</p> <p>The Post Office said in a statement that it took its responsibility \u201cvery seriously\u201d and was \u201cuniquely placed to bring vital services to local communities right across the country\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/13/overhaul-of-uk-poor-banking-culture-is-slow-admits-standards-chair\">Overhaul of UK's poor banking culture is slow, admits standards chair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the Post Office should be \u201cdoing more, to both improve its small business banking offer and make more firms aware of it\u201d.</p> <p>He added that bank branches were still \u201cvital\u201d to small business owners in areas where internet services were still lagging, or whose customers preferred to pay cash.</p> <p>\u201cBank branch closures damage high street footfall, restrict cashflow in local economies and force business owners to waste time travelling to and from their next nearest branch, which could be miles away.</p> <p>\u201cYes, small business owners need to consider alternative ways to bank, but the sheer pace of branch closures is frightening.
