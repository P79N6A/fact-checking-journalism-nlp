      "bodyText": "Shares in Deutsche Bank have gyrated wildly before closing sharply higher amid speculation the embattled German lender was on the brink of a deal with the US authorities over a decade-old mis-selling scandal that would be less damaging to its finances. On a day of big swings on the market, shares in Germany\u2019s biggest bank initially slumped as much as 9% on Friday to leave the stock below the key \u20ac10 (\u00a38.65) level. But by the end of day on the Frankfurt exchange, they were 6% higher at \u20ac11.57. They have lost 50% of their value this year. The rally continued on Wall Street after Europe closed with the bank\u2019s US-listed shares rising 14%. The stock was buoyed by an attempt by chief executive John Cryan to calm nerves with a memo sent to the bank\u2019s 100,000 staff and hopes of a deal with the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of mortgage bonds between 2005 and 2007. An Agence France-Presse report suggested the bank might be doing a deal with the DoJ to pay just over a third of the $14bn (\u00a310.8bn) penalty that was originally suggested by the DoJ. Cryan said there were \u201cforces in the market\u201d trying to destabilise the bank after its shares plunged to 30-year lows amid fears it would not be able to afford to pay $14bn. The AFP report said that Cryan was on the brink of agreeing a penalty of $5.4bn with the DoJ. Cryan \u2013 a Briton who has been at the helm of Deutsche for 15 months \u2013 fired off his memo to staff after a Bloomberg report rattled nerves by revealing 10 hedge funds had taken some business away from the bank. \u201cOur bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price. It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business. Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust,\u201d said Cryan. \u201cThe rumors that are out there that Deutsche Bank is going to get a better deal ... I think is adding some positive effect into the market,\u201d said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner for Meridian Equity Partners in New York. \u201cI think people were fearful and concerned about what the outcome of this is going to be.\u201d Deutsche\u2019s plight has prompted fears that global markets are facing turmoil of the kind triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers eight years ago this month. While Lehman\u2019s boss also blamed speculators, Cryan argued Deutsche was strong while policymakers also insisted any comparison is unfair. Deutsche\u2019s gyrations initially prompted a knock-on effect in the UK, with shares in Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 both of which face a similar investigation by the DoJ \u2013 falling sharply before regaining their losses. The FTSE 100 also clawed back lost ground. After slumping100 points it ended 20 points lower. Germany\u2019s Dax index ended 1% higher. But in an indication of the anxiety in the market the price of bonds which Deutsche can use to bolster its financial strength in times of crisis \u2013 known as CoCos \u2013 plunged to new lows. From the moment the $14bn penalty was demanded Cryan has insisted the bank would not pay that amount. Reports this week \u2013 strenuously denied \u2013 suggested the bank had approached the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, for help and sparked a fresh round of concern about its financial strength. Cryan insisted there was \u201cno basis for this speculation\u201d as he set out four factors to support Deutsche\u2019s \u201cstrong fundamentals\u201d. He said its restructuring was on track \u2013 including the sale of UK business Abbey Life this week; that the bank had reduced its exposure to risky clients; that it had made \u20ac1bn of first-half profits; and it had \u20ac215bn of easy-to-sell assets in times of crisis. \u201cYou will hear back from me soon. Please keep working as you have been doing so far,\u201d he told staff, 7,000 of whom work in London. With Deutsche\u2019s shares down 50% this year, Cryan has been under pressure from some analysts to accelerate his restructuring programme to cope with the low interest rate environment. Cryan is expected to attend the International Monetary Fund meeting next week. Analysts at Credit Suisse said the share price reaction was overdone as the penalty would eventually be reduced from $14bn. \u201cWe have modelled \u20ac4bn for this issue,\u201d they said, and calculated that Deutsche could afford to pay \u20ac9bn \u201cbefore breaching minimum capital requirements, a comfortable cushion in our view\u201d. But even once the penalty is agreed, the bank will still face investor angst. Analysts said Deutsche might still need more capital, identifying a \u20ac7bn shortfall to Cryan\u2019s capital targets for 2018. The bank has set aside \u20ac5.5bn for litigation but not all of this is for the current situation. Deutsche is one of a number of European banks facing a possible penalty for mis-selling of US residential mortgage-backed securities, including Barclays and RBS. The Financial Times reported on Friday that the DoJ was aiming to wrap any settlement with Deutsche into one with Barclays and Swiss bank Credit Suisse and have it completed before the US presidential election on 8 November. Bailed-out RBS, which could take a hit of as much as \u00a39bn, said earlier this week it was not in settlement talks.",

      "bodyText": "Work for the dole participants are finding it harder to get jobs. New statistics show that just 11.7% of them find full-time work three months after the program. Of jobseekers who took part in the program between 1 July 2015 and 31 March 2016, 27.7% were in either full-time, part-time or casual employment three months later, the employment department has revealed in an answer to a question on notice from Senate estimates. That has decreased from 35% when the same question was asked at Senate estimates in May for the period of July to November 2015. Results for those who find full-time work are also down, from 16.1% to 11.7%. Labor\u2019s spokesman on employment services, Ed Husic, has taken aim at the government\u2019s delivery of the program saying the already \u201cabysmal\u201d results had \u201ccratered\u201d since May. \u201cThe work for the dole program has failed under the Abbott-Turnbull government,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. It had made it harder for young people to find work despite the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, vowing at estimates in May not to let youth \u201cbecome entrenched in a culture of welfare dependence\u201d, he said. \u201cIs work for the dole going to be relegated to a PR stunt or turned into a meaningful pathway to work for people who\u2019ve been locked out a job for ages?\u201d Figures released in August show unemployment in Australia sits at 5.72%, the lowest in almost three years, but full-time work has continued to decline, particularly among young people aged 15-24. In July 2015 the federal government moved to provide employment services through Jobactive, which pays incentives to private providers to help people gain employment. Last week Guardian Australia reported the Australian Unemployed Workers\u2019 Union is considering legal action against Jobactive providers after receiving complaints from people who suffered abrupt suspensions or penalties to their unemployment benefits when they were deemed to have breached work for the dole rules. Husic said the current success rate was \u201cappalling\u201d and the government had failed at managing basic employment services since the shift to Jobactive. In May the employment department secretary, Renee Leon, told Senate estimates work for the dole had \u201cvery positive outcomes\u201d. She cited a survey that found more than two-thirds of participants said it had improved their desire to find a job, their ability to work for others, their self-confidence, their work-related skills, and their understanding of the workplace. Leon said its objective was to give \u201cwork-like experiences ... especially as a means of improving [participants\u2019] job prospects and also to enable them to provide a benefit to their local community\u201d. Under changes in the May budget, the government will save $494.2m over four years by requiring the \u201cmost job-ready\u201d unemployed people to work for the dole after 12 months, instead of six months. It also announced it would redirect $751.7m from work for the dole to the new PaTH internship scheme, which will pay employers $1,000 to take on a young person who has been unemployed for more than six months as an intern for four to 12 weeks. Husic said: \u201cBefore fixing work for the dole the government has moved on to its next thought bubble, an internship program called PaTH which, it appears, hasn\u2019t been thought through.\u201d He cited fears the internships will displace \u201creal jobs\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Savour your morning juice and coffee this weekend, because the price of your favourite breakfast drinks may be on the way up. Unfavourable weather in Brazil \u2013 varying from droughts to heavy rainfall and frosts \u2013 has driven up the price of coffee, sugar and orange juice around the world by more than 20% in the past few months. The London traded November futures contract on robusta beans, the type mostly used to make instant coffee, has risen by a third since June to $2,027 (\u00a31,561) a tonne on the ICE exchange after the main growing areas of Espirito Santo and Bahia were hit by drought, leaving farmers with only half their potential crop. The recent rise in price was also driven by concerns about next year\u2019s crop. With reservoirs dry or nearly empty in the regions, farmers have been reliant on annual rains to provide the moisture needed to kickstart coffee plants\u2019 flowering season, and there has been precious little precipitation. \u201cThere has been rain but it\u2019s not enough to repair the damage,\u201d said Carlos Mera, a commodities analyst at Rabobank. Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest producer of high quality arabica coffee and the second largest grower of robusta beans. More than a quarter of coffee imported to the UK comes from Brazil. The country also produces 80% of the oranges traded on worldwide markets, more than half of which head to Europe, and exports nearly three times more sugar than any other country. The price of orange juice concentrate has risen 21% since June to more than $2 a lb on the New York futures market, a level described as \u201castronomically high\u201d by Andres Padilla, a senior commodities analyst at Rabobank based in Brazil. Padilla says prices have not been close to this level since 2006. Although globally we are drinking 4% to 5% less orange juice every year, production fell by a fifth in Brazil in the latest harvest year which finished in June, and by nearly a quarter in the world\u2019s second biggest producing region \u2013 Florida. Both areas were affected by the tree-killing Huanglongbing bug, better known as citrus greening. Brazil\u2019s harvest was already expected to be down year-on-year because of the bug, but as the crop was processed it emerged that heavy rains had left oranges with lower sugar content so that it takes more fruit to make each tonne of concentrate, the commodity exported around the world. \u201cAlthough demand is shrinking as the consumer is shifting to other products, there is more competition for orange juice as supply is shrinking faster than demand,\u201d said Padilla. Padilla added that prices were likely to stay high as several years of poor harvests meant that stocks of frozen juice built up in better years, before 2012, were now dwindling. Farmers in Brazil have also been tearing up trees and replacing them with more profitable crops such as sugar cane. Meanwhile, sugar is up 22% since June to about 23.5c per lb as weather problems in Brazil have combined with concerns about production in India to push up prices. Some sugar cane was harvested prematurely in early September after frosts in Brazil, and the harvest was also affected by extreme heat and dry weather earlier in the year. In some regions, yields were as much as 12% below expectations, according to Rabobank. Jara Zicha, a commodities analyst at Mintec, said sugar prices had risen amid \u201cexpectations that the global market will be in a supply deficit for the second consecutive year in 2016-17 and stocks will fall to six-year lows.\u201d As he reported Sainsbury\u2019s quarterly sales figures this week, the supermarket\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe reflected industry fears about price rises, pointing to a potential rise in coffee prices while other foodstuffs may fall. One supermarket source said it was not clear that commodity prices would feed through directly to supermarket shelves as retailers were facing tough pricing pressures from rival chains. All the major supermarkets are trying to fight back against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl by reducing prices on basics such as fruit, veg, tea and coffee, and so may be forced to absorb higher commodity costs.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "London companies to bear brunt of business rates overhaul", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An overhaul of the business rates system is to dramatically increase the tax paid by businesses in central London and cut the bills for struggling northern towns. Shops on Regent Street in London face an 87% increase in their business rates bill next year, while northern towns such as Bolton and Blackpool will enjoy a drop of up to 56%. The stark divergence in tax reflects the changes in Britain\u2019s economy since 2008, when the last official valuation of the country\u2019s property \u2013 on which business rates are based \u2013 took place. According to government estimates, London as a whole will register an 11% increase in its tax bill while everywhere else will experience a drop, including 10% in the north-west and the West Midlands, and 11% in the north-west. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the tax increases are a \u201creal kick in the teeth\u201d for the capital, but the Federation of Small Businesses said many firms across the country \u201cwill be getting some relief from years of overpayment\u201d. However, BT said telephone and broadband prices could increase as a result of a \u00a3565m hike in its taxes, while hospitals, universities and landmarks such as the Tower of London could also lose out. Business rates are a tax that firms pay on their commercial property. They were the Treasury\u2019s sixth biggest source of income in the last year, bringing in \u00a327.8bn. Retailers claim the levy places a damaging burden on the high street. The tax is calculated as a proportion of the value of a commercial building. The overall tax take for the Treasury is supposed to remain flat in real terms, but the burden for paying the tax shifts between businesses depending on the shape of the economy, which is measured through the revaluation of property. The principles behind business rates were laid out in the 1601 Poor Relief Act, which charged property owners a tax to help support the poor. Britain\u2019s property is supposed to be revalued by the Valuation Office Agency every five years, but the government controversially delayed the last revaluation by two years, claiming it would create uncertainty among businesses. This has made the changes in business rates payments announced by the government on Friday particularly dramatic. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the revaluation showed the government\u2019s reliance on London. David Phillips, economist at the IFS, said: \u201cGrowing differences in property prices reflect broader evidence of a growing divergence in economic performance over the last few years, and it will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole \u2013 which may pose difficulties if more revenue sources are devolved to the local level.\u201d The Department for Communities and Local Government has revealed plans to soften the blow of the tax hikes when they come into force next April by limiting the increase in the first year to 45%. However, this will be funded by introducing a cap of as little as 4.1% for businesses preparing for a drop in their rates bill, meaning they will have to wait for the full benefits. BT will face one of the biggest tax increases. According to research by Deloitte Real Estate its tax bill will increase from \u00a3149m to \u00a3714m by April 2017, a 450% increase. BT said the tax increase was excessive and would challenge it, saying: \u201cIt is highly likely that an increase of this size would lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses.\u201d Other business and sites set for large increases in their business rates bill include the O2 in London, which is set for a 142% rise, the Tower of London, which will see a 90% rise, and the Bank of England, which is due for a 61% uplift. According to Colliers International, the property agent, universities and hospitals will also be hit. The Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham faces a 64% increase while the University of Bangor in Wales will take a 33% hike. Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at property specialists Gerald Eve, said: \u201cThe new rateable values highlight the huge disparities between locations that have weathered the effects of the recession and those that have struggled to reverse the decline, but also underline what a mistake it was to postpone the revaluation by two years. \u201cThat the most struggling companies in the hardest-hit locations will never see the full benefit of their reduced assessments makes a mockery of the government\u2019s approach to revaluations. What is the point of revaluing properties if retailers are unable to see the upside? It is yet another example of confused thinking on the part of the government and indicative of an attitude that asks retailers to \u2018pay up and shut up\u2019.\u201d",

The stark divergence in tax reflects the changes in Britain\u2019s economy since 2008, when the last official valuation of the country\u2019s property \u2013 on which business rates are based \u2013 took place.</p> <p>According to government estimates, London as a whole will register an 11% increase in its tax bill while everywhere else will experience a drop, including 10% in the north-west and the West Midlands, and 11% in the north-west.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/sep/30/entrepreneurs-biggest-business-rates-change-generation-london\">Entrepreneurs face biggest business rates change in a generation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the tax increases are a \u201creal kick in the teeth\u201d for the capital, but the Federation of Small Businesses said many firms across the country \u201cwill be getting some relief from years of overpayment\u201d.</p> <p>However, BT said telephone and broadband prices could increase as a result of a \u00a3565m hike in its taxes, while hospitals, universities and landmarks such as the Tower of London could also lose out.</p> <p>Business rates are a tax that firms pay on their commercial property. They were the Treasury\u2019s sixth biggest source of income in the last year, bringing in \u00a327.8bn. Retailers claim the levy places a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/national-living-wage-business-rates-lethal-cocktail-says-tesco\">damaging burden on the high street.</a></p> <p>The tax is calculated as a proportion of the value of a commercial building. The overall tax take for the Treasury is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/treasury-curbing-radical-business-rates-review-say-retailers\">supposed to remain flat in real terms</a>, but the burden for paying the tax shifts between businesses depending on the shape of the economy, which is measured through the revaluation of property.<br></p> <p>The principles behind business rates were laid out in the 1601 Poor Relief Act, which charged property owners a tax to help support the poor.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s property is supposed to be revalued by the Valuation Office Agency every five years, but the government controversially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/revaluation-business-rates-delayed-tory\">delayed the last revaluation by two years</a>, claiming it would create uncertainty among businesses. This has made the changes in business rates payments announced by the government on Friday particularly dramatic.</p> <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the revaluation showed the government\u2019s reliance on London. David Phillips, economist at the IFS, said: \u201cGrowing differences in property prices reflect broader evidence of a growing divergence in economic performance over the last few years, and it will contribute to the ongoing trend of the UK government becoming more and more dependent on revenue from London to fund services across the whole \u2013 which may pose difficulties if more revenue sources are devolved to the local level.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Department for Communities and Local Government has revealed plans to soften the blow of the tax hikes when they come into force next April by limiting the increase in the first year to 45%. However, this will be funded by introducing a cap of as little as 4.1% for businesses preparing for a drop in their rates bill, meaning they will have to wait for the full benefits.</p> <p>BT will face one of the biggest tax increases. According to research by Deloitte Real Estate its tax bill will increase from \u00a3149m to \u00a3714m by April 2017, a 450% increase. BT said the tax increase was excessive and would challenge it, saying: \u201cIt is highly likely that an increase of this size would lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Other business and sites set for large increases in their business rates bill include the O2 in London, which is set for a 142% rise, the Tower of London, which will see a 90% rise, and the Bank of England, which is due for a 61% uplift.</p> <p> According to Colliers International, the property agent, universities and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/cash-strapped-hospitals-ask-for-a-15bn-rebate\">hospitals will also be hit</a>. The Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham faces a 64% increase while the University of Bangor in Wales will take a 33% hike.</p> <p>Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at property specialists Gerald Eve, said: \u201cThe new rateable values highlight the huge disparities between locations that have weathered the effects of the recession and those that have struggled to reverse the decline, but also underline what a mistake it was to postpone the revaluation by two years.</p> <p>\u201cThat the most struggling companies in the hardest-hit locations will never see the full benefit of their reduced assessments makes a mockery of the government\u2019s approach to revaluations. What is the point of revaluing properties if retailers are unable to see the upside? It is yet another example of confused thinking on the part of the government and indicative of an attitude that asks retailers to \u2018pay up and shut up\u2019.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trade negotiators will meet in New York next week to search for common ground on the controversial EU-US trade deal, which has been buffeted by strong opposition on both sides of the Atlantic. A team of 90 EU negotiators will travel to New York for five days of talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), starting on Monday. Hopes of a deal before US president Barack Obama leaves the White House in mid-January have evaporated, raising doubts about whether TTIP can ever be agreed amid widespread hostility and regular street protests. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner, said last week: \u201cIf we were not to conclude TTIP before 19 January, then there would be a natural pause.\u201d Her opposite number, US trade representative Michael Froman, is expected to leave his post during the White House changeover. By the time his successor is in place \u2013 a process that may take six months \u2013 Germany will be in the midst of a national election campaign. With the window for finding an agreement closing, officials at the European commission hope to \u201clock in as much progress\u201d as possible before Obama goes. Next week\u2019s talks will focus on developing compatible standards in key industry sectors, spanning pharmaceuticals, engineering and IT. Regulatory differences are seen as an easier nut to crack than other disputed issues, such as allowing European companies to bid for US public-sector contracts or protecting European cheese and champagne from imitators. \u201cWe have not tried to hide the fact that these differences are quite large,\u201d a commission source said. While technical talks grind on, the political outlook has become stormier. Trade ministers from seven countries, including France and Germany, raised a variety of doubts and concerns last week. The UK was in a rival group of 12 countries that signed a letter in favour. The supporters, which also include Italy and Spain, said they were ready to sign a similar deal with Canada on 27 October. John Springford, head of research at the Centre for European Reform, said it was hard to see TTIP talks resuming in 2017. \u201cThe window of opportunity for getting TTIP done was before we got into the US election campaign, and certainly before the French and German elections got under way [in 2017]. I think that window of opportunity is now closed.\u201d In an acknowledgement that it has lost the public relations battle on TTIP, the European commission is preparing to release a tranche of data showing the benefits of transatlantic trade for towns and cities across the EU. Advance statistics from the data set, which will be published in late October, show that 30,000 British companies export to the US, 93% of which are small businesses. The British government has always championed TTIP, but the Brexit vote means the deal may never apply to the UK. In a speech this week, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, argued that the UK stood on the verge of a golden age of free trade, where \u201ca post-geography trading world\u201d meant \u201cwe are much less restricted in having to find partners who are physically close to us\u201d. That claim does not reflect the expert consensus, according to Springford at the CER, who said academic studies showed that geography still mattered. \u201cGlobalisation, rather than meaning distance no longer matters, has created regionalisation, which has increased the importance of being close to your trading partners, so you can set up supply chains and global value chains, [and] the products are then exported around the world.\u201d Jude Kirton-Darling, a Labour MEP for the north-east of England, said Fox\u2019s speech showed bravado, but left many questions unanswered. \u201cWill we grandfather existing trade deals? What kind of trade policy are we going to be pushing for? What are our basic negotiating positions? All of this is completely unclear.\u201d The MEP, who sits on the European parliament\u2019s international trade committee, led Labour MEPs in voting against a motion on TTIP, because of concerns over giving too much power to foreign investors and diluting environmental and health standards. A supporter of the UK remaining in the EU, Kirton-Darling argued it would be preferable to be in a \u201creforming\u201d EU trade policy than outside. \u201cIt is clear that the EU of 500 million people negotiating with the US is a much more balanced relationship than 65 million people in Britain negotiating with the US. The danger is that we would be given a fait accompli by Washington and the pressure would be intense to accept what was on the table, because what else would be available when we have left the EU?\u201d TTIP: three stumbling blocks Special court One of the main worries about TTIP \u2013 and existing trade rules \u2013 is the power given to large corporations to sue governments. These fears were crystallised when tobacco company Philip Morris used an international trade-dispute-resolution system, in an attempt to overturn Australia\u2019s plain-packaging laws for cigarettes. In response, the European commission called for a special trade court to replace the current system, which dates back to the 1960s. The commission says its proposed Investment Court System would be more transparent and efficient. But critics argue it is no better than the current system. The US is unenthusiastic about the EU plan and has expressed doubts about allowing companies the right of appeal. \u2018Kentucky-Fried Bratwurst\u2019 Under EU rules, real Champagne only comes from the vineyards around Reims; Feta cheese belongs to Greece; and the true Cornish pasty cannot be made in Devon (or anywhere else). TTIP critics fear the deal would open the door to \u201cKentucky-Fried Bratwurst\u201d and a slew of imitators, as EU labels on \u201cprotected geographical indication\u201d have no status in US law. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has vowed to block any deal, \u201cwhich would put our agriculture in difficulty\u201d. The French government has also voiced concern about dilution of environmental standards. Buy American While Europeans are worried about their cheese and ham, Americans want to hang on to protections for their iron and steelmakers. Reciprocal access to the lucrative sector of government contracts is a potential deal-breaker. The EU side argues the US has not done enough to allow European companies to bid for US government contracts. \u201cBuy American\u201d became US policy in 1933 during the Great Depression and was also a significant aspect of the 2009 Stimulus Act. The policy prevents foreign firms from bidding for many federal and state construction jobs.",

      "bodyText": "The closing bell has rung in New York, signalling the end of the trading day, the week, the month and indeed the quarter. And shares have finished higher, after a wild old day in the markets. The Dow Jones has finished up 163 points, of 0.9%, at 18,306 points. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8%. Financial stocks led the rally following those reports that Deutsche could receive a fine of just $5.4bn from the DoJ; much less than the opening shot of $14bn. Deutsche Bank\u2019s US-listed securities closed up around 14%, clawing back all yesterday\u2019s losses, and more. Traders seem to have concluded that the panic that gripped the markets 27 hours ago, following reports of hedge funds cutting exposure to DB, was overdone. But still, the health of the German banking giant is still the main story; and remember, we still don\u2019t have any confirmation that a deal with the DoJ is imminent. As Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, puts it: \u201cWe are very much being driven by headline risks at Deutsche Bank.\u201d And that really is for tonight, unless that deal comes soon..... An important point: (As explained earlier, these CoCo bonds are high-yielding debt that convert into equity if the bank runs short of capital) Here\u2019s a handy list of tonight\u2019s market-moving US news, for anyone away from their terminal (or bereft of one): Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story about the latest developments in the Deutsche Bank saga: Traders are also getting impatient for news about a possible settlement between Deutsche and the US authorities... Nothing momentous to report yet.... but with one hour\u2019s trading to go, Deutsche Bank\u2019s US shares are still up a mighty 15% tonight. That means investors are still clinging to hopes that the bank will secure a DoJ fine that doesn\u2019t wipe out its capital base. The excitable talk about a new Lehman Brothers moment has also calmed down, as traders digest the fact that Deutsche has a lot of assets, and plenty of liquidity too. Elsewhere, in a week when Opec looked like it was on track to curb output to support oil prices, US drillers continued to bring more rigs on stream. The weekly Baker Hughes report showed: US oil rigs rose this quarter by the largest amount in two years, according to the report. On that note, and with Deutsche Bank\u2019s US shares now up 14%, it\u2019s time to close for the evening, although we\u2019ll try and pop back in to cover any momentous events should they occur. Otherwise, thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Investors in Deutsche Bank must be feeling giddy after the wild gyrations in the bank\u2019s share price in the course of just one day. An early 10% slump followed reports that a number of hedge funds had cut their exposure to the bank. But reassurance from Deutsche chief executive John Cryan that the bank had strong fundamentals helped limit some of the damage, and the shares really surged near the end of the trading day on talk its US fine - the cause of much of the recent gloom around the bank - might be reduced from $14bn to around $5.4bn. So Deutsche\u2019s German shares ended up 6.39% on the day at \u20ac11.57. The US shares are currently up 13%. The rebound dragged the financial sector and indeed most of Europe\u2019s markets into positive territory after their early falls. But the FTSE 100 failed to regain all its lost ground. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 20.09 points or 0.29% at 6899.33, although the index is up 1.69% on the month and 6% on the quarter Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.01% to 10511.02 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.1% higher at 4448.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.38% to 16401.00 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 8779.4 In Athens, the Greek market dipped 0.48% to 565.53 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 171 points or 0.9%. And now this: Another report is doing the rounds suggesting that Deutsche Bank may only pay $5.4bn in a settlement with the US Department of Justice, rather than the $14bn initially suggested. AFP has reported the bank is close to a settlement, and even though the $5.4bn figure is the same as in a JP Morgan note for non-US loans, the bank\u2019s shares have moved sharply higher. The Department of Justice is not commenting, but Deutsche Bank chief executive John Cryan is still in the US so a deal is not implausible. The bank is also not commenting, according to Reuters. The banks\u2019s US shares are up 13% while the German shares have added 6% after their earlier slump. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: With the end of the quarter now upon us it is not surprising to see some last minute rallies in risk assets, as institutional investors look to spruce up their portfolios, but overall the bears have been denied the selloff for which they have been looking all week. Dip buying, it seems, is alive and well as an art form. Banks continue to dominate the lower reaches of the FTSE 100, as the prospect of further travails for Deutsche loom large over the sector Ironically, Deutsche shares themselves have staged an impressive recovery, with more than a few shorts probably getting cold feet given the possibility of more news over the weekend that could easily send the shares soaring anew. Goldman Sachs estimates that Deutsche Bank will end up paying between $2.8bn and $8.1bn, rather than the $14bn figure from the Department of Justice. But its that there is some urgency to resolve the issue. The volatility in Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares over the last day or so proves the point. Goldman said: We believe Deutsche Bank\u2019s liquidity position...is stable \u2013 and further strengthened by ECB funding backstops, which remain available to all Eurozone banks. This said, the reaction of (admittedly less liquid) the ADR to a single piece of news flow demonstrates the extent of concern in the market. As we highlighted previously, as market concerns intensify, achieving resolution to litigation, and thus capital concerns, is important. Analysts are taking a positive view of the Eurogroup president\u2019s earlier comments that Deutsche Bank would have to stand on its own. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Despite, or perhaps because of, Jeroen Dijsselbloem coming out to state that Deutsche Bank won\u2019t receive state aid the German giant has managed to claw its way back into the green this afternoon. One could argue that the comments from Dijsselbloem prove that the financial health of Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t as bad as suspected. For if it the financial firm was on its last legs there is no way the Eurozone chiefs wouldn\u2019t find a way of preventing the collapse of the region\u2019s biggest lender. Deutsche Bank\u2019s US shares are sharply higher after Thursday\u2019s sell-off, up around 6% at the moment. Back with Deutsche Bank and here\u2019s the chart of its shares over the last couple of days: After briefly edging into positive territory for the day, they have slipped back again slightly. Analysts have suggested that the earlier figure of $5.4bn is a misreading of a JP Morgan note, which estimated that could be the amount Deutsche would have to pay for non-US fines, not the Department of Justice liability. And US consumer confidence is on the rise as well. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index is up from 89.8 in August to 91.2 in September, above forecasts of a figure of 90. It is also better than the preliminary reading for September of 89.8. Back with the US economy, and a better than expected Chicago purchasing managers index for September. The index came in at 54.2 compared to forecasts of 52 and last month\u2019s figure of 51.5. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have now moved into positive territory for the day: After Thursday\u2019s falls, the US market is heading higher in early trading, with financial stocks recovering some ground on hopes that Deutsche Bank can emerge intact from the current crisis. Investors appear to be taking heart from the bank\u2019s chief executive John Cryan telling staff the bank has strong fundamentals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 121 points or 0.67%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both opened around 0.4% higher. As we said earlier, Deutsche Bank\u2019s position will look a lot healthier if it can agree a deal with the US Department of Justice to reduce its fine from the mooted $14bn. There is market chatter that a deal can be done, perhaps over the weekend, and at a much lower cost to the bank. Whatever the case, Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares continue to recover and are now down just 0.69% at \u20ac10.80. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, has told reporters that Deutsche Bank must survive on its own, without state aid, Reuters is reporting. The early morning market panic in Europe has abated. So, with the East Coast of America heading to work (or already there), let\u2019s quickly catch up. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have suffered fresh losses on Friday, on growing fears over the bank\u2019s financial health. They tumbled 8% in early trading, falling below \u20ac10 for the first time in decades, after it emerged that 10 hedge funds had cut their exposure to the bank. But right now, Deutsche\u2019s shares are staging a recovery, and currently 3.7% lower at \u20ac10.47. The recovery began after Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan wrote to the bank\u2019s staff, to reassure them about its financial situation. Cryan insisted that: We fulfil all current capital requirements and our restructuring is well on track. We have significantly decreased our market and credit risk in recent years. Despite low interest rates and a difficult environment we posted a pre-tax profit of about 1 billion euros in the first half of 2016. In a situation like this, the most important factor is our liquidity reserves, which are still over \u20ac215bn. Intriguingly, Cryan signed off his note by promising staff that \u201cYou will hear back from me soon.\u201d Cryan has been America this week, attending a Deutsche banking conference. We understand that he\u2019s still in the US..... Some analysts have been arguing that Deutsche Bank\u2019s financial position is healthier than feared, and that it has enough capital to handle the fine heading its way from the DoJ. Credit Suisse, for example, believe the slump in Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is overdone. There\u2019s also widespread agreement that Deutsche Bank\u2019s position will improve once that fine is agreed. That would then pave the way for fresh capital to be raised to underpin the bank. European stock markets have recovered from their early morning slump, although bank shares are still in the red. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is now down just 39 points, or 0.6% -- having been down over 100 points earlier. The German DAX is now down only 0.6%, while the French CAC is down 1.2%. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Cryan\u2019s memo helped to reassure the City. \u201cEquities are nursing losses into the weekend, derived from more intense anxiety about the health of Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. Major equity indices are, nonetheless, off their worst levels courtesy of intervention by DBK\u2019s CEO saying market anxiety is excessive, fine or no fine from the US DoJ. Contagion fears that were denting financial peers may have eased but of course remain ready to pounce on the next negative DBK soundbite. Wall Street is currently expected to open a little higher, in 40 minutes time, having suffered a chunky selloff last night. Meanwhile in the UK, two pieces of economic data have provided fresh evidence that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t hurt the economy. Growth in April-June has been revised up, to 0.7%. Fresh data showed that businesses boosted their investment spending by 1% in the second quarter, defying speculation that the Brexit vote would hit confidence. And the dominant services sector had a blowout July, with output rising by 0.4%. Economists are now predicting stronger growth in the current quarter. Chancellor Philip Hammond says the data shows the strength of the UK economy. Newsflash from America: US citizens saw their incomes rise by 0.2% in August, bang in line with forecasts. Hmmmm Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is picking up. Now down just 3.8% today at \u20ac10.40. Investors are keeping an eye on a particular type of debt, called CoCo bonds, issued by Deutsche Bank. Also known as AT1 bonds, they are effectively insurance for Deutsche, in the event that it needs fresh capital. Investors buy them because they offer a high interest rate, but they also know that the bonds could be converted into shares if the bank hits trouble. So it\u2019s worth noting that Deutsche\u2019s CoCo bonds have hit fresh lows today, showing that investors think there\u2019s a greater danger they\u2019ll be triggered. But let\u2019s be clear -- this is an example of the financial markets working as they should. CoCo bonds are meant to be triggered when a bank needs new capital. They\u2019re part of the framework created after the 2008 crash, to stop taxpayers being first on the hook. Joel Lewin of fastFT has more details: The price of Deutsche\u2019s 6% coco has dropped below 70 cents on the euro for the first time today. Last summer it was trading above 100 cents. Coco bonds are deemed among the riskiest forms of debt. They are a form hybrid debt that converts to equity when the bank\u2019s capital falls to a certain level. Recent concerns over the impact of a potential fine of as much as $14bn from the US Department of Justice on Deutsche\u2019s balance sheet have sparked fears that its coco bonds could be triggered, resulting in scrapped coupon payments or forcing parts of its debt structure to be converted to equity. Neither the German or US governments will want to see Deutsche Bank suffer a meltdown this autumn, for political reasons. Angela Merkel is already under extra pressure since the right-wing AfD party made gains in Berlin elections earlier this month. A bailout of Germany\u2019s flagship bank would intensify criticism of her leadership, ahead of Federal Elections in autumn 2017. Barack Obama can also remember what a banking crisis looks like. The final weeks of his historic battle for the White House in 2008 saw the financial system come close to meltdown, after Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail. A repeat today would not, I suspect, help Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in November. Barack Obama and Angela Merkel spoke by phone yesterday, but didn\u2019t discuss Deutsche Bank\u2019s looming fine from the DoJ. That\u2019s according to a German spokeswoman, who told reporters that: \u201cThe conversation with Obama concerned Ukraine and Syria,and was not about other issues.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quote) Berlin\u2019s government continues to play a straight bat on Deutsche, having denied a report this week that a secret rescue plan is being developed. John Cryan\u2019s claim that forces in the markets are trying to weaken confidence in Deutsche Bank has reminded some observers of another bank chief, Dick Fuld of Lehman Brothers. Fuld notoriously told staff in 2007 that he wanted to squeeze, hard, the speculators who had shorted Lehman\u2019s shares. To nervous laughter, Fuld declared that: What I really want do to is reach in, rip out their heart, and eat it before they die. Those speculators had the last laugh though, when Lehman failed in September 2008. John Cryan is hardly cut from the same cloth as Fuld, though. Deutsche\u2019s British-born CEO has a reserved, almost doleful delivery in public, and could surely never give such a speech. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have taken such a hammering recently that it\u2019s hard to say exactly when they were lower. My Reuters terminal only has data going back to the early 1990s, and that shows that Deutsche are at their lowest since reunification. They\u2019ve lost 90% of their value since 2007 (!) James Mackintosh of the WSJ has done some serious digging, and shows how shares hit 1973 levels this morning. Carlo Mareels of Mitsubishi UFJ, a financial services group, reckons that the markets have over-reacted to last night\u2019s scoop about some hedge funds cutting their prime brokerage exposure to Deutsche Bank (DB). He says: \u201cIt is unexpected news to us, especially because it includes 10 different hedge funds which, we understand, would have made such a decision at the same time. DB said yesterday that its prime brokerage is \u2018still very profitable\u2019 (CNBC) and that it had outflows, but also inflows. We are not sure why this decision would have been taken by all these hedge funds given that the risk of a liquidity crisis is very remote and the Central Banks are now much more on an alert than in 2007/8.\u201d Mareels also argues that Deutsche Bank could handle a DoJ fine of up to $6bn. [Anything higher] would appear excessively punitive given how other banks with larger initial settlement requests have ended up paying smaller amounts than $6bn.\u201d But until that fine is agreed, Deutsche Bank can\u2019t raise fresh capital, Mareels concludes. City traders are expecting some turbulent days, as Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems tumble on. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says currencies could be knocked, including the pound (which is currently below $1.30) The next few days will not only be crucial for Deutsche bank, but also currencies across Europe. This morning\u2019s news has already undermined the Pound, with the improvements seen this week impacted by market concerns over Deutsche Bank. Continued instability will put great pressure on the fragile and unpredictable pound, and investors globally will be keeping a close eye not just on the German bank but on what happens to the Pound.\u201d Your starter for 10.... Credit Suisse have published a research note on Deutsche Bank this morning. On the upside, CS argue that the slump in Deutsche\u2019s share price is an overreaction, which \u201coverstates the short-term litigation risk\u201d from US authorities. They are confident that the DoJ will settle for a much lower amount than the opening offer of $14bn. But \u2026 there\u2019s also the downside. And CS warns that Deutsche Bank needs \u20ac7bn of additional capital over the next two years, to hit its own targets. And that means its share price will remain under pressure. Here\u2019s the relevant bit: A capital shortfall of nearly \u20ac7bn still exists on a fully phased basis between the 2Q16 fully phased CET1 ratio of 10.8% and the 2018 management target of 12.5% (including just 25bps buffer over the 12.25% minimum; we think investors will demand nearer 13% on a sustainable basis). With just a 5% ROTE in 2018 in the current revenue environment, even with no dividend in 2016/2017 and benefits from recent disposals we still think Deutsche Bank will struggle to meet its capital targets organically, especially if the sale of Postbank (which could add 20-70bps at 0.3-0.6x TBV) is delayed due to a low price in a low rate environment. We think this will keep the shares trading below 0.4x 2016E TBV. And for readers who aren\u2019t banking experts, here\u2019s a glossary: CET1= Tier 1 common capital, a measure of financial strength ROTE = Return on tangible equity, a measure of how much cash shareholders receive TBV: tangible book value, or how much Deutsche Bank is actually worth (and thus what the share price will do) Has John Cryan dropped a hint that he may have news for Deutsche\u2019s worried staff, in today\u2019s memo? It\u2019s early days...but it appears that the New York stock market may open calmly in three and a half hours despite the fears gripping the banking sector. Wall Street took the brunt of the Deutsche Bank selloff last night, after Bloomberg broke the news that some hedge funds had pulled cash away from the company. That wiped 1% off the Dow Jones industrial average last night, as Deutsche plunged to fresh lows. Jamieson Blake, Retail Sales Manager at ADS Securities London, says the Dow is on track for a flat open: Despite a volatile start in Europe, Wall Street is currently looking to kick off the last trading session of the quarter as good as unchanged. There are mounting fears over the state of Deutsche Bank and with this will come concern over the risk of contagion. The VIX is spiking higher too, but at least for now the market seems content that the slide we saw for US equities yesterday has been an appropriate adjustment. VIX is a measure of volatility, known informally as the Fear Index. Here\u2019s our latest news story on Deutsche Bank, for anyone just tuning in Earlier this week, John Cryan was in Arizona for Deutsche Bank\u2019s 24th Annual Leveraged Finance Conference. This tweet, from two days ago, confirms it: It\u2019s thought that Cryan hasn\u2019t flown back to Europe yet; if so, he has an opportunity to tackle that looming fine from the DoJ. City editor Jill Treanor explains: Cryan has insisted the bank will not pay the $14bn the DoJ has demanded. Under pressure from some analysts to accelerate his restructuring programme, Cryan is understood to be in the US, which might indicate that the bank is trying to further engage with the authorities. Here\u2019s John Cryan\u2019s email to Deutsche Bank\u2019s staff, reassuring them about the bank\u2019s financial health. I have bolded up the most important bits. Media reports on Deutsche Bank: a message to employees from John Cryan Dear Colleagues, You will have seen speculation in the media that a few of our hedge fund clients have reduced some activities with us. That is causing unjustified concerns. We should consider this in the context of the bigger picture: Deutsche Bank overall has more than 20 million clients. I understand if you feel concerned by the extensive coverage on this issue. Our bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price. It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business. Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust. Deutsche Bank has strong fundamentals. Let me mention some of the most important facts at this point: We fulfil all current capital requirements and our restructuring is well on track. We completed the disposal of the British insurer Abbey Life this week and the sale of our stake in the Chinese Hua Xia Bank will be finalised soon. This will further improve our capital ratio. We have significantly decreased our market and credit risk in recent years. At no point in the last two decades has the balance sheet of Deutsche Bank been as stable as it is today. Despite low interest rates and a difficult environment we posted a pre-tax profit of about 1 billion euros in the first half of 2016. Before extraordinary items like restructuring costs, we earned about 1.7 billion euros. This demonstrates the operating strength of Deutsche Bank. In a situation like this, the most important factor is our liquidity reserves. Currently they still amount to more than 215 billion euros. This is an extremely comfortable buffer. This is clear proof of how conservatively we have planned. This is acknowledged by numerous banking analysts. There is therefore no basis for this speculation. Nor can uncertainty about the outcome of our litigation cases in the US explain this pressure on our stock price, if we take the settlements of our peers as a benchmark. You have all done a tremendous job over the past few days. You are the ones who are in constant contact with our clients and making it clear how Deutsche Bank is really doing. You are Deutsche Bank \u2013 that is impressively clear. All of us in the Management Board highly appreciate it. You will hear back from me soon. Please keep working as you have been doing so far. We are and we remain a strong Deutsche Bank. Yours sincerely, Let\u2019s get back to Deutsche Bank. And shares in Germany\u2019s largest lender have recovered some of their earlier losses, after CEO John Cryan told staff that the bank is still in solid shape. In that memo, Cryan also said (via Reuters): \u201cWe should look at the complete picture. \u201cDeutsche Bank has more than 20 million customers. \u201cWe are and remain a strong Deutsche Bank.\u201d And this seems to have helped restore some confidence. Deutsche\u2019s shares are now down \u2018only\u2019 4% this morning, at \u20ac10.42, having been driven into single digits earlier. That still leaves them on track for a new record closing low. Other bank stocks have recouped some ground too, but are still in the red. Joshua Mahony of City firm IG says the threat of US litigation for misconduct is haunting the sector. Market sentiment continues to suffer as a result of recent Deutsche Bank woes, with the financial sector leading the race to the bottom this morning. With the US Department of Justice aiming to also penalise Barclays and Credit Suisse alongside Deutsche [details here], there is a fear that we could see huge amounts of fines levied across the whole industry, effectively wiping out much of the safety buffers built up in case of emergency. Chancellor Philip Hammond has welcomed the news that Britain\u2019s service sector grew at a faster pace in July (up from +0.3% to +0.4%), and that Q2\u2019s growth rate has been revised up (from 0.6% to 0.7%) Hammond says: \u201cThe UK started the year in a position of economic strength, and we can see today that this momentum has continued in the services sector \u2013 the largest part of our economy. We want to build on this strength as we forge a new relationship with the EU and deliver an economy that works for all. The UK is well-positioned to deal with the challenges, and take advantage of the opportunities, that lie ahead.\u201d Hammond, who took office after the referendum, is currently working on his autumn statement (due on 23 November). He must decide how much extra stimulus the UK economy needs, following the Brexit vote. Inflation across the eurozone has doubled, from 0.2% to 04% in September. Eurostat reports that energy costs were less of a drag on the cost of living, as the oil prices has picked up recently. That suggests that inflation is finally heading up towards the official target of just below 2%, following massive stimulus efforts from the European Central Bank. Here\u2019s the details: Service sector inflation rose to 1.2%, up from 1.1% in August Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prices rose by 0.7%, compared with 1.3% in August non-energy industrial goods rose by 0.3%, having been flat in August And energy prices only shrank by 3.0%, compared with -5.6% in August. Economist Sam Tombs reckons the Bank of England now has less reason to cut interest rates again: City experts are hailing this morning\u2019s UK data, and the latest signs that the Brexit vote hasn\u2019t derailed the economy. Alan Clarke of Scotiabank says the surge in service sector growth in July is significant: Representing around \u00be of the economy, this was the first official output data for the sector to cover the post Brexit vote period. Services grew by 0.4% m/m, well above consensus, with the prior month also revised up for good measure. So despite the Brexit vote and the anxiety surrounding it, it was business as usual in the services sector. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees. He\u2019s revised up his forecast for growth in the third quarter of 2016: News that services output grew 0.4% month-on-month in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote is a significant boost to third quarter growth prospects; consequently we are lifting our third quarter growth estimate to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3%. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway is also impressed by the services sector growth: Economist Rupert Seggins puts the 1% jump in business investment into context: In further good news, Britain\u2019s services sector output grew by 0.4% in July, up from 0.3% in June. That suggests that the UK economy was not rocked badly by the results of June\u2019s referendum, as well as growing strongly in the run-up to the vote. Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the Office for National Statistics, says today\u2019s data (online here) shows the UK services sector is in better shape than feared. \u201cDespite some very weak indicators appearing in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, estimates gathered by ONS from more than 23,000 firms now suggest that the services sector \u2013 which accounts for three quarters of the economy \u2013 in fact grew strongly in July. \u201cFurther information also suggests that the whole economy also grew slightly more strongly in the months before polling day than previously thought.\u201d \u201cTogether this fresh data tends to support the view that there has been no sign of an immediate shock to the economy, although the full picture will continue to emerge. \u201cONS is also developing new sources of data so as to provide a faster and more complete picture of the economy as the Brexit story unfolds over the longer term.\u201d Newsflash from London: Britain\u2019s economy performed better in the run-up to June\u2019s EU referendum than first thought. UK GDP grew by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016, the Office for National Statistics says, up from a previous estimate of 0.6%. These new figures show that: the services industry grew by 0.7%, not 0.6% as first thought Industrial production growth is confirmed at 2.1%, The construction sector only shrank by 0.1%, not 0.7% The ONS also reports that business investment grew by 1% during the quarter, despite the apparent uncertainty over the Brexit vote. It\u2019s the latest sign that the economy held up pretty well in the run-up to the 23 June referendum .... Deutsche Bank\u2019s share prices has climbed back over the \u20ac10 mark, after John Cryan\u2019s memo to staff was published. But it\u2019s still down almost 7% at \u20ac10.11. Reuters have now translated John Cryan\u2019s memo into English. Here\u2019s the key quote from the Deutsche Bank boss, blaming market speculation for undermining the company: \u201cThere are forces now under way in the market that want to weaken confidence in us, Our job now is to ensure that this distorted perception does not more strongly influence our day-to-day business.\u201d Newsflash: John Cryan, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, has written a memo to staff insisting that the company has a strong foundation, and hitting out at speculators. It is an attempt to quash concerns over Deutsche\u2019s future, and shore up confidence in Germany\u2019s largest lender. Reuters has the memo. It says that Cryan says that \u201cmarket forces\u201d are in action, and that there is \u201cno basis\u201d for speculation over Deutsche\u2019s health. He says the bank fulfils all capital requirements, and a strong foundation. He also says that the uncertainty over the upcoming fine from the Department of Justice does not justify the fall in Deutsche\u2019s share price, given the final settlements that have been agreed by rivals. Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems would be less severe if it could reach a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage securities a decade ago. Deutsche has been under pressure since it emerged that the DoJ has proposed a $14bn penalty \u2013 much more than expected, and dwarfing the $6bn which the bank had set aside for misconduct. Most analysts expect the DoJ to settle on a lower figure. but until that happens no-one knows how much extra capital Deutsche Bank needs to raise. The Financial Times is reporting that the DoJ is planning a multibillion-dollar \u201comnibus settlement\u201d with Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities, in the next few weeks. They say: By grouping the three banks together into a single deal the DoJ hopes to achieve maximum public impact by collecting an eye-catching sum in penalties from the trio just weeks before the US presidential election. More here: US seeks pre-election settlement of bank mis-selling claims Every one of Europe\u2019s financial stocks is falling this morning, as Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems rattle the sector. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: After a couple of days of relief the markets are back in the red, with Deutsche Bank continuing to position itself as the number one worry for investors. A Bloomberg report yesterday evening claiming that 10 hedge funds had reduced their exposure to the German financial firm has sparked the latest round of heavy losses, with Deutsche Bank dropping between 9% after the bell. That drop has seen the bank dip below \u20ac10, effectively its worst price in 30 years. Understandably the European markets are rattled. The FTSE has now lost all of the 2016-high grazing growth it managed yesterday, falling back below 6850 in part thanks to the near 5% declines seen by Barclays and RBS (the latter of which is perhaps most in line for a Deutsche Bank style shock). The DAX, meanwhile, dropped by nearly 200 points, with the CAC the worst performing major index at a 2.1% slide thanks to the heavy losses incurred by BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale. Analyst Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services agrees that Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t the new Lehman: The Deutsche Bank, and broader European banking concerns will also remain \u2018front and central\u2019 to proceedings, though the specific comparisons to Lehman look to be off target, in so far as Deutsche is a huge deposit taker (close to \u20ac600 Bln), is very clearly too big to fail, and has access to all the ECB funding facilities that have been established since the GFC [Great Financial Crisis]. But he believes Deutsche Bank needs to bite the bullet and do something... As with Lehman, the key issue is far less its under-capitalization or solvency, and rather more the potential loss of access to liquidity. Doing nothing is eminently no longer an option, and per se it needs to consider one or more of the following difficult options: a) raise equity other via a rights issue or converting CoCos [bonds that convert to equity when a bank needs capital] b) go with a begging bowl to the ECB, an option that remains heavily stigmatized, c) opt for a bail-in, or d) seek a government bail-out. Deutsche Bank\u2019s struggles may sound like a repeat of the Lehman Brothers collapse, but there are some key differences. For one, Deutsche can approach the European Central Bank for liquidity if it struggles (which would be embarrassing for such a large lender). New bail-in rules mean it can tap bond-holders, before needing a state bailout. And Angela Merkel could, if needed, step in if a \u2018bail-in\u2019 didn\u2019t raise enough capital. Ouch! Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price just slipped below the \u20ac10 mark for the first time in around 30 years. Germany\u2019s DAX stock index has shed 1.6% in early trading, led by bank stocks, and France\u2019s CAC is down by 1.7%. Almost every share has fallen in London this morning; the only risers are precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo. Financial stocks are being badly rattled by the situation at Deutsche: Shares in Deutsche Bank have slumped by 7% at the start of trading in Frankfurt. They hit a low of \u20ac10.07, the lowest since the mid-1980s, echoing last night\u2019s selloff in New York. Commerzbank, Germany\u2019s second largest lender, are down 6% at the open. Yesterday it announced 9,600 job cuts and a dividend freeze, as it tried to shore up its own profitability. London\u2019s stock market is bathed in red at the start of trading, as Deutsche Bank fears ripple through the City. The FTSE 100 index has shed 89 points, or 1.3%, to 6830. Banks are leading the selloff; Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are all down around 3.5%. Worries over Deutsche Bank rippled through Asia\u2019s stock markets overnight. The Japanese Nikkei dropped by 1.5%, as investors digested the news that 10 hedge funds (out of 200) had cut their exposure to Deutsche. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: While these firms represent a fairly small part of the banks clients, as a weather vane in the current febrile environment, it doesn\u2019t exactly represent a vote of confidence either, and sent the US listed shares of the bank to a record low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. When does a problem turn into a crisis? For Deutsche Bank, that moment may have come last night, when Bloomberg reported that 10 hedge funds had cut their exposure to the German lender. These funds, who use Deutsche Bank to clear various trades, have chosen to move some excess cash elsewhere, in light of recent speculation over Germany\u2019s largest lender\u2019s financial health. Although most of Deutsche\u2019s clients haven\u2019t taken any action, the news still rattled Wall Street. Deutsche Bank\u2019s US-listed securities tumbled by 6.6% in New York last night, as the Dow Jones industrial average shed 1%, or 197 points. Its Frankfurt-listed shares are likely to slide when trading begins, and may drag down the wider European stock markets as well. As Rupert Neate reported last night, Deutsche Bank tried to reassure the markets: The report forced the chairman of Deutsche\u2019s hedge fund business, Barry Bausano, to take to the airwaves to reassure the market. He told CNBC that Deutsche, its prime brokerage division, which services hedge funds, was \u201cstill very profitable\u201d but said there was \u201cno question we have a perception issue\u201d. Deutsche, which has had been quick to deny reports it needed help from the German government, released a statement on Thursday to reassure investors that the majority of its clients were sticking with the bank. \u201cOur trading clients are among the world\u2019s most sophisticated investors. We are confident that the vast majority of them have a full understanding of our stable financial position, the current macroeconomic environment, the litigation process in the US and the progress we are making with our strategy,\u201d the bank said. It\u2019s important not to sensationalise the situation at Deutsche Bank; many banking analysts insist that this isn\u2019t another Lehman moment. The bank doesn\u2019t need fresh capital today, and could probably raise it if needed -- partly by triggering a particular kind of bond, called CoCos, which are designed for such eventualities. But the bank does risk losing confidence, as it fights to reach a settlement with US authorities for financial misconduct. The threat of a large fine from the US Department of Justice is unnerving some investor, with the DoJ suggesting $14bn - compared to Deutsche Bank\u2019s provision of just $6.1bn.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

That is causing unjustified concerns. We should consider this in the context of the bigger picture: Deutsche Bank overall has more than 20 million clients.<br><br>I understand if you feel concerned by the extensive coverage on this issue. <strong>Our bank has become subject to speculation. Ongoing rumours are causing significant swings in our stock price.</strong><br><br>It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business. Trust is the foundation of banking. Some forces in the markets are currently trying to damage this trust.<br><br>Deutsche Bank has strong fundamentals. Let me mention some of the most important facts at this point:<br></p> <ol> <li><strong>We fulfil all current capital requirements and our restructuring is well on track.</strong> We completed the disposal of the British insurer Abbey Life this week and the sale of our stake in the Chinese Hua Xia Bank will be finalised soon. This will further improve our capital ratio.</li> <li><strong>We have significantly decreased our market and credit risk in recent years</strong>. At no point in the last two decades has the balance sheet of Deutsche Bank been as stable as it is today.</li> <li><strong>Despite low interest rates and a difficult environment we posted a pre-tax profit of about 1 billion euros in the first half of 2016.</strong> Before extraordinary items like restructuring costs, we earned about 1.7 billion euros. This demonstrates the operating strength of Deutsche Bank.</li> <li><strong>In a situation like this, the most important factor is our liquidity reserves</strong>. Currently they still amount to more than 215 billion euros. This is an extremely comfortable buffer. This is clear proof of how conservatively we have planned. This is acknowledged by numerous banking analysts.</li> </ol> <p>There is therefore no basis for this speculation. Nor can uncertainty about the outcome of our litigation cases in the US explain this pressure on our stock price, <strong>if we take the settlements of our peers as a benchmark.</strong><br><br>You have all done a tremendous job over the past few days.

      "bodyText": "When Nissan\u2019s chief executive warned this week that the car company\u2019s future in Britain was not assured in the event of a hard Brexit, it was viewed by some as proof that leaving the European single market would not just cost British jobs but also devastate whole communities. But in Washington, Sunderland, where most of Nissan\u2019s 8,000 UK employees live and work, there was little sign of panic on Friday at Carlos Ghosn\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of blackmail, really,\u201d said an engineering consultant, one of 32,000 people supported by the car giant via its supply chain and dealerships. \u201cIt\u2019s just a chance to get a few quid out of the government,\u201d said his friend, who works for a metal fabrication company that has fitted out much of the Washington plant. He was one of 82,934 Mackems who voted to leave the EU, 61% of those who turned out in Sunderland. The engineer lives in Boldon, a few miles north of Nissan\u2019s gargantuan complex. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends who work there, from shop floor to management, and I can\u2019t say they seem too perturbed. Every other family in Boldon has someone working there or at one of the tier-one suppliers and they\u2019re not too worried. There\u2019s no mass panic.\u201d Nonetheless, the men believed the government could not afford to play a game of chicken with Ghosn, who demanded compensation in the event of car exports being subjected to extra duties once Britain leaves the EU. \u201cThey\u2019d have to pay it,\u201d the engineer said. \u201cIt would be devastating for this area if it did close. The government would surely realise it would end up costing them more if they find themselves with 30,000-plus unemployed people who suddenly can\u2019t pay their mortgages. Nissan knows that.\u201d Last year the Washington site, which makes Nissan\u2019s Juke, Note, Qashqai, Infiniti and Leaf models, produced 500,237 vehicles \u2013 one in three UK-made cars. Heading off to start the afternoon shift and assemble a few more models, one production line worker, who has been with Nissan for 18 years, said he was one of just two people in his 40-strong team to vote to stay in the EU. His 21-year-old son, who also works at the plant, voted out. Ghosn\u2019s threats are not empty, he insisted. \u201cI do believe Nissan would go if they don\u2019t get assurances from the government. The business in Sunderland is very modular. Everything can be put on the back of a wagon and shopped to Spain. They are a business trying to make profit. At the end of the day we are just a small cog in a very big machine.\u201d Steve Bush, a Unite trade union representative at the Washington site, said if Ghosn had been clearer about his Brexit stance leading up to the vote it may have changed the local result. In the run-up to the referendum, Ghosn made clear Nissan\u2019s preference was for the UK to remain part of the EU. But he made no threat to transfer production out of the UK \u2013 a position noted by many leave voters the Guardian spoke to in Sunderland just before the vote. Bush said: \u201cIt was the company\u2019s prerogative to be guarded about their position, I suppose. But if they had been a bit more vocal it may have changed the way people voted. There was a very high percentage of people voting to leave the EU which did raise eyebrows because of the investment the area has historically received from the EU. Maybe if they had known the company\u2019s position it could have swayed votes.\u201d In their office on the Turbine business park, round the corner from the Nissan plant, two men in their 50s continued a long-running argument about the EU. Like everyone interviewed for this article, they asked for their names and company to be withheld \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve got a business to run after all,\u201d said the owner \u2013 who when the Guardian visited was completing a commission for one of Nissan\u2019s most valued logistics providers. He voted to stay in Europe; his colleague voted to leave, reasoning: \u201cI voted in 1973 to join the common market, not a European superstate.\u201d The owner said he thought the government should call Nissan\u2019s bluff. \u201cWe have already been decimated with the pits and shipyards closing down. It\u2019s about time the government actually invested. They should have the balls to say to Nissan, \u2018Fine, you leave. We\u2019ll buy it and we\u2019ll run it.\u2019 I\u2019d like to see that plant wholly UK-owned. Why can\u2019t they step in and say, \u2018Let\u2019s build the best car in the world?\u2019 Why do we have to be held to ransom by these fellas?\u201d",

He was one of 82,934 Mackems who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-result-live-counting-leave-remain-brain-in-europe?page=with:block-576c6e1ae4b0f43038109672#block-576c6e1ae4b0f43038109672\">voted to leave the EU</a>, 61% of those who turned out in Sunderland.</p> <p>The engineer lives in Boldon, a few miles north of Nissan\u2019s gargantuan complex. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends who work there, from shop floor to management, and I can\u2019t say they seem too perturbed. Every other family in Boldon has someone working there or at one of the tier-one suppliers and they\u2019re not too worried. There\u2019s no mass panic.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/european-customers-boycotting-british-cars-eu-brexit-vote-jaguar-land-rover\">European customers are boycotting British cars, says Jaguar Land Rover boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, the men believed the government could not afford to play a game of chicken with Ghosn, who demanded compensation in the event of car exports being subjected to extra duties once Britain leaves the EU. \u201cThey\u2019d have to pay it,\u201d the engineer said. \u201cIt would be devastating for this area if it did close. The government would surely realise it would end up costing them more if they find themselves with 30,000-plus unemployed people who suddenly can\u2019t pay their mortgages. Nissan knows that.\u201d</p> <p>Last year the Washington site, which makes Nissan\u2019s Juke, Note, Qashqai, Infiniti and Leaf models, produced 500,237 vehicles \u2013 one in three UK-made cars. <br></p> <p>Heading off to start the afternoon shift and assemble a few more models, one production line worker, who has been with Nissan for 18 years, said he was one of just two people in his 40-strong team to vote to stay in the EU. His 21-year-old son, who also works at the plant, voted out. Ghosn\u2019s threats are not empty, he insisted. \u201cI do believe Nissan would go if they don\u2019t get assurances from the government. The business in Sunderland is very modular. Everything can be put on the back of a wagon and shopped to Spain. They are a business trying to make profit. At the end of the day we are just a small cog in a very big machine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436da25fac5b5ada1d7c9be73af7215303395990\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436da25fac5b5ada1d7c9be73af7215303395990/0_267_4784_2869/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Ghosn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the run-up to the referendum, Ghosn made clear Nissan\u2019s preference was for the UK to remain part of the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Piermont/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steve Bush, a Unite trade union representative at the Washington site, said if Ghosn had been clearer about his Brexit stance leading up to the vote it may have changed the local result. In the run-up to the referendum, Ghosn made clear Nissan\u2019s preference was for the UK to remain part of the EU. But he made no threat to transfer production out of the UK \u2013 a position <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/sunderland-how-labour-city-became-one-of-the-uks-most-eurosceptic\">noted by many leave voters</a> the Guardian spoke to in Sunderland just before the vote.</p> <p>Bush said: \u201cIt was the company\u2019s prerogative to be guarded about their position, I suppose. But if they had been a bit more vocal it may have changed the way people voted. There was a very high percentage of people voting to leave the EU which did raise eyebrows because of the investment the area has historically received from the EU. Maybe if they had known the company\u2019s position it could have swayed votes.\u201d<br></p> <p>In their office on the Turbine business park, round the corner from the Nissan plant, two men in their 50s continued a long-running argument about the EU. Like everyone interviewed for this article, they asked for their names and company to be withheld \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve got a business to run after all,\u201d said the owner \u2013 who when the Guardian visited was completing a commission for one of Nissan\u2019s most valued logistics providers.</p> <p>He voted to stay in Europe; his colleague voted to leave, reasoning: \u201cI voted in 1973 to join the common market, not a European superstate.\u201d </p> <p>The owner said he thought the government should call Nissan\u2019s bluff. \u201cWe have already been decimated with the pits and shipyards closing down. It\u2019s about time the government actually invested. They should have the balls to say to Nissan, \u2018Fine, you leave. We\u2019ll buy it and we\u2019ll run it.\u2019 I\u2019d like to see that plant wholly UK-owned. Why can\u2019t they step in and say, \u2018Let\u2019s build the best car in the world?\u2019 Why do we have to be held to ransom by these fellas?\u201d</p>",

Dr Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, also joined senior figures at rival firms in warning that a hard Brexit would damage the car industry, which supports around 800,000 jobs. Speaking at the Paris Motor Show, Speth said JLR\u2019s European sales team have reported customers turning their noses up at British cars after the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThey have the very first customers in their showrooms [who] clearly highlight that they don\u2019t want to buy British products any more,\u201d he said. But he warned that the car industry would feel the pinch much more in the event of a hard Brexit that results in tariffs being slapped on to goods traded with the EU. He said carmakers would face a double whammy as import tariffs force up the cost of the parts they buy from Europeans and higher export tariffs make JLR vehicles less affordable for Europeans. \u201cIf we face higher tariffs than anybody else, then it\u2019s quite clear that it\u2019s reducing the competitiveness of our products, especially in Europe,\u201d said Speth. He said the exact cost to JLR could not be calculated, although reports this summer suggest that the firm believes it would miss out on \u00a31bn in profit over 10 years if UK goods incur tariffs at the World Trade Organisation rate of 10%. Speth said JLR had not changed its investment plans in the light of Brexit, but hinted that the company may have to spend its money elsewhere. \u201cWe have to realign all of our thinking and work on how to handle this Brexit best,\u201d said the German. Asked if that could include investment, he said: \u201cEverything.\u201d Speth\u2019s comments echoed similar warnings from a host of carmakers and the industry\u2019s trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, said he could scrap a potential new investment in the UK\u2019s biggest car plant in Sunderland if the government refuses to pledge compensation for any post-Brexit tariffs. Toyota also warned that tariffs would hurt its UK production, while Volkswagen-owned \u0160koda called for swift clarity on the details of Brexit. The SMMT also called on the government to do something to prevent an exodus of the UK\u2019s largely foreign-owned car firms. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: \u201cThe government must do all it can to maintain the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector, which has been hugely successful in boosting exports, creating jobs and generating economic growth in recent years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy was stronger than initially thought in the run-up to the EU referendum, growing by 0.7% in the second quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. Separate figures from the ONS suggested the economy got off to a decent start in the third quarter, with the services sector growing by 0.4% in July, a month after the Brexit vote. Services account for almost 80% of the UK economy. The ONS said there was no sign that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU triggered an immediate shock to the economy, but it was waiting for the full picture to emerge. Economists largely agree that while Britain will almost certainly avoid a recession this year, the economy is likely to slow in 2017 as businesses and consumers grapple with heightened uncertainty. Here is a roundup of economists\u2019 reaction to the latest figures. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to forecasters EY Item Club \u201cConsumers did most of the heavy lifting that supported the upward revision of GDP in the second quarter. More importantly, the services sector showed a 0.4% increase in output in July, a very strong out-turn which should end any fears that GDP will contract in the third quarter. \u201cOur short-term model suggests that we are now on track to see GDP growth in the region of 0.2-0.3% in the third quarter. The economy looks to be in much better shape than many had feared it would be as we move towards the fourth quarter. The latest data supports our above-consensus view that the economy will grow by 1.9% this year. And with activity carrying more momentum than anticipated, there is the chance of an upside surprise for 2017.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCooper \u201cToday\u2019s data confirmed the generally favourable picture of how the UK economy evolved immediately before and after the Brexit vote. \u201cWe do still expect some moderation in GDP growth later this year and in 2017 as increased uncertainty acts as a drag on business investment, but there are no signs yet of the Brexit vote pushing the UK into recession.\u201d Scott Corfe, director at the Centre for Economics and Business Research \u201cThere is very little evidence of a slowdown in the UK economy either prior to or immediately after the Brexit referendum. A recession will almost certainly be avoided this year. \u201cHaving said that, 2017 is set to be a challenging year in Cebr\u2019s view, with economic growth expected to slow from about 2% this year to close to 0.5%. Economic growth has been partly driven by UK consumers becoming less cautious and saving less. This could easily unravel in the face of headwinds that cause consumers to adopt a more cautious attitude \u2013 such as the significant degree of economic uncertainty that is likely to be seen over the coming years, both Brexit-related and otherwise.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics \u201cThe jump in services output in July is the clearest sign yet that the Brexit vote has not pushed the economy into a recession. Since the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee expected GDP growth to slow to 0.2% in the third quarter, considerable doubt is now cast over whether the MPC will cut interest rates again in November. \u201cA strong case remains, however, for expecting the economic recovery to slow ahead. Surveys show clearly that businesses are holding back from investment, while households will soon be hit by a rebound in inflation due to sterling\u2019s depreciation.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight \u201cNews that services output grew 0.4% month-on-month in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote is a significant boost to third quarter growth prospects; consequently we are lifting our third quarter growth estimate to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3%. \u201cNevertheless, we expect the economy will find growth increasingly difficult over the coming months, particularly in 2017, although it will most likely dodge recession. We expect the economy to suffer as the uncertainties facing businesses and consumers are magnified by the triggering of Article 50. Additionally, the fundamentals for consumers will likely increasingly weaken as their purchasing power is diluted by rising inflation and muted earnings growth. Furthermore, the labour market looks likely to soften in 2017.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics \u201cAlthough the incoming economic data has suggested that the immediate economic impact of Brexit has not been as severe as some had expected, growth still looks to have slowed markedly in the third quarter. Survey measures point to quarterly growth of only a bit above zero. \u201cNonetheless, with another cut in interest rates likely when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets again on 3 November, and some easing in the fiscal squeeze set to be announced later that month in the autumn statement, we don\u2019t think that the economy is headed into a more pronounced downturn. We maintain our view that GDP will expand by a subdued, but above-consensus 1.5% in 2017.\u201d Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank \u201cThe more interesting release was the monthly services output data for July. Representing around three quarters of the economy, this was the first official output data for the sector to cover the post Brexit vote period. \u201cServices grew by 0.4% month-on-month, well above consensus, with the prior month also revised up for good measure. So despite the Brexit vote and the anxiety surrounding it, it was business as usual in the services sector.\u201d",

And with activity carrying more momentum than anticipated, there is the chance of an upside surprise for 2017.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>John Hawksworth, chief economist at accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCooper</strong></h2> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s data confirmed the generally favourable picture of how the UK economy evolved immediately before and after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>\u201cWe do still expect some moderation in GDP growth later this year and in 2017 as increased uncertainty acts as a drag on business investment, but there are no signs yet of the Brexit vote pushing the UK into recession.\u201d </p> <h2><strong>Scott Corfe, director at the </strong><strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThere is very little evidence of a slowdown in the UK economy either prior to or immediately after the Brexit referendum. A recession will almost certainly be avoided this year.</p> <p>\u201cHaving said that, 2017 is set to be a challenging year in Cebr\u2019s view, with economic growth expected to slow from about 2% this year to close to 0.5%. Economic growth has been partly driven by UK consumers becoming less cautious and saving less. This could easily unravel in the face of headwinds that cause consumers to adopt a more cautious attitude \u2013 such as the significant degree of economic uncertainty that is likely to be seen over the coming years, both Brexit-related and otherwise.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>The jump in services output in July is the clearest sign yet that the Brexit vote has not pushed the economy into a recession. Since the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee expected GDP growth to slow to 0.2% in the third quarter, considerable doubt is now cast over whether the MPC will cut interest rates again in November. </p> <p>\u201cA strong case remains, however, for expecting the economic recovery to slow ahead. Surveys show clearly that businesses are holding back from investment, while households will soon be hit by a rebound in inflation due to sterling\u2019s depreciation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight</strong></h2> <p>\u201cNews that services output grew 0.4% month-on-month in July in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote is a significant boost to third quarter growth prospects; consequently we are lifting our third quarter growth estimate to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter from 0.3%.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, we expect the economy will find growth increasingly difficult over the coming months, particularly in 2017, although it will most likely dodge recession. We expect the economy to suffer as the uncertainties facing businesses and consumers are magnified by the triggering of Article 50. Additionally, the fundamentals for consumers will likely increasingly weaken as their purchasing power is diluted by rising inflation and muted earnings growth. Furthermore, the labour market looks likely to soften in 2017.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics</strong></h2> <p>\u201cAlthough the incoming economic data has suggested that the immediate economic impact of Brexit has not been as severe as some had expected, growth still looks to have slowed markedly in the third quarter. Survey measures point to quarterly growth of only a bit above zero.</p> <p>\u201cNonetheless, with another cut in interest rates likely when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets again on 3 November, and some easing in the fiscal squeeze set to be announced later that month in the autumn statement, we don\u2019t think that the economy is headed into a more pronounced downturn. We maintain our view that GDP will expand by a subdued, but above-consensus 1.5% in 2017.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe more interesting release was the monthly services output data for July. Representing around three quarters of the economy, this was the first official output data for the sector to cover the post Brexit vote period. </p> <p>\u201cServices grew by 0.4% month-on-month, well above consensus, with the prior month also revised up for good measure. So despite the Brexit vote and the anxiety surrounding it, it was business as usual in the services sector.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Crisis talks between Monarch Airlines, aviation regulators and the company\u2019s financial backers are under way in a last-ditch effort to extend the firm\u2019s licence to fly package-holiday customers. Monarch\u2019s owner, Greybull Capital, is trying to put together a multimillion-pound funding package to prove to regulators the airline has the money to continue operating. The Luton-based firm, which has been operating since 1968, has until midnight to show it can keep flying for three months, a condition attached to the award of the Air Travel Operators\u2019 Licence (Atol). An Atol offers passengers financial protection in the event an airline goes under, ensuring they are not stranded abroad. Theoretically, even if it does not secure a licence extension, Monarch could continue to carry passengers who have only booked a flight because airlines are only required to offer Atol protection on package holidays, not flight-only purchases. One option could involve the Civil Aviation Authority granting a temporary extension to Monarch\u2019s Atol, if it can show a funding package is near completion. Marc Meyohas, one of the two brothers behind Greybull, a fund that specialises in buying distressed businesses, is understood to be personally involved in talks. Monarch\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, representatives from the CAA and the airline\u2019s law firm, Freshfields, are also part of the negotiations. Greybull has been trying to get funding from banks and other stakeholders to avoid having to shoulder the entire burden of any new funding for the airline, in which it holds a 90% stake. The CAA has granted a temporary stay of execution before: Monarch secured a three-week extension two years ago, when Greybull bought it from Switzerland\u2019s Mantegazza family. Rumours that Monarch was on the verge of collapse surfaced last weekend, when planespotters noticed that a United Airlines plane had been put on standby to repatriate passengers on Monarch\u2019s Mallorca-to-Manchester route. Monarch has said it is trading well but that its stakeholders are discussing a significant investment to help it ride out difficult market conditions. The Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which owns Hainan Airlines, has expressed interest in Monarch, which has blamed industry difficulties on terrorist attacks, the Brexit vote and the fall in the pound. Monarch\u2019s 2,800 staff took pay cuts of up to 30% and accepted hundreds of redundancies when a rescue deal with Greybull was agreed. The Pension Protection Fund owns the other 10% of the airline.",

That was the main message of the economic data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which included the first piece of hard evidence of how the UK performed after the 23 June vote to leave the EU. The ONS said the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the UK economy, expanded by 0.4% in July, a month in which surveys showed business and consumer confidence crashing and the financial markets in turmoil. In the circumstances, that\u2019s a pretty impressive performance and analysts are already revising up their forecasts for growth in the third quarter. On the basis of still limited evidence, they are penciling in 0.4-0.5%. Hopes of avoiding a recession were also strengthened by the upward revision to growth in the second quarter, from 0.6% to 0.7%. The economy had plenty of momentum before the Brexit vote, and while it is likely to slow in the second half of 2016 there will not be the necessary two consecutive quarters of falling output to fulfil the technical definition of a recession. Much less welcome for the government was the news that Britain\u2019s balance of payments deficit, which stood at an alarming 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016, widened in the second quarter. A deterioration in the UK\u2019s trade performance was largely responsible for the country diving deeper into the red, with the scale of the deficit highlighting the unbalanced nature of the economy. Put simply, domestic producers are unable to keep up with consumer demand. The fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote will make exports a bit more competitive and will check consumer spending by making imports dearer. But turning round the balance of payments is a huge challenge, and would have been even had the vote in the referendum gone the other way. In terms of policy, the post-Brexit resilience will make the Bank of England think twice before cutting interest rates again in November from the already record low of 0.25%. Threadneedle Street may want to keep its powder dry for later, leaving the field clear for the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Stimulus in the autumn statement still looks probable despite the upbeat growth news. That\u2019s because the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote will have more of an impact on longer-term business decisions than on consumer spending. Hammond would be well-advised to pause deficit reduction for the two-year period when the UK is negotiating the terms of Brexit, using the extra \u00a330bn headroom to finance public investment. That would provide double benefit: it would ensure that the economy continued to grow, and it would make that growth less unbalanced.",

Average house prices increased by 0.3% this month to \u00a3206,015, following a 0.6% rise in August. It brought the annual pace of growth down to 5.3% in September from 5.6% a month earlier. The figures are the latest evidence that the Brexit vote in June has so far failed to trigger the collapse in consumer confidence feared by many. In the run-up to the referendum, remain backers including the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said a vote to leave the EU could lead to a crash in house prices. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe relative stability in the rate of house price growth suggests that the softening in housing demand evident in recent months has been broadly matched on the supply side of the market. \u201cWhile new buyer enquiries have remained fairly subdued, the number of homes on the market has remained close to all-time lows, in part due to low rates of construction activity.\u201d On a regional basis, house price growth was strongest in the London commuter belt, with annual prices up 9.6% in the third quarter. The market was weakest in Wales over the period, with prices down 0.5%. Gardner said that while new home building was rising, the rate of growth was too slow to meet the needs of a swelling population. \u201cThe major housebuilders appear to have capacity to expand output, with most reporting land banks that could support around five years\u2019 worth of construction at current rates of building activity. However, there is a risk that the uncertain economic outlook may weigh on activity in the period ahead.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s vast services sector defied gloomy expectations to continue growing after the Brexit vote and the economy was expanding faster than previously thought in the run-up to the referendum. The first official figures on how the biggest sector of Britain\u2019s economy fared after the decision to leave the EU, showed services output rose 0.4% in July, improving on June\u2019s growth of 0.3%. That was at odds with business surveys of the sector, which includes government services, retail and banking. They had suggested it suffered an initial slump after the referendum before rebounding in August. But the Office for National Statistics said there was little sign of a referendum blow. \u201cDespite some very weak indicators appearing in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, estimates gathered by ONS from more than 23,000 firms now suggest that the services sector \u2013 which accounts for three-quarters of the economy \u2013 in fact grew strongly in July,\u201d said the statistics office\u2019s head of GDP, Darren Morgan. \u201cFurther information also suggests that the whole economy also grew slightly more strongly in the months before polling day than previously thought. \u201cTogether this fresh data tends to support the view that there has been no sign of an immediate shock to the economy, although the full picture will continue to emerge.\u201d As part of data released on Friday, the ONS revised up its estimates for GDP growth in the second quarter to 0.7% from 0.6% previously. It was still a slowdown compared with the first quarter however, when the economy grew by 0.8%. Consumers continued to drive much of the growth in the second quarter, but there were renewed signs households were eating into savings to fund their spending. The savings ratio \u2013 the share of households\u2019 income they do not spend \u2013 fell to its lowest since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. But business investment grew by more than previously thought in the quarter, suggesting companies were not as nervous about spending before the referendum as economists had feared. Chancellor Philip Hammond seized on the latest figures as evidence the economy entered the post-referendum period uncertainty enjoying solid growth. \u201cThe UK started the year in a position of economic strength, and we can see today that this momentum has continued in the services sector \u2013 the largest part of our economy,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe want to build on this strength as we forge a new relationship with the EU and deliver an economy that works for all.\u201d The figures will cast doubt on whether the Bank of England will follow through on hints at another interest rate cut before the end of the year. Amid downbeat signals on the referendum\u2019s impact on business and consumer sentiment, its monetary policy committee (MPC), led by governor Mark Carney, cut official borrowing costs to 0.25% and expanded the Bank\u2019s electronic money printing programme in August. They signalled at the time and again this month that rates could be cut further to 0.1%. Reacting to the latest data, Samuel Tombs, at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said: \u201cThe jump in services output in July is the clearest sign yet that the Brexit vote has not pushed the economy into a recession.\u201d He predicted that growth would still slow in the third quarter, the months of July to September, probably to about 0.5%. But that may not be enough of a deterioration to prompt more Bank of England action. \u201cSince the MPC expected GDP growth to slow to 0.2% in the third quarter, considerable doubt is now cast over whether the MPC with cut interest rates again in November,\u201d Tombs added. Alan Clarke, head of European fixed income strategy at Scotiabank, said much would depend on the official estimate of third quarter GDP growth released at the end of October. Growth of just 0.1% would prompt more action from the MPC, growth of 0.4% or more would make policymakers sit tight. \u201cSadly we fear that growth will be in that awkward middle ground of 0.2-0.3% which makes calling the next move tricky,\u201d he added. Despite the stronger-than-expected services data, the ONS warned against reading too much into one month\u2019s figures and economists highlighted potential challenges ahead for the UK as it embarks on Brexit negotiations. Some drew attention to the latest figures on the UK\u2019s trading position released with the GDP report. The current account deficit widened from \u00a327bn in the first quarter to \u00a328.7bn in the second, or 5.9% of GDP. The current account deficit reflects Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. The British Chambers of Commerce said the latest figures underscored how trade was a big drag on growth for the UK even before the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe pick-up in growth in the second quarter is likely to be as good as it gets for some time, with the mounting economic and political uncertainty weighing heavily on the UK\u2019s near-term growth prospects,\u201d said Suren Thiru, the group\u2019s head of economics.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have dropped sharply, with banking shares among the main losers after continuing concerns about Deutsche Bank. But outsourcing group Capita takes the wooden spoon, down another 27p or nearly 4% to 671p as analysts issued negative notes in the wake of Thursday\u2019s shock profit warning which lead to a near 27% slump in the shares. The company blamed Brexit jitters, problems with the London congestion charge contract and a contractual dispute with the Co-operative Bank. Analysts at Stifel said: It is clear from [the] profit warning that some of Capita\u2019s woes are deep-rooted and structural in nature. This will take time to rectify. On our revised estimates and at the intraday price, the shares are trading on little more than 10 times 2017 estimated earnings, at a deep discount to the 10 year through the cycle average of 16.8 times. However, given the scale of Capita\u2019s problems, the risk of litigation, restructuring costs still to be defined and possible action to strengthen the balance sheet, we think this is reasonable with the share price likely to be volatile. Investec said: Given the sharp de-rating, instinctively we want to turn more positive on the stock, particularly as on our forecasts the company will delever. However, the lack of top-line visibility and possible risk of a capital raise gives an asymmetric pay-off and we remain at hold with a lower 750p target price. Shore Capital moved from hold to sell: Whilst we have harboured concerns in our research for some time over the level of growth driven by acquisitions, sustainable margins and growing debt levels, we were nonetheless surprised by the timing of yesterday\u2019s profits warning. The specific\u2019s and \u2018one-offs\u2019 that Capita point to as being primarily responsible only point to some of the issues that the group faces in our view, but these still point to some worrying strategic failures. We are particularly concerned by what we consider to be under-investment in organic development, such as in the education platform and addressing the digital opportunity in recruitment and sourcing \u2013 has this been at the expense of prioritising acquisitive growth? We view Capita as a services conglomerate following the disparate acquisitive activity of the last several years (we note the group has acquired around \u00a32.0bn in revenue since 2010, with revised revenues forecast for this year now at \u00a34.9n, group revenues in 2011 were \u00a32.9bn). We believe that effective service delivery needs focus, but it can be scaled, as Capita has shown in the past. Looking to \u2018Brexit\u2019 as being a cause of Capita\u2019s woes, our view is that this has likely hasted and accelerated trends already in play in the business. Michael Donnelly at Panmure Gordon said: Our anti-consensus sell case on Capita in January 2016 was predicated on four concerns that, we contested, made the shares far riskier than at any point hitherto. We said that Capita felt \u201cincreasingly like the last man standing\u201d. Not anymore. The shares fell throughout the first half of 2016, leading us, incorrectly, to believe that those concerns might be in the price. We were wrong. As, it would appear, was almost everyone else. We sat through the excruciating, hour-long analyst call post the profit warning yesterday; a call that addressed precisely none of these four issues. The four issues, according to Panmure, are balance sheet concerns with possible write-downs and the prospect of a cash call; the quality of earnings; concerns about acquisitions including recent reseller purchase Trustmarque (Donnelly said: \u201cThe conference call led us to believe that the resellers causing the problem were those acquired since 2008 and not Trustmarque acquisition - so the Trustmarque warning, presumably, has yet to come.\u201d); and a too-high valuation. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 85.10 points at 6834.32 despite better than expected UK GDP figures. Among the banking shares caught in the slipstream of Deutsche Bank\u2019s decline, Barclays is down 5.65p at 161.65p while Lloyds Banking Group is 1.38p lower at 54.11p and Royal Bank of Scotland has fallen 4.4p to 172.7p. Mining shares are also weaker, with Glencore down 6.95p at 208.9p and Anglo American 27.8p lower at 952.3p. But precious metal miners are bucking the trend as investors seek havens amid the declines. Randgold Resources has risen 100p to \u00a379.85 while Fresnillo is up 16p at \u00a318.26.",

We view Capita as a services conglomerate following the disparate acquisitive activity of the last several years (we note the group has acquired around \u00a32.0bn in revenue since 2010, with revised revenues forecast for this year now at \u00a34.9n, group revenues in 2011 were \u00a32.9bn). We believe that effective service delivery needs focus, but it can be scaled, as Capita has shown in the past. Looking to \u2018Brexit\u2019 as being a cause of Capita\u2019s woes, our view is that this has likely hasted and accelerated trends already in play in the business.</p> </blockquote> <p>Michael Donnelly at Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our anti-consensus sell case on Capita in January 2016 was predicated on four concerns that, we contested, made the shares far riskier than at any point hitherto. We said that Capita felt \u201cincreasingly like the last man standing\u201d. Not anymore. The shares fell throughout the first half of 2016, leading us, incorrectly, to believe that those concerns might be in the price. We were wrong. As, it would appear, was almost everyone else. We sat through the excruciating, hour-long analyst call post the profit warning yesterday; a call that addressed precisely none of these four issues.</p> </blockquote> <p>The four issues, according to Panmure, are balance sheet concerns with possible write-downs and the prospect of a cash call; the quality of earnings; concerns about acquisitions including recent reseller purchase Trustmarque (Donnelly said: \u201cThe conference call led us to believe that the resellers causing the problem were those acquired since 2008 and not Trustmarque acquisition - so the Trustmarque warning, presumably, has yet to come.\u201d); and a too-high valuation.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 85.10 points at 6834.32 despite better than expected UK GDP figures. Among the banking shares caught in the slipstream of Deutsche Bank\u2019s decline,<strong> Barclays</strong> is down 5.65p at 161.65p while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is 1.38p lower at 54.11p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland </strong>has fallen 4.4p to 172.7p.</p> <p>Mining shares are also weaker, with <strong>Glencore</strong> down 6.95p at 208.9p and <strong>Anglo American</strong> 27.8p lower at 952.3p.</p> <p>But precious metal miners are bucking the trend as investors seek havens amid the declines. <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> has risen 100p to \u00a379.85 while <strong>Fresnillo</strong> is up 16p at \u00a318.26.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Swedish fashion chain H&amp;M has said profits in the third quarter were hit by a combination of hot weather, increased markdowns and a stronger dollar. The retailer said the autumn trading season got off to a tough start because exceptionally hot September weather in the UK and other European countries put people off buying warmer clothing and led to increased discounting. A stronger dollar also pushed costs up over the quarter. Pre-tax profit fell 9.2% to 6.3bn kronor (\u00a3567m) between 1 June and 31 August, falling short of analysts\u2019 expectations. Sales including VAT rose 6% to 56.8bn kronor. Karl-Johan Persson, H&amp;M\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cSales were good in most of the markets up until mid-August. Thereafter sales were negatively affected by unseasonably hot weather which continued into September, resulting in a challenging start to the autumn season. \u201cThe sales performance in the third quarter and increased markdowns due to a higher opening stock than planned had a negative impact on profit development. In addition, profits continued to be negatively affected by the strong US dollar effect on purchasing costs.\u201d Sales including VAT in the first nine months of H&amp;M\u2019s financial year increased by 5% to 161.8bn kronor. Pre-tax profit fell 17% to 16.6bn kronor. H&amp;M has a total of 4,135 stores, with 271 in the UK. The UK was the retailer\u2019s third largest market in terms of sales in the first nine months of the year, behind Germany and the US. UK sales including VAT slipped to 11.05bn kronor from 11.6bn kronor a year earlier. Persson said big investment in IT and new brands had \u201cburdened\u201d profits for a long time but was necessary to create the basis for sustainable and profitable growth. H&amp;M \u2013 whose other brands include Cos and &amp; Other Stories \u2013 is planning to introduce one or two new brands in 2017. \u201cBuilding on this base, we can now continue to develop and strengthen the shopping experience within a number of different areas such as continued integration of stores and online, expanded and faster delivery options and mobile payment solutions,\u201d Persson said. \u201cAll of this \u2013 combined with the fact that the fast pace of investment is to some extent gradually starting to subside \u2013 gives us a positive view of our opportunities for 2017 and going forward, both in terms of sales and profitability.\u201d The company declined to give any details on the new brand launches planned for next year. Nils Vinge, head of investor relations at H&amp;M, suggested price competition was mounting among retailers: \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen in the past couple of weeks competitors and peers getting panicked and starting their mid-season sale before the season even started.\u201d The retailer is planning to launch an online shop in Canada and South Korea during autumn 2016. By the end of the year, H&amp;M will have online shops in 35 markets and stores in 64 markets. It will have opened about 425 new stores by the end of the current financial year, and entered three new markets \u2013 Puerto Rico, Cyprus and New Zealand. In 2017 the fashion brand plans to open stores in four to five new markets, including Colombia, Iceland and Kazakhstan. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said they were concerned about the longer-term outlook for H&amp;M\u2019s like-for-like sales, \u201cdue to more challenging markets, increased price competition and a lower structural boost now from the rollout of online sales\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is giving more prominence to NatWest, the bank it bought more than 15 years ago, in a move that further signals its break from the Fred Goodwin era. RBS is to rebrand its investment banking arm \u2013 already much diminished from Goodwin\u2019s time \u2013 NatWest Markets, which itself had a troublesome history when it was part of the former NatWest group. Customers of the bailed-out bank in England and Wales will see the NatWest brand, although Scottish customers will continue to use RBS-branded branches. RBS logos will be removed from the bank\u2019s offices in the City of London, at 280 and 250 Bishopsgate, and replaced with NatWest branding. The address 250 Bishopsgate used to belong to ABN Amro, the Dutch bank bought by RBS just as the banking crisis began. The changes are being announced by the 73% taxpayer-owned bank as it outlines how it will implement the ringfencing rules born out of the Vickers commission and intended to help avoid bailouts in the future. Under these rules, high-street operations must be ringfenced from the potentially more risky investment banking arms. This requires a complex legal restructuring, under which all the retail banking customers will be held under a holding company called NatWest Holdings Ltd \u2013 a move that puts more emphasis on the name of the bank that RBS took over in February 2000 after a hostile bid. NatWest Holdings will house high-street customers of NatWest, RBS, Ulster Bank and its brands for wealthier customers such as Coutts, Drummonds, Holt\u2019s and Adams &amp; Co. In a further complication, the banking licence for Adams &amp; Co will technically be the one used for retail customers of RBS. Under the current structure, RBS retail and investment banking customers are all handled through the same entity. The use of Adams &amp; Co means customers will not have to be handed new sort codes. The announcement that RBS is pressing on with the ringfence \u2013 which must be completed by the start of 2019 \u2013 comes amid turbulence in financial markets sparked by fears about the ability of Deutsche Bank to pay a $14bn (\u00a311bn) penalty from US regulators. It evokes memories of the crisis that hit the markets eight years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed and eventually led, in October 2008, to a bailout for RBS. It also comes as Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, begins his fourth year running a bank that has incurred \u00a352bn of losses since taxpayers pumped in \u00a345bn to keep it afloat. He has distanced the bank from the empire-building of Goodwin, who left after the bailout and after plastering the RBS logo across Formula One cars and Edinburgh airport. \u201cThe future ringfenced structure of the bank is not only designed to be in compliance with the new regulatory requirements and objectives, but will better reflect who we are as a bank and what we stand for: a bank that is focused on its customers,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cOur proposed future structure under the ringfencing legislation and our brand strategy are key elements of the bank we are becoming.\u201d Last week, RBS began a new advertising campaign, which signalled that the NatWest brand would be given more prominence in England and Wales and set out that in Scotland it would be known as \u201cThe Royal Bank\u201d. The situation has been complicated by the failure of RBS to sell off the 300 branches it was required to by the EU as a penalty for state aid. These Williams &amp; Glyn branches are supposed to be sold by the end of next year, although McEwan warned this week that the bank faced uncharted territory if it failed to do so.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last year\u2019s budget deficit has improved by $340m, helped largely by a $1.3bn delay in major government partnerships that could push spending into the next budget cycle. The 2015-16 final budget outcome, released on Friday, showed a $39.6bn underlying cash deficit, or 2.4% of gross domestic product. Net government debt has risen to $296.4bn, or 18% of GDP, an increase of $10.7bn compared with the estimate in the 2016-17 budget. The $340m improvement in the bottom line was caused by government spending being $1.6bn lower than expected, however revenue was also down $1.1bn on what was expected in the 2016-17 budget. Lower revenue was due to tax receipts falling $2.5bn, including company tax receipts down $1.8bn, income tax down $1.3bn and GST down $350m. Non-tax receipts increased by $1.4bn due to larger than expected recoveries from states and territories in relation to aged-care programs. The tax receipt write-downs add further weight to the fact decreases in revenue have contributed to budget deficits, which the treasurer, Scott Morrison, has grudgingly accepted constitutes an \u201cearnings problem\u201d. The future fund earned $190m more than was expected at the 2016-17 budget. Of the $1.6bn decrease in spending, $1.3bn was \u201cdue to delays in the achievement of project milestones under a range of national partnership agreements, including the asset recycling initiative\u201d. Those delays could push spending into the 2016-17 financial year, putting pressure on this year\u2019s budget. On Friday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the outcome showed \u201cthe government is continuing to repair the budget by lowering the spending growth trajectory of the previous Labor government\u201d. Morrison defended his decision to only give Victoria $877m in federal funds from the asset recycling scheme rather than the $1.45bn the state government expected. In 2015-16, real GDP rose 2.9%, up from the 2.5% forecast in the 2016-17 budget. \u201cThe stronger growth was the result of larger than expected contributions from net exports, public final demand and dwelling investment,\u201d the final budget outcome paper said. \u201cThese factors, together with steady growth in household consumption, more than offset the impact on the economy of declining mining investment.\u201d In fiscal balance terms, the 2015-16 final budget outcome improved by $2.0bn compared with the fiscal balance deficit estimated at the time of the 2016-17 budget. That was due to $1.3bn lower revenue, $2.8bn lower expenses and $526m lower net capital investment. Before the 2015-16 budget the then Abbott government had promised to increase investment to help reach a global growth target of 2%. The final budget paper attributed that difference to lower interest rates increasing the market value of government securities. In a speech to the Lowy Institute on Friday, Morrison said that government debt was growing at the rate of $1.4bn a week. He criticised Labor for proposing to increase the deficit by $16.5bn. \u201cJust raise taxes or borrow more, what could possibly go wrong?,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A slump in home ownership and less generous pensions have left those born in the early 1980s with only half the wealth of those born a decade earlier by the same stage of their lives. In fresh evidence of the UK\u2019s growing inter-generational divide, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has reported that people in their early 30s had average net household wealth of \u00a327,000 from equity in their homes, the value of their pensions and other financial investments. The thinktank said that those who were born in the early 1970s had accumulated household wealth of \u00a353,000 by similar stage. It added that children of the 70s were themselves notably less wealthy than those born in the early 1960s. Theresa May highlighted the problems young people face in buying their own home in her list of injustices to be tackled when she became prime minister. The House of Commons work and pensions select committee is conducting an inquiry into \u201cintergenerational fairness\u201d, which will investigate the issues the IFS has raised. The report found that those born during the early 1980s were the first postwar generation not to enjoy higher incomes in early adulthood than those born in the previous decade. \u201cAt the age of 30, the average income of the 1960s cohort was more than \u00a35,000 a year higher than the average income of the 1950s cohort, and the average income of the 1970s cohort was more than \u00a37,000 a year higher than the average income of the 1960s cohort\u201d, the IFS report said. \u201cBy contrast, the average incomes of those born in the early 1980s have been similar to those of the 1970s cohort at the same age throughout their working-age lives so far, and are now, if anything, slightly lower.\u201d Stagnant incomes and rising property prices have made it more difficult for young people to get on the housing ladder, the IFS said. By their early 30s, at least 55% of those born in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s had bought their own homes, but this has dropped to 40% for those born in the early 1980s. The last cohort to have a similar homeownership rate at the same age was children born in the 1930s. Members of \u201cgeneration rent\u201d also spend more of their income on housing costs than those who are homeowners. With ultra-low interest rates reducing the cost of servicing a mortgage, a homeowner in their late 20s spends around 15% of their household income on housing costs, while those renting spend 30%. Changes in pensions have also hurt those born since the 1970s, with a marked decline in defined benefit final salary schemes for those not working in the public sector. The IFS said that less than 10% of private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme, compared with more than 15% of those born in the 1970s and nearly 40% of those born in the 1960s. Recent changes have seen workers automatically enrolled into defined contribution schemes, which has meant younger cohorts have higher membership of pension schemes than their predecessors, but on less generous terms. Andrew Hood, an author of the report and an IFS research economist, said: \u201cSharp falls in home-ownership rates and in access to generous company pension schemes, alongside historically low interest rates, will make it much harder for today\u2019s young adults to build up wealth in future than it was for previous generations.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "'Should I start with my Thatcher quotes?' Gina Rinehart charms David Flint in video interview", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gina Rinehart really likes Margaret Thatcher. She also likes Ronald Reagan and in a bizarre 25-minute video interview she shares her page of quotes on each to the chortled delight of prominent Australian conservative David Flint. \u201cSo should I start with my Thatcher quotes?\u201d she asks, before rattling off six Thatcherisms and concluding that she was \u201ca very clever lady, did much for her country\u201d. Another seven quotes, attributed to Reagan, follow. Flint beams. Flint\u2019s face is the only live video component of the interview. It took place last month while Rinehart was in Rio for the recent Olympics and the Skype connection between Flint\u2019s office and Rinehart\u2019s car, he told Guardian Australia, wasn\u2019t strong enough to sustain a video signal. It went without saying that you do not ask Rinehart, Australia\u2019s richest woman with a fortune of $8bn built off iron ore mines in Western Australia and Queensland, to hover under the Wi-Fi of her hotel. The interview began with a brief discussion about how terribly well Australia always does in the Olympics and how much we punch above our weight (although the 2016 medal haul was deemed the worst in decades). It then moved, rather abruptly, to over-regulation, the change in topic heralded by a clipart of BIG GOVERNMENT with a line through it on the right hand side of the screen. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would agree, Mrs Rinehart, that there must be something done to get rid of this waste and duplication,\u201d Flint says, before throwing to the first quote from former US president Ronald Reagan. Rinehart does agree and is very pleased that he\u2019s mentioned Reagan, as it permits her to answer with a quote of her own. \u201cHe also said that government\u2019s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidise it.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Rinehart had quotes on hand specifically in preparation for this interview or whether she carries them on her person at all times. Regulation and Australia\u2019s alleged determination to curb the growth of successful businesses, ie Hancock Prospecting, the mining company founded by her father which she now heads, is a favourite topic of Rinehart\u2019s. The interview moves to the \u201cextraordinary number of permits and licences\u201d needed for Hancock\u2019s Roy Hill iron ore mine near Port Hedland in Western Australia (more than 4,000, she says) to the number needed in its Gailee Basin coal mine in Queensland (more than 5,000), before moving on to her plan for a special economic zone across all of Northern Australia to promote investment. Most of Australia\u2019s resource wealth is located in northern Australia, as are some of its most significant environmental and Indigenous heritage. But, Rinehart said, people need incentives to do business there. \u201cIf a special economic zone worked as I do believe it would in the north then hopefully we could extend it further south,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cIt could certainly have benefits for an even wider area of Australia.\u201d Flint has the perfect example of an effective incentive in the decision of former Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to abolish the death tax. They pause to praise Bjelke-Petersen as a premier who \u201chad money in the kitty when he left,\u201d somehow neglecting to mention the royal commission, the ministers jailed for corruption and the perjury charge. While they talk, the right hand side of the screen provides a constant stream of messages in the form of bad graphics: NATIONAL DEBT, a soldier on a horse holding the Australian flags, COMPETITIVE PRICING, cows, milk, the word COSTS being cut with scissors, another pair of scissors slicing through red tape. The video interview series is a relatively new venture for Flint. The prominent legal academic and constitutional monarchist has become more known in recent years for his conservative political commentary and a YouTube channel was probably a natural progression. It arose out of a conversation Flint had with a man named Alan Metcalfe in Perth several years ago. Metcalf is the chief executive of Safeworlds TV, an internet broadcasting venture that the Queensland-born Christian apparently started in 1983, then repurposed in the 1990s as a way to rebuild Russia, and now sees as a \u201cdigital Noah\u2019s Ark\u201d to help preserve \u201cthe prominently Christian middle class\u201d. It looks exactly as you would imagine an internet broadcasting venture started in 1983 to look. According to its own website it hasn\u2019t quite got off the ground. Nevertheless, it does have offices on the Gold Coast in Queensland and a contractor in Baltimore, in the US, which Flint says handles the production of the video after he has prepared his interview questions and made the Skype call. Flint said he saw the series as speaking to a section of society that are no longer represented by the mainstream media, which he said had moved to the left and created \u201ca distinct gap for conservative views\u201d. \u201cWe do get them now that the Australian has swung back.\u201d Past interviewees include the Australian\u2019s political editor, Dennis Shanahan; Family First senator Bob Day; Christian Democratic Party leader Fred Nile; and senator Pauline Hanson. His list of ideal future interviewees are the \u201ccourageous\u201d Hanson, again, and her One Nation stablemate, senator Malcolm Roberts. \u201cMalcolm Roberts is very interesting, very interesting \u2026 I would very much like to talk to him,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Gina Rinehart really likes Margaret Thatcher. She also likes Ronald Reagan and in a bizarre <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvKMfe2Lhek\">25-minute video interview</a> she shares her page of quotes on each to the chortled delight of prominent Australian conservative David Flint.</p> <p>\u201cSo should I start with my Thatcher quotes?\u201d she asks, before rattling off six Thatcherisms and concluding that she was \u201ca very clever lady, did much for her country\u201d.</p> <p>Another seven quotes, attributed to Reagan, follow. Flint beams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/27/climate-change-challenge-to-gina-rineharts-alpha-mine-dismissed-by-court\">Climate change challenge to Gina Rinehart\u2019s Alpha mine dismissed by court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Flint\u2019s face is the only live video component of the interview. It took place last month while Rinehart was in Rio for the recent Olympics and the Skype connection between Flint\u2019s office and Rinehart\u2019s car, he told Guardian Australia, wasn\u2019t strong enough to sustain a video signal.</p> <p>It went without saying that you do not ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/gina-rinehart-gives-way-to-blair-parry-okeden-as-australias-wealthiest-person\">Rinehart, Australia\u2019s richest woman with a fortune of $8bn</a> built off iron ore mines in Western Australia and Queensland, to hover under the Wi-Fi of her hotel.</p> <p>The interview began with a brief discussion about how terribly well Australia always does in the Olympics and how much we punch above our weight (although the 2016 medal haul was <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2016/s4524940.htm\">deemed the worst in decades</a>).</p> <p>It then moved, rather abruptly, to over-regulation, the change in topic heralded by a clipart of BIG GOVERNMENT with a line through it on the right hand side of the screen. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would agree, Mrs Rinehart, that there must be something done to get rid of this waste and duplication,\u201d Flint says, before throwing to the first quote from former US president Ronald Reagan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/19/gina-rineharts-office-says-offer-to-build-darwin-cancer-hospital-hasnt-been-scrapped\">Gina Rinehart's office says offer to build Darwin cancer hospital hasn't been scrapped</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rinehart does agree and is very pleased that he\u2019s mentioned Reagan, as it permits her to answer with a quote of her own. </p> <p>\u201cHe also said that government\u2019s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidise it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s unclear whether Rinehart had quotes on hand specifically in preparation for this interview or whether she carries them on her person at all times.</p> <p>Regulation and Australia\u2019s alleged determination to curb the growth of successful businesses, ie Hancock Prospecting, the mining company founded by her father which she now heads, is a favourite topic of Rinehart\u2019s.</p> <p>The interview moves to the \u201cextraordinary number of permits and licences\u201d needed for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/21/gina-rinehart-secures-funding-to-operate-her-own-iron-ore-mine\">Hancock\u2019s Roy Hill iron ore mine</a> near Port Hedland in Western Australia (more than 4,000, she says) to the number needed in its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/04/appeal-against-gina-rineharts-alpha-mine-dismissed-but-project-claimed-unviable\">Gailee Basin coal mine in Queensland</a> (more than 5,000), before moving on to her plan for a special economic zone across all of Northern Australia to promote investment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/gina-rineharts-children-win-right-to-fight-case-against-her-in-open-court\">Gina Rinehart's children win right to fight case against her in open court</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of Australia\u2019s resource wealth is located in northern Australia, as are some of its most significant environmental and Indigenous heritage. But, Rinehart said, people need incentives to do business there. </p> <p>\u201cIf a special economic zone worked as I do believe it would in the north then hopefully we could extend it further south,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cIt could certainly have benefits for an even wider area of Australia.\u201d</p> <p>Flint has the perfect example of an effective incentive in the decision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/10/guardianobituaries.australia\">former Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a> to abolish the death tax. They pause to praise Bjelke-Petersen as a premier who \u201chad money in the kitty when he left,\u201d somehow neglecting to mention the royal commission, the ministers jailed for corruption and the perjury charge.</p> <p>While they talk, the right hand side of the screen provides a constant stream of messages in the form of bad graphics: NATIONAL DEBT, a soldier on a horse holding the Australian flags, COMPETITIVE PRICING, cows, milk, the word COSTS being cut with scissors, another pair of scissors slicing through red tape.</p> <p>The video interview series is a relatively new venture for Flint. The prominent legal academic and constitutional monarchist has become more known in recent years for his conservative political commentary and a YouTube channel was probably a natural progression. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/gina-rinehart-gives-way-to-blair-parry-okeden-as-australias-wealthiest-person\">Gina Rinehart gives way to Blair Parry-Okeden as Australia's wealthiest person</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It arose out of a conversation Flint had with a man named Alan Metcalfe in Perth several years ago. </p> <p>Metcalf is the chief executive of Safeworlds TV, an internet broadcasting venture that the Queensland-born Christian apparently started in 1983, then <a href=\"http://www.identitynetwork.net/apps/articles/default.asp?articleid=71902\">repurposed in the 1990s as a way to rebuild Russia</a>, and now sees as a \u201cdigital Noah\u2019s Ark\u201d to help preserve \u201cthe prominently Christian middle class\u201d.</p> <p>It looks exactly as you would imagine an internet broadcasting venture started in 1983 to look.</p> <p><a href=\"http://safeworlds.net/index.html\">According to its own website</a> it hasn\u2019t quite got off the ground.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it does have offices on the Gold Coast in Queensland and a contractor in Baltimore, in the US, which Flint says handles the production of the video after he has prepared his interview questions and made the Skype call.</p> <p>Flint said he saw the series as speaking to a section of society that are no longer represented by the mainstream media, which he said had moved to the left and created \u201ca distinct gap for conservative views\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe do get them now that the Australian has swung back.\u201d</p> <p>Past interviewees include the Australian\u2019s political editor, Dennis Shanahan; Family First senator Bob Day; Christian Democratic Party leader Fred Nile; and senator Pauline Hanson. </p> <p>His list of ideal future interviewees are the \u201ccourageous\u201d Hanson, again, and her One Nation stablemate, senator Malcolm Roberts.</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm Roberts is very interesting, very interesting \u2026 I would very much like to talk to him,\u201d he said.</p>",
