Anything below 50 indicates a contraction and this is the third month in a row this has happened.

It was not just manufacturing which was struggling last month, with the service sector expanding at its slowest pace in nearly seven years. Last month, the Chinese central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to try to bolster the country\u2019s flagging economy, and analysts believe further stimulus measures may be necessary.

      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s review of whether to move its headquarters out of the UK will be in focus on Monday when it reports its results for the first nine months of the year. The results will be scrutinised for any update on the bank\u2019s views on whether to remain in London, where it has been based since moving from Hong Kong to facilitate the takeover of Midland bank in 1992. Britain\u2019s biggest bank caused a political row when it announced in Aprilit was formally reviewing whether to retain its headquarters in Canary Wharf, because the announcement came in the middle of campaigning for the May general election. Stuart Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, has indicated the board will make a decision at the end of the year and has published 11 factors it will consider during the review, which include the government\u2019s tax policy and attitude to financial services companies. He has already embarked on a plan intended to bolster returns for shareholders that involves cutting 25,000 jobs around the world, including up to 8,000 in the UK, and selling off underperforming international operations. Since HSBC announced the review \u2013 delayed from its usual three-year cycle because the regulatory overhaul \u2013 a number of changes have been made. The bank levy has been watered down and replaced with an eight percentage point surcharge on corporation tax, which is regarded as beneficial to HSBC in the longer term. HSBC paid about \u00a3700m a year in bank levy, more than other bank, because of the size of its balance sheet. Clarifications have also been made about the way the rules on ringfencing banks\u2019 high street operations from the riskier investment banking businesses are being operated. Among them is how much influence the parent company would have over the ringfenced bank which housed the high street customers. Douglas Flint, HSBC\u2019s chairman, told the Financial Times recently that the self-imposed deadline to make a decision by year-end could move. HSBC is not the only internationally focused bank to report results this week. Standard Chartered is scheduled to report on Tuesday amid speculation that could tap its shareholders for cash to bolster its balance sheet. The results are the last ones before the Bank of England publishes its annual check-up of banks\u2019 financial health on 1 December. This year\u2019s assessments are focused on international scenarios which are expected to put more focus on Standard Chartered and HSBC than last year\u2019s stress tests.

    "webTitle": "UK losing millions in VAT from non-EU sellers on Amazon and eBay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK is expected to lose tens of millions of pounds in VAT avoidance and evasion this Christmas as a growing number of non-EU sellers, including hundreds from China, increasingly dominate sales of popular gifts on Amazon and eBay. \u201cThere has been a huge increase in this trade which is very difficult to control,\u201d a senior Brussels source told the Guardian. \u201cThe system is so complicated it\u2019s open to abuse.\u201d Customs officers are aware that some overseas sellers are under-declaring the value of goods shipped to the UK and other European destinations in order to qualify for VAT exemptions on low-value packages. \u201cYou\u2019re getting packages which the [online] customer might have paid \u20ac100 [\u00a370] for. And they\u2019re coming in [through customs] identified as \u20ac20, or as gifts. And that\u2019s the abuse,\u201d said the source, who has close knowledge of the subject. This deception benefits the seller because lower-value goods \u2013 less than \u20ac22 in most EU member states and \u00a315 in the UK \u2013 are exempt from VAT. Growing numbers of businesses from China are using Chinese-run warehouses in UK port cities as staging posts, allowing them to offer eBay and Amazon shoppers rapid delivery as well as competitive prices. In many instances, sellers are not disclosing VAT numbers in their eBay and Amazon listings. When asked by a customer for a VAT receipt, several have simply replied that they do not apply the tax. All overseas businesses selling on eBay and Amazon must apply VAT on their UK sales from the moment they start selling to customers in Britain, regardless of how low their turnover is in the UK. VAT can be avoided only if items are sold from outside the EU, are genuinely low-value and are imported in small packages already addressed to individual consumers. The Guardian has seen evidence of Chinese sellers on eBay giving invalid VAT numbers as well as sharing, or cloning, numbers belonging to other businesses, all of which suggests there may be serious compliance failures or fraud. Evidence was shown to eBay, which said cases highlighted by the Guardian would be discussed with HM Revenue &amp; Customs. \u201ceBay reminds all its users of their need to comply with their legal obligations and we also provide helpful guidance on VAT through our policies and help pages,\u201d the company said. \u201cIf eBay sellers are found to be breaching UK VAT compliance rules, we will cooperate with HMRC in all cases where HMRC provides evidence of underpayment of taxes.\u201d Amazon said sellers on its site were \u201cindependent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations\u201d. It added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs.\u201d Amazon argued that sellers using its site were not required to post their business details or VAT numbers on Amazon.co.uk. Instead they can meet EU seller disclosure rules by making the information available in an email to customers or in a paper invoice delivered with goods bought. Brussels sources disagreed, insisting EU rules required that customers be informed of seller details before making a purchase. \u201cIn practice, for sales via online marketplaces, the information must be provided on the website,\u201d one source said. Both eBay and Amazon said they had no obligation to police VAT compliance by sellers using their sites, and no liability in cases in which sellers are found to have committed VAT fraud. Richard Allen of Ravas, a tax fairness campaign group which represents UK small traders, said: \u201cThe systematic abuse of the VAT system results in damaging price distortions that drive legitimate UK businesses to the wall, and workers out of their jobs.\u201d His members have spent months cataloguing evidence of suspected VAT abuses and have passed on their findings to senior Whitehall and Brussels officials. Brussels sources told the Guardian that out-of-date VAT rules were too complex and ill-suited to the internet age. An overhaul including the removal of low-value exemption is planned, but it will be years before some changes come into force. About a dozen member states are understood to have informally clubbed together to explore interim measures they can take to cope with the rapid rise of non-EU sellers, many offering VAT-free prices. British customs officers have tried to increase scrutiny of small package imports in the last year, but they are under pressure to prioritise the monitoring of imports for terrorism threats, drugs and counterfeit goods. Official estimates suggest the number of small packages shipped into Europe more than quadrupled from 26m in 2000 to 115m two years ago. The figure is thought to have climbed further since then, in line with e-commercewhich grew by an estimated 14% last year. A report for the European commission in May estimates that more than \u20ac500m a year is being lost to member states because of the huge volumes of packages qualifying for the low-value VAT exemption. This estimate did not factor in the possibility many importers might be under-declaring the value of goods.

      "body": "<p>The UK is expected to lose tens of millions of pounds in VAT avoidance and evasion this Christmas as a growing number of non-EU sellers, including hundreds from China, increasingly dominate sales of popular gifts on Amazon and eBay.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThere has been a huge increase in this trade which is very difficult to control,\u201d a senior Brussels source told the Guardian. \u201cThe system is so complicated it\u2019s open to abuse.\u201d<br></p> <p>Customs officers are aware that some overseas sellers are under-declaring the value of goods shipped to the UK and other European destinations in order to qualify for VAT exemptions on low-value packages.<br></p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting packages which the [online] customer might have paid \u20ac100 [\u00a370] for. And they\u2019re coming in [through customs] identified as \u20ac20, or as gifts. And that\u2019s the abuse,\u201d said the source, who has close knowledge of the subject. This deception benefits the seller because lower-value goods \u2013 less than \u20ac22 in most EU member states and \u00a315 in the UK \u2013 are exempt from VAT. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Growing numbers of businesses from China are using Chinese-run warehouses in UK port cities as staging posts, allowing them to offer eBay and Amazon shoppers rapid delivery as well as competitive prices.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In many instances, sellers are not disclosing VAT numbers in their eBay and Amazon listings. When asked by a customer for a VAT receipt, several have simply replied that they do not apply the tax.</p> <p>All overseas businesses selling on eBay and Amazon must apply VAT on their UK sales from the moment they start selling to customers in Britain, regardless of how low their turnover is in the UK.</p> <p>VAT can be avoided only if items are sold from outside the EU, are genuinely low-value and are imported in small packages already addressed to individual consumers. </p> <p>The Guardian has seen evidence of Chinese sellers on eBay giving invalid VAT numbers as well as sharing, or cloning, numbers belonging to other businesses, all of which suggests there may be serious compliance failures or fraud.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Evidence was shown to eBay, which said cases highlighted by the Guardian would be discussed with HM Revenue &amp; Customs. <br></p> <p>\u201ceBay reminds all its users of their need to comply with their legal obligations and we also provide helpful guidance on VAT through our policies and help <a href=\"http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/questions/what-rules-selling-items.html\">pages</a>,\u201d the company said. \u201cIf eBay sellers are found to be breaching UK VAT compliance rules, we will cooperate with HMRC in all cases where HMRC provides evidence of underpayment of taxes.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Amazon said sellers on its site were \u201cindependent businesses responsible for complying with their own VAT obligations\u201d. It added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the authority to review their tax affairs.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Amazon argued that sellers using its site were not required to post their business details or VAT numbers on Amazon.co.uk. Instead they can meet EU seller disclosure rules by making the information available in an email to customers or in a paper invoice delivered with goods bought. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Brussels sources disagreed, insisting EU rules required that customers be informed of seller details before making a purchase. \u201cIn practice, for sales via online marketplaces, the information must be provided on the website,\u201d one source said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Both eBay and Amazon said they had no obligation to police VAT compliance by sellers using their sites, and no liability in cases in which sellers are found to have committed VAT fraud. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Richard Allen of <a href=\"http://www.ravas.org.uk/\">Ravas</a>, a tax fairness campaign group which represents UK small traders, said: \u201cThe systematic abuse of the VAT system results in damaging price distortions that drive legitimate UK businesses to the wall, and workers out of their jobs.\u201d His members have spent months cataloguing evidence of suspected VAT abuses and have passed on their findings to senior Whitehall and Brussels officials.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Brussels sources told the Guardian that out-of-date VAT rules were too complex and ill-suited to the internet age. An overhaul including the removal of low-value exemption is planned, but it will be years before some changes come into force.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>About a dozen member states are understood to have informally clubbed together to explore interim measures they can take to cope with the rapid rise of non-EU sellers, many offering VAT-free prices.</p> <p>British customs officers have tried to increase scrutiny of small package imports in the last year, but they are under pressure to prioritise the monitoring of imports for terrorism threats, drugs and counterfeit goods.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/common/publications/studies/lvcr-study.pdf\">Official estimates</a> suggest the number of small packages shipped into Europe more than quadrupled from 26m in 2000 to 115m two years ago. The figure is thought to have climbed further since then, in line with e-commercewhich grew by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ecommerce-europe.eu/press/2015/european-e-commerce-turnover-grew-by-14.3-to-reach-423.8bn-in-2014\">an estimated 14%</a> last year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/common/publications/studies/lvcr-study.pdf\">A report</a> for the European commission in May estimates that more than \u20ac500m a year is being lost to member states because of the huge volumes of packages qualifying for the low-value VAT exemption. This estimate did not factor in the possibility many importers might be under-declaring the value of goods. As a result, the true losses to governments could be much higher.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cAlready this is a problem that is there and it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s getting bigger,\u201d said the Brussels source.<br></p> <p>eBay sales of items ranging from Android phones and balance scooters to iPad covers and bike lights are already dominated by Chinese sellers, according to the latest sales analytics data.

      "bodyText": "When Chris Sheldrick ran a business organising music events, he repeatedly came across the same problem: getting equipment to the right place at the right time. In London, this meant the drivers could end up at one of the 17 other entrances to Wembley stadium rather than the one they were supposed to be at, while in Dubai, they could get lost by turning at the wrong landmark. After trying and failing with GPS coordinates, Sheldrick sought to find a simpler mapping system. The answer came by using three random words strung together to divide the entire globe, oceans included, in three-metre-by-three-metre squares. Under the existing system, the postcode for No 10 Downing Street is SW1A 2AA. Under Sheldrick\u2019s what3words, it is variously \u201conions.warned.picked\u201d, \u201cslurs.this.shark\u201d or \u201cinput.caring.brain\u201d, depending on which particular square of the prime minister\u2019s residence is chosen. One part of Buckingham Palace is \u201cgown.allows.erase\u201d while the Palace of Westminster is \u201cthink.sunk.gifted\u201d. \u201cIf you go to the rural parts of the UK, you have got a \u2026 problem in that a lot of places don\u2019t have a street number, and you rely on a postcode which takes you to the area and then you get stuck,\u201d Sheldrick said. \u201cIf you are in the Italian mountainside or Dubai or Qatar, you will find that whilst Italian addresses are quite ropey, in Dubai and Qatar they are pretty bad, and it is very landmark driven. [With] the suppliers, if you are dealing with more than one person, you can be guaranteed that X percent will not make it on time.\u201d The system was thought up and developed via a mixture of pragmatism and maths. Sheldrick said the smallest practical area for a phone\u2019s GPS to operate on was a square of three metres by three metres, within which area a destination can easily be found. The number of squares of this size that cover the world comes to 57 trillion. In order to come up with a different combination of three words for each, 40,000 words are needed. To put this in context, the Oxford English dictionary has over 171,000 words. Each of the 40,000 words used in the what3words system is ranked (offensive words and homophones are omitted), so that the shorter and more memorable words are used in places such as city centres. Longer and more obscure words are used in remote places. One of the coordinates in the midst of the Pacific ocean is \u201ccommands.tempo.testimonial\u201d while \u201cscrapings.stressed.rampage\u201d is in the Atlantic. \u201cThe most important thing for us is that people can remember them short-term. It is something that you can hear and see quickly and transfer in everyday communications. I think long-term memory is a bonus. You will probably remember your home and your office and another three-word combination, but we don\u2019t expect that people will go around with tens or hundreds of these in their long-term memory.\u201d Sheldrick said that another part of the inspiration for the project was his frustration with GPS coordinates, which can have 10 digits, resulting in inputting mistakes. \u201cThe idea for me was that we have got something really great and scientific here in GPS coordinates, but they have not been designed or adapted for universal human use, and that is what I saw is the opportunity. There is a reason that coordinates have been around for ages, but you and I and the people around us don\u2019t say \u2018Great, I will see you for a beer at 28.69 degrees north.\u2019\u201d In the three-word system, if a word is misspelt, the user is sent to another distant location entirely, so that it is clear that a mistake has been made. The company claims that three-quarters of the world has an inadequate addressing system. An NGO working to eradicate malaria in Tanzania has been using the system to map houses that have been visited, while in Brazil a delivery company called Carter Amigo uses it to give people in favelas addresses for online deliveries where previously they would not have had one. The consumer app on a smartphone, where each location can be found and then directions linked, is free. Companies that use the conversion tool in services such as online ordering are charged. Sheldrick admits that a person who lives in a city centre location with an easily accessible address is unlikely to be one of the first users. For those in rural locations, who have had to direct a postman though various winding lanes, this is an opportunity, however. Finding friends at festivals, taxi directions and sourcing remote places in foreign locations are cited as other uses. \u201cIf you are somewhere without an address, you have not got a viable alternative, and none of these people have ever started using GPS coordinates,\u201d he said. The system can work offline and is now in nine languages \u2013 English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swahili, Russian, German, Turkish and Swedish \u2013 although the three-word addresses are not directly translated into each language. Interest in the system has been expressed by companies and groups working in Africa, where there are problems with addresses in both rural and urban areas. Deliveries are typically achieved by navigating around landmarks and directing drivers once they get close to where they are meant to be, said Sheldrick. Where are you? Although the name of every three-metre-by-three-metre square is set randomly, there are some bizarre coincidences. One part of the Palace of Westminster is called \u201creform.speech.debate,\u201d while Sheldrick\u2019s dentist in Queen\u2019s Park in London contains the word \u201cteeth\u201d. One part of Red Square in Moscow is called \u201cbleak.fine.smoking\u201d, a section of the Guardian\u2019s live news desk is \u201cadmiral.news.wakes\u201d, and in the home of Manchester United in Old Trafford can be found something a few fans may find appropriate in recent years: \u201cdizzy.strike.method\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has belatedly jumped on to the retail loyalty card bandwagon with its new Sparks offering, which rewards customers with in-store events, fashion previews and early access to online sales. But maintaining loyalty can be difficult if your website has to shut down for two hours because people can see details of others\u2019 accounts when they log on, as happened to M&amp;S last Tuesday. The company said it was a technical issue rather than a cyber-attack \u2013 like the one that hit TalkTalk \u2013 and had affected only 800 customers. But M&amp;S could do without anything that discourages shoppers to buy its goods, particularly in its clothing range, so any disruptions are bad news. Deutsche Bank is forecasting a 1.5% fall in non-food sales in the second quarter, compared with a 0.4% decline in the first three months. And stockbroker Peel Hunt said: \u201cWe have anecdotally picked up from core shoppers that the product is slipping in quality terms: is M&amp;S finding some of its gross margin gains by compromising the spec of the garments?\u201d Wednesday\u2019s half-year results \u2013 with Deutsche expecting overall profits to fall by 2.7% to \u00a3260m \u2013 should provide some answers. Satellite puts Inmarsat on the right flight path Inmarsat\u2019s third Global Xpress satellite finally made it into orbit in August after delays due to problems with the Russian Proton rockets being used for its launch. That means the group\u2019s \u00a31bn high-speed broadband network \u2013 which required three GX satellites to provide global coverage \u2013 is now complete. The service is due to start by the end of the year. Last month Inmarsat agreed to provide broadband services for Lufthansa\u2019s European fleet, and easyJet and British Airways are also said to be in talks with the company. Credit Suisse analysts said: \u201cWith GX now global we believe Inmarsat will have a sizeable competitive advantage over its peers for at least one to two years.\u201d They expect revenues of $298m (\u00a3192m), up 2.4%, when Inmarsat reports third-quarter results on Friday. This excludes any contribution from its agreement with troubled US group LightSquared, but anticipates a return to growth at the company\u2019s maritime business. \u2018Super Thursday\u2019 unlikely to surprise There are unlikely to be many fireworks from the Bank of England on Thursday, with interest rates expected to be kept on hold at 0.5% yet again. With recent figures showing that GDP growth slowed to a worse-than-forecast 0.5% in the third quarter, and problems globally, the Bank will undoubtedly keep its powder dry. But on so-called Super Thursday, when the Bank releases its rate decision, the minutes of the relevant meeting and its quarterly inflation report all at the same time, there will be much interest in any hints about when it might finally sanction dearer borrowing costs. The monetary policy committee was split eight to one in favour of keeping rates on hold last time, and a similar outcome is expected this week. But most economists believe the Bank will move early next year. Howard Archer at IHS Economics said: \u201cAn interest rate hike from 0.50% to 0.75% some time in the first half of 2016 currently still looks more likely than not to us. This is based on our belief that the UK will see some improvement in growth from its third quarter slowdown and that consumer price inflation will start rising gradually from late 2015. We also expect earnings growth to strengthen further, although this will likely be partly offset by a further pick-up in productivity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Those of us who have opposed George Osborne\u2019s austerity policies throughout can take some comfort from two successive events on either side of the Atlantic. The first was the resounding victory of Trudeau the younger\u2019s Liberal party in Canada on an unashamedly Keynesian, anti-austerity electoral platform. The second has been the way that the chancellor (indeed chancer) of the exchequer received his come-uppance from the House of Lords over his dishonourable programme of drastic reductions in tax credits. First, some background. Hardly anybody can be found these days who will say that they ever thought the Labour party stood a chance of winning under Ed Miliband. Yet David Cameron was sufficiently concerned to call a referendum on our membership of the European Union in order to ward off a threat from Ukip that might well have let Miliband in. It is a direct result of Cameron\u2019s panic about Ukip that he is now wasting everyone\u2019s time preparing for a diversionary British referendum. This is at a time when the European Union is facing an existential crisis over the migration issue and the appalling reaction of extreme rightwing \u2013 indeed neo-fascist \u2013 movements in several European countries: not least, alas, in Germany, whose leaders since the war have worked so hard to avoid any recrudescence of the 1930s. Cameron is asking Angela Merkel for help out of his self-inflicted jam; he ought to be helping her in a migration crisis that threatens dire things \u2013 and not just for her reputation. Warding off Ukip was vital for the Tories, as was the low turnout among the disaffected young. This disaffection was manifested in the election of the anti-austerity Jeremy Corbyn as successor to Miliband. There is, of course, intense speculation about how long Corbyn can stay in place, but his anti-austerity policy has struck a chord, as has shadow chancellor John McDonnell now that he has escaped from the unnecessary bonds of George Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter. Although the government has an unassailable majority in the House of Commons, and the chancellor will no doubt force a heavily revised plan through, it is an interesting moment. Having got away with blue murder with his propaganda that the increase in the budget deficit was caused by the Labour government\u2019s public spending \u2013 of which he had previously approved \u2013 and not by the banking crisis, Osborne has finally discovered that, nauseatingly arrogant though he is, even he cannot walk on water. His reputation for political acumen has been seriously damaged, and it could not have happened to a nicer chancer. The point is that both the austerity policy, and the form it has taken, are the result of political choice. Choosing to impose deflationary measures on an already depressed economy that was just beginning to recover was cavalier, to say the least. And placing some four-fifths of the burden of the austerity programme on public spending cuts was very political indeed. But though this prime minister may talk about \u201cone nation\u201d, and they both go on about helping \u201chard-working families\u201d and the \u201cworking poor\u201d, penalising them is a funny way of doing it. John Le Carr\u00e9 was right, several years ago, to call this \u201cplanned penury\u201d. And Ed Balls was also right to predict, way back in August 2010, that the 2010 budget would have countervailing effects on the recovery Osborne inherited. Before the election Cameron unashamedly promised \u00a38bn of tax cuts while his chancellor was preparing for \u00a312bn of reductions in the welfare budget. Osborne is aiming for a budget surplus not only on day-to-day and year-to-year spending, but also on current and capital (infrastructure!) spending combined. He wants a lower top rate of tax on the backs of people who are struggling. But economists of many persuasions are now pointing out that inequality is having a serious impact on what they call aggregate demand \u2013 ie total spending in the economy \u2013 and, ultimately, economic growth. In his book Capitalism, the Financial Times writer John Plender makes an important point, drawing on an observation by the economist Brian Reading. They note that in the 18th century there was an early version of \u201ctrickle-down\u201d theory, which Ronald Reagan and Mrs Thatcher invoked to justify the redistribution of income in favour of the rich. As Plender writes of the original theory: \u201cIt suffered from the flaw that in a society marked by an uneven distribution of income favouring a numerically small elite, the rich had plenty of spending power to satisfy their desires but not enough buying power to dynamise the economy to its full potential to raise real incomes.\u201d This is what so may \u201cadvanced\u201d economies are experiencing now. As this year\u2019s United Nations Trade and Development Report points out, the share in total income of the richest households has strongly increased in developed countries, \u201cand these households tend to spend less and save more of their incomes than other households\u201d. The situation calls for a rethinking of economic policy here, in continental Europe, and in the US. Let us hope Justin Trudeau and the Canadian Liberals will show the way. I can hear my old friend the late JK Galbraith \u2013 another enlightened Canadian \u2013 applauding from the grave.",
