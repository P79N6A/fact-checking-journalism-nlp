What can the justification for this secrecy be when at the same time the government (and the EU) insist that TTIP is a good deal for all of us? Usually, when an individual or organisation has something that will benefit you, they are eager to tell you about it. With the honourable exception of Caroline Lucas, and I would hope some others, it seems incredible that our MPs either are, or are pretending to be, insouciant to the irony that they are being grudgingly granted limited access only to the details of a treaty that will demote the interests of democratically elected governments below those of multinational corporations. Dave Hunter Bristol \u2022 Since it is being negotiated by the EU rather than the UK, should those opposed to TTIP vote leave? Simon Smewing Lewes, Sussex \u2022 Once again, concern has been expressed about the potential impact of TTIP on the NHS (New trade deal could lock in NHS sell-off, says top lawyer, 22 February), and it is noted that David Cameron has the power to exclude the NHS from the trade deal. Indeed he has. The Lisbon Treaty sets out the conditions under which the European commission conducts trade negotiations. The European council (the body that includes heads of government, and authorises the negotiations and validates the result) acts, in most cases, by qualified majority (at least 55% of members). However, unanimity is required for certain types of trade as specified in Article 207, Paragraph 4: \u201cThe Council shall also act unanimously for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements: (a) in the field of trade in cultural and audiovisual services, where these agreements risk prejudicing the Union\u2019s cultural and linguistic diversity; (b) in the field of trade in social, education and health services, where these agreements risk seriously disturbing the national organisation of such services and prejudicing the responsibility of Member States to deliver them.\u201d So no aspect of TTIP with potential impact on the NHS can take place without the approval of the British government. This responsibility lies firmly in the UK and an unpopular outcome cannot be blamed on Brussels. John Blackman Reading, Berkshire \u2022 I can understand why Unite is concentrating on the NHS, which it hopes will be exempt from TTIP, but the implications go far wider (Report, 22 February). Few commentators seem aware of the negative effect of TTIP on our ability to tackle climate change. Suppose in 10 to 15 years that several fracking firms were operating in the UK and the government decided the continued extraction of shale gas or shale oil were incompatible with our climate change commitments. Under TTIP, those companies could sue the British government and the result would either be massive compensation or the repeal of the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act. The decision will not be taken by politicians, but by unaccountable lawyers meeting in secret and applying the terms of the trade deal. It is significant that Cameron and leaders of the out campaign are united in their admiration for TTIP, but fail to appreciate that it will involve a huge transfer of sovereignty to unaccountable officials. EU plus TTIP will persuade a lot of voters to leave. Cameron needs to look again at this dreadful piece of legislation.

      "bodyText": "The UK is set for another year of record low interest rates, economists have predicted, following news that the dominant services sector suffered a sharp slowdown last month. Worries about the EU referendum, turmoil on financial markets and a faltering global recovery all took their toll on confidence among the UK\u2019s services businesses and knocked their growth to a three-year low, according to a closely watched survey. As interest rates mark their seventh anniversary at the historic low of 0.5% this week, the figures will reassure Bank of England policymakers that they can keep borrowing costs low without fearing a rapid pick-up in inflation. Some economists have even raised the idea of interest rates being cut closer to zero, something the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, has conceded is an option. The services snapshot showed business activity and new work in the UK\u2019s biggest sector, which covers hairdressers to insurers, expanded at the slowest rate since March 2013 when there were fears a fragile economy was about to slip into recession. The report, compiled by data company Markit, chimed with similarly downbeat polls on the UK\u2019s smaller construction and manufacturing sectors earlier this week. Taken together, they pointed to a slowdown in GDP growth and were in territory normally consistent with the Bank cutting interest rates rather than raising them, said Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson. \u201cThe extent of the slowdown will be a shock to policymakers and surely puts to bed any talk of the Bank of England raising interest rates. The focus will instead increasingly shift to whether policymakers may soon need to dig deeper into their toolbox to introduce new measures to shore up the economy with additional stimulus, and what tools might be used,\u201d he said. The survey\u2019s headline measure of activity fell to 52.7 in February, from 55.6 in January. That was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction but well below expectations for a reading of 55.1 in a Reuters poll of economists. That downbeat picture mirrored gloomy growth reports from services companies in China, the US and the eurozone, and underscored fears that demand is waning around the world. Companies in the UK had reported that rising levels of global economic uncertainty had resulted in delays in clients placing new orders, according to Markit. It also cited faltering confidence due to the looming EU referendum on 23 June and noted employment growth slumped to its weakest level in two and a half years in February, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report. \u201cSurvey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of Brexit, financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad,\u201d said Williamson. Investment bank JP Morgan said the services data had prompted it to push back its forecast for an interest rate rise from the final quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2017. \u201cThe timing of this call depends a lot more on two great uncertainties this year: 1) the possibility of Brexit and 2) downside risks to the global outlook,\u201d said Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan. The prospect of low borrowing costs for longer will be welcomed by mortgage holders but will disappoint savers. Analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown suggested seven years of quantitative easing (QE) and record low rates had cost savers an estimated \u00a3160bn. This article was amended on 4 March to remove a reference to shops. While the service sector includes retailers, they are not included in PMI data.",

    "webTitle": "Dobson's switch at Schroders: corporate governance, anyone?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Well played, Michael Dobson, that was a terrific 14-year innings as chief executive of fund manager Schroders, one of the few grand old City names to flourish in the modern world. A loss-making company in 2001 now makes profits of \u00a3600m. Take a bow, throw a party and enjoy your retirement. Hold on, Dobson isn\u2019t retiring at all. He is merely moving into the chairman\u2019s office, a switch that \u2013 as usual on these occasions \u2013 looks like a triumph of chumminess over common sense. There are good reasons why the UK code on corporate governance \u2013 born as a reaction to ancient boardroom scandals like Polly Peck and Maxwell \u2013 states baldly that \u201ca chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company\u201d. One individual can end up with too much power and resist new thinking. Boardroom virtues of independence and openness can be lost. The new chief executive operates under a shadow. Schroders says it seeks \u201cstability and continuity\u201d. Almost any company, after a good run, could make the same plea. They all think their boardrooms contain only strong personalities. It is rarely a persuasive argument. The code, it should be noted, is not an absolute prohibition. Non-compliers are told to consult their major shareholders. But, in Schroders\u2019 case, this is hardly onerous. The family controls 44% of the stock and Bruno Schroder, a board member since 1963, has given a thumbs-up, which will tend to dampen outside dissent. If they really don\u2019t like it, non-family shareholders can sell their shares. But there is wider principle here. Schroders, managing \u00a3313bn of other people\u2019s money, is a firm we expect to read the riot act on governance to quoted companies. That job has just become harder. Schroders says there are cases where, having assessed the merits, it has approved of a chief executive becoming chairman \u2013 for example at Wood Group in 2013. But it was in the oppose camp in 2014 at Experian, the last time this issue blew up at a FTSE 100 company. The point remains. Dobson\u2019s experience may be hard to replicate, but a firm of Schroders\u2019 standing should be able to attract a top-notch chairman who is properly independent \u2013 and see the sense of doing so. Has Costa run out of steam? Little can be read into a single month\u2019s sales figures, said Alison Brittain, chief executive of Whitbread, at the end of last year. Fair enough, a warm November seemed a reasonable explanation for why Costa Coffee\u2019s like-for-like sales growth had slipped to 2.5%, the slowest quarterly increase for five years. But here comes Costa\u2019s latest reading, covering the next 11 weeks to mid-February \u2013 it\u2019s even slower at 0.5%. Brittain is sticking to her line about \u201clower footfall on the high street and an unusually warm winter\u201d but this is starting to look like more like a trend rather than a blip. Maybe the UK is simply saturated with coffee shops. This would not be surprising if the entrepreneurial classes have been reading Whitbread\u2019s accounts. The last set showed a return on capital for Costa of 46.3%, a ratio so fat it invites independent operators to try their luck. The average hipster lacks Costa\u2019s buying clout but the chance of a 20% return on capital, or even 10%, is worth a shot. From Whitbread\u2019s point of view, there is a fair argument that actual growth at Costa \u2013 as opposed to same-store increases \u2013 is more important. On that score, the rate is still 10.5%, so this is a long way from being a crisis. And, anyway, Premier Inn is far more important to Whitbread in profit terms. But you can also understand why Whitbread\u2019s share price has fallen from \u00a354 a year ago to \u00a338, down 6% on Thursday. Costa, having outrun all competitors with ease over the past decade, is suddenly looking tired. Definitely maybe at Hinkley Point Is Hinkley Point, the planned \u00a318bn nuclear power station in Somerset to be built by French firm EDF, a runner or not? Here\u2019s the latest dispatch from the Anglo-French summit: \u201cEDF is currently devoted to prepare [sic] all necessary elements for the announcement of a FID [final investment decision] for Hinkley Point C in the near future, with the full support of the French government.\u201d Top marks for ambiguity and obfuscation. In the mouth of EDF, \u201cin the near future\u201d could mean next year, which is what the latest stories of delays have suggested. Last October, remember, the company said the contract was ready to sign within weeks. As to the actual decision, \u201cFrance and the United Kingdom welcome the major progress made in recent months with a view to confirming the project.\u201d A view to confirming? Call that a definite maybe. It would be funny if our government hadn\u2019t based its entire energy policy for the 2020s on Hinkley and neglected to draw up a back-up plan. The sooner the Hinkley farce is called off, the better.",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of staff at the motor insurer Admiral have been handed bonuses worth \u00a33,600 each amid higher profits due to rising car insurance premiums. The firm\u2019s shares reached a record high on the annual figures, after a year that founder and chief executive Henry Engelhardt termed an \u201cuncut diamond\u201d. Pre-tax profit at the Cardiff-based insurer, which owns brands such as Confused.com and Elephant, rose 6% to \u00a3377m in 2015, on turnover that grew by 8% to reach \u00a32.1bn. Engelhardt said the improvement was partly down to Admiral increasing car insurance rates before the rest of the market, having seen industry-wide rises coming. He said Admiral\u2019s scale allowed it to increase rates more modestly than some rivals, which resulted in a 5% increase in the number of cars covered by the company to 3.3m. \u201cI would describe 2015 as the year of the uncut diamond,\u201d said Engelhardt, who steps down this year. \u201cWhen the year started many people thought it would turn out to be a lump of coal. But no, 2015 was no lumpy coal year.\u201d The absence of lumpy coal meant a windfall for 8,000 staff, who were handed shares worth \u00a33,600 each under a bonus scheme linked to company performance. Shareholders were also rewarded with a total dividend for the year of 114.4p, including a special dividend worth 29.8p per share. It said this was possible thanks to a solvency capital ratio of 206% under new European rules, with 100% meaning a firm has enough cash set aside to cover its costs and risks. \u201cAdmiral continues to benefit from strongly rising prices, rising reserve releases, higher capital buffer returned to shareholders and extremely low investment risk,\u201d analysts at Bernstein said. In a statement that contained few downsides, Admiral said its price comparison business slipped to a loss of \u00a37.2m, having made a profit of \u00a33.6m last year. Its international business also finished the year in the red, to the tune of \u00a322m. Engelhardt is due to step down as chief executive in May, having launched the business in 1993 and floated it on the stock market in 2014. Admiral\u2019s chairman paid tribute to the Chicago-born chief executive\u2019s work in building the company from scratch. \u201cThere is no way to measure adequately the contribution of a founder of a business that has grown from zero to now worth almost \u00a35bn, employs over 8,000 people and serves more than 4 million customers,\u201d Alastair Lyons said. Engelhardt will continue working for Admiral on a part-time basis but will be replaced in the top job by chief operating officer and co-founder David Stevens.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At 09.12am on Wednesday morning Aubrey McClendon, billionaire sports team owner, oil executive and \u201cvisionary\u201d pioneer of the US fracking revolution, \u201cpretty much drove straight into\u201d a bridge on a quiet country road in Oklahoma. His 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe burst into flames instantly killing the 56-year-old executive, who was not wearing a seatbelt. The crash, which did not involve any other vehicles, came just hours after McClendon, was charged by the Justice Department with conspiring to rig bidding for oil and gas contracts over several years. McClendon, who built his former oil company Chesapeake Energy into the US\u2019s second-biggest natural gas producer with seed money of just $50,000, had on Tuesday night vowed to \u201cfight to prove my innocence and to clear my name\u201d. \u201cThe charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,\u201d he said in a statement late on Tuesday night. \u201cI have been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years \u2026 to have been accused of this crime in relation to joint bidding on leasehold. \u201cAnyone who knows me, my business record and the industry in which I have worked for 35 years, knows that I could not be guilty of violating any antitrust laws. All my life I have worked to create jobs in Oklahoma, grow its economy, and to provide abundant and affordable energy to all Americans. I am proud of my track record in this industry, and I will fight to prove my innocence and to clear my name.\u201d McClendon, who leaves behind his wife Katie and their three children Jack, Callie and Will, was charged following a nearly four-year federal antitrust investigation into alleged rigging of drilling rights in rural Oklahoma between at least December 2007 to March 2012. He faced up to 10 years in prison, and a maximum fine of $1m for each violation. The high-rolling businessman \u2013 known across America for his lavish lifestyle including extensive use of private jets, professional basketball team, Bordeaux vineyard and $12m (\u00a38.5m) antique map collection \u2013 was due in court on Wednesday morning. He died before he could appear. Captain Paco Balderrama of Oklahoma City police said McClendon was driving \u201cat a high rate of speed\u201d in a 40mph zone when he \u201cpretty much drove straight into the wall\u201d. \u201cThere was plenty of opportunity for him to correct or get back on the roadway and that didn\u2019t occur,\u201d Balderrama said. The police said they were only able to identify McClendon as the driver after being contacted by the businessman\u2019s personal security guards. Balderrama on Thursday released recordings of 911 calls following the crash. \u201cThe accident looks pretty bad,\u201d one caller said. \u201cIt looks like they swerved and hit [the wall].\u201d The police said it would take at least a week to determine the cause of the crash, which happened eight miles from the offices of American Energy Partners, a company McClendon setup after leaving Chesapeake under a cloud in 2013. Business leaders praised McClendon for his vision and leadership in driving the shale fracking boom and dramatically improving the economic fortunes of Oklahoma. \u201cI\u2019ve known Aubrey McClendon for nearly 25 years. He was a major player in leading the stunning energy renaissance in America,\u201d Texan oil magnate T Boone Pickens said. \u201cHe was charismatic and a true American entrepreneur. No individual is without flaws, but his impact on American energy will be long-lasting.\u201d Activist investor Carl Icahn said McClendon was \u201cone of the brightest men I\u2019ve ever dealt with\u201d. The governor of Oklahoma, Mary Fallin, described him as \u201ca visionary who raised the profile of Oklahoma\u201d. Billy Donovan, the coach of the NBA team Oklahoma City Thunder which McClendon helped buy out and relocate from Seattle to the Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City \u2013 said: \u201cIn situations like this the best thing you can do is just pray, pray for the family and pray for the people involved.\u201d McClendon\u2019s part-purchase of the NBA team, previously known as the Seattle SuperSonics, from Starbucks founder Howard Schultz made him a hate figure in Seattle and is just one of several scandals blotting his staggering success. McClendon, a history graduate, started Chesapeake in 1981 with his friend Tom Ward. The company didn\u2019t really get going until the shale boom struck, which McClendon foresaw, leading him to buy up the rights to huge swaths of land in promising areas. As the company succeeded, McClendon started spending. He bought two of his neighbours\u2019 houses near Oklahoma City, a mansion on Bermuda\u2019s \u201cbillionaire\u2019s row\u201d, and properties in Minnesota, Colorado and Maui. At one point he had wine cellars in three states, which between them contained 100,000 bottles. He also leased a fleet of private planes to transport executives to oil and gas fields \u2013 and to take his family on holiday. One trip taking his family to Amsterdam and Paris cost $108,000 and was listed as a business expense, according to a Reuters report. In 2011 Forbes magazine put McClendon\u2019s face on its cover with the headline: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Reckless Billionaire\u201d. Then it all started to go wrong. Following the 2012 Reuters reports, which included claims that McClendon had personal borrowings of more than $1bn secured on stakes in Chesapeake\u2019s wells, investors raised corporate governance concerns. McClendon was removed as chairman in June 2012, and stood down as chief executive in January 2013 following \u201cphilosophical differences\u201d with the rest of the board. \u201cYou can pick up the paper every day and read something negative about me or about the company,\u201d McClendon said during the media storm of coverage at the time. \u201cI would not have wished the past month on my worst enemy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s economy suffered its worst slump for quarter of a century last year as a global commodity rout, a domestic political crisis and rising inflation forced businesses to slash spending and jobs. Economists warned that the country\u2019s recession had further to run and could deepen amid fresh signs that a drop in demand has continued into 2016. Official figures showed Brazil\u2019s GDP fell 3.8% in 2015, the steepest decline since 1990, when the country was battling hyperinflation. Last year finished on a gloomy note with fourth quarter GDP down 1.4% on the previous quarter against the backdrop of a deepening political corruption scandal. The Brazilian economy is expected to shrink again by more than 3.0% this year, the worst consecutive annual plunges since records began in 1901. Four years ago, the economy was growing by more than 4.0% a year. The gloomy news will raise pressure on President Dilma Rousseff, who is fighting efforts to impeach her over charges that she used money from state-run banks to plug holes in the budget. More timely figures showed the private sector contracted at a record pace last month. The Brazil composite output index, published by data company Markit, dropped to its lowest since the survey began in 2007. The index, which tracks companies across the economy, dropped to 39 in February, marking the 12th month running below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Brazil\u2019s economy had been hit hard by a collapse in commodity and oil prices in the past two years, said Mihir Kapadia, head of Sun Global Investments, an emerging markets wealth management company in London. \u201cThe situation has been made worse by the high debt levels, especially in foreign currency \u2013 essentially in US dollars. Problems of governance, corruption and political issues have created a perfect storm for continued political instability,\u201d Kapadia added. \u201cThings will improve if the recent recovery in oil prices and commodities continues but there are few grounds for great optimism in the short run.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Weaker service sector data from around the globe has left stock markets flagging, despite a fairly stable performance from the oil price (Brent crude is currently down just 0.14% at $36.88 a barrel). From China to the US, service sector companies have reported a slowdown, prompting investors to cash in some of their gains from the recent rally. But there was no panic selling unlike earlier in the year, and the movements were fairly restrained. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 16.6 points or 0.27% at 6130.46 although around 13 points of the fall can be attributed to a number of companies going ex-dividend Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.25% to 9751.92 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.2% at 4416.08 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.78% to 18,348.50 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.03% to 8767.0 In Greece, the Athens market rose 2.91% to 551.36 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 60 points or 0.36%. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019re back tomorrow for, among other things, the latest US non-farm payroll numbers. The US central bank should be patient on raising rates, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan has said. The economic data out today has shown continuing weakness, calling into doubt the idea of a number of rate rises this year after the Fed lifted the cost of borrowing in December. Reuters reports on Kaplan\u2019s speech today: Global factors like the drop in stock markets, the decline in the price of oil, and the rise in the dollar since the beginning of the year are acting like a brake on the U.S. economic recovery, similar to the effect of an interest-rate increase, he said. \u201cWhile I believe that excessive accommodation carries a cost in terms of distortions and imbalances in hiring, asset allocation and investment decisions, I also believe that, at this juncture, the Fed needs to show patience in decisions to remove accommodation,\u201d Kaplan said in remarks prepared for delivery in Austin. The Fed raised interest rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade, and at the time policymakers indicated they thought they would like raise rates four more times over the course of the year... Kaplan said he expects the U.S. economy to be \u201cresilient\u201d this year, with consumer spending buoyed by lower gas prices, among other factors. He forecast about 1.9 percent U.S. GDP growth for this year, enough to push down the unemployment rate, now at 4.9 percent. But, he added, while monetary policy remains accommodative, it is \u201csomewhat\u201d less so than it was at the beginning of the year \u201cin light of tightening global financial conditions.\u201d Back with the weakness in the global economy: Here\u2019s BHS: BHS is threatening to close up to half its shops as the cash-strapped retailer tries to negotiate a reduction in rents with its landlords. It is understood that BHS has told landlords it wants to close between 50 and 60 shops, and could close another 30 if landlords do not reduce the rents. The shop closures would put hundreds of jobs at risk if BHS presses ahead with its threat. An announcement is expected from the company about its plans within days. It is likely that BHS will use a company voluntary arrangement, a type of insolvency proceeding, to close the shops. The retailer is being advised by KPMG, the accountancy firm, and they have been in discussions with landlords for several weeks about how to cut the retailer\u2019s rent bill. Full story here: Breaking news on UK retailer BHS: And in the search for havens amid the market volatility: Meanwhile UK chancellor George Osborne and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble have been talking about Brexit at the British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: The day\u2019s US data has been uniformly poor. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Posting its first contraction since October 2013 the Markit services PMI managed to underperform the already low-bar set by the flash reading, coming in at 49.7 against the 49.8 expected; soon after the ISM non-manufacturing figure slipped month-on-month from 53.5 to 53.4 (admittedly, slightly higher than forecast) with factory orders rising back to 1.6% from -2.9% but crucially failing to match the 2.1% expected. Add onto that the worst jobless claims figure for around 4 weeks and significant miss in the non-farm productivity number, and the Fed was dealt another dovish blow ahead of the central bank\u2019s meeting in a fortnight; we\u2019ll see if the all-important non-farm jobs report adds to that sentiment tomorrow afternoon, with an improvement in the employment change figure (still expected below 200,000) set to be countered by a wage growth tumble. Regardless there was little reason to cheer for the Dow, even with the prospect of no rate hike in the immediate future. And there are some unwanted records: The weak services data shows the US Federal Reserve was too hasty in raising interest rates in December, says David Morrison at Spread Co: The ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI slipped at touch from last month\u2019s reading while Factory Orders came in shy of the consensus expectation. This means that both the services and manufacturing sides of the US economy are showing signs of distress. This provides a good reason for the Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC to row back from its December projection of a full 100 basis points-worth of rate hikes in 2016. However, it also suggests that the Fed\u2019s rate hike at the end of last year is proving to be a big policy error. Nevertheless, investors are unlikely to overreact to today\u2019s data ahead of tomorrow\u2019s all-important Non-Farm Payrolls. More confirmation of weakness in the US services sector, and indeed the US economy. The ISM non-manufacturing index dipped from 53.5 in January to 53.4 last month, although this was slightly higher than the 53.2 figure which had been forecast. The new orders index at 55.5, down from 56.5, is the lowest since March 2014. Recent US economic data has suggested the Federal Reserve may struggle to justify raising interest rates again in the near future. The Markit survey shows a stagnating US economy and there may be worse to come, said the group\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson: Business activity stagnated in February as malaise spread from the manufacturing sector to services. The Markit PMIs are signalling a stagnation of the economy in February, suggesting growth has deteriorated further since late last year. Prices pressures are waning again in line with faltering demand. Average prices charged for goods and services are dropping once again, down for the first time in five months, as firms compete to win new business Worse may be to come, as inflows of new business have slowed sharply, causing backlogs of work across both sectors to fall at the fastest rate seen since the 2008-9 financial crisis. Such weak demand suggests that business activity and price discounting look set to continue. However, perhaps the brightest warning light is the downturn in business optimism to the joint-lowest recorded by the survey, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for trouble ahead. The Markit services PMI is out and contrary to expectations, it has slipped back. The final reading for February has come in at 49.7, down from the initial reading of 49.8 and January\u2019s figure of 53.2. This is the first contraction since since October 2013. US markets have slipped back in early trading, as oil prices edge lower once more. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 26 points or 0.16%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.10% and Nasdaq dipped 0.12%. Brent crude is 0.97% lower at $36.57 a barrel on continuing concerns over a glut of supply and falling demand. Earlier US weekly jobless claims rose to a higher than expected 278,000 from 272,000 the previous week, and higher than the 271,000 forecast. Due shortly are the US service sector figures for February. As with manufacturing there are two rival indices, from Markit and ISM. And as with manufacturing, they may not necessarily be in tandem. Analysts expect the Markit services PMI to edge up from an initial reading of 49.8 for February to 50, but down on the January figure. The ISM non-manufacturing index is forecast to slip from 53.5p to 53. Influential bond trader Bill Gross has launched a scorching attack on the world\u2019s central bankers for driving interest rates into record low territories. In his latest note to clients at Janus Capital, Gross warned that the credit growth that has fuelled the economy for so long could soon fizzle out, much as the sun will (eventually) run dry of hydrogen. Sounding more like a campaigner for financial reform than a Wall Street titan, Gross wrote: Capitalistic initiative married to an ever expanding supply of available credit has facilitated economic prosperity much like the Sun has been the supply center for energy/ food and life\u2019s sustenance. But now with quantitative easing and negative interest rates, the concept of nurturing credit seems to have morphed into something destructive as opposed to growth enhancing. Our global, credit based economic system appears to be in the process of devolving from a production oriented model to one which recycles finance for the benefit of financiers. Making money on money seems to be the system\u2019s flickering objective. Our global financed-based economy is becoming increasingly dormant, not because people don\u2019t want to work or technology isn\u2019t producing better things, but because finance itself is burning out like our future Sun. Gross also took aim at the push into negative interest rates, calling it a \u201ca Zika-like contagion\u201d that has spread from the eurozone to Japan. Stay classy, Bill. And he even touched on speculation that authorities might even abolish cash, to allow rates to be slashed even lower. As Gross puts it: Central bankers seem ever intent on going lower, ignorant in my view of the harm being done to a classical economic model that has driven prosperity \u2013 until it reached a negative interest rate dead end and could drive no more. In addition, government policymakers seem to be setting up future roadblocks for savers. There is a somewhat suspicious uniform attack on high denomination bills of global currencies. Noted economists such as Larry Summers; respected journalists such as the FT\u2019s Gillian Tett, central bankers such as Mario Draghi \u2013 all seem suddenly concerned that 500 euro or 10,000 yen Notes are facilitating drug dealers and terrorists (which they are). But what\u2019s an economist/central banker doing opining on law enforcement? It appears that the one remaining escape hatch for ordinary citizens is being closed. Money in a mattress will heretofore be associated with drugs/terror. The cashless society which appears over the horizon may come sooner than the demise of the penny! More here: Sunshine, Lollipops and\u2026 It\u2019s a double dose of Brazilian gloom! Brazil\u2019s private sector contracted at a record pace last month, suggesting that the slump recorded in 2015 extended int0 2016. Markit\u2019s Brazil Composite Output Index, which tracks companies across the economy, dropped to 39.0 in February, the lowest figure since the survey began in 2007. That\u2019s the 12th month running that the index has fallen below the 50-point mark that splits expansion from contraction. Brazilian companies reported that business activity, new orders and employment all fell sharply last month.\uf0a7 Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, says the picture in Brazil is pretty grim: \u201cThe Brazilian economic downturn took a real turn for the worse in February, as the financial and political difficulties in the country drove down output and led to reduced order intakes. The domestic market is especially weak and this hit service providers hard, with activity and new business in this sector falling at survey record rates. The labour market also appears to be in dire straits, as manufacturers and service providers reported further substantial reductions to headcounts. Back to the UK....and JP Morgan has pushed back its forecast for the first UK interest rate rise, following today\u2019s service sector slowdown. They now think the Bank of England will leave borrowing costs at record lows for another year, and only hike in the first quarter of 2017. Brazil\u2019s economy has suffered its worst 12 months in 25 years. The country\u2019s economy shrank by 3.8% during 2015, new data show, dragged down by the commodity crunch and a deepening political corruption scandal. Stats body IBGE also reported that GDP in the final three months of 2015 was 1.8% lower than in the third quarter. That rounded off a pretty brutal year for Brazil, as this chart from the FT shows: The slump in the prices for iron ore, copper and oil has hurt Brazil\u2019s natural resource companies, forcing them to shed workers. But the problems in Brazil run much deeper, with the political class engulfed by allegations of wrong-doing. President Dilma Rousseff is fighting efforts to impeach her over charges that she used money from state-run banks to plug holes in the budget. That case is making it harder for Rousseff to tackle Brazil\u2019s finances, as hefty spending cuts or tax rises could alienate her supporters. And while growth withers, inflation is running at 11% - despite the central bank keeping interest rates at around 14%. In other news, business secretary Sajid Javid has announced that statutory regulators will be forced to take into account the cost of investigations into possible misconduct. He announced the plan at the British Chambers of Commerce\u2019s annual conference, pitching it as part of a government clampdown on the broader costs of regulation on business. Javid said the new requirement on regulators would help save \u00a310bn from cutting red tape, in addition to the \u00a310bn saved by the previous government between 2010 and 2015. But it sounds like an alarming development, especially for financial regulators, who will be under pressure to delay tackling or even ignore claims of misselling. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, launched a stinging attack on foreign digital businesses that successfully avoid paying corporation tax. He said it was an obligation for companies that earn revenues in the UK to pay tax in the UK. There\u2019s also a lot of discussion about the EU referendum at the BCC event, including an appearance by German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Our Politics Live operation is covering it all, here: And here\u2019s some pessimism from Royal Bank of Scotland, who have crunched the manufacturing data released on Tuesday: Here\u2019s some optimism from Kallum Pickering, economist at Berenberg Bank, who reckons the threats hitting the UK economy are \u2018transitory\u2019: The real problem for the UK is not fundamentals. In fact, a broad range of indicators point to sustained healthy growth in domestic demand; low unemployment, cheap oil, low interest rates and moderate real wage growth. The real problem is that risks appear to be \u2018all or nothing\u2019. Since Autumn of last year the global economy has delivered a treadmill of threats; China slowdown, EM crisis and the EU migrant problem, to name but a few. And in 2016 they have intensified. First, the financial market rout and overstated fears of a global recession hit confidence in January. Then, before consumers and businesses could find their feet again, the date of the EU referendum (June 23) was announced, bringing the reality of a Brexit to the fore. But on the upside, global risks are mostly overstated and are beginning to gradually ease and a Brexit is not our central view. We give a 35% likelihood that the UK votes to leave the EU. In a battle between consistent economic fundamentals and transitory risks (no matter how threatening) the former usually seizes the day, especially in the context of low inflation and dovish central banks. Today\u2019s service sector report follows disappointing data from the manufacturing sector on Tuesday, which showed growth at a 34-month low. Construction firms also had a weak February, as this chart shows: Economists are split over whether the Bank of England will slash interest rates to fresh record lows, in response to these signs of economic slowdown. Independent economist Shaun Richards reckons at least one policymaker will vote for a cut: Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics reckons the BoE will hold its nerve, though. He points to recent falls in sterling (which should push up inflation and help exporters), and the strong jobs market. The service sector slowdown is a \u2018hammer blow\u2019 to Britain\u2019s growth prospects, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. He predicts a sharp slowdown in the current quarter, compared with the 0.5% growth recorded in October-December. We have pencilled in growth of 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, but there look to be downside risks to this \u2013 especially as heightened uncertainty over the EU membership referendum could well foster increasing business and consumer caution. This is uncomfortable news for George Osborne as he readies his March budget. The UK service sector makes up around 70% of the economy, so the scale of the slowdown in February is quite worrying. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First, flags up that many firms are too nervous to expand. \u201cMomentum in services is slowing with everything from Chinese growth concerns, low oil prices, the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership and global market volatility all increasing the level of uncertainty that businesses are feeling. These doubts have meant that less than 50% of survey respondents expect their businesses to expand in the next 12 months although only 8% expect a contraction; there are simply too many all-encompassing questions that need answering for businesses to feel that they have a solid foundation to grow. So, for now, expect the engine of UK economic performance to tread water, at best.\u201d Today\u2019s UK service sector report is much weaker than expected, says financial newswire RANsquawk. Brexit fears mean British companies have little to be optimistic about right now, according to David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He warns: \u201cA maelstrom of sluggish global economic performance and relatively subdued business confidence resulted in a downbeat message in February. The combined pressures from uncertainties around the EU referendum, China and Middle East crowded out any strong optimism for the future. BREAKING: UK service sector growth has hit its weakest level in three years. Markit\u2019s services sector PMI, which tracks activity at hundreds of British firms, has fallen sharply to 52.7 in February, from 55.6 in January. That\u2019s the lowest reading since March 2013 (anything over 50 = growth). UK service providers said they have suffered a big drop in new order growth. Some blamed rising levels of global economic uncertainty, including the EU referendum, China\u2019s slowdown, and the crisis in the Middle East. Employment growth hit a two-and a half-year low, suggesting bosses are nervous about taking on more staff. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson singles out the upcoming vote on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. Survey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of \u2018Brexit\u2019, financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad. Williamson added that the slowdown puts more pressure on the UK central bank to take fresh action:\uf0a7 The extent of the slowdown will be a shock to policymakers and surely puts to bed any talk of the Bank of England raising interest rates. The focus will instead increasingly shift to whether policymakers may soon need to dig deeper into their toolbox to introduce new measures to shore up the economy with additional stimulus, and what tools might be used. Today\u2019s PMI reports confirm that the eurozone recovery has been faltering for a few months now: The slowdown across Europe\u2019s private sector has worsened. Data firm Markit has found that growth decelerated to its weakest rate in 13 months, dragged back by France (not for the first time). Its monthly PMI report found evidence of \u201ca broad-based slowdown of the eurozone private sector economy\u201d. Growth slowed in Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland, while France fell back into contraction for the first time in 13 months. Firms reported that output growth, and new business, both grew at a slower rate, indicating that demand fell. And they also cut prices again, adding to the threat of deflation that is stalking the eurozone. This meant that Markit\u2019s Final Eurozone Composite Output Index dropped to 53.0, down from 53.6 in January.\uf0a7 Chris Williamson, their chief economist, warns that the eurozone\u2019s growth rate may be falling towards stagnation, dragged down by its second largest member.\uf0a7 The survey data raise the prospect of economic growth deteriorating further from the already meagre pace seen late last year, when GDP rose only 0.3%. \u201cGermany and Italy both reported the smallest expansions for five months, while Spain recorded the worst growth for 14 months. It was France, however, that remained the weakest link, seeing business activity fall for the first time in just over a year. The economic chasm between Germany and France has widened, according to today\u2019s purchasing manager reports. France\u2019s service sector PMI fell to 49.3 in February, showing that activity shrank last month - at the fastest pace in over a year. But over in Germany, service sector firms kept growing, pushing the PMI further above the 50-point mark showing expansion. Satellite firm Inmarsat is the biggest faller in London this morning. It warned that trading may be tough this year due to weak government spending; a reminder that fiscal cutbacks have a nasty habit of hitting the private sector. Whitbread is close behind too, after disappointing the City by only reporting sales growth of 0.5% in the last quarter. It blamed \u201clower footfall on the high street and an unusually warm winter\u201d, which apparently meant less demand for hot drinks (?!) A weak start to trading in London has sent the FTSE 100 down by 17 points to 6129. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx reckons the weak Chinese data has hit sentiment: Kicking off the day\u2019s data dump with a whimper was China, Caixin reporting that the country\u2019s economy is \u2018weak and unstable\u2019 as the latest PMI slipped to 51.2. Of course this won\u2019t have helped the markets regain the confidence that was so rampant on the first day of the month, a reminder of the Chinese slowdown the last thing anyone needs to hear when they wake up for a day\u2019s trading. After five months of contraction, Russia\u2019s service sector has finally returned to growth. Firms reported that they won new orders at the fastest pace since last July. And that pushed Markit\u2019s Russia Services Business Activity Index up to 50.9, up from January\u2019s 47.1, showing a small expansion. But Western sanctions and the slump in the oil price are still hurting Russia\u2019s economy, forcing companies to keep shedding staff. Markit explains:\uf0a7 Faced with a lower level of incomplete work, Russian service sector firms continued to shed jobs. Moreover, workforce numbers have declined in every survey for the past two years. There was some evidence that lower employee numbers were associated with efforts to cut back on costs. China\u2019s vice central bank governor has pledged to maintain a prudent approach to monetary policy this year, rather than shocking the markets with another yuan devaluation. Reuters has the details: Yi Gang said the central bank would keep the yuan basically stable against a basket of currencies this year. The weak service sector report comes as thousands of Chinese officials travel to Beijing for the National People\u2019s Congress. The NPC is a rare chance to hear from China\u2019s top leadership, as they plot their strategy to rebalance the economy towards consumerism. Bloomberg dubs it \u201c10 days of parliamentary pageantry\u201d, adding that: This year\u2019s meeting will focus on crafting China\u2019s development plan for the next five years. And the proceedings may provide crucial details on how the government plans to control a slow down in growth while avoiding the dreaded \u201cmiddle-income trap.\u201d Chinese policymakers have been given a new warning that their economy is weakening. Growth in the Chinese service sector slowed in February, according to a new report from data provider Caixin. Chinese service sector firms told Caixin that activity and new orders both grew at a slower rate - meaning they also cut back on job creation. This follows weak factory data earlier this week, and indicates that activity across the Chinese private sector actually shrank last month. Here\u2019s the key points from Caixin\u2019s new survey of the Chinese economy. Services business activity growth slows as manufacturers report further fall in output Composite employment falls at quickest rate in six months, as service sector job creation weakens and manufacturers cut staff numbers sharply Input costs increase at the composite level for the first time in a year-and-a-half And that dragged Caixin\u2019s China General Services Business Activity Index down to 51.2, from January\u2019s six-month high of 52.4. That\u2019s significantly closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. Add in the weak manufacturing sector, and the \u2018composite\u2019 PMI fell to 49.4, showing contraction. Dr. He Fan, Chief Economist at Caixin Insight Group says it underlines the need for fresh action from Beijing. The Caixin Composite Output Index for February came in at 49.4, dipping below 50 again, indicating the economy is still weak and unstable. Overall, the services sector has outperformed manufacturing industries, reflecting continued improvement in the economic structure. While implementing measures to stabilize economic growth, the government needs to push forward reform on the supply side in the services sector to release its potential.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s another big day for economic data, as we look for signs that the world economy is fighting off the risk of a new downturn. The service sector is in the spotlight today, with surveys from across the globe showing whether activity, exports and hiring picked up or slowed down in February. That includes: 9am GMT: The eurozone 9.30am: the UK 3pm: the US Given the size of the services economy, this should show whether fears of a new recession are overblown, or if the recent financial turmoil has hit confidence. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: While there is no question that the global manufacturing sector continues to find its growth prospects somewhat difficult, the recent rebounds in commodity prices has raised the hope that we could well see a similar rebound in economic activity in the coming months. In that time, concerns about a ripple out effect to the services sector do appear to have been contained, but there is still a worry that the slowdown in the services sector could last a little bit longer than many expect. We also get two health checks on the UK housing market, with figures from Nationwide and Halifax building societies. There\u2019s plenty of corporate results around too. In the UK, we\u2019ll be hearing from hotels-to-coffee chain Whitbread, pizza chain Domino\u2019s and challenger bank Shawbrook, while German sportswear giant Adidas is also releasing numbers. And we\u2019ll also keep an eye on Spain, where opposition leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez failed to be backed by enough MPs to become prime minister. Another vote is scheduled for Friday. If S\u00e1nchez can\u2019t get sufficient backing, then it could be fresh election times in Spain, adding another dose of political risk to Europe....",

But now with quantitative easing and negative interest rates, the concept of nurturing credit seems to have morphed into something destructive as opposed to growth enhancing. Our global, credit based economic system appears to be in the process of devolving from a production oriented model to one which recycles finance for the benefit of financiers. Making money on money seems to be the system\u2019s flickering objective.</p> <p>Our global financed-based economy is becoming increasingly dormant, not because people don\u2019t want to work or technology isn\u2019t producing better things, but because finance itself is burning out like our future Sun.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Gross also took aim at the push into negative interest rates, calling it a \u201ca Zika-like contagion\u201d that has spread from the eurozone to Japan. <em>Stay classy, Bill</em>.</strong></p> <p>And he even touched on speculation that authorities might even abolish cash, to allow rates to be slashed even lower. </p> <p>As Gross puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Central bankers seem ever intent on going lower, ignorant in my view of the harm being done to a classical economic model that has driven prosperity \u2013 until it reached a negative interest rate dead end and could drive no more. In addition, government policymakers seem to be setting up future roadblocks for savers. There is a somewhat suspicious uniform attack on high denomination bills of global currencies.</p> <p>Noted economists such as Larry Summers; respected journalists such as the FT\u2019s Gillian Tett, central bankers such as Mario Draghi \u2013 all seem suddenly concerned that 500 euro or 10,000 yen Notes are facilitating drug dealers and terrorists (which they are). But what\u2019s an economist/central banker doing opining on law enforcement?</p> <p>It appears that the one remaining escape hatch for ordinary citizens is being closed.

      "bodyText": "The latest reports from two of the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders show house prices going in opposite directions in February. While Nationwide building society said the average price of a house in the UK rose by 0.3% in February to \u00a3196,930, Halifax reported a 1.4% fall over the month, with the average price dropping to \u00a3209,495. Both lenders base their house price indices on mortgages they have approved, with adjustments made to produce a value for a typical house and iron out any unusual trends in lending. However, the loan books and adjustments are not the same, resulting in different figures. Halifax\u2019s annual rate of change, based on a comparison of the three months to February with the same period last year, has been running higher than Nationwide\u2019s for some months. Its monthly price movements have also tended to be more erratic, with the bank reporting a 1.7% increase in January before last month\u2019s dip. For February, Halifax said prices were up by 9.7%, while Nationwide\u2019s figure for annual growth was 4.8%. Although this was higher than the 4.4% reported the previous month, the building society said it had remained in a fairly narrow range, between 3% and 5%, since the summer. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Nationwide\u2019s index was showing lower price growth than other measures, which could be a result of the sample of mortgages it used. \u201cNationwide\u2019s measure of house prices underplays the extent to which the housing market is heating up again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest growth rates of all the other main measures of house prices have been significantly stronger over the last six months.\u201d Richard Donnell, the research director at property firm Hometrack, said Halifax had understated the level of house price growth until the end of 2012, and its index seemed to have been catching up since then. He added that Halifax does \u201ca lot of new-build lending so softer valuations on new build in London might [have an] impact\u201d. Reports from lenders have shown strong activity in the mortgage market since the start of the year, and despite reporting a fall for February, Halifax said prices were rising \u201cat a robust pace\u201d, driven by a significant imbalance between supply and demand. The bank\u2019s housing economist, Martin Ellis, said: \u201cWhile this position is likely to continue over the coming months, there are some tentative signs that the supply situation may be beginning to improve.\u201d Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said recent activity was likely to have been driven by the new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, which comes into effect in April. \u201cThis is likely to have brought forward a significant number of purchases, which in turn will probably result in a fall back in approvals during the spring/summer,\u201d he said. Looking further ahead he predicted further increases in property values. \u201cWe expect the underlying pace of activity to increase in the quarters ahead as improving labour market conditions and low borrowing costs provide ongoing support.\u201d Hansen Lu, a property economist at Capital Economics, said the monthly figures from both lenders suggested that the increased activity in the market \u201cmay, at least so far, be having only little impact on prices\u201d. He said this could be because prices were already so high that buyers were unable or reluctant to keep bidding up prices. \u201cOther buyers, especially those purchasing for the first time, may be delaying until competition in the market cools after the April stamp duty deadline \u2013 helping to keep a lid on price growth,\u201d he added. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, predicted that prices would rise by about 6% over the year. However, he added that the EU referendum on 23 June posed a \u201cpotential major downside risk to housing market activity and prices\u201d. He said: \u201cA vote for Brexit would be liable to see a marked hit to UK economic activity over the rest of this year and in 2017 amid heightened uncertainties, which would likely weigh down heavily on the housing market.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BHS, the cash-strapped department store group, is threatening to close up to half its shops if landlords do not agree to a reduction in rents. BHS has filed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding, at the high court in an attempt to push through a vital restructuring of its finances. It is understood that the business has told landlords it will shut 50-60 shops without substantial reductions in rent, while another 30 are also at risk without cuts. Hundreds of jobs could be lost if BHS presses ahead with its threat. BHS is being advised by the accountancy firm KPMG, and in recent weeks discussions have taken place with landlords about how to cut the retailer\u2019s rent bill. The stores could be saved if the landlords agree to reduce the rent, but BHS demands on the most at-risk sites are so significant that their survival is doubtful. Savills, the property agent, has been brought in to assist KPMG and could dispose of unwanted stores. BHS is desperate to cut costs to fund a turnaround plan. The retailer, which has 164 stores, intends to install food departments in its shops and modernise the BHS brand. Sir Philip Green, the retail tycoon, sold BHS for \u00a31 in March to a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants. Since then concerns about the future of the retailer, which employs more than 10,000 staff, have grown. It emerged the man who led the buyout, Dominic Chappell, is a former bankrupt, while credit insurers have refused to support BHS\u2019s suppliers, meaning the retailer had to pay upfront for stock. A CVA allows a company in financial difficulty to reach a deal with creditors, including landlords, about reducing its liabilities. The agreement must be approved by 75% of BHS\u2019s creditors at a meeting scheduled for 23 March. CVAs are legal but controversial in the property industry because they allow a company to walk away from its lease obligations. BHS has split its properties into three categories in the CVA: 77 stores that are unaffected; 47 stores that it claims are viable but need a reduction in rent to \u201cmarket levels\u201d; and 40 that need a substantial reduction in rent to survive. The rent reductions it has proposed are significant. Of the 47 \u201cviable\u201d shops, BHS wants the rent to be cut by 75% on 21 stores and 50% on 26 stores. For the struggling 40 shops it wants to pay just 25% of the rent for the next 10 months while it tries to reach a long-term deal that secures their survival. BHS also wants to move its stores, including the group of 77 unaffected stores, to monthly rental payments instead of quarterly. The company has pushed its CVA through ahead of the vital quarterly rent day at the end of March, when BHS and other retailers have to pay rent for the next three months. Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said he hoped store closures \u201cwill be kept to a minimum\u201d. He added: \u201cThe CVA proposal that we have announced today is a necessary milestone in resetting British Home Stores to ensure its long term future as an iconic British retail brand. Some of our stores are loss-making as we are being charged rents that are too high relative to today\u2019s market. The CVA will address this issue. \u201cAlthough a difficult process to go through, this sets in motion the comprehensive updated turnaround plan that we have identified, and gives British Home Stores a secure financial footing from which to grow and deliver sustainable profitability. BHS will continue to trade as usual and we thank our staff and customers for their continued support.\u201d Brian Green, restructuring partner at KPMG, said: \u201cBHS has a total of 164 retail sites across the UK. Importantly, none of these stores will close on day one, and suppliers will continue to be paid on time and in full.\u201d BHS is under substantial financial pressure. The company lost \u00a385m in its last financial year and has a pension deficit of \u00a3207m. It secured a \u00a365m loan from London investment group Grovepoint Capital last year, and last month borrowed \u00a310m from Gordon Brothers, an American company renowned for restructuring struggling businesses. Topp said a CVA would \u201creset\u201d the retailer\u2019s costs by aligning rents to market levels and \u201cexiting loss-making stores where necessary\u201d. Topp said BHS was in \u201cactive discussions\u201d about addressing its pension deficit. The triennial valuation of the BHS pension scheme is being conducted with the results expected before 30 June. BHS is also restructuring its head office and store management team, which could lead to job losses. If the CVA and internal revamp is successful, BHS plans to work on refreshing the brand and modernising its online operations. Will Wright at KPMG said: \u201cWhile the company\u2019s store estate is located across favourable retail locations, a number of these leases are unsustainable, predicated on terms which were originally negotiated some decades ago. \u201cWith the support of its lenders, shareholders and landlords, the company will be able to reshape its debt and operational structure to a model more suited to today\u2019s multichannel retail environment.\u201d",

Of the 47 \u201cviable\u201d shops, BHS wants the rent to be cut by 75% on 21 stores and 50% on 26 stores. For the struggling 40 shops it wants to pay just 25% of the rent for the next 10 months while it tries to reach a long-term deal that secures their survival.</p> <p>BHS also wants to move its stores, including the group of 77 unaffected stores, to monthly rental payments instead of quarterly.</p> <p>The company has pushed its CVA through ahead of the vital quarterly rent day at the end of March, when BHS and other retailers have to pay rent for the next three months.</p> <p>Darren Topp, the chief executive of BHS, said he hoped store closures \u201cwill be kept to a minimum\u201d. He added: \u201cThe CVA proposal that we have announced today is a necessary milestone in resetting British Home Stores to ensure its long term future as an iconic British retail brand. Some of our stores are loss-making as we are being charged rents that are too high relative to today\u2019s market. The CVA will address this issue.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough a difficult process to go through, this sets in motion the comprehensive updated turnaround plan that we have identified, and gives British Home Stores a secure financial footing from which to grow and deliver sustainable profitability. BHS will continue to trade as usual and we thank our staff and customers for their continued support.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Green, restructuring partner at KPMG, said: \u201cBHS has a total of 164 retail sites across the UK. Importantly, none of these stores will close on day one, and suppliers will continue to be paid on time and in full.\u201d</p> <p>BHS is under substantial financial pressure. The company lost \u00a385m in its last financial year and has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/15/head-of-bhs-pension-fund-admits-deficit-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought\">a pension deficit</a> of \u00a3207m. It secured a \u00a365m loan from London investment group Grovepoint Capital last year, and last month borrowed \u00a310m from Gordon Brothers, an American company renowned for restructuring struggling businesses.</p> <p>Topp said a CVA would \u201creset\u201d the retailer\u2019s costs by aligning rents to market levels and \u201cexiting loss-making stores where necessary\u201d.</p> <p>Topp said BHS was in \u201cactive discussions\u201d about addressing its pension deficit. The triennial valuation of the BHS pension scheme is being conducted with the results expected before 30 June.</p> <p>BHS is also restructuring its head office and store management team, which could lead to job losses.</p> <p>If the CVA and internal revamp is successful, BHS plans to work on refreshing the brand and modernising its online operations.</p> <p>Will Wright at KPMG said: \u201cWhile the company\u2019s store estate is located across favourable retail locations, a number of these leases are unsustainable, predicated on terms which were originally negotiated some decades ago.</p> <p>\u201cWith the support of its lenders, shareholders and landlords, the company will be able to reshape its debt and operational structure to a model more suited to today\u2019s multichannel retail environment.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Schroders, one of the City\u2019s oldest financial institutions, has come under fireover its corporate governance after controversially elevating chief executive to the chairmanship. The asset manager, founded in 1804, said Michael Dobson would step down as chief executive on 4 April, after more than 14 years with the company. He will be replaced by the head of investment, Peter Harrison, and will move upstairs to take over as non-executive chairman from Andrew Beeson. The move contravenes recommendations in the corporate governance code, the regulatory framework that Schroders is more used to defending as a powerful investment institution. Schroders drew immediate criticism from the Institute of Directors (I0D) for failing to abide by the code. \u201cSchroders\u2019 decision to appoint Michael Dobson as their next chairman does raise concerns,\u201d said Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the business lobby group. \u201cIt must be acknowledged that Mr. Dobson has played a key role in Schroders\u2019 recent success, and the firm should be commended for taking a long-term approach,. But strong performance is no excuse for ignoring the corporate governance rules without a very convincing explanation.\u201d The corporate governance code, overseen by the Financial Reporting Council, states: \u201cA chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company. If exceptionally a board decides that a chief executive should become chairman, the board should consult major shareholders in advance and should set out its reasons to shareholders at the time of the appointment and in the next annual report.\u201d The code is not mandatory but operates on a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d model, meaning that firms must give their reasons if they breach its guidelines. The IoD said the circumstances at Schroders were not exceptional enough for the code\u2019s guidelines to be ignored. \u201cAlthough we understand Schroders\u2019 desire for continuity, this should not come at the expense of board independence,\u201d said Parry. The code\u2019s recommendation that chief executives do not become chairman is intended to ensure that the chairman\u2019s views are sufficiently independent from those of the rest of the board. Schroders said it was mindful of the code\u2019s provisions but Dobson had been the unanimous choice of the board. The firm published an open letter from its senior independent director, Philip Howard, explaining its position to investors. \u201cIt is clear to the board that Michael Dobson is the outstanding candidate for the role,\u201d said Howard. He said the firm recognised that \u201cordinarily\u201d, the code guides against a succession plan like the one announced by Schroders. But he said major shareholders had been consulted and given their \u201cstrong support\u201d. It added that it was unlikely to pursue a similar succession plan in future: \u201cThe board does not regard this appointment as seeing a precedent at Schroders and the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive remains in place.\u201d Dobson, who will earn \u00a3625,000 a year and will not get a fee for giving up the chief executive role, will seek new non-executive directors to strengthen the firm\u2019s governance. The company hailed Dobson\u2019s achievements, pointing to his role in leading Schroders from 2001, when it made a loss, to record profits in 2015 of more than \u00a3600m. Schroders announced its succession plan alongside annual results that showed an 8% increase in pre-tax profit to \u00a3609.7m in the year to the end of 2015. The firm has \u00a3313.5bn of assets under management, up from \u00a3300bn in 2014, an increase that saw it overtake Aberdeen Asset Management as the UK\u2019s biggest listed fund manager. Annual dividends will be 87p per share, an improvement on the 78p that investors were handed in 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Well played, Michael Dobson, that was a terrific 14-year innings as chief executive of fund manager Schroders, one of the few grand old City names to flourish in the modern world. A loss-making company in 2001 now makes profits of \u00a3600m. Take a bow, have a party and enjoy your retirement. Hold on, Dobson isn\u2019t retiring at all. He is merely moving into the chairman\u2019s office, a switch that \u2013 as usual on these occasions \u2013 looks like a triumph of chumminess over common sense. There are good reasons why the UK code on corporate governance \u2013 born as a reaction to ancient boardroom scandals like Polly Peck and Maxwell \u2013 states baldly that \u201ca chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company\u201d. One individual can end up with too much power and resist new thinking. Boardroom virtues of independence and openness can be lost. The new chief executive operates under a shadow. Schroders says it seeks \u201cstability and continuity\u201d. Almost any company, after a good run, could make the same plea. They all think their boardrooms contain only strong personalities. It is rarely a persuasive argument. The code, it should be noted, is not an absolute prohibition. Non-compliers are told to consult their major shareholders. But, in Schroders\u2019 case, this is hardly onerous. The family controls 45% of the stock and Bruno Schroder, a board member since 1963, has given a thumbs-up, which will tend to dampen outside dissent. If they really don\u2019t like it, non-family shareholders can always sell their shares. But there is wider principle here. Schroders, managing \u00a3313bn of other people\u2019s money, is a firm we expect to read the riot act on governance to quoted companies. That job just became harder. Schroders says there are cases where, having assessed the merits, it has approved of a chief executive becoming chairman \u2013 although it couldn\u2019t name any immediately. Well, maybe, but the point remains. Dobson\u2019s experience may be hard to replicate, but a firm of Schroders\u2019 standing should be able to attract a top-notch chairman who is properly independent \u2013 and see the sense of doing so.",

A loss-making company in 2001 now makes profits of \u00a3600m. Take a bow, have a party and enjoy your retirement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/schroders-corporate-governance-chief-executive-chairman-role\">Schroders defends governance after chief switches to chairman role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hold on, Dobson isn\u2019t retiring at all. He is merely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/schroders-corporate-governance-chief-executive-chairman-role\">moving into the chairman\u2019s office</a>, a switch that \u2013 as usual on these occasions \u2013 looks like a triumph of chumminess over common sense.</p> <p>There are good reasons why the UK code on corporate governance \u2013 born as a reaction to ancient boardroom scandals like Polly Peck and Maxwell \u2013 states baldly that \u201ca chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company\u201d. One individual can end up with too much power and resist new thinking. Boardroom virtues of independence and openness can be lost. The new chief executive operates under a shadow. </p> <p>Schroders says it seeks \u201cstability and continuity\u201d. Almost any company, after a good run, could make the same plea. They all think their boardrooms contain only strong personalities. It is rarely a persuasive argument.</p> <p>The code, it should be noted, is not an absolute prohibition. Non-compliers are told to consult their major shareholders. But, in Schroders\u2019 case, this is hardly onerous. The family controls 45% of the stock and Bruno Schroder, a board member since 1963, has given a thumbs-up, which will tend to dampen outside dissent.</p> <p>If they really don\u2019t like it, non-family shareholders can always sell their shares. But there is wider principle here. Schroders, managing \u00a3313bn of other people\u2019s money, is a firm we expect to read the riot act on governance to quoted companies. That job just became harder.</p> <p>Schroders says there are cases where, having assessed the merits, it has approved of a chief executive becoming chairman \u2013 although it couldn\u2019t name any immediately. Well, maybe, but the point remains. Dobson\u2019s experience may be hard to replicate, but a firm of Schroders\u2019 standing should be able to attract a top-notch chairman who is properly independent \u2013 and see the sense of doing so.</p>",

In the UK, Domino\u2019s sold 8.1% more pizzas last year; side orders were 12.1% ahead, desserts rose 14.8% and drinks 32.7%.

The company was responding after the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said it was considering a range of options, which are believed to include handing over the role to the regulator, Ofgem, or setting up a not-for-profit company. The new body would oversee large energy consumers limiting their consumption and would order power stations to increase their output to try to prevent energy shortages. \u201cThe costs and risks of introducing further change to market structures must be proportional to the benefit to consumers,\u201d said National Grid, which has come under increasing attack from energy companies. \u201cThere is little evidence that an independent system operator model would deliver value to justify the significant consumer costs and risks to security of supply.\u201d National Grid, a \u00a336bn publicly quoted company, is tasked with balancing energy supply and demand but also runs many of the country\u2019s electricity transmission lines and pipelines. Critics have accused it of being compromised by the fact it has a financial interest in supplying ever larger volumes of power rather than encouraging demand reduction, which is another way of preventing power shortages and keeping the lights on. The National Grid insisted on Thursday it was not compromised: \u201cWe take very seriously the need to provide confidence that any potential conflicts of interest are properly managed and have a lot of experience operating in an environment where this is a key part of what we do. We will continue to work closely with government and regulators to proactively manage potential conflicts as our role develops.\u201d DECC said it was looking at various options for changing the way the system worked. \u201cThere is a strong case for greater independence for the system operator to promote more competition in our electricity system,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are working alongside National Grid and Ofgem to see how we can ensure our electricity system is as secure, flexible and independent as possible, while operating in the best interest of consumers.\u201d Claims by National Grid that additional changes risk further undermining consumer and investor confidence came the day after a parliamentary report was severely critical of government for a series of U-turns on policy since the general election last May.",

      "bodyText": "Costa owner Whitbread has joined the ranks of retailers blaming the mild winter weather and lower footfall on the high street for disappointing sales. The coffee chain, which has 2,034 outlets in the UK, posted like-for-like sales growth of 0.5% in the 11 weeks to 11 February, down from 2.5% in the previous quarter. Whitbread said this reflected \u201clower footfall on the high street and an unusually warm winter\u201d. Many high street retailers have blamed the mild weather for not being able to sell winter clothes. Whitbread\u2019s budget hotel chain Premier Inn fared better, with like-for-like sales up 2.2%, although this was down on the 4.7% in the previous quarter, when it grew by 4.7%. The hotel chain continued to win market share. Premier Inn has been growing much more strongly outside London. In the capital, occupancy and revenue per room declined \u2013 in line with the softer hotel market, Whitbread said. Group like-for-like sales were 3.2% ahead, down from 3.6% in the previous quarter. Whitbread expects to meet City forecasts for full-year profits. The company\u2019s share price fell almost 4% to \u00a338.94 after the trading update. Nigel Parson at Canaccord Genuity said: \u201cThe bulls will say it\u2019s a blip and the bears will say it\u2019s a trend.\u201d Under its new chief executive, Alison Brittain, a former boss of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s retail arm, the company is pushing ahead with plans to open a further 5,500 new Premier Inn rooms in the UK this year. At Costa, it expects a net increase of 200 stores worldwide and is to install 950 of its self-service machines at travel hubs. It is trialling Costa Collect, a pay-and-collect app to reduce queues and increase sales, along with improved food ranges. Analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon that a fresher and healthier range could bolster lunch trade where Costa is weak. They believe that Costa can benefit from its heritage and strong brand. The company has also raised some prices to counter the cost of the national living wage and is considering differential pricing, such as increasing prices in London and travel hubs. The analysts recently toured a Costa Fresco trial site with management in central London, where a kitchen prepares freshly baked products. At the moment, Costa mainly sells pastries and other sweet treats, and centrally produced panini. It is up against sandwich chains such as Pret a Manger and Greggs, the latter of which has been moving into selling coffee. Greggs, Britain\u2019s biggest bakery chain, has broadened its ranges beyond pasties and sausage rolls and healthier products such as soup, salad and porridge now make up 10% of its sales. It has also improved its coffee, and is investing \u00a3100m in ambitious expansion plans, with a target of more than 2,000 outlets. Panmure Gordon analyst Anna Barnfather said: \u201cGreggs\u2019 recent trading results give reason for caution, especially as we believe that the customer propositions of the two brands are converging \u2013 Costa becoming \u2018value\u2019, Greggs pushing breakfast and coffee and increasingly seen in the same service stations, travel hubs and high streets.\u201d Mark Brumby, analyst at Langton Capital, was more optimistic about Whitbread\u2019s prospects. \u201cIn Costa and Premier Inn, the group does have two potentially international brands. That is something of a rarity across much of the leisure space.\u201d",

At the moment, Costa mainly sells pastries and other sweet treats, and centrally produced panini. It is up against sandwich chains such as Pret a Manger and Greggs, the latter of which has been moving into selling coffee.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/greggs-says-healthier-options-boosted-sales\">Greggs, Britain\u2019s biggest bakery chain, has broadened its ranges</a> beyond pasties and sausage rolls and healthier products such as soup, salad and porridge now make up 10% of its sales. It has also improved its coffee, and is investing \u00a3100m in ambitious expansion plans, with a target of more than 2,000 outlets.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Anna Barnfather said: \u201cGreggs\u2019 recent trading results give reason for caution, especially as we believe that the customer propositions of the two brands are converging \u2013 Costa becoming \u2018value\u2019, Greggs pushing breakfast and coffee and increasingly seen in the same service stations, travel hubs and high streets.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Brumby, analyst at Langton Capital, was more optimistic about Whitbread\u2019s prospects. \u201cIn Costa and Premier Inn, the group does have two potentially international brands. That is something of a rarity across much of the leisure space.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Worries about the EU referendum, turmoil on financial markets and a faltering global recovery have hit confidence among the UK\u2019s services businesses and knocked their growth to a three-year low. A closely watched survey of companies in the UK\u2019s biggest sector, which covers hairdressers to insurers, showed business activity and new work both expanded at the slowest rate since March 2013. That mirrored gloomy growth reports earlier on Thursday from services companies in China and the eurozone. The UK survey\u2019s headline measure of activity fell to 52.7 in February, from 55.6 in January. That was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction but well below expectations for a reading of 55.1 in a Reuters poll of economists. In the latest sign that uncertainty about the outcome of June\u2019s EU referendum is hitting spending and hiring decisions, employment growth also slumped in February, according to the latest Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report (pdf). The survey\u2019s compilers said that taken together with reports from the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors earlier this week, the gloomier service news signalled that UK economic growth had slowed to the weakest pace for almost three years. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at Markit, said: \u201cDespite rising slightly from January\u2019s three-year low, business confidence in the service sector remained at a level which has historically presaged an imminent slowing in the economy to near stagnation or worse in coming months. \u201cSurvey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of Brexit, financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad.\u201d The slowdown in services sector activity reflected sluggish growth in new business for companies last month. New contracts rose at the weakest pace in almost three years, with some firms commenting that rising levels of global economic uncertainty had resulted in delays in clients placing new orders, according to Markit. Services employment rose at the slowest pace in two and a half years. Separate PMI reports by Markit from the eurozone suggested private sector growth there decelerated to its weakest rate in 13 months, dragged back by France. In China, growth in the service sector slowed in February, according to a report from the data provider Caixin. Chinese service sector companies told Caixin that activity and new orders both grew at a slower rate, meaning they also cut back on job creation. The latest UK news will reinforce expectations that interest rates will remain on hold at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come and perhaps into 2017. This week marks seven years of interest rates at their historic low. With global growth slowing and the UK economy expected to lose steam, there is talk on financial markets of the Bank of England cutting interest rates even lower. Markit\u2019s Williamson said the PMI reports had \u201cmoved down into territory normally consistent with the central bank cutting interest rates rather than hiking\u201d interest rates. \u201cThe extent of the slowdown will be a shock to policymakers and surely puts to bed any talk of the Bank of England raising interest rates. The focus will instead increasingly shift to whether policymakers may soon need to dig deeper into their toolbox to introduce new measures to shore up the economy with additional stimulus, and what tools might be used,\u201d he said. James Knightley, economist at the bank ING, said the outcome of the EU referendum would also influence policy as well as the strength of the pound, which has already been hit by Brexit worries. \u201cAs the referendum approaches, businesses will become more cautious on hiring new workers and implementing investment plans, which will likely see growth rates slow,\u201d he said, reacting to the PMI report. \u201cShould the UK vote to remain an EU member, we are likely to see a bounceback in sentiment and activity in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016. However, should it vote to leave then the near-term growth backdrop will deteriorate even further, which will likely result in renewed Bank of England policy stimulus and add to the downside risks for sterling.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are flagging on continuing concerns about the global economy and the effect of a number of companies going ex-dividend. The biggest faller in the FTSE 100 is Inmarsat, down 41.5p or 4% to 924.5p after the satellite communications group warned of tough trading this year. It has been hit by cutbacks in government spending as well as slowdown in the maritime market. It recently completed its Global Xpress satellite network, allowing it to offer broadband services to corporate customers such as airlines. But it is planning to spend $500m to $600m this year and each of the following two years to upgrade older satellites and supply new equipment for airline broadband. This was around $100m more than many analysts had been expecting. The news came as the company reported full year pretax profits down from $342.3m to $338m on flat revenues of $1.27bn. The FTSE 100 is currently down 2.90 points at 6144.16, but the companies quoted without the right to their dividend have knocked around 13 points off the index. These include HSBC, down 12.15p at 459.45p and RSA Insurance, 8.3p lower than 439p. Whitbread has fallen 97p to \u00a339.52 after its results disappointed, but Admiral Group is up 122p to \u00a318.82 following the insurer reporting better than expected profits of \u00a3377m, up 6%. CRH has climbed 4.7% to \u00a319.37 after the Irish cement maker reported a 35% rise in earnings to \u20ac2.2bn and issued a positive update for the current year. Mining shares are moving higher despite a dip in Chinese service sector data and a slowdown in the eurozone, with Anglo American up 15.9p to 540p as copper hit a three month high. Among the mid-caps Thomas Cook is down 4.5p at 103.9p as Barclays cut its target price from 122p to 110p and its earnings forecasts. It said: Post its 2015 results, we update our model. 2016 earnings before interest and tax goes to \u00a3339m from \u00a3370m, meaning our 2016 earnings per share forecast decreases by 15% to 10p (Bloomberg consensus 10.7p). Our 2017 earnings per share forecast is reduced by 13% to 12.4p (Bloomberg consensus 13.3p), and we introduce our 2018 earnings per share forecast of 16p (Bloomberg consensus 15.3p). We note there is a large consensus earnings range for Thomas Cook. We use a consistent valuation methodology (applying the average Tour Operator PE of around 11 times on 2016 EPS) and our price target moves to 110p from 122p.",

      "bodyText": "The average price of a house in the UK rose by 0.3% in February to \u00a3196,930, according to the country\u2019s biggest building society. Despite signs of strong activity in the mortgage market at the start of the year, Nationwide\u2019s figures, which are based on loans it approved during last month, show prices remained steady. The monthly increase matched the rise in January, and although the annualised rate of growth increased to 4.8%, from 4.4% the previous month, the lender said it had remained in a fairly narrow range, between 3% and 5%, since the summer. Separate figures from rival lender Halifax showed a 1.4% fall over the month, although annual growth was at 9.7%. The bank said prices were rising \u201cat a robust pace\u201d. Halifax\u2019s annual rate of change, which is based on a comparison of the three months to February with the same period last year, has been running higher than Nationwide\u2019s for some months. Its monthly price movements have also tended to be more erratic, with the bank reporting a 1.7% increase in January. Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said recent activity was likely to have been driven by the new stamp duty surcharge on second homes, which comes into effect in April. \u201cThis is likely to have brought forward a significant number of purchases, which in turn will probably result in a fall back in approvals during the spring-summer,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking through this volatility we expect the underlying pace of activity to increase in the quarters ahead as improving labour market conditions and low borrowing costs provide ongoing support.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Nationwide\u2019s index was showing lower price growth than other measures, which could be a result of the sample it was based on. \u201cNationwide\u2019s measure of house prices underplays the extent to which the housing market is heating up again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe latest growth rates of all the other main measures of house prices have been significantly stronger over the last six months.\u201d For January, the Land Registry reported a price increase of 2.5% and annualised growth of 7.1% \u2013 considerably higher than Nationwide\u2019s figures. However, the lender\u2019s figures cover the whole of the UK, while the Land Registry is only England and Wales, and growth has tended to be highest in England in recent times. They are also based on an earlier stage of the sales process. Tombs said: \u201cWe still expect the strengthening labour market, falling mortgage rates and a dearth of homes for sale to result in punchy house price increases this year.\u201d Halifax\u2019s latest report put the cost of a house in the UK at \u00a3209,495, more than \u00a316,000 higher than in February 2015. The bank\u2019s housing economist, Martin Ellis, said: \u201cPrices continue to rise at a robust pace driven by a significant imbalance between supply and demand. While this position is likely to continue over the coming months, there are some tentative signs that the supply situation may be beginning to improve. \u201cFurther ahead, increasing affordability issues, as house price increases continue to exceed wage growth, are likely to curb housing demand and cause price growth to ease.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected prices to rise by about 6% over the year. However, he added that the EU referendum on 23 June was a \u201cpotential major downside risk to housing market activity and prices\u201d. Archer said: \u201cA vote for Brexit would be liable to see a marked hit to UK economic activity over the rest of this year and in 2017 amid heightened uncertainties, which would likely weigh down heavily on the housing market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Changes in government energy policy since the last election have chased off investors and may have added \u00a3120 a year to household bills, according to a parliamentary report. Thursday\u2019s report, from the energy and climate change committee, argues future domestic and business power bills may be higher than necessary as a result of changes including U-turns on funding onshore windfarms and energy efficiency schemes. \u201cBillions of pounds of investment is needed in order to replace ageing energy infrastructure, maintain secure energy supplies and meet our legally binding climate change targets,\u201d said Angus MacNeil, a Scottish National party MP who chairs the energy and climate change committee. \u201cSince coming to office in May, the government has made a number of sudden and unexpected changes to policy. This has spooked investors and left them wondering \u2018what will be next?\u2019\u201d Ministers have slashed subsidies for onshore windfarms, reduced aid to solar power, ended the \u201cgreen deal\u201d energy efficiency programme and cancelled a longstanding competition to build a carbon capture and storage scheme. The report, Investor Confidence in the UK Energy Sector, contains statements from companies including wind turbine maker, Siemens, complaining about \u201capparently contradictory messages\u201d from ministers. These include giving local people a say over onshore wind farm planning while excluding them from shale gas projects and claiming to favour low-cost decarbonisation while halting relatively cheap onshore wind farms. In the most damning part of the report Octopus Investments calculates that the UK may be paying an extra \u00a33.14bn per annum in investment costs. Richard Black, director of the energy and climate intelligence unit, said: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that critical evidence given to the committee came from some of the biggest investment houses, such as Schroders, as well as from people in the renewables industry \u2013 and interesting too that the committee points its finger squarely at Treasury. \u201cOne investment firm puts the cost of policy tinkering at \u00a33.14bn per year, which, if it were applied only to domestic consumers, would add as much as \u00a3120 per year to the average household bill.\u201d The committee has called on the government to provide a detailed plan for when the next three rounds of contracts for difference subsidy auctions will be held, how much money will be available and which technologies will be eligible to take part. It also wants ministers to publish the assumptions and methodologies that underpin the calculations of how much money is being spent in the levy control framework and how much will be available after 2020. The Department of Energy and Climate Change defended its record saying its priority was to ensure families and businesses have access to reliable, secure, affordable and clean energy supplies. \u201cWe have been clear that low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear, offshore wind and shale gas will play a key role in our energy future,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAt the same time we are rightly taking action to keep bills as low as possible to protect consumers and ensure they get value for money, including by being tough on subsidies so that technologies stand on their own two feet.\u201d However, Alasdair Cameron, who campaigns on behalf of Friends of the Earth for renewable energy, said MPs were right to attack the \u201cmess\u201d that has been made of UK energy policy. \u201cConstant ministerial attacks on renewable energy have confused and frustrated businesses and investors, and this will inevitably lead to more expensive electricity and more pollution. \u201cThe government must take a forward-looking approach to our energy needs. This means pulling the plug on climate-wrecking fossil fuels and getting behind energy efficiency and Britain\u2019s huge wind, wave and solar potential.\u201d The report is published just days after Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, announced a new subsidy scheme to try to head off a power supply crunch caused by lack of new investment. Earlier this week Energy-UK the power industry\u2019s main lobbying group, threw its weight behind a long-term national energy plan like that moving Germany toward a low-carbon economy. Paul Dorfman, from the energy institute at University College London, said Energy-UK\u2019s \u201cbelated conversion\u201d to renewable power was welcome but needed to be supported by appropriate ministerial policies. \u201cGermany, the strongest economy in Europe, which is using 20% of all EU electricity, has been conscientiously following this [low carbon] path for some time now. \u201cPerhaps the difference lies in the way governments listen to or ignore practical energy policy research. Whereas German energy policy is evidence-based, that of the UK is evidence-light \u2013 largely based on short-term ideology.\u201d Subsidy cuts and policy changes affecting low carbon energy May 2015 The Conservative party manifesto pledge to \u201chalt the spread of onshore windfarms\u201d. 18 June Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) announces early closure of the renewable obligation (RO) subsidy for onshore wind. 10 July Treasury announces the scrapping of Zero Carbon Homes programme. 22 July DECC announces cuts to RO for solar power, biomass and feed-in-tariff (FIT) accreditation. 23 July DECC ends funding for the Green Deal Finance Company, ending the green deal subsidy scheme for home energy efficiency. 19 August Consultation on changes to FIT accreditation closes. 27 August DECC publishes consultation on a review of the FIT scheme for solar. 18 November Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, says energy policy needs to be \u201creset\u201d. 25 November Chancellor\u2019s autumn statement reveals \u00a31bn cut in competition for prototype carbon capture and storage project. 17 December Cuts to solar subsidies confirmed.",
