Carlos Ghosn\u2019s remarks on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos may raise concerns about the commitment of company to the UK, following its pledge in October to turn the factory into one of the biggest car plants in the world. The government has faced questions about the \u201csupport and assurances\u201d given to Nissan before the company\u2019s October\u2019s announcement that new versions of its Qashqai and X-Trail would be made in the north-east of England, turning Sunderland into a \u201csuper plant\u201d producing more than 600,000 cars a year. Ghosn was reported as saying that Nissan trusted Theresa May\u2019s assurances, but that the company would need to review the situation. \u201cObviously when the package comes, you are going to have to re-evaluate the situation, and say, \u2018OK, is the competitiveness of your plant preserved or not?\u2019 \u201cWe are going to have to make decisions on investment within the next two to three years, so obviously the faster the Brexit results come, the better it is,\u201d Reuters quoted Ghosn as saying. The government has refused to publish the letter to Nissan in which assurances were given by Greg Clark, the business secretary. May, who set out her vision for a post-Brexit Britain in a speech on Tuesday, was in Davos to meet bankers and business leaders. In a keynote address she urged delegates to address the effects of globalisation. A senior Toyota executive at the Swiss ski resort told the Financial Times that the carmaker\u2019s UK plants also needed to be competitive after Brexit. Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota\u2019s chair, said: \u201cWe have seen the direction of the prime minister of the UK, [so] we are now going to consider, together with the suppliers, how our company can survive.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oh, one last thing. You\u2019ll never guess which Davos regular has just landed a swanky job..... Our work here is done. Thanks for reading and commenting through the week. Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s news story on today\u2019s key developments: Here\u2019s what we learned in Davos this week: Tsch\u00fcss! The World Economic Forum is wrapping up now, which is just as well as my laptop is seizing up after a week of constant activity. The co-chairs of this year\u2019s event have been speaking; Save the Children\u2019s Helle Thorning-Schmidt cites Tuesday\u2019s speech by president Xi as a key moment: Perhaps the most interesting part of Kissinger\u2019s appearance was his advice to Donald Trump to redefine America\u2019s role in the world. Here\u2019s the full quotes, courtesy of CNBC: \u201cOne of the major achievements or impacts of President Obama was to withdraw America from some positions in which it was overextended but also to create the feel that America was withdrawing from the world even in places in which over extension would not apply and where its contribution remains essential. \u201cSo President Trump will have to find a definition of the American role that answers the concern of many parts of the world that America was giving up its indispensable role of leadership in many countries - and major contribution in others - and define what and where America can lead and where it must contribute and in that help in the creation of an international order.\u201d On Brexit, Kissinger says it could be used in a creative way -- to create Europe and America in the Atlantic partnership. It could seek to address the problem that some of the key issues in Europe, such as the economy and security, are very difficult to solve in a forum where unanimity is the absolute requirement. One answer could be to create subgroups on issues like finance and security, where decisions could be made on the basis of support from countries who would carry the greatest burden, Kissinger continues. In such a system, Britain could reenter Europe, and play a function linking Europe and America. This could allow countries to act with the same \u201cmoral conviction\u201d as we saw in the early days of the Atlantic Alliance. The Atlantic Partnership is crucially importance, says Kissinger, in avoiding a return to the problems that used to characterise Europe. It needs to be reconstructed, but with the attitude that it is the key element of both US and European policy. On the Middle East, Kissinger says it is important that progress is made at the Syrian peace talks in Astana, as a precursor for further progress. Those talks start next week, and are organised by Russia and Turkey. Any solution will have to include the United States, he adds. Q: What advice would you give president Trump about Russia, if you were secretary of state? America and Russia seem to be making the worst assumptions about each other today, Henry Kissinger replies. Trump has spoken about de-escalating the tension in the relationship, and Kissinger agrees with this \u2018general attitude. I think Russia is a country with a very special history - 11 time zones, touching Asia, he Middle East, and Europe, Kissinger continues. It has been the cause of many tensions, but also maintained the equilibrium in the world Q: What advice would you give president Trump? President Trump must find a definition of America\u2019s role in the world, and decide in what way America can lead, what it can contribute, to help create an international world order, Kissinger replies. Henry Kissinger is now joining the delegates at Davos, by video link, to discuss the state of the world today. He starts by paying tribute to Shimon Peres, the Israeli statesman and Davos favourite who died in September 2016. Q: What conclusions do you draw for President Xi\u2019s speech on Tuesday? Important assertion by China that it will participate in the construction of a world order. The world order which we were familiar is disintegrating in some respects, Kissinger says. President Xi has put forward a concept of international order that must be discussed, Kissinger adds. Rosberg is telling an audience in Davos about what it takes to make it to the top. He says failure and suffering can be a \u201cgift\u201d, depending on how you look at it. Losses, failure, are not always a bad thing. They can help you. I can look back [at my career in F1] and say I\u2019ve ticked all the boxes. I find that life has more to offer than driving around in circles. He says that among the things that helped him succeed in his F1 career were jet lag training and keeping his family life simple. This year I realised how much my private life had an impact... simplifying it so that it took the least possible energy from me, so that I could 100% focus on the job of racing. It really made a difference. F1 champ Rosberg is giving an interview at Davos. Watch it here. Roberto Azevedo, director general of the World Trade Organization, is concerned about the tone of some of the conversations at Davos. Specifically he\u2019s concerned that talk about protectionism and trade wars could lead to a crisis. Speaking after a meeting of trade ministers at Davos, attended by 29 WTO members, he said: I\u2019ve heard a lot in Davos about trade wars. That would destroy jobs, not create jobs. We must definitely avoid talking ourselves into a crisis.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Call the Midwife gets a mention by the Davos (non Brit) panel on the hospital of the future. Elizabeth Nabel, president of Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women\u2019s Health Care describes the programme as \u201ccharming\u201d as she discusses her belief that health care should be provided as much as possible at home in the community. As the world\u2019s political and business leaders debate inequality and globalisation in Davos, Harrods is making some changes after it was criticised by a union. The luxury department store has agreed to let staff keep 100% of the money raised from restaurant tips following a campaign by the United Voices of the World union. Previously the retailer kept 50% of the discretionary 12.5% service charge automatically added to diners\u2019 bills. It is also reducing its service charge rate to 10%. The Guardian\u2019s Zoe Wood has the full story: Away from Davos for a moment, but on the subject of Brexit, the Gambia\u2019s new president has been speaking to Sky News: The panel on the hospital of the future is underway. Panelists are pondering what a hospital in a major city is going to be like in 2027. The broad conclusion is that it\u2019s going to be very different. Shamsheer Vayalil, managing director at Abu Dhabi based VPS Healthcare, says that in 10 years time, there won\u2019t be standalone hospitals. There will be gyms, cafes, business meetings in the same place. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has the full story on how the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, is blaming Tony Blair for Brexit: Third time lucky? Currently underway is a debate on mental health and what might be done to mitigate the consequences of mental illness. Also coming up: The hospital of the future at 13.00 UK time The global security outlook at 14.15 UK time A conversation with Nico Rosberg, 2016 Formula 1 World Champion at 14.30 UK time Henry Kissinger on the world in 2017 at 15.30 UK time Stephen Lewis, chief economist at ADM Investor Services, says it is not surprising that the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, have chosen to stay away from Davos this year: It is not difficult to understand why, for some European leaders, Davos is now a no-no. To be seen by their voters junketing with business chiefs in a luxury resort would merely serve to heighten the populist rage that has been shaking the foundations of the political order in Europe. Admittedly, [UK prime minister] Mrs May addressed the meeting but she was in the special position of having a job to do to persuade corporate managers that Brexit would not render the UK a less friendly environment for business. The most significant political attendee at this year\u2019s event, he says, was China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping: President Xi\u2019s attendance was perhaps the most significant of these political comings and goings, though. Beijing surely recognises that Mr Trump\u2019s approach to international trade could well result in the reversal of the globalisation process that has so favoured China\u2019s economic development. By presenting himself as the champion of free markets, he was probably hoping to win good will towards China among the multinational globalisers. The World Economic Forum is not giving up on the idea of globalisation that works for everyone: The panel ends with Christine Lagarde, IMF chief, urging advanced economies to do more to support the developing world. She says: Growth is not sustainable if it is not inclusive. She singles out Britain\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7% of its GDP on overseas aid. All countries should adhere to that target, and do more to help. Otherwise we will be dealing with massive inequality issues at all levels. Q: There is concern that there might be no agreement, two years after triggering Brexit, leading to a cliff-edge. How concerned would you be about that? Wolfgang Schauble says it would be \u201ca disaster for all of us if that happened.\u201d He adds that he is \u201ctotally convinced\u201d London will remain an important financial centre for Europe after Brexit. And he believes that a deal can be done in two years. Wolfgang Schauble isn\u2019t convinced by Hammond\u2019s threat to leave the economic mainstream. The Financial Times\u2019s Martin Wolf, who is moderating the panel, asks the German finance minister to comment on the idea that Britain will become \u201cSingapore on Thames\u201d Schauble says: I can\u2019t see that the UK, this great nation, would compare itself with Singapore. If America aggravates some of our largest lenders, and raise our deficits, quite frankly that puts even more pressure on the dollar, Larry Fink adds. That\u2019s a very hard thing to navigate. He explains: Right now the biggest lender is Japan, the second biggest lender is China. We need to be paying quite a bit of attention to our relationships worldwide, as the biggest borrower in the world. Larry Fink, the head of US investment group BlackRock, says the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote have both had an immediate boost to consumer optimism. These votes have had an immediate impact on families, they feel they have a voice now and their voice has changed policy, so they\u2019re feeling happier and spending more. Whether they are right or wrong they think the old policies were wrong for them. We\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re right, Fink says. Philip Hammond then warns his audience at Davos that Britain could quit the economic mainstream if it doesn\u2019t get a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU. Our \u201cstrong preference is that we remain within the European economic mainstream\u201d, with reciprocal access to each others markets, and Britain \u201ccontinuing to operate to European norms and regulatory standards,\u201d says Hammond. However.... But if we are driven out of that market, and denied access to our most important market, we will reinvent ourselves and find a new way of being competitive. Hammond reminds us that Britain already works longer hours, to ensure that our lower productivity doesn\u2019t undermine competitiveness He doesn\u2019t spell out what the \u2018economic mainstream\u2019 means, but I think he\u2019s hinting at lower corporate tax, a bonfire of regulations and other measures to make Britain more attractive to companies. Philip Hammond goes next. He says Britain has confounded sceptics who thought the British economy would suffer an immediate shock after voting to leave the UK. He repeats his prediction that inflation will rise this year due to the depreciation in the pound. And he then lays into Tony Blair for allowing citizens from the eight eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004 to have full access to Britain. It is important to understand the drivers of the Brexit decision, Hammond says. They are not \u201cone and the same\u201d as the drivers that led to the election of president Trump. There was no anti-trade or anti globalisation rhetoric in the campaign - one of the central tenets of the Leave campaign was that Britain should do more trade with the rest of the world. Hammond says: It was absolutely the opposite of the anti-trade rhetoric that we heard in the United States. But what there was clearly was a strong strand of feeling against uncontrolled migration. And I lay the responsibility for that squarely at the door of prime minister Blair who failed to impose transitional regime in the UK in 2004 So while other countries in Europe smoothly transitioned the A8 members and the freedom of movement from A8 members Britain took the full force of the tide in 2004, and that created a public perception which we still haven\u2019t shaken off to this day. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, says Germany would suffer if there was a decline in free trade. Brexit will not have a big impact on the German economy this year, though. Christine Lagarde speaks first. She says there are good signs in the global economy - for a start, the IMF isn\u2019t revising down its growth forecasts any more Global growth is expected to rise from 3.1% in 2016 to 3.4% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018. Japan is getting stronger, and Europe is in a recovery cycle. And the IMF has revised up the US, because of Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax reforms. However, it\u2019s not clear how this fiscal stimulus will be combined with trade treasures, Lagarde warns. This is \u201cSomething to be explored and probably not overall a net positive\u201d, she warns. Philip Hammond has now hotfooted it across the conference to join a panel discussion on the global economic outlook, with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Japan\u2019s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda, Wall Street titan Larry Fink and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Here\u2019s a live feed: Official figures for the how UK retailers fared over the crucial Christmas period are out and will not make pretty reading for the industry. Contrasting with the largely upbeat tone of retailers\u2019 trading updates, the official statistics suggest retail sales volumes dropped 1.9% in December from the month before. That was the biggest drop since April 2012 and far worse than forecasts for a 0.1% dip in a Reuters poll of economists. But taking the final three months of the year together retail sales were up 1.2%, the Office for National Statistics said. That will buoy hopes that consumers continued to drive a pretty solid pace of overall economic growth in the fourth quarter. Commenting on the figures, ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: Retailers saw a strong end to 2016 with sales in the final quarter up 5.6% on the same period last year, although the amount bought fell between November and December once the effects of Christmas are removed. There were some notably strong figures from smaller retailers, in particular butchers, who reported a significant boost in sales in the run-up to Christmas.\u201d Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, called it a \u201cdisastrous December\u201d and pointed to the effects of a pick-up in inflation last month. We know from the CPI [inflation] data earlier in the week that prices rose more than expected in December and now we also know that sales volumes fell. This is likely to be the theme for the rest of the year - higher prices will reduce disposable income and hurt consumer spending growth.\u201d The pound has dropped on the news and is currently at $1.2290, down 0.4% on the day against the dollar. It is down 0.3% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1542. Another interesting angle \u2013 Hammond told the panel that he thinks the Brexit deal can be done in two years, but there might have to be an \u2018interim\u2019 arrangement if a final trade deal isn\u2019t ready. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on Philip Hammond\u2019s migration comments: British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday it was an \u201copen question\u201d whether migrants from the European Union would enjoy easier access to Britain after Brexit than those from other parts of the world. \u201cThat could be a subject for the negotiations. What we have said clearly is that we cannot accept the principle of free movement,\u201d Hammond said in response to a question at a panel discussion in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Could Britain leave the EU and rejoin in the future? Hammond thinks this is unlikely, as it would mean joining the euro - a red line issue for the UK. And he warns that the slump in the pound is going to push the cost of living higher. British people are starting to feel that through increased inflation, and we\u2019ll see more of that through this year. That\u2019s the mechanism that allows economic shocks to be handled in a smooth way. Hammond was also asked about the issue of EU citizens currently living in the UK He says Europe rejected the idea of an immediate reciprocal deal, because nothing can be discussed until everything is discussed. The 2.4 million EU citizens in Britain are welcome, Hammond says. Provided we can be assured of a reciprocal deal for the 1.2 million UK citizens in Europe, it will be settled. More Hammond: On to geopolitics. The change of administration in Washington is a very big issue for the UK, and has introduced even more uncertainty for the EU than Brexit, Hammond continues. And the crucial issue is Europe\u2019s relationship with Russia, and the question of whether the security provided by America changes. It is not an exaggeration that for some eastern partners of the EU, security is a much bigger issue than economics. We want to find the best people from around the world, Barclays CEO Jes Staley tells the panel. One of the reasons for the City\u2019s success is the acceptance that financial companies can being talent from anywhere. Staley doesn\u2019t think the UK people want that to stop. Mario Monti says there has been \u201ca fundamental change in a small time\u201d in Britain\u2019s attitude to EU migration. He reminds us that the UK was one of the members pushing to allow more countries to join the bloc a couple of decades ago. The two are linked, Philip Hammond shoots back. The attitude in the UK now on EU migration is absolutely for sure derived from the mistake that Blair made to open the floodgates in 2004. More from Hammond on migration: What we\u2019ve said clearly is that we cannot accept the principle of free movement. Any EU national can simply change his place of residence from Bulgaria or Romania to the UK, Hammond adds, and we can\u2019t accept that any more. But the UK will still need migrants for its economy, and it will still welcome them. Hammond insists Britain isn\u2019t anti-migration. There might be a few people in the UK whose view is the migrants don\u2019t come in, but it\u2019s absolutely not the majority view, he says, adding: It is very important to the British people that we control our borders, but most of them do not want to use that control to shut the borders, they simply want to have the control. Professor Ngaire Woods then gives a passionate call to the government not to include students in its migration controls. She says that Britain needs to be at the front of the knowledge economy to succeed. Oxford is fighting against top US universities to attract the best students, and Brexit could make this much harder. If we have a tone in Britain that it\u2019s less welcoming of immigrants then it can\u2019t attract the best talent in the world then it doesn\u2019t become Global Britain, it becomes Doors Shut Britain.\u201d Woods says we should see overseas students as purchases of Britain\u2019s \u2018fantastic\u2019 education services, rather then including them in the immigration numbers. If we make them part of Britain\u2019s immigration debate we\u2019ve smashing our own kneecaps before even beginning the race.... Don\u2019t kneecap your best asset. Let us thrive, make sure that immigration policies tell the world that Britain is open and welcoming to the best most entrepreneurial, energetic talent from all over, without restraint and constraint. Professor Ngaire Woods, professor of global economic governance at Oxford University, tells the Davos panel that successful Brexit negotiations can\u2019t be done in two years, and criticises the \u201cgloating\u201d among leave supporters. Woods says that May and Hammond are taking a positive, constructive approach \u2013 but not everyone in their party is taking the same view. There are still factions that are gloating about Brexit \u2013 and that unfortunately takes an unconstructive tone. That\u2019s because the Brexit vote caused the sterling devalation giving an immediate boost to exports, but the costs of a hard Brexit won\u2019t be felt for two years. Politically, this is a big call on both sides, Woods continues. The cool constructive approach that the PM and chancellor are taking needs to quickly infect all their party and people who supported Brexit. And she warns that the two-year timetable laid out under Article 50 may not be achievable. \u201cThe ideal would be a 10 year period in which you could put each piece together and end up in a Churchillian world of a more coherent EU without Britain, and Britain as a constructive friend sitting alongside it\u201d. Mario Monti, the former Italian PM and European commissioner, is also on the panel - and is roasting David Cameron for calling last year\u2019s EU referendum. Monti starts by welcoming the \u201cclarity\u201d that Britain has given about its Brexit plans in recent days. But then he attacks Cameron for calling the referendum \u201cin the interest of his position in his party\u201d. \u201cHe put his country and the whole of Europe on the line to achieve this\u201d The consequences have been rather devastating, not only for him personally but because the whole political system in the UK has been blocked, paralysed and made uncertain. This means that other European leaders who play the game of attacking the EU for personal interests will \u201cfind it an admonishment to be a bit more careful\u201d, Monti concludes. Hammond adds that it would be economically \u201csub-optimal\u201d if countries and companies had to start precautionary spending in case Brexit turned out badly. For example, France would also have to invest in new systems at its own borders. Philip Hammond starts by telling Davos that Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech on Tuesday was an important step forward. We\u2019ve now set out an agenda that lets this become a shared problem that has to be solved. One of the key challenges is the \u2018pretty rigid\u2019 timetable laid down by the EU treaties, the chancellor says. He still expects to serve the Article 50 notice by the end of March, whatever the Supreme Court rules next week. Hammond says there are many issues to consider; Britain will need significant new infrastructure at our borders if we change our customs arrangements, and new IT systems if the migration rules change. Hammond says that he hopes to begin \u201cconstructive engagement\u201d with the EU once the Article 50 notice is served. It will become clear, I hope pretty quickly, that there is a shared ambition to get to an end state arrangement that will mean maximising the reciprocal access to each other\u2019s markets and the level of co-operation across this range of non-economic areas as well. That means the fog gradually clears, and businesses have more certainty, Hammond adds. Philip Hammond\u2019s session begins with an audience question \u2013 who thinks Britain is not going to leave the EU? No one puts their hand up... The message has finally got through, says Hammond. Former foreign office minister Mark Malloch-Brown reckons Theresa May\u2019s cabinet is the \u201cB team\u201d. Speaking on the same panel as Pascal Lamy, Malloch-Brown says: \u201cIn the history of the Tory party, they have never been able to form a second cabinet if the first one falls under a bus. If the first one (David Cameron\u2019s) gets knocked out because it makes a mess of Brexit you get the B team.\u201d Pascal Lamy, the former EU trade commissioner and former director general of the World Trade Organisation, has an interesting theory about the government\u2019s Brexit plan: it is all a ruse to disguise the fact that Britain is not going to leave the EU. Speaking at a Clifford Chance breakfast in Davos, Lamy says: \u201cIt is like world war two where the allies intoxicated the Germans into thinking the landings were going to take place in northern France when in fact they were going to take place in western France. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening here.\u201d* You have a fake foreign minister, then you have a message that Brexit means Brexit, then you choose the most costly option so that at some stage people realise that the costs are not worth it.\u201d * He\u2019s referring to Operation Bodyguard, in which the Allies persuaded Germany that the Normandy landings were a diversion. Lamy adds that while the lawyers are divided about whether the Article 50 process can be stopped once it has started, the process may drown in its own complexity. The divorce proceedings, he says, will be \u201clong, obscure, bumpy and probably nasty\u201d. That\u2019s why the idea that Theresa May is running a Black Cabinet operation of the sort mounted by Churchill in 1944 can\u2019t be ruled out, Lamy argued. Lamy\u2019s comments come just hours after billionaire philanthropist George Soros caused a stir by claiming that Theresa May wouldn\u2019t last long as PM, due to her divided cabinet and small Commons majority Good morning from Davos, where the final day of the World Economic Forum is getting under way. Today we\u2019ll be hearing a lot more about Brexit, the global economy and Donald Trump, as the presidential inauguration reminds delegates that the world is changing \u2013 and not the way most would like. The UK\u2019s chancellor, Philip Hammond, is about to give us his views on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Barclays CEO Jes Staley is also on the panel, at bank chiefs ponder whether to start moving jobs overseas. That session starts at 9.15am Davos time, or 8.15am GMT. Hammond\u2019s going to be busy too \u2013 he\u2019s then appearing on a panel on the global economic outlook alongside IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Japan\u2019s central bank chief Haruhiko Kuroda, Wall Street titan Larry Fink and German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. There\u2019s a rather subdued feeling at WEF today; some business chiefs have left early so they can attend Trump\u2019s swearing-in. Others are simply wondering what 2017 has in store for them.... Henry Kissinger will have some guidance; he\u2019s giving his views on the state of the world at 4.30pm CET. NHS chief executive Simon Stephens is also in town, appearing on a panel about hospitals of the future at 2pm CET. Plus there are panels on science, security and the Middle East to keep an eye on too...",

The lion\u2019s share of fresh vegetables we eat in winter comes from Murcia and Valencia in southern Spain, but the regions\u2019 crops have been hit by flooding, frost and now snow. One supplier said lorries transporting vegetables already in short supply to the UK had been stuck in snow this week. Courgette prices have risen four-fold in the past two weeks. \u201cSouthern Spain is the bread basket for Europe in the winter,\u201d said Anthony Gardiner of G\u2019s, a major supermarket fresh food supplier. \u201cThe whole of southern Europe has been hit hard and supply is absolutely challenging across a number of salad, fruit and vegetable lines. That\u2019s likely to continue until the beginning of May when the first British crops are ready.\u201d Heavy rains in mid-December ruined half the Christmas lettuce harvest in Murcia, and the rains have been been followed by frost and snow, the first snowfall many residents can remember since the early 80s. Spanish government figures show the price of a kilo of aubergines surging 132% between 8 January and 15 January. Courgette prices were up by 60% and some tomatoes by 45% over the same period. Spain\u2019s largest farming association, Asaja, says the average price of a kilo of courgettes in Almer\u00eda rose by \u20ac1.10 (95p) to hit \u20ac4.02 between the first and second week of January, with increases also recorded in aubergines, cucumbers, peppers and beans. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s vegetables that are being most affected by the weather all along the eastern coast \u2013 Valencia, Murcia and Almer\u00eda,\u201d said Asaja spokeswoman Estrella Larrazabal, adding that producers growing cucumbers, peppers, artichokes, courgettes and green beans under plastic were also beginning to report damage. Nick Matthews, a regional director at Total Produce, one of world\u2019s largest fresh produce suppliers, said it was receiving only 20 to 30% of its usual volume of courgette and aubergines. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unprecedented and I\u2019ve been in this business for 28 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tend to get one or two products affected by the weather but we are are seeing shortages of courgettes, aubergines, all salad leaves, cucumbers, celery, peppers, tomatoes and broccoli.\u201d New year health kicks create a surge in demand for greens, and Matthews said dieters looking for an alternative to courgettes to whizz through their spiraliser could try carrots, celeriac or even moolis. Suppliers are concerned that Spanish farmers may not be able recover the situation, because the bad weather has also damaged young plants and prevented fresh crops being sown. The disruption means gaps on supermarket shelves are expected to continue as importers scramble to tap supplies from further afield. \u201cThe inclement weather in Greece, Italy and southern France means any contingency sourcing has also been wiped out,\u201d said one senior industry source. \u201cThat means people are now looking further afield to import produce, notably from America \u2013 which given the devaluation of pound versus the dollar and the increase in airfreight charges \u2013 means this will be very expensive for UK consumers and prices will rise on the shelf or there will be gaps on the shelf.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "I have a confession to make. I am a design critic, and my house is full of Ikea products. There are Billy bookcases and Tarva chests of drawers, Vate table lamps and Pokal glasses galore. We have odd 1950s things from junk shops too, stuff made by friends, and one hallowed Eames side table, but it\u2019s certainly no designer den. But according to BBC Antiques Roadshow expert Judith Miller, our global addiction to the Swedish flat-pack giant is a cause for concern, partly to blame for \u201ckilling off the antiques trade\u201d and spawning a national crisis of individual taste. While Ikea continues to boom, operating 392 stores in 48 countries and selling \u00a335bn-worth of cheap \u2019n\u2019 cheerful Scandi goods last year, prices for antiques have plummeted to their lowest levels since the 1930s. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Miller, speaking at a London antiques fair last week. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s laziness, in some ways it\u2019s because we\u2019re quite busy, but I think it\u2019s also people feeling that they don\u2019t know what to buy.\u201d So, in the interests of sparking our impoverished interior imaginations, here are six furniture classics to fuel your junk-shop foraging instincts and get your taste buds going beyond what those nice, blonde, bland boxed kits with funny names and occassionally missing Allen keys have to offer. 1 Emeco 1006, 1944 First built for use on US navy submarines \u2013 and nicknamed the Navy chair as a result \u2013 the Emeco 1006 has become a timeless symbol of no-nonsense American manufacturing, up there with Zippo lighters and button-fly Levis. Going into mass production after the war, it became the standard-issue chair for prisons, hospitals and government offices, and was revived in the 2000s when Philippe Starck was commissioned to produce a range that riffed off the classic design. It might look as if it\u2019s machine cast in a single form, but it is still handmade from rolled sheet aluminium in a two-week long, 77-step process of forming, welding, grinding, heat-treating, finishing and anodizing \u2013 and guaranteed to last 150 years as a result, making it one to hand down to the great-great-grandchildren. Original: \u00a3493 Endless cheap imitations are available, in all manner of colours and materials, from around \u00a350 online. 2 Red Blue Chair, by Gerrit Rietveld, 1918 The Mondrian painting that leapt off the canvas to become a chair, Gerrit Rietveld\u2019s iconic Red Blue Chair might look like a punishing thing to sit on, but it is actually one of the most comfortable of the design classics around \u2013 and much better for you than something squishy, such as Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cGrand Confort\u201d armchair.

As cultural commentator Aline Saarinen (wife of organic modernist architect, Eero) noted in the 1950s, they were at \u201cthe peak of chic around 1900\u201d, but had fallen \u201cto the gutter of derision around 1920 to 1930\u201d. Andy Warhol had a huge Tiffany lamp in his New York apartment, as part of his \u201cVictorian surrealist\u201d interior decor, prompting Saarinen to comment that they are for people who \u201clike what is out of favour for perversity\u2019s sake\u201d. So ugly that they must be great. Originals: \u00a33250 \u2013 \u00a32.3m at auction. They have been so successful over the decades that \u201cTiffany\u201d has become a catch-all word for any kind of stained glass lamp. Thousands of varieties available on eBay, from \u00a330, or have a rummage in your local market. 4 Jacobean joint stool As featured in Neil MacGregor\u2019s A History of the World in 100 Objects, the joint stool is perhaps the most ubiquitous piece of furniture in all of western civilisation, commonplace in European homes of all social classes for centuries. Consisting of four robust turned legs and a simple top, connected by 16 mortise and tenon joints, it was the everyday, all-purpose stool, often used around a dining table, under which they could be tucked when not in use. It is a favourite of V&amp;A furniture curator Nick Humphrey, who describes it as \u201ca 400-year-old workhorse: a stool, a table, something to stand on to reach a shelf \u2013 and often used to rest coffins on. It is a simple witness to life and death.\u201d Jacobean antique version: \u00a315,000 Get scouring your local junk shops and you may well find a bargain, otherwise you can pick up replicas online for around \u00a375. 5 Fornasetti cabinet by Piero Fornasetti /Gio Ponti, 1951 A chunk of Renaissance cityscape compressed into a cabinet, the \u201cTrumeau Architettura\u201d (or architectural cabinet) was a collaboration between Italian surrealist artist Piero Fornasetti and designer Gio Ponti, first shown at the 1951 Milan Triennale. Inspired by 16th-century Italian mannerist art, its doors open to reveal classical colonnades disappearing into the distance, while images of vaulted undercrofts extend below. Lithographs were created for each section, printed on to transfer sheets, and then applied to fibreboard panels \u2013 but you could create your own by printing out a picture of your favourite building and doing a bit of DIY decoupage on your Ikea cupboard, right? Original: \u00a3120,000 EBay and Etsy are crawling with \u201cFornasetti style\u201d furniture, mostly horrible, but a darn sight cheaper than the real thing, with wallpapered wardrobes for about \u00a3175. 6 Opendesk You want that Ikea wardrobe, but it doesn\u2019t quite fit in the alcove? Or you\u2019ve spotted a nice dining table, but it would be better if it was a bit longer? Young east London start-up company Opendesk have invented an ingenious online platform for open-source furniture designs that can be customised, downloaded and made locally, anywhere in the world, cutting out the middle-man supplier and reducing waste, transport and storage costs. As economist John Maynard Keynes put it: \u201cIt is easier to ship recipes than cakes or biscuits.\u201d Sister company WikiHouse is applying the same idea to architecture: in the future you might be downloading your own home.

There are Billy bookcases and Tarva chests of drawers, Vate table lamps and Pokal glasses galore. We have odd 1950s things from junk shops too, stuff made by friends, and one hallowed Eames side table, but it\u2019s certainly no designer den.</p> <p>But according to BBC Antiques Roadshow expert Judith Miller, our global addiction to the Swedish flat-pack giant is a cause for concern, partly to blame for \u201ckilling off the antiques trade\u201d and spawning a national crisis of individual taste. While Ikea continues to boom, operating 392 stores in 48 countries and selling \u00a335bn-worth of cheap \u2019n\u2019 cheerful Scandi goods last year, prices for antiques have plummeted to their lowest levels since the 1930s.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Miller, speaking at a London antiques fair last week. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s laziness, in some ways it\u2019s because we\u2019re quite busy, but I think it\u2019s also people feeling that they don\u2019t know what to buy.\u201d</p> <p>So, in the interests of sparking our impoverished interior imaginations, here are six furniture classics to fuel your junk-shop foraging instincts and get your taste buds going beyond what those nice, blonde, bland boxed kits with funny names and occassionally missing Allen keys have to offer.</p> <h2><strong>1 </strong><a href=\"https://www.emeco.net/variants/emeco-1006-navy-chair-brushed-us-navy\"><strong>Emeco 1006, 1944 </strong></a></h2> <p>First built for use on US navy submarines \u2013 and nicknamed the Navy chair as a result \u2013 the Emeco 1006 has become a timeless symbol of no-nonsense American manufacturing, up there with Zippo lighters and button-fly Levis. Going into mass production after the war, it became the standard-issue chair for prisons, hospitals and government offices, and was revived in the 2000s when Philippe Starck was commissioned to produce a range that riffed off the classic design. It might look as if it\u2019s machine cast in a single form, but it is still handmade from rolled sheet aluminium in a two-week long, 77-step process of forming, welding, grinding, heat-treating, finishing and anodizing \u2013 and guaranteed to last 150 years as a result, making it one to hand down to the great-great-grandchildren.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83ebcdd7a730b88fe198df8b41ebdd97dcf777ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83ebcdd7a730b88fe198df8b41ebdd97dcf777ae/42_403_1925_1155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Emeco 1006 is still handmade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Emeco 1006 is still handmade.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.conranshop.co.uk/1006-navy-side-chair-satin-alu.html\"><strong>Original: \u00a3493</strong></a><br></h2> <p>Endless cheap imitations are available, in all manner of colours and materials, <a href=\"https://www.superestudio.co.uk/chair-navy-line-polypropylene?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Textlink&amp;utm_content=Shopping&amp;utm_campaign=Google_merchant&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiA5IHEBRCLr_PZvq2_6qcBEiQAL4cQ08GSPYEQEGbQJIbeswQq3XRmQKXe8-_ddMwCsHCJo0waAvk18P8HAQ\">from around \u00a350 online</a>.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/4044\">2 Red Blue Chair, by Gerrit Rietveld, 1918</a></strong></h2> <p>The Mondrian painting that leapt off the canvas to become a chair, Gerrit Rietveld\u2019s iconic Red Blue Chair might look like a punishing thing to sit on, but it is actually one of the most comfortable of the design classics around \u2013 and much better for you than something squishy, such as <a href=\"http://imodern.com/le_corbusier_grand_confort_chair.html\">Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cGrand Confort\u201d</a> armchair.

      "bodyText": "The silver lining in China\u2019s disappointing 2016 growth figures was the pickup in performance at the end of the year. Or so it seems. Annualised GDP growth improved to hit 6.8% in the final three months of 2016, compared with the previous quarter\u2019s 6.7%, in a show of strength that a wary Donald Trump will see as further evidence of Beijing\u2019s trading prowess. It is unlikely, however, that the new White House administration will miss the startling fact that it took a 19% increase in public investment and a lighter touch on real estate borrowing to reverse, if only for one quarter, the fortunes of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Without an injection of government funds and higher borrowing by construction companies and developers, both of which Trump plans to emulate, China\u2019s growth would likely have been outside the 6.5% to 7% target range it set itself. As it was, an assessment of 2016 found that its full-year performance was still the weakest in nearly three decades. Beijing and the US are on different paths though. It is widely thought that a Trump stimulus will overload an economy already running at full capacity - think of the obese diner eating a wafer thin mint in Monty Python\u2019s Meaning of Life - while Beijing is managing a long decline in growth as it attempts to wean itself off the diminishing returns from export-led growth. Alarm bells ring when the slowdown is too strong and unemployment begins to grow. President Xi Jinping has reacted to this by switching on the public sector spending taps. Analysts said house prices also surged, but regulators are taking steps to cool the market, which will depress this year\u2019s performance.

      "bodyText": "They\u2019re terrified of Trump Donald Trump has been on everyone\u2019s mind, even though he has been on the other side of the Atlantic this week preparing for his inauguration. Most criticism of the incoming US president was firmly off the record, showing that no one wants to be caught in the firing line of @realdonaldtrump\u2019s Twitter feed. One insider said some US executives are nervous of being seen posing with Chinese leaders, in case the Oval Office saw this as unpatriotic. Banks are off the hook Banks, particularly those stationed in the City of London, have been the unexpected beneficiaries of the new mood of populism sweeping the west. Having been treated as pariahs for causing the global financial crisis, banks are now wooed by all and sundry. The UK government is keen to reassure Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the other Wall Street names that they\u2019ll still be able to operate in the London, while European leaders see the opportunity to steal jobs. Banks are fully aware they\u2019re no longer on the naughty step, and have been dropping hints that they\u2019ll leave London if they don\u2019t get the deal they want. Predictions are out, unless you\u2019re Soros Sir Martin Sorrell, the boss of advertising giant WPP, said he was out of the forecasting game after confidently predicting at last year\u2019s Davos that Hillary Clinton would be US president and Brexit would never happen. This year, the chastened Mystic Megs of Davos were reluctant to put their credentials on the line by calling the French presidential election, for example. But George Soros \u2013 still making headines at 86 \u2013 retains the nerve to predict that markets will soon fall, Theresa May won\u2019t last long, and that US checks and balances will stop Trump being a dictator. We wouldn\u2019t put much money on another Soros idea \u2013 that Britain might quit the EU on a Friday and rejoin on a Monday. Britain gets a cool reception Theresa May and Philip Hammond had the unenviable task of explaining to the overwhelmingly pro-remain crowd at Davos what the government was up to now that the decision had gone the other way. Perhaps understandably, May\u2019s reception was cool rather than rapturous \u2013 even though she sought to reassure her audience that her vision was a global Britain rather than a siege economy. Hammond didn\u2019t help the mood by repeatedly hinting that Britain could slash taxes and burn regulations if it doesn\u2019t get what it wants. Martin Wolf of the FT got a laugh by calling this the \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d option \u2013 but Europe doesn\u2019t get the joke. Yesterday\u2019s men flock to Davos Enoch Powell was wrong when he said every political career ends in failure. For some washed-up politicians, it ends in Davos. George Osborne, a WEF darling only 12 months ago, has gone from debating the global economy with Christine Lagarde to posing with the Clooneys at a swanky drinks reception. Davos\u2019s nightlife is a great chance to relive Oxford student days, and Osborne was seen enjoying a scotch at PR magnate Matthew Freud\u2019s bash at a private chalet at the Schatzalp hotel, only reachable by funicular railway. Other one-time political heavyweights who couldn\u2019t keep away included David Cameron, widely criticised this week for holding the EU referendum, Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson. Climate change fears abound Campaigners are worried that the years of slow progress made on climate change are going to melt away once Trump is in the White House. Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg spoke for many when she warned that Trump might simply not implement the Paris agreement, to keep global warming \u201cwell below\u201d 2C. Activists at Davos told us they were keeping a very close eye on the Trump administration, fearing it will alter or make unavailable vital climate change data. China is flexing its muscles At Davos you know a speaker is a real draw if they manage to fill both the cavernous conference hall and also the overspill room. That was the case for Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s opening address, seen as an attempt by Beijing to seize the mantle of cheerleader for globalisation from Washington. The word on the floor is that China isn\u2019t ready to dislodge the US \u2013 and might not win a trade war either. But it was dominating Davos, with Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma signing a massive Olympic sponsorship deal and chiding America for wasting money on its military rather than spending it on infrastructure. One spin-off for the local economy was that Xi\u2019s 200-strong delegation required 100 drivers, which usually cost 10,000 Swiss francs for a week. Is Sadiq the new Boris? Sadiq Khan packed a lot into just 20 hours at Davos this year. When he wasn\u2019t telling bank chiefs and politicians that London is open for business, he was racing from TV camera to microphone to liveblog to warn that a hard Brexit would rip Britain apart. Labour hasn\u2019t had a lot to cheer about recently, but winning the mayoralty was one bright spot. Judging by UK businesses\u2019 reaction to Khan this week, London chose the right man to fight its corner through the Brexit negotiations. He wouldn\u2019t be the first politician to use City Hall \u2013 and Davos \u2013 as a stepping stone for bigger things.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce sent an agent to \u201cretrieve\u201d an incriminating document from tax officials in India to avoid the investigation and prosecution of its employees. The agent told the engineering giant that he paid a large sum to get the document from authorities, avoiding the company being banned from operating in India for 25 years. The revelation is contained in court documents filed by the Serious Fraud Office as part of the admission by Rolls-Royce that it had acted corruptly in 12 countries, including India. According to the statement of facts on corruption, which was put to the court by the SFO and Rolls-Royce, the individual \u2013 identified only as \u201cIntermediary 4\u201d in court documents \u2013 was the company\u2019s agent on at least two major deals in India, including the sale of engines for BAE Systems Hawk aircraft in 2004. False accounting and conspiracy to bribe foreign officials in India were part of a series of admissions by Rolls-Royce, as Britain\u2019s leading multinational manufacturer agreed to pay \u00a3671m in penalties to settle a long-running corruption investigation by the SFO and regulators in Brazil and the US. However, investigators are still considering whether to prosecute individuals over the endemic corruption at the company that extended over four decades and involved multimillion-dollar bribes to land huge contracts. The engineering giant is under pressure to explain who was responsible for what the high court judge, Sir Brian Leveson, called \u201cegregious criminality over decades\u201d. In the settlement with the SFO, Rolls-Royce stated it had used Intermediary 4 as an agent for several years. In January 2006, Indian tax inspectors visited Rolls-Royce\u2019s Delhi office and removed a list of Rolls-Royce\u2019s advisers. The list included several companies connected to Intermediary 4. By February, Rolls-Royce employees in London were discussing the retrieval of the list, because of concerns that an investigation could subject the company to \u201cvigorous and possibly public hostile scrutiny\u201d. According to Intermediary 4, \u201csome [Rolls-Royce] employees, including one based in India, would have gone to jail and [Rolls-Royce] would have been closed out of the Indian market for 25 years.\u201d At the time, it was illegal for companies to use unregistered intermediaries in defence deals in India, so there were concerns that the adviser list could trigger a more extensive investigation. Intermediary 4 was told to retrieve the document from the tax authorities. \u201cThere is an inference that this involved payment to a tax inspector,\u201d stated the SFO. The SFO also noted that \u201cwhile [Rolls-Royce] could accept no legal or fiscal liability for Intermediary 4\u2019s action, they were however grateful and should look to see if mutually beneficial future business through which [Rolls-Royce] could give tangible form to that gratitude\u201d. By the end of April, senior Rolls-Royce figures were informed that the situation had been resolved. The next month, seven contracts were signed and \u201cit is accepted that these contracts were the mechanism by which [Rolls-Royce] made payments to Intermediary 4 in connection to the adviser list\u201d. Over a period of five months, Rolls-Royce paid \u00a31.85m to entities connected to Intermediary 4. In 2007, Rolls-Royce agreed to enter into an agreement with one of Intermediary 4\u2019s companies to establish a warehouse facility in Dubai. According to the SFO, the warehouse facility had an \u201cancillary purpose\u201d which was to provide \u201ca means of remunerating Intermediary 4 for assistance provided on [defence] contracts\u201d. Intermediary 4 had been involved in brokering an agreement between Rolls-Royce and Hindustan Aeronautics, an Indian state-owned defence company, helping increase a licensing fee from the Indian government from \u00a34m to \u00a37.5m. Hindustan Aeronautics declined to comment. Four years later Rolls-Royce decided to terminate the relationship with Intermediary 4. At this point, Intermediary 4 reminded Rolls-Royce executives about his assistance with the adviser list. According to court documents: \u201cAt the meeting, Intermediary 4 mentioned the help Intermediary 4 had given to RR in resolving the tax difficulty in the RR India office in 2006, that Intermediary 4 had paid out a lot more than received from RR to resolve the matter.\u201d Anti-corruption campaigners have said that while Rolls-Royce has accepted criminality on a corporate basis, it is also crucial that the individuals responsible are held to account in the criminal courts. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson said:\u201cRolls-Royce has committed to full ongoing co-operation with the authorities and must avoid the risk of prejudicing any potential future prosecutions. As a result, we cannot comment on individuals or the specific conduct set out in the statement of facts included in the collective agreements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Luxury department store Harrods has agreed to let staff keep 100% of the money raised from restaurant tips following a union campaign. The store was targeted by protesters earlier this month after it emerged that the retailer, which is owned by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, kept 50% of the discretionary 12.5% service charge automatically added to diners\u2019 bills. The retailer has also announced that it is reducing its service charge rate to 10% to give customers more discretion over the amount they wish to contribute. The campaign, first reported by the Guardian at the beginning of January, was organised by the United Voices of the World (UVW) union, which argued the Knightsbridge retailer was shortchanging more than 450 kitchen and waiting staff who worked in its restaurants. \u201cWe are delighted to have won this amazing victory against the richest department store in the world,\u201d said UVW\u2019s general secretary, Petros Elia. \u201cThe victory sends out a clear message to the rest of the restaurant and hospitality industry that workers are no longer going to accept anything less than 100% of the tips. The success of the campaign at Harrods offers a powerful model to follow for other workers across the industry.\u201d Earlier this month Harrods confirmed it was reviewing the way the service charge was distributed and on Friday confirmed an \u201cimproved tronc system\u201d was being introduced that would mean 100% of the charge\u2019s proceeds would be handed directly to staff. A tronc, from the French tronc des pauvres meaning poor box or alms box, is used to describe a central pool that automatically shares out tips and discretionary service charges. \u201cOver recent months, Harrods has been meeting with restaurant employees to discuss the system through which it distributes service charge,\u201d said a Harrods spokeswoman. \u201cThis has been in order to review all aspects of the current system and ensure that the service charge is distributed fairly to all restaurant staff. Following these discussions, Harrods is announcing a new system whereby 100% of a discretionary 10% service charge will be distributed directly to staff.\u201d The use of \u201ctronc\u201d systems has proved controversial because a number of companies have used them to retain a portion of the service charge without customers or staff necessarily being aware that was the case. Harrods said the only deductions from the service charge under the new arrangement would be the \u201cminor administration cost\u201d of the tronc. In December the chef Michel Roux Jr admitted that his Michelin-starred restaurant Le Gavroche classed service charge income as revenue rather than tips to be shared among staff. He has since said the restaurant would scrap the charge from the end of January. Roux also apologised following a Guardian report in November which revealed that he had been paying some of his staff less than the minimum wage at his Mayfair restaurant, where the menu includes starters costing as much as \u00a362.80 for lobster mousse with caviar and champagne sauce. Fortnum &amp; Mason, another high-end London department store, is also trying to persuade staff at its Heathrow bar to move over to a tronc system \u2013 but only if they agree to take a cut in basic pay. Fortnum &amp; Mason does not currently distribute any of the 12.5% service charge collected on drinkers\u2019 bills at Heathrow. Harrods said it had also appointed a new, independent \u201ctroncmaster\u201d who would manage the system autonomously on behalf of employees. \u201cAs well as providing a fair arrangement for employees, Harrods wants to ensure that customers are presented with a transparent, reduced service charge, allowing them more discretion in the amount they would like to contribute,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cThe decision aims to be in line with recent government consultation objectives on service charge, which encourage transparency for both employees and customers, while rewarding employees for the service they provide.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tony Blair\u2019s failure to control the flow of workers from eastern Europe fuelled the anti-immigration sentiment that led to the UK\u2019s Brexit vote, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the chancellor launched a strongly worded attack on the former prime minister\u2019s open-door policy when eight former communist countries joined the EU in 2004. Britain was one of only three countries \u2013 alongside Sweden and Ireland \u2013 that decided to have no transitional arrangements to limit the flow of people from eastern Europe looking for work and Hammond said the results of that decision were still being felt. The chancellor said the Brexit vote was not the result of the anti-trade and anti-globalisation feeling that manifested itself in the US presidential race. \u201cBut what there was clearly was a strong strand of feeling against uncontrolled migration. And I lay the responsibility for that squarely at the door of prime minister Blair who failed to impose transitional regime in the UK in 2004. \u201cSo while other countries in Europe smoothly transitioned the A8 members [Accession 8] and the freedom of movement from A8 members Britain took the full force of the tide in 2004, and that created a public perception which we still haven\u2019t shaken off to this day.\u201d Hammond said the UK was not anti-migration and that only a minority thought the borders should be completely closed. \u201cIt is very important to the British people that we control our borders, but most of them do not want to use that control to shut the borders, they simply want to have the control,\u201d he said. The chancellor said departure from the EU and from the single market did not mean there would be no migration. He said Britain would want to attract skilled workers but wanted the ability to control the flow of unskilled, cheap labour. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve said clearly is that we cannot accept the principle of free movement,\u201d Hammond said, adding that any EU national could simply change their place of residence from Bulgaria or Romania to the UK. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept that any more.\u201d Oxford university professor Ngaire Woods said it would be a serious mistake if Britain included foreign students in its immigration curbs post-Brexit. \u201cIf we make them part of Britain\u2019s immigration debate we\u2019ve smashing our own kneecaps before even beginning the race. \u201cDon\u2019t kneecap your best asset. Let us thrive, make sure that immigration policies tell the world that Britain is open and welcoming to the best most entrepreneurial, energetic talent from all over, without restraint and constraint.\u201d Hammond said the government had no intention of kneecapping itself and would still need migrants for an economy operating at close to full employment. The chancellor said the UK economy had confounded those predicting immediate dire consequences from the result of the referendum in June, largely due to the resilience of consumer spending. But he warned that growth was set to slow this year as the impact of the weaker pound raised inflation and eroded spending power. \u201cA floating exchange rate is a smooth and efficient transmission mechanism that deals very effectively with an external shock,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cBut currency depreciation is now feeding into inflation which will increasingly affect consumer behaviour this year, hence the lower forecast for growth in 2017.\u201d When the figures for the fourth quarter of last year are released later this month, it is expected that the economy will grow by around 2% in 2016. The expectation is that expansion will be about 1.5% in 2017.",

Let us thrive, make sure that immigration policies tell the world that Britain is open and welcoming to the best most entrepreneurial, energetic talent from all over, without restraint and constraint.\u201d</p> <p>Hammond said the government had no intention of kneecapping itself and would still need migrants for an economy operating at close to full employment.</p> <p>The chancellor said the UK economy had confounded those predicting immediate dire consequences from the result of the referendum in June, largely due to the resilience of consumer spending.<br></p> <p>But he warned that growth was set to slow this year as the impact of the weaker pound raised inflation and eroded spending power.</p> <p>\u201cA floating exchange rate is a smooth and efficient transmission mechanism that deals very effectively with an external shock,\u201d the chancellor said.</p> <p>\u201cBut currency depreciation is now feeding into inflation which will increasingly affect consumer behaviour this year, hence the lower forecast for growth in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>When the figures for the fourth quarter of last year are released later this month, it is expected that the economy will grow by around 2% in 2016. The expectation is that expansion will be about 1.5% in 2017.</p>",

On the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration as president, Soros delivered a scathing assessment, saying the \u201cimpostor and con-man\u201d was \u201cgearing up for a trade war\u201d which would have \u201ca very far-reaching effect in Europe and other parts of the world\u201d. The \u201cwould-be-dictator \u2026 didn\u2019t expect to win, he was surprised\u201d, Soros told an audience of business leaders and journalists in Davos where the World Economic Forum is being held. \u201cI personally have confidence that he\u2019s going to fail \u2026 because his ideas that guide him are inherently self-contradictory,\u201d added Soros, who was a supporter of Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Soros said he expected financial markets to \u201cnot do very well\u201d because of the uncertainty generated by the Trump administration. On Theresa May and Brexit, Soros predicted economic upheaval in Britain and substantial difficulties in bringing about a clean break with the European Union \u2013 and the prospect of the UK quickly joining again or entering a successor arrangement once the referendum mandate of leaving the EU was fulfilled. \u201cIn my opinion it is unlikely that prime minister May is actually going to remain in power. Already she has a very divided cabinet, a very small majority in parliament. And I think she will not last,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment the people in the UK are in denial. The current economic situation is not as bad as was predicted and they live in hope. But as the currency depreciates, and inflation will be the driving force, this will lead to declining living standards. \u201cThis is going to take some time, but when it does happen they\u2019ll realise that they are earning less than before because wages won\u2019t rise as fast as the cost of living. \u201cThe divorce is going to take a very long time. It\u2019s much harder to divorce than to get married, so I think the desire for rapprochement will develop, and in theory or maybe even in practice you could have a situation in 2019 or 2020 when Britain will leave the EU, because it does have to take place, but they could leave on a Friday but join over the weekend and have the new arrangement in place in Monday morning.\u201d Soros said he hoped both sides would realise they must find some common ground and find common ground to avoid a bitter divorce. The future for Europe looked bleak, Soros said, after a disastrous 2016. Europe had become too complicated, leaving people alienated and anti-European parties gathering force. May, speaking earlier at the forum, said Britain had voted with \u201cdetermination and quiet resolve\u201d to leave the EU but it was \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d in Britain\u2019s interests for Europe to succeed. \u201cBritain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country\u2019s children, and grandchildren too. \u201cWe are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.\u201d With the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers suffered a surprise end-of-year slump in sales in a sign that rising prices since the Brexit vote are starting to hit people\u2019s spending power. Sales volumes dropped by 1.9% in December, the retail industry\u2019s crucial Christmas month, according to official figures. That was the biggest drop since April 2012 and far worse than forecasts for a 0.1% dip in a Reuters poll of economists. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 4.3%, below a forecast for 7.2% growth. Industry experts cautioned against reading too much into a single month\u2019s figures and instead pointed to news of continued growth for the final three months of the year as a whole. Sales from October to December were up by 1.2% on the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, describing the performance as a \u201cstrong end to 2016\u201d. But signs that momentum dipped at the end of the year were taken by economists as a flavour of the pressures to come in 2017 as shoppers adjust to rising prices on the back of a weaker pound. The drop in sterling since the referendum has raised import costs and some of that is now being passed on to consumers. The UK\u2019s main inflation rate hit a two and a half year high in December. Reacting to the retail sales news, Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, called it a \u201cdisastrous December\u201d. \u201cWe know from the CPI [inflation] data earlier in the week that prices rose more than expected in December and now we also know that sales volumes fell. \u201cThis is likely to be the theme for the rest of the year \u2013 higher prices will reduce disposable income and hurt consumer spending growth,\u201d he said. The pound dropped to below $1.23 after the figures, down by 0.4% from the day before, reflecting worries that the squeeze on consumer spending will hit overall economic growth this year. The official retail figures for December contrasted with the largely upbeat tone of retailers\u2019 Christmas trading updates but echoed signs of a slowdown in spending reports from debit card companies. Consumer spending has been the main driving force behind the UK\u2019s relatively strong economic growth since the EU referendum. Figures next week are expected to show the economy continued to grow at a relatively solid pace in the final quarter of 2016. But the slowdown in retail sales fanned fears that consumers will struggle keep up that support to the economy. \u201cDecember\u2019s data delivered some unpleasant omens for this year,\u201d said Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club. \u201cThe squeeze on households\u2019 real incomes is gradually tightening, implying a tough 2017 for retailers.\u201d Month-on-month retail sales figures can be volatile and the ONS focussed instead on the quarterly figures. ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: \u201cRetailers saw a strong end to 2016 with sales in the final quarter up 5.6% on the same period last year, although the amount bought fell between November and December once the effects of Christmas are removed. \u201cThere were some notably strong figures from smaller retailers, in particular butchers, who reported a significant boost in sales in the run up to Christmas.\u201d The ONS reported that small businesses enjoyed an estimated 17.4% rise in sales compared with December 2015. Feedback from businesses, such as butchers, suggested that meat purchases in preparation for Christmas had contributed to good sales, in addition to an extra trading day this December. The largest contribution to the month-on-month fall in sales came from non-food stores, it said. Industry experts said December\u2019s drop in sales should be seen in the context of a boost in November from Black Friday discount events. \u201cAlthough the December figures were down on November, it would be a mistake to focus too heavily on a monthly drop in sales,\u201d said Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter to a retailer whether they generate revenue in November or December. What they care about is their overall performance, and this data shows that the net result for the final quarter was much more impressive this year.\u201d The Bank of England, which cut interest rates to a record low after the EU referendum, has highlighted the role of consumers in propping up growth in recent months. Its governor commented this week that \u201chouseholds appear to be entirely looking through Brexit-related uncertainties\u201d. Mark Carney also flagged a pickup in consumer borrowing and signs that people were dipping into their savings to carry on spending. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the retail sales figures might provide some relief on that front. \u201cThe slowdown in spending growth should help to calm fears that low interest rates are driving an unsustainable credit-fuelled consumer boom. And we expect spending growth to lose some more pace over the coming year as inflation picks up and squeezes growth in households\u2019 real incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with interest rates set to remain low and the cost of servicing debt very manageable, as well as strong confidence by past standards, we expect spending growth to slow, rather than grind to a halt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The judgments on the corruption charges against Rolls-Royce and the statement of facts behind the case clearly implicate former executives within the company. In his judgment, Sir Brian Leveson said the term \u201csenior employees\u201d meant \u201ccommunications by an employee with a superior, or, more significantly, to identify decision-makers who may be argued to represent the corporate mind\u201d. Here are some of the key quotes that highlight the involvement of senior figures within the FTSE 100 engineering group in the scandal between 1989 and 2013. Lord Justice Leveson\u2019s overall judgment on Rolls-Royce \u201cAgainst that background [of the size and importance of Rolls to the UK], it can properly be described as devastating and of the very greatest gravity that the conduct of this institution should fall to be examined within the context of a criminal investigation, and that the investigation (in very large part conducted and voluntarily revealed to the SFO by Rolls-Royce itself) should reveal the most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption (some of which implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company).\u201d On the charges against the company \u201cThe conduct involved senior (on the face of it, very senior) Rolls-Royce employees.\u201d Rolls-Royce\u2019s co-operation with the Serious Fraud Office \u201cThis has been far more extensive than was identified in the public domain; it included written reports revealing further corruption indications and a report concerning conduct Rolls-Royce had known about since 2010 and previously (under different leadership) decided not to notify.\u201d Extract from statement of facts on the case, which was put to court by Serious Fraud Office and the company \u201cIn 1999 RR [Rolls-Royce] issued its first written policy governing the use of intermediaries, administered by MS [marketing services division]. No process for due diligence was specified. Additional approval was required from a senior RR employee where the proposed payment exceeded 5% of the contract price. A revised policy in 2003 extended this additional approval process also to require approval from RR\u2019s CEO.\u201d Extract from statement of facts on corruption in Indonesia \u201cRR senior employees agreed to pay $2.25m and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an intermediary or company controlled by that intermediary.\u201d More on Indonesia \u201cAn internal RR memo dated 17 December 1991, which was sent to RR senior employees, noted that Intermediary 1 had interpreted a previous conversation with an RR employee as a promise to reward him with a Rolls-Royce car if the A330 [Airbus aircraft] deal was won. The memo noted that the car was not part of the CAA [commercial consulting agreement] but: \u201cOne way or another we are going to have to deliver, and recover the costs as best we can. Seen against the future business, particularly in the military field, where to [Intermediary 1] could be obstructive, the cost is not great. I am asking for the best price we can get for a Silver Sprint II.\u201d Extract from statement of facts on corruption in Thailand \u201cBy the end of February 1992 a total of $4.75m had been paid to Intermediary 3. Two of the sums making up that total figure ($1.9m and $2.4m) were authorised at the point of payment by an RR senior employee.\u201d More on Thailand \u201cIn November 1996 an internal RR memo noted that the same employee of Thai [Airways] had asked an RR senior employee to \u2018release\u2019 $1m of the $5m which remained to be paid to Intermediary 3. The memo recommended that payment be made now \u2018so that Thai can use it to \u201cmanage the political process\u201d. \u201989. Three RR senior employees agreed to this.\u2019\u201d Extract from statement of facts on corruption in India \u201cOn or around 23 May 2005, MS [marketing services division] informed an RR senior employee that the \u00a31m was approved in return for securing the \u00a37.5m fee and confirmed that MS supported the proposal. Additional approval was provided by the RR senior employee. On or around 3 June 2005, a more senior RR employee was briefed and, following his approval, all four of the new CCAs [commercial consulting agreements] were signed by RR from 12 July 2005 onwards. All described fixed fees payable for general services.\u201d More on India \u201cBy 20 March 2006 two new CCAs through which RR in London was to make some of its payment to Intermediary 4 had received senior employee approval.\u201d Extract from statement of facts on corruption in Russia \u201cDiscussions with and about the intermediaries were deliberately kept to a small circle within RR by the RR senior employee and other RR employees.\u201d Extract from statement of facts on charge that Rolls gave an Air Asia executive credits worth $3.2m for the maintenance of a private jet \u201cIn early September [2012], as a commercial deal between RR and AAX [Air Asia X] first took shape, the AAX senior employee emailed the RR senior employee to complain about the CorporateCare rate on the private jet. The RR senior employee passed the complaint on to RR employees and noted: \u2018We seem to have a death wish on this subject.\u2019\u201d",
