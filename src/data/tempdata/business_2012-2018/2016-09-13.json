      "bodyText": "In a move as brazen as bookstore destroyer Amazon opening physical bookshops, one of the world\u2019s biggest companies that allows web users to block advertisements from appearing on the sites they visit will start selling ads itself. Adblock Plus is a free piece of software that lets people \u201cblock annoying ads, disable tracking and block domains known to spread malware\u201d. Users can specify which types of ads or online tracking they don\u2019t like, and Adblock Plus\u2019s software \u2013 which the company says is installed on more than 100 million devices \u2013 will make sure they are shielded from those elements. Adblocking technology like that used by Adblock Plus has been blamed for harming online publishers, which rely on advertising revenue to pay for the content they create. According to a report by PageFair, adblockers cost publishers almost $22bn in 2015 alone. But now Adblock Plus is launching a platform to sell \u201cacceptable ads\u201d itself. The company says that its Acceptable Ads Platform will allow publishers and bloggers to choose to sell and show only pre-whitelisted ads \u2013 those that meet Adblock Plus\u2019s strict criteria \u2013 on their websites. Publishers will get to keep 80% of the advertising revenue from ads sold through the marketplace, and the rest will be divided between Adblock Plus and other partners. Since 2011, the company has allowed certain nonintrusive ads to pass through the blocking software and appear as intended. These ads must meet strict criteria in terms of how they are placed and appear. They must not disrupt the user\u2019s natural reading flow, they should always be recognizable as ads, and they shouldn\u2019t be too big. Adblock Plus\u2019s co-founder Till Faider said this new platform will be a good thing for publishers, since they will have the opportunity to show some advertising to people who typically block it. \u201cThere are two ecosystems of online consumers out there right now: the one composed of people who block intrusive ads and the other where people do not. The Acceptable Ads Platform lets publishers reach the former group without changing anything about how they\u2019re reaching the latter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting years for the ad-tech industry to do something consumer-friendly like this, so finally we got tired of waiting and decided to just do it ourselves.\u201d Such good intentions are disputed by key media industry players, who feel that Adblock Plus has deprived them of valuable revenue and fear that it will continue to rule out the possibility of displaying larger ad formats with premium prices. \u201cNo matter how Adblock Plus tries to justify their form of extortion, or make it seem harmless, it is a practice that will continue to erode the value exchange that powers the free and open internet,\u201d said Dave Grimaldi, executive vice-president of public policy at industry body the Interactive Advertising Bureau. \u201cOnline advertising is what enables consumers across the globe to access their favorite websites, songs, and videos, and Adblock Plus continues to ignore the damage its technology is doing to that free-flowing ability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Economic data is viewed these days through the prism of the vote for Brexit and its implications for the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement in November. Philip Hammond should be delighted with the news from the consumer inflation front: the headline rate was stuck at 0.6% in August. It\u2019s as if the post-referendum fall in the value of sterling, which in theory should have caused a few inflationary breezes by now, never happened. That analysis requires heavy qualification, of course. Look at the data from the manufacturing sector to see the pummelled pound in action. After a long period of deflation, the prices of goods bought and sold by producers rose for a second month in a row. At some point, wholesalers and retailers will attempt to shift those pressures on to consumers. They won\u2019t succeed entirely, but nobody seriously thinks inflation will stay at 0.6% for much longer. A pick-up lies around the next corner. But look at life from Hammond\u2019s point of view. An instant post-Brexit surge in inflation would have been seriously bad news. It could have tempted him into cutting VAT as a short-term crowd-pleaser to bring down prices in shops and prop up consumer spending. Lower VAT, one suspects, remains an option but the case is weak and becoming weaker. Incomes are growing at roughly 2.5% and even the City\u2019s most hawkish pundits don\u2019t see inflation reaching 2% until the middle of next year. So best to keep a cut in VAT \u2013 which, remember, would cost the Treasury \u00a314bn a year if the reduction was from 20% to 17.5% \u2013 in reserve for stormier days. Hammond should use the period of relative calm \u2013 in growth and inflation \u2013 to boost investment, especially public spending on infrastructure. Whether it\u2019s housing, transport (but, please, not the dreaded HS2 white elephant) or energy generation, the case for addressing the UK\u2019s under-spending by international standards is compelling. Payback on long-term projects can be slow. But, with a following wind, Hammond could reasonably expect to be looking at GDP growth of 2% and inflation at, say, 3% in 2018. We\u2019d settle for that. In defence of Barroso You might assume a pension of \u20ac15,000-a-month would be quite enough to ensure you never have to work for Goldman Sachs. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, former president of the European commission, feels differently. He\u2019s taken the job of chairing Goldman\u2019s subsidiary in London and has caused a stink back in euro-land. Strip him of his pension, demands an online petition originating in Brussels. The appointment is \u201cmorally unacceptable,\u201d declares French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who may have one eye on his lowly popularity rating. A storm of protest was inevitable, of course. Brussels is a lobbyist\u2019s paradise and the sight of the commission\u2019s former chief switching sides to take Goldman\u2019s shilling inspires little confidence in the transparency of the system. Yet Barroso, as he cries \u201cdiscrimination\u201d, makes a reasonable point. There are rules to cover what former commissioners can do after leaving office and he appears to have followed them to the letter. He waited the required 18 months to take the gig. And, since Brussels has not declared Goldman to be a uniquely evil institution, how is he supposed to have breached the requirement to act with \u201cintegrity and discretion\u201d out of office? Goldman may have helped the Greek government to massage its debts to get into the euro (the tale is contested), but the bank is regulated to operate in the internal market. Jean-Claude Juncker, Barroso\u2019s successor, has tried to quell the row by saying Barroso will be denied the usual red carpet treatment for former presidents if he turns up in Brussels on Goldman business. That seems a fair response, even if Juncker may be making policy on the hoof. But it\u2019s hard to understand on what grounds the commission\u2019s \u201cad hoc ethical committee\u201d could go further. If Goldman is an unsuitable retirement home for former bureaucrats addicted to the limelight, explain why Deutsche Bank, say, would get a thumbs-up. This affair carries a strong anti-American and anti-London current. Uber drivers need help Uber\u2019s squeals of discrimination get no sympathy, however. The US taxi-hailing app firm thinks London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s plan to offer limited protection to black cabs \u201cwill cost drivers who use Uber hundreds of pounds and thousands may lose their livelihoods as a result\u201d. If Uber thinks Khan\u2019s modest measures are really so severe, there\u2019s a simple remedy. Give its drivers a financial helping-hand to cover the costs of extra insurance and language lessons. Uber is valued at $60bn (\u00a345bn); it could afford to be generous and recognise a few obligations to raise standards for customers.",

    "webTitle": "Why the US economy is crucial to the election \u2013 in six charts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Census Bureau released its annual look at US household incomes on Tuesday, the most detailed report on the financial health of the nation in the run-up to the 2016 election. The economy is once again the central background of the 2016 campaign. The data confirmed what the Obama administration has been trying to convince American voters of for more than a year: the US economic recovery is here. But it also highlighted how much work remains to be done. Here are the six charts that could decide who takes the White House come November. Median household income Yes, the median household income saw its first significant increase since 2007 last year, rising by 5.2%. It\u2019s the first rise since the recession and since Obama was elected, and it\u2019s clearly a significant moment. But, for perspective, that increase brings the median household income up to $56,516 a year, which is about where it was back in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, Americans today are bringing home 2.4% less than they were at the turn of the millennium. It\u2019s no wonder that so many feel as though they haven\u2019t had a significant raise in years \u2013 because they haven\u2019t. Job creation An additional 1.4 million people found full-time work in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. Job creation has been one of the highlights of Obama\u2019s presidency. His administration often likes to point out that his presidency saw the longest streak of job creation on record. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation and the 77th consecutive month of private-sector job growth. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has described the jobs added as \u201cbad jobs\u201d and promised that if elected he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs-producing president that God ever created\u201d. Racial divide While everyone\u2019s income went up in 2015, a large racial divide remains. The median household income for white Americans in 2015 was $63,000. That\u2019s 70% more than the median household income of black Americans, which was $36,898. Hispanic households saw the greatest jump in median income. Their income went up by 6.1%, reaching $45,148. Trump, who lags Clinton by a wide margin with minority voters, has argued the Democrats have failed African Americans and Latinos economically. Polls suggest that his message is not yet hurting Clinton. Income inequality The census does not have to single out the top 1% of Americans in order to make a point about income inequality in the US. According to its data, the top 5% of Americans had a median household income of $214,500, while the bottom 50% had a median income of $56,500. And the bottom 10%? Their median household income was $13,300. Bernie Sanders railed against income inequality, and in the primaries at least, so did Clinton and Trump. The two one-percenters have been major beneficiaries of the widening income gap. Gender wage gap In 2015, the gender wage gap shrank by a penny. This means that women earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men that year, up from 79 cents the year before. Clinton has long called for equal pay. While serving in the US Senate, she co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which despite being introduced in every Congress since 1997 has yet to pass. Speaking at the Republican national convention, Ivanka Trump promised that her father too would fight for equal pay for women. \u201cHe will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,\u201d she said. Millions still in poverty In 2015, the US poverty rate dropped by 1.2%. However, there are still 43.1 million people living in poverty in the US, up from 38 million in 2007. Neither candidate has made poverty a major focus of their campaign. The poor are much less likely to vote than the rich.",

The economy is once again the central background of the 2016 campaign. </p> <p>The data confirmed what the Obama administration has been trying to convince American voters of for more than a year: the US economic recovery is here. But it also highlighted how much work remains to be done.</p> <p>Here are the six charts that could decide who takes the White House come November.</p> <h2>Median household income</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c3d8daa9215c622f1c9089137ec5dd9ec8ff4e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c3d8daa9215c622f1c9089137ec5dd9ec8ff4e9/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Median US household income\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Median US household income.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Census Bureau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, the median household income saw its first significant increase since 2007 last year, rising by 5.2%. It\u2019s the first rise since the recession and since Obama was elected, and it\u2019s clearly a significant moment. But, for perspective, that increase brings the median household income up to $56,516 a year, which is about where it was back in 1999. Adjusted for inflation, Americans today are bringing home 2.4% less than they were at the turn of the millennium. It\u2019s no wonder that so many feel as though they haven\u2019t had a significant raise in years \u2013 because they haven\u2019t. </p> <h2>Job creation </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/jobs-report-added/\" data-alt=\"US jobs growth\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/04/jobs-report-added/\">US jobs growth</a> </figure>  <p>An additional 1.4 million people found full-time work in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. Job creation has been one of the highlights of Obama\u2019s presidency. His administration often likes to point out that his presidency saw the longest streak of job creation on record. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/02/us-jobs-report-august-economy\">August was the 71st</a> consecutive month of overall job creation and the 77th consecutive month of private-sector job growth.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has described the jobs added as \u201cbad jobs\u201d and promised that if elected he would be \u201cthe greatest jobs-producing president that God ever created\u201d.</p> <h2>Racial divide</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47f168bef223e33fb2b32722d55e5ce3a34abb81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47f168bef223e33fb2b32722d55e5ce3a34abb81/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Median household income by race\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Median household income by race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: US Census Bureau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While everyone\u2019s income went up in 2015, a large racial divide remains. The median household income for white Americans in 2015 was $63,000. That\u2019s 70% more than the median household income of black Americans, which was $36,898. </p> <p>Hispanic households saw the greatest jump in median income. Their income went up by 6.1%, reaching $45,148. Trump, who lags Clinton by a wide margin with minority voters, has argued the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/17/donald-trump-appeals-to-black-voters-in-attempt-to-offset-dismal-polling\">Democrats have failed African Americans and Latinos</a> economically. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-attempts-woo-black-voters-having-opposite-effect-n642331\">Polls suggest</a> that his message is not yet hurting Clinton.</p> <h2>Income inequality</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13b8d7e80c206833e94dcf5907890ee7be6e35c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13b8d7e80c206833e94dcf5907890ee7be6e35c5/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Household income by percentile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The census does not have to single out the top 1% of Americans in order to make a point about income inequality in the US. According to its data, the top 5% of Americans had a median household income of $214,500, while the bottom 50% had a median income of $56,500. And the bottom 10%? Their median household income was $13,300. Bernie Sanders railed against income inequality, and in the primaries at least, so did Clinton and Trump. The two one-percenters have been major beneficiaries of the widening income gap.</p> <h2>Gender wage gap</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc979d7e2489e8586a4604b90f288c319866d22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc979d7e2489e8586a4604b90f288c319866d22/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"earnings by gender\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015, the gender wage gap shrank by a penny. This means that women earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men that year, up from 79 cents the year before. Clinton has long called for equal pay. While serving in the US Senate, she co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which despite being introduced in every Congress since 1997 has yet to pass. </p> <p>Speaking at the Republican national convention, Ivanka Trump promised that her father too would fight for equal pay for women. \u201cHe will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,\u201d she said. </p> <h2>Millions still in poverty</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c576b6624099cc40e74de7168ee7df256be4b97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c576b6624099cc40e74de7168ee7df256be4b97/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"poverty rate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015, the US poverty rate dropped by 1.2%.

      "bodyText": "Senior figures from Britain\u2019s music industry have called on the government to help them defeat \u201cprofiteering\u201d touts at an industry summit on live music ticketing. Agents, promoters and musicians met to discuss how to ensure tickets go directly to fans rather than being traded purely for profit via secondary websites such as Viagogo and Get Me In! Several of them warned that politicians were not doing enough to protect the live music industry, which was worth \u00a3904m to the economy in 2015 according to the lobby group UK Music. Prof Michael Waterson, who led a government-backed review into ticketing, admitted during the event he fears his proposals for solving the problem may be \u201cpushed into the long grass\u201d. Campaign group FanFair Alliance said touts were \u201cprofiteering via under-regulated resale sites\u201d. \u201cWe urgently need government to address these failings and make legislation effective for the digital age,\u201d it said in a statement. Ben Lovett, a founding member of the band Mumford &amp; Sons, said: \u201cThey [touts] are doing it very secretly because they know it\u2019s morally wrong but it\u2019s not currently legally wrong so there are no repercussions.\u201d He called for measures to tackle the use of bots, automated programmes that help touts harvest tickets quickly for resale at a markup. Ian McAndrew, founder and chief executive of Wildlife Entertainment, who has worked with acts such as Arctic Monkeys and Travis, said existing consumer rights law was being ignored and called for touts who flout it to be penalised. The Labour peer Lady Hayter, who also spoke at the event, said legislation was \u201cabsolutely key\u201d. But Waterson said he was growing concerned at the lack of government action. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s delayed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it will be pushed into the long grass. I do intend to raise the issue if I don\u2019t get a response. I haven\u2019t had one.\u201d The summit, organised by the Music Managers\u2019 Forum and live music website Songkick in London on Tuesday, comes amid mounting dismay that touts can hoover up tickets the moment they go on sale and then list them on secondary websites for huge markups. Bands such as influential US rock outfit Pixies have taken their own steps to combat touting in an attempt to loosen their grip on the UK market. Waterson\u2019s review proposed new measures to address secondary ticketing, including an investigation into whether existing consumer rights law is being broken. The Consumer Rights Act demands that ticket resellers publish information such as the face value of the ticket and the seat number, but Waterson said enforcement of the rules was patchy. \u201cWe want to see the existing legislation in the Consumer Rights Act enforced,\u201d said Matt Jones, the chief executive of Songkick. Waterson told the summit he was concerned that the issue had been a low priority with \u201cvery little focus on enforcing the legislation\u201d. His review urged secondary ticketing websites to make more effort to identify traders who use the sites purely to make money and suggested setting up a licensing system for touts. Ticket resale is illegal or strictly limited in countries such as France, Italy and Norway. The government is expected to wait for the result of a Competition and Markets Authority report into whether ticket companies are complying with the law, which is due by the end of the year. The digital and creative industries minister, Matt Hancock, gave a speech on protecting UK artists last week but did not address ticketing. A spokesperson for the Department for Culture Media and Sport said: \u201cThe government\u2019s response to Professor Waterson\u2019s report will be published in due course.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A sharp slowdown in global oil demand growth will put a lid on prices, according to the International Energy Agency, which said ballooning oil stocks and rising supply would also mean the crude market is likely to be oversupplied through the first six months of 2017. The IEA report published on Tuesday tallied with a gloomy forecast by the Opec oil cartel about the prospects for demand over the next year, sending oil prices down to $47 (\u00a335) a barrel. The IEA said global oil demand growth had slackened by more than previously thought following a slowdown in global trade that offset higher demand in China. Without a strong rise in oil prices, major importers such as Britain, Japan and most of Europe are likely to see only muted pressure on petrol prices. In its September oil market report, the organisation said it anticipated global demand growth to rise by 1.3m barrels a day in 2016, 100,000 below the previous forecast. The IEA anticipates a further slowdown next year, down to 1.2m barrels a day \u201cas underlying macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain\u201d. The Paris-based organisation also said world oil supplies remained near record levels despite a 300,000-barrels-a-day drop in August. The fall was largely the result of lower output from countries outside the Opec oil cartel and was offset by production from Opec countries, which include Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela. The weak outlook contrasts with the agency\u2019s last forecast a month ago for supply and demand to be broadly in balance over the rest of this year and for stocks of oil to fall swiftly. The IEA\u2019s latest comments followed a bearish outlook from Opec the day before. Brent crude prices fell to $47.40 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate futures declined by $1.03 to $45.26 a barrel. \u201cIt seems the situation has deteriorated strongly in the eyes of Opec as well as the IEA,\u201d Commerzbank head of commodities strategy Eugen Weinberg told Reuters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see this price weakness continue for a while right now, because that was not on the cards, in our opinion.\u201d Upbeat Chinese data on industrial output growth for August failed to lift oil prices as the crude market remained in a profit-taking mode, traders said. China\u2019s industrial output grew the fastest in five months as demand for products from coal to cars rebounded thanks to higher government spending and a year-long credit and property boom.",

The fall was largely the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/24/scottish-finances-worsen-fall-oil-revenues-15bn-deficit\">result of lower output from countries outside the Opec oil cartel</a> and was offset by production from Opec countries, which include Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela.</p> <p>The weak outlook contrasts with the agency\u2019s last forecast a month ago for supply and demand to be broadly in balance over the rest of this year and for stocks of oil to fall swiftly. </p> <p>The IEA\u2019s latest comments followed a bearish outlook from Opec the day before. </p> <p>Brent crude prices fell to $47.40 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate futures declined by $1.03 to $45.26 a barrel. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt seems the situation has deteriorated strongly in the eyes of Opec as well as the IEA,\u201d Commerzbank head of commodities strategy Eugen Weinberg told Reuters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see this price weakness continue for a while right now, because that was not on the cards, in our opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Upbeat Chinese data on industrial output growth for August <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/06/oil-prices-plummet-oversupply-global-markets\">failed to lift oil prices</a> as the crude market remained in a profit-taking mode, traders said. <br></p> <p>China\u2019s industrial output grew the fastest in five months as demand for products from coal to cars rebounded thanks to higher government spending and a year-long credit and property boom. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Football Pools, once a staple of the British Saturday teatime as families crowded around TVs and radios with fingers crossed for eight score draws, is to change hands in a near \u00a3100m deal. The National Lottery came close to killing off the pools, but 300,000 people still spend an average of just over \u00a33 a week in the hope of scooping the maximum prize of \u00a33m. The three big pools operators, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters merged between 2000 and 2007. The owners, Sportech, after many years of dwindling profits, have now agreed to sell to a new company run by the existing management for \u00a397.3m. The buyers are pinning their hopes on an online revival, with players still able to \u201cperm eight from ten\u201d football matches \u2013 but rather than resting on the result from Bury v Workington, online punters are offered Barcelona v Celtic or Paris St Germain v Arsenal. Spot the Ball, the game on the reverse of the paper coupons, can also be played online. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s the pools had 15 million regular punters, helped by an army of door-to-door coupon collectors. When Leeds factory worker Viv Nicholson and husband Keith promised to \u201cspend, spend, spend\u201d after bagging \u00a3152,319 in a 1961 pools win \u2013 equal to around \u00a33m today \u2013 they captured the spirit of the new consumer age, and prompted atabloid frenzy. But Keith Nicholson died in 1965 and by the end of the 60s the fortune was gone after Viv spent compulsively. Viv Nicholson died last year. Football pools started in 1923 when Littlewoods sold them outside Manchester United\u2019s Old Trafford ground. Its success drew criticism from politicians and religious leaders, with the then Labour leader, Ramsay MacDonald, calling it \u201ca disease which spread downwards to the industrious poor from the idle rich\u201d. The game allowed players to place small stakes on football results with the chance of winning a big prize from the pooled money. The pools says it has paid out \u00a33.2bn in prize money to more than 61 million people. Players, often in workplace syndicates, filled in paper coupons that they submitted by post or through an agent. The aim of the main game was, and still is, to predict eight score draws, although the pools now has various add-on games. After the harsh winter of 1963, when football matches were scrapped for three weeks running, the \u2018Pools Panel\u2019 was created to predict scores, and such was the intense interest they were broadcast live on BBC television. Robert James, senior lecturer in history at Portsmouth University, said: \u201cThe pools was significant because it gave the working class a sense of identity and community and of aspiration to something better by winning something. \u201cFootball was seen as the working class game and the pools helped give people a sense of community through leisure. They didn\u2019t have to be at the game to debate about it. The pools also helped legitimise gambling because initially gambling was illegal and was done through the bookie\u2019s runner and it was secretive and underhand.\u201d Rival operations such as Vernons and Zetters sprang up and by the 1980s around one-in-four of the British population were doing the pools. In 1986, Littlewoods paid out the first \u00a31m jackpot when \u00a31,017,890 was shared by 11 nurses from Devizes in Wiltshire. Sportech bought Littlewoods Gaming, which included the pools, in 2000 and in 2007 it acquired Vernons and Zetters. Combining the three pools was meant to strengthen the game against the National Lottery, which launched in 1994. But the pools struggled against the might of the lottery. It still had 10 million players in 1994, but this fell to 700,000 by 2007 and has halved again since. Sportech said it stabilised earnings in the first half of this year and decided the time was right to sell and focus on its US gaming businesses. Sportech said: \u201cThe board of Sportech believes that the proposed disposal represents an attractive opportunity to realise the value of The Football Pools following the implementation of its modernisation programme.\u201d A new company will float on the stock market after raising funds from investors. It will be run by Conleth Byrne, managing director of the Football Pools, and Carl Lynn, its finance director. Other ways to win The national lottery Was set up by John Major\u2019s government and is operated by Camelot, which recently said that more than \u00a335bn had been raised for good causes since it started running the lottery in 1994. The ticket price of the twice-weekly main Lotto game was increased to \u00a32 in 2013, and Camelot later changed the prizes, guaranteeing to pay out \u00a31m to someone each week. Players select six numbers from 1 to 59 (previously it was 49) or pick Lucky Dip. Its other games include EuroMillions and Thunderball. Colin and Chris Weir from the Scottish town of Largs won \u00a3161m on EuroMillions in 2011, making them the biggest lottery winners in Europe. However, the price of a EuroMillions ticket will rise from \u00a32 to \u00a32.50 on 24 September. People\u2019s postcode lottery A charity lottery where, for \u00a310 a month, you use your postcode to try to win prizes. It claims that since 2005 players have raised more than \u00a3142m for charities and community projects. The most a single ticket can win is 10% of the draw revenue, up to a maximum of \u00a3400,000. Of every \u00a31 spent, a minimum of 30p goes to charity, 40p is used for prizes and 30p is used to cover the expenses in running the lotteries. In 2016 it expects to raise more than \u00a340m for charity. Novamedia, the parent company of People\u2019s Postcode Lottery, operates similar schemes in the Netherlands and Sweden. The health lottery This is not a national lottery: it\u2019s 51 local society lotteries, each representing one or more local authority areas across Britain, aimed at raising money for health-related good causes. Each local society lottery takes turns at participating. It costs \u00a31 to play each line, and there are 32,000 participating retailers, or it can be played online. Twenty pence in every \u00a31 goes to support good causes. The top prize, for matching five numbers, is equal to 10% of total ticket sales, capped at \u00a3100,000. Projects that receive funding include support for older people to keep fit, respite programmes to give carers a break, and healthy living initiatives.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jane Shepherdson has left Whistles eight years after becoming co-owner of the fashion label which she has re-invented. The former Topshop boss nurtured Whistles into one of the high street\u2019s most well-regarded brands, helping to earn her a CBE for services to UK retail business in 2014. Shepherdson\u2019s departure comes less than six months after Whistles was bought out by South Africa\u2019s Foschini Group. At the time of the takeover, Shepherdson retained her 20% stake and said she was committed to remaining at the company. The brand\u2019s fans include the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron and its clothes are stocked by Bloomingdale\u2019s in the US and Harrods in the UK. Foschini said it wanted to expand the company, which added a menswear range in 2014, into new markets. But on Tuesday, Whistles confirmed that Shepherdson, who has already signed off the brand\u2019s spring/summer and autumn/winter 2017 collections, had stepped down. A spokesperson told Vogue she had left to \u201cwork on her charity projects and is planning to travel, initially spending time on the west coast of America\u201d. Sherpherdson will hand over to brand director Helen Williamson, managing director Justin Hampshire, and creative director Nick Passmore. One source said Shepherdson had disagreed with the new owners over the running of the business and its attempts to introduce processes used at some of the other brands it owns, such as Phase Eight. Whistles said after experiencing challenging trading conditions last year, the company had returned to profitability in 2016 as customers responded well to its spring and summer collections. Jane Shepherdson said: \u201cI am really proud of what we have achieved at Whistles.\u201d Ben Barnett, chairman of Whistles, added: \u201cWe would like to thank Jane for her outstanding contribution to the rebuilding of the Whistles brand. She has established a clear direction for the future development of the brand and in Helen, Justin and Nick we are privileged to have an exceptional management team to realise this vision.\u201d The loss of Shepherdson is likely to be a blow for Whistles. She became one of the most influential people in British fashion during her time at Topshop. Having worked her way up from the shop floor, Shepherdson took over as brand director of Topshop in 1999. Within six years, profits had gone from \u00a39m to \u00a3110m, and had become a retail sensation. It is now the cornerstone of former BHS owner Sir Philip Green\u2019s empire with stores around the world. Founded in 1976 by husband and wife team Richard and Lucille Lewin, Whistles has endured fluctuating fortunes over the years. Shepherdson\u2019s buyout was backed by the former Icelandic retail investment group Baugur, which collapsed in 2009. The group later refinanced with some loans from the then nationalised Glitnir bank.",

Foschini said it wanted to expand the company, which added a menswear range in 2014, into new markets.</p> <p>But on Tuesday, Whistles confirmed that Shepherdson, who has already signed off the brand\u2019s spring/summer and autumn/winter 2017 collections, had stepped down.

      "bodyText": "A fall in the oil price after a report from the International Energy Agency forecast a continuing supply glut, plus renewed concerns about a US rate rise next week, sent shares lower once more after a brief attempt at revival. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Both European and US markets have turned lower once more this afternoon, as the relief brought by predictably dovish comments from Fed member Brainard soon evaporated. Coming out of the summer lull, it seems volatility is back with a bang, leaving many struggling to get a handle on where exactly it has come from. Despite a perceived hawkish shift from some Fed rate setters, driving a flight out of stocks and into the dollar, September still seems too early for the next US rate increase and it is still a coin toss whether one will happen in 2016. Crude prices have suffered after yet another downbeat assessment of the sector, this time from the IEA which cut its demand forecasts for the year ahead. Even if OPEC and Russia manage to reach a supply freeze deal, output would still be maintained at near record highs while demand falters. There is little surprise that we are seeing the bears come back into play to take advantage of the misguided ramp up in price recently. Brent crude is currently down more than 2% at $47.25 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2.6% to $45.07. On the European markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 35.27 points or 0.53% to 6665.63 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.43% to 10,386.60 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.19% lower at 4387.18 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 1.74% down at 16,547.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.61% at 8724.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.05% at 556.96 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 249 points or 1.36%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The bounce that followed comments last night from Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard suggesting that US interest rate rises should be kept in check has faded. Instead investors have revisited concerns that next week\u2019s Fed meeting could after all see an increase in borrowing costs. Meanwhile a fall in crude oil prices after the International Energy Agency warned of a glut until the middle of next year has also soured sentiment. So Wall Street is sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 240 points or 1.35 and sending European markets to their lowest levels of the day. There are exceptions however (or one at least): Apple is benefitting from some positive comments about the recently revealed iPhone 7, with good initial sales figures. The pound continues to decline, after UK inflation came in below expectations and made any move by the Bank of England to raise rates a more distant prospect. The Bank meets this week to decide its next move, but economists believe it is very unlikely there will be any change in its stance. Sterling has dropped more than 1% on the day to $1.3171, while against the euro it is down 1.23% at \u20ac1.1720. Here\u2019s our story about Sports Direct and MPs concerns about its ties with employment agency Transline. Sarah Butler writes: MPs have called on Sports Direct to end its relationship with Transline, which supplies workers for the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, over fears that the employment agency misled a parliamentary inquiry. Iain Wright, Labour MP and chair of the Commons business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, which published a damning report on Sports Direct in July, has written to the retailer\u2019s founder and majority shareholder Mike Ashley saying he believed Transline was not candid about the reasons for its lack of an operating licence from the industry watchdog. The BIS committee has also warned Transline that it is considering reporting to the Commons that the company\u2019s directors are not fit to run the company because of concerns about its dealings with Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). \u201cWe ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis,\u201d Wright wrote to Ashley, in a letter published by the BIS committee on Tuesday. He added that Sports Direct not having any formal written contract with Transline \u2013 as revealed in a report by the retailer\u2019s lawyers published last week \u2013 \u201ccould make any decision to terminate the working relationship with Transline somewhat easier\u201d. The BIS committee report published in July raised concerns about employment conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, where most staff are employed through Transline and one other agency, The Best Connection. The full story is here: Earlier the Bank of England managed to successfully buy enough long-dated bonds in its weekly reverse-auction. It received offers worth more than three times the amount of bonds maturing in 15 years and more that it wanted to buy as part of its quantitative easing programme. The offer to cover ratio of 3.21 times was down, however, from 4.14 the previous week. And the Bank has run into controversy over the company bonds it will purchase as part of its corporate bond buying programme. The fall in crude oil prices in the wake of the International Energy Agency\u2019s forecast of oversupply well into next year has helped push US markets lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 203 points or more than 1%, reinforcing the volatility surround stock markets at the moment. Over in Toronto, the head of the International Monetary Fund is calling for a new push to make globalisation work -- and attacking Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies. Christine Lagarde is acknowledging that the lowering of trade barriers has cost manufacturing jobs in the West. But she insists that politicians must keep working together to raise wages and improve standards of living. Lagarde says: \u201cFor two decades before the 2000s, global trade regularly grew by 7%, or twice the rate of the world economy. Today, however, trade growth is below that of the global economy \u2013 at about 2%. \u201cThere is a growing risk of politicians seeking office by promising to \u2018get tough\u2019 with foreign trade partners through punitive tariffs or other restrictions on trade. I am deeply concerned about this \u2013 not only because I was a minister of trade, but because trade has been at the heart of the IMF\u2019s mandate for more than 70 years.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story. The pound has weakened steadily this morning, and has now lost a whole cent to $1.3201 against the US dollar. With inflation coming in below expectations, investors may see more wriggle room for the Bank of England to stimulate the economy further. Newsflash: Sports Direct has been urged to cut ties with the agency that supplies thousands of workers to its warehouse. Iain Wright MP, who chairs the BIS committee, says the retailer must drop Transline Group, to prove its commitment to improving workers\u2019 conditions in Shirebrook. The BIS committee quizzed Transline in June, after the \u201cVictorian\u201d conditions at Sports Direct were revealed (including a \u2018six strikes\u2019 policy that could see workers\u2019 sacked for chatting too much, or being off sick). They heard that some workers had lost 15 minutes pay for clocking out one minute earlier, or being slightly late back from a break. They also heard that Transline had paid some workers with pre-paid debit cards, which came with a \u00a310 one-off fee, and a monthly management fee of \u00a310 per month. Wright says that reputable companies simply shouldn\u2019t use such agencies: We on the Committee are very keen to see improvements to working practices at Sports Direct. Mike Ashley says he is committed to making conditions better for staff at Shirebrook. If he means what he says, he could start by cutting his ties with Transline Group who have not been candid or credible in their evidence to the Business Committee and, as we heard in our evidence sessions, have deducted money from low-paid workers without proper explanation and justification. I would expect other companies using Transline Group will want to think seriously about using a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in this way\u201d. \u201cNeither Mike Ashley nor the RPC report into working practices last week have explained why so many people at Shirebrook are employed through agencies, and why they are employed on short-term contracts, other than to reduce costs and avoid legal responsibility for their poor working conditions. If Sports Direct are going to become the Selfridges or John Lewis-style retailer which Mike Ashley has said he aspires them to be, then he needs to fix these poor contractual terms and make a real improvement to warehouse staff working conditions\u201d. In other news... the head of the European Central Bank has urged the region\u2019s politicians to give more help to those who have lost out from Europe\u2019s integration. Speaking in Italy, Mario Draghi said Europe must \u201cprotect the single market in all its forms\u201d \u2013a hot topic, given the Brexit vote. But Draghi also chided European governments for neglecting those who have been left behind. The Europe project will founder unless it can protect its poorest from the consequences of open borders and deregulation. Draghi says: What is different from the past, however, is that today we must devote more attention to the redistributive aspects of integration, and especially to those people who have paid the highest price. I do not think there will be significant progress in terms of opening up markets and competition if Europe does not listen to the demands of those left behind by a society built on the pursuit of wealth and power; if Europe, as well as being a catalyst for integration and an arbiter of its rules, does not also moderate its outcomes. Draghi was in Trento to collect the 2016 Alcide De Gasperi Award, in memory of former Italian PM . Here\u2019s the full speech: Reviving the spirit of De Gasperi: working together for an effective and inclusive Union Despite the shock of the Brexit vote, UK house prices kept climbing in July. The ONS\u2019s latest survey shows that property prices rose by 8.3% compared with July 2015. That\u2019s lower than in June, when house price inflation hit a blistering 9.7%. But it means that the average UK house now costs \u00a3217,000, \u00a317,000 higher than in July 2015 and \u00a31,000 higher than the month of the referendum. Prices rose fastest in the East of England, although London was close behind: So anyone who bought a London house after the financial crash may have actually doubled their money.... But could the boom be over? Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts that prices could drop by up to 5% in 2017. He says: We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will be increasingly pressurized as mounting uncertainty affects the economy and also constrains consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions. We suspect that business and consumer uncertainty will heighten in 2017 once the UK formally launches divorce proceedings from the EU by triggering Article 50 and the negotiations increasingly come to the forefront. Here\u2019s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today\u2019s inflation report: Cheaper hotel rooms, summer clothing bargains and cuts in the cost of alcohol helped peg the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate at 0.6% last month. Confounding City fears of a small rise in the cost of living, the Office for National Statistics said price falls had cancelled out increases in the cost of food, air fares and smaller reductions in fuel than in August 2015. Economists had predicted that the annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index would edge up to 0.7% or 0.8% in August due to imports becoming more expensive following the post-Brexit drop in the value of sterling. The ONS said there was some evidence that a cheaper currency was pushing up the cost of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 an early indicator of inflationary pressure \u2013 but this had not fed into more expensive prices for consumers.... More here: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains how inflation could spike over the next few months: Forecasts suggests the drop in sterling will ultimately add around five percentage points to the Consumer Prices Index, but it\u2019s as yet unclear whether that will come via a gradual uptick in the inflation rate over a couple of years, or a shorter, sharper bout of inflation over the coming months. The Bank of England forecasts consumer price inflation will hit 2% this time next year. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, reckons young people are experiencing a higher inflation rate than their elders. He says: Our Generational Inflation Barometer shows millennials have already had to contend with a higher inflation rate of 0.8% for the past few months, double that of older generations.* \u201cFor the last two years it has been young people who have borne the brunt of the rising cost of living. The upward pressure comes largely from their spending on eating out, rent and bills. At the same time, they spend less on grocery shopping and eating in and therefore don\u2019t benefit from the year-on-year drag on inflation which comes from cheaper food prices and non-alcoholic beverages.\u201d Getting old does have its compensations.... ;) Today\u2019s inflation rate is pretty low in historical terms -- CPI hit 5% twice following the financial crisis. Angela McGowan, chief economist at Danske Bank UK, warns that the fall in sterling will drive up inflation eventually.... Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics agrees: The BBC\u2019s Andrew Verity highlights the rise in import prices: But financial commentator Matthew Lynn reckons todays report shows that the EU referendum isn\u2019t causing financial chaos Here\u2019s another new chart, showing how imported raw materials are becoming pricier. Import prices are 7% higher than in August 2015 - due to the tumble in the pound following the Brexit vote: Important point: UK companies are definitely being hit by higher import costs -- it just hasn\u2019t reached the high street.... It appears that UK companies are managing to absorb the impact of the weaker pound, rather than passing it onto their customers. Mike Prestwood, head of inflation at the ONS, says: \u201cFuel costs falling more slowly than a year ago as well as rising food prices and air fares all pushed up CPI in August, but these were offset by hotels, wine and clothing leaving the headline rate of inflation unchanged. \u201cRaw material costs have risen for the second month running, partly due to the falling value of the pound, though there is little sign of this feeding through to consumer prices yet. On a monthly basis, prices actually rose by 0.3% in August compared with July. The ONS attributes this to an increased in some food prices - such as bread, cereal products and meat. But mineral waters, soft drinks and juices all got cheaper during the month. Here\u2019s more detail from today\u2019s inflation report: Transport: prices, overall, rose by 0.9% between July and August this year, compared with a rise of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, fell by 0.4%, compared with a negligible change a year ago. The main downward contribution came from accommodation services, in particular overnight hotel accommodation, for which prices fell by more than a year ago. Clothing and footwear: prices, overall, rose by 1.0% between July and August this year compared with a rise of 1.5% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effect came principally from garments, particularly children\u2019s outerwear. The pound has dipped, as traders react to the news that inflation was a little weaker than expected in August. It\u2019s not a major selloff, though: Today\u2019s inflation report says: The largest downward pull on inflation in August 2016 and for 2016 to date comes from prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. Upward pressures come from a variety of categories, most notably restaurant and hotel bills. Transport prices provided a downward pressure during 2015 and early 2016 but this has eased during 2016 and they now have an upward effect. At 0.6%, UK inflation remains at its highest level since November 2014: BREAKING: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has remained unchanged, despite the pressure from the weak pound. The consumer prices inflation came in at 0.6% in August, matching July\u2019s reading. That\u2019s weaker than the 0.7% which City economists had expected More to follow... Newsflash: The world is going to be swimming in oil well into next year, according to new estimates from the top energy body. The International Energy Agency reckons that supply will outstrip demand until at least the middle of 2017, and has revised down its forecast for demand growth. That is likely to keep the oil price depressed, which could hold back inflation over the next year... The pound has lost a little ground this morning, dipping by a third of a cent to $1.3299 ahead of the inflation report. This is a busy week for UK economic data; we get unemployment on Wednesday, while Thursday brings new retail sales numbers and a Bank of England decision on interest rates. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says the pound\u2019s value could fluctuate this week: Sterling remains tentative ahead of the data release and with the deluge of data out this week, we are likely to see greater volatility in the currency as markets attempt to ascertain the health of the economy The latest inflation data from the eurozone is pretty underwhelming. Prices across Germany only rose by 0.3% year-on-year, despite the massive stimulus measures unleashed by the European Central Bank recently. And Spain remains wedged in deflation, mainly due to cheaper energy prices. Elsewhere in the markets, retail chain JD Sports have jumped by 7.5% after impressing the City with a 73% jump in profits. Quite a contrast with struggling rival Sports Direct, which last week predicted that earnings might shrink by a fifth this year. Retail analyst Nick Bubb has crunched the numbers, and reports: Well, given the astonishing profits growth reported by the booming JD Sports today, you may be wondering how much bigger its market cap is now compared to the beleaguered Sports Direct and the answer is that \u00a32.6bn plays \u00a31.9bn\u2026 Ocado, though, is the worst performing company on the FTSE 250 - tumbling by 9%. Analysts are disappointed that it still hasn\u2019t landed any new distribution deals, to protect it from the thundering approach of Amazon. Ocado is also suffering from \u201csustained and continuing margin pressure\u201d -- which basically means the supermarket price war ain\u2019t over yet.... The London stock market is open, and staging a very minor recovery after yesterday\u2019s sharp selloff. The FTSE 100 has gained 13 points (having lost 75 points yesterday). Housebuilders are among the risers, but mining stocks are dropping again. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets also reckons inflation may have risen to 0.7%, giving the Bank of England a potential headache. He writes: In the wake of the recent rebound in the UK economy shown in the recent August data, the latest inflation data looks set to show a sharp uptick as a result of the recent slide in the pound in the wake of the June Brexit vote. This could well start to act as a headwind for the UK consumer in the months ahead, and while Bank of England governor Mark Carney may feel \u201cserene\u201d about the Bank of England\u2019s recent and possible future actions, UK consumers may not feel as benevolent towards him or the central bank if the Bank of England\u2019s over reaction to the recent Brexit vote causes price pressures to move sharply higher in the coming months. Even if Britain\u2019s inflation rate does rise this morning, it will still be significantly below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. As this tweet shows, most central banks are undershooting their inflation targets; although India and Brazil can only dream of such a problem.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s inflation rate may push higher today, as the weaker pound drives up the cost of imported goods. Some economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index will rise to 0.7%, for August, up from July\u2019s 0.6%. That would indicate that retailers are making consumers share the pain following the 10% drop in sterling since the Brexit vote. James Brown, partner at consultancy firm Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, explains: Inflation, as recorded by the consumer price index (CPI), is expected to have gone further up in August compared to July when it rose to 0.6% which was the highest level recorded since November 2014. We forecast continued growth in inflation as higher import costs from the devalued sterling find their way into consumer prices. August is only the second month where CPI numbers are based on post-referendum figures. If inflation does push higher, it might limit the Bank of England\u2019s ability to ease monetary policy again to help Britain handle the fallout from Brexit. Having said that, most economic date since the referendum suggests the economy isn\u2019t faring too badly.... Also coming up... European stock markets are expected to recover some of Monday\u2019s heavy losses, as investors stop fretting that US borrowing costs might be hiked next week. As we covered in last night\u2019s blog, Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard has hinted that interest rates should only rise gradually. Traders are also encouraged by overnight data from China, showing that industrial production and retail sales both grew last month. Germany\u2019s ZEW institute will release its regular economic sentiment survey at 10am, which may show whether investors are still worried about Brexit. And on the corporate front, online supermarket Ocado and high street retailer JD Sports are reporting to the City right now:",

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Both European and US markets have turned lower once more this afternoon, as the relief brought by predictably dovish comments from Fed member Brainard soon evaporated. Coming out of the summer lull, it seems volatility is back with a bang, leaving many struggling to get a handle on where exactly it has come from. Despite a perceived hawkish shift from some Fed rate setters, driving a flight out of stocks and into the dollar, September still seems too early for the next US rate increase and it is still a coin toss whether one will happen in 2016.</p> <p>Crude prices have suffered after yet another downbeat assessment of the sector, this time from the IEA which cut its demand forecasts for the year ahead. Even if OPEC and Russia manage to reach a supply freeze deal, output would still be maintained at near record highs while demand falters. There is little surprise that we are seeing the bears come back into play to take advantage of the misguided ramp up in price recently.</p> </blockquote> <p>Brent crude is currently down more than 2% at $47.25 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate has fallen 2.6% to $45.07.</p> <p>On the European markets, the final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 35.27 points or 0.53% to 6665.63</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.43% to 10,386.60</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.19% lower at 4387.18</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 1.74% down at 16,547.75</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.61% at 8724.2</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.05% at 556.96</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 249 points or 1.36%.</p> <p><em>On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

      "bodyText": "The former president of the European commission has hit back against criticism about his new role at Goldman Sachs by insisting he will act with integrity and discretion. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, who was president of the commission for 10 years until 2014, was in July named chairman of Goldman Sachs International, the bank\u2019s UK and European operations, in a move that sparked anger among commission staff. A petition criticising Barroso\u2019s \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d behaviour, has attracted almost 140,000 signatures, and this week the EC president, Jean-Claude Juncker, launched an investigation into whether any EU rules had been broken by Barroso. In a letter to Juncker, Barroso said he was not being employed as a lobbyist or adviser on Brexit and that the bank had intended to appoint him before the vote to the leave the EU. \u201cI have not been engaged to lobby on behalf of Goldman Sachs and I do not intend to do so,\u201d Barroso said. Barroso also took issue with the warning from Juncker that he would not be received in EU institutions as a former president, but as an \u201cinterest representative\u201d, subject to the same rules as other lobbyists. \u201cI have never sought a privileged position but I would not expect to be discriminated against,\u201d Barroso said in his letter, adding that he wanted to know how a decision about his position had been made. \u201cNot only are these actions discriminatory but they appear inconsistent with decisions taken in respect of other former members of the commission.\u201d A former prime minister of Portugal, Barroso said he had been careful to comply with the commission\u2019s rules, adding that he had joined Goldman 20 months after his period office, longer than the 18-month cooling off period imposed on him. \u201cI am very clear about my ongoing responsibilities to the European institutions and naturally I will maintain my commitment to act with integrity and discretion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been claimed that the mere fact of working with Goldman Sachs raises questions of integrity. While I respect that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, the rules are clear and they must be respected. These claims are baseless and wholly unmerited. They are discriminatory against me and against Goldman Sachs, a regulated company operating in the internal market.\u201d EU rules stipulate that commission officials have a duty to \u201cbehave with integrity and discretion\u201d once they have ceased to hold high office. Barroso\u2019s role at Goldman sparked controversy in France, from the far-right leader Marine Le Pen and also the country\u2019s Europe minister, Harlem D\u00e9sir, who said the EU\u2019s conflict of interest rules needed to be tightened.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have called on Sports Direct to end its relationship with Transline, which supplies workers for the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, over fears that the employment agency misled a parliamentary inquiry. Iain Wright, Labour MP and chair of the Commons business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, which published a damning report on Sports Direct in July, has written to the retailer\u2019s founder and majority shareholder Mike Ashley saying he believed Transline was not candid about the reasons for its lack of an operating licence from the industry watchdog. The BIS committee has also warned Transline that it is considering reporting to the Commons that the company\u2019s directors are not fit to run the company because of concerns about its dealings with Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). \u201cWe ask you to think seriously about continuing to use Transline, a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in a way that is inconsistent with your own aspirations for Sports Direct to be on a par with likes of Selfridges and John Lewis,\u201d Wright wrote to Ashley, in a letter published by the BIS committee on Tuesday. He added that Sports Direct not having any formal written contract with Transline \u2013 as revealed in a report by the retailer\u2019s lawyers published last week \u2013 \u201ccould make any decision to terminate the working relationship with Transline somewhat easier\u201d. A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cWe have received a letter from the BIS Committee and we will give careful consideration to the contents of the ongoing correspondence. We will not be making further comment at this stage.\u201d The BIS committee report published in July raised concerns about employment conditions at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, where most staff are employed through Transline and one other agency, The Best Connection. The parliamentary inquiry, which followed an undercover investigation by the Guardian into working conditions at Shirebrook, questioned the legality and fairness of voluntary schemes provided by the agencies to workers such as pre-paid debit cards and insurance services. Since then, Sports Direct and its employment agencies have been forced to award about \u00a31m in back pay to Shirebrook warehouse staff found to be have been paid less than the national minimum wage. The committee has asked Transline to confirm if its licence was refused by the GLA because directors were found not to be \u201cfit and proper persons\u201d and to reply by 16 September. The letter says Transline did not acknowledge that it traded without a licence between July and September 2013. It adds that the GLA refused Transline\u2019s application because it had found examples of the company not paying the minimum wage and not paying workers for time spent on inductions. The letter added that Transline did not mention that it had a second application, under a different company name, for a licence refused partly because it had not been candid about the links between the two companies. Transline has written to Wright saying it can see \u201cabsolutely no basis for the committee to state that we misled the committee in responding to the committee\u2019s inaccurate assertion that the company\u2019s GLA licence had been revoked\u201d. The company said the committee was biased against Transline and it was \u201castounded and extremely saddened\u201d to read what it said were inaccurate critical comments about its operation and evidence. It also pointed out that the GLA licensing system only related to the food industry and so had no bearing on its work with Sports Direct. A Transline spokesperson said: \u201cWe have always provided accurate information to the select committee and are focused on supporting Sports Direct in reviewing and implementing recommendations and actions from the working practices report. We will continue to offer clarity and any further information necessary to the committee. Obviously we find Iain Wright MP\u2019s statements and summary disappointing, however we will prioritise responding to the latest correspondence in a full and concise manner, within the requested timescale.\u201d Wright said: \u201cWe on the committee are very keen to see improvements to working practices at Sports Direct. Mike Ashley says he is committed to making conditions better for staff at Shirebrook. If he means what he says, he could start by cutting his ties with Transline Group who have not been candid or credible in their evidence to the business committee and, as we heard in our evidence sessions, have deducted money from low-paid workers without proper explanation and justification. \u201cI would expect other companies using Transline Group will want to think seriously about using a company that treats their workers and conducts its business in this way. \u201cNeither Mike Ashley nor the RPC report into working practices last week have explained why so many people at Shirebrook are employed through agencies, and why they are employed on short-term contracts, other than to reduce costs and avoid legal responsibility for their poor working conditions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has launched a thinly veiled attack on the anti-free-trade sentiments expressed by US presidential candidate Donald Trump in a speech calling for globalisation to be made to work for all. Speaking in Canada, Christine Lagarde, admitted competition from low-cost emerging countries such as China had caused pain for workers in the west. But she said the solution was for governments to provide direct financial support for those with low skills through higher minimum wages, more generous welfare states, investment in education and a crackdown on tax evasion. While not mentioning Trump by name, Lagarde made it clear she strongly opposed the Republican candidate\u2019s policies, which include higher US tariffs and a barrier along the border with Mexico. \u201cFor two decades before the 2000s, global trade regularly grew by 7%, or twice the rate of the world economy. Today, however, trade growth is below that of the global economy \u2013 at about 2%,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cThere is a growing risk of politicians seeking office by promising to \u2018get tough\u2019 with foreign trade partners through punitive tariffs or other restrictions on trade. I am deeply concerned about this \u2013 not only because I was a minister of trade, but because trade has been at the heart of the IMF\u2019s mandate for more than 70 years.\u201d The IMF is concerned about what is sees as a growing backlash against globalisation, which has been manifested in support for Trump and Bernie Sanders in the US presidential primaries, by the vote for Brexit and by the rise of populist parties across Europe. Lagarde said the ability of countries to ignore narrow self-interest had brought unprecedented progress since the second world war. \u201cBut progress has not come for everybody at the same pace. There is no doubt that the transformation of our economies has also brought dislocation and hardship,\u201d she said. \u201cStructural change caused by globalisation and technological change has deeply affected some sectors and industries, while benefitting society as a whole.\u201d She added that throughout history there had been arguments about trade. \u201cBut history clearly tells us that closing borders or increasing protectionism is not the way to go. Many countries have tried this route, and just as many have failed. Instead, we need to pursue policies that extend the benefits of openness and integration while alleviating their side effects.\u201d Lagarde traced the origin of these side-effects back to the opening up of the global economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. \u201cThe historic events of the early 1990s, when China, India, and the former communist countries entered into the global trading system, had far-reaching effects. The size of the global workforce effectively doubled, putting downward pressure on wages, especially for lower-skilled workers in advanced economies,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the US, competition from low-wage countries has been one of the factors that have contributed to a decline in manufacturing employment, along with a wave of automation. And this has not been spread evenly across the whole economy, but has been concentrated in some local labor markets that have faced deep, long-lasting effects from overseas competition.\u201d The IMF was a cheerleader in the 1990s and early 2000s for free movement of capital but Lagarde acknowledged there were drawbacks to financial liberalisation. \u201cBetween 1980 and 2007, global capital flows increased more than twenty-fivefold, compared with an eightfold expansion in global trade. This has underpinned investment, especially in emerging economies. But it has also opened the door to financial contagion and concerns about the stability of financial systems.\u201d Growing inequality in wealth, income, and opportunity in many countries had added to a groundswell of discontent, especially in the industrialised world, Lagarde said. There was a \u201cgrowing sense among some citizens that they \u201clack control\u201d, that the system is somehow against them.\u201d",

This has underpinned investment, especially in emerging economies. But it has also opened the door to financial contagion and concerns about the stability of financial systems.\u201d</p> <p>Growing inequality in wealth, income, and opportunity in many countries had added to a groundswell of discontent, especially in the industrialised world, Lagarde said.

      "bodyText": "Wells Fargo will eliminate sales goals for all of its retail banking products by January, the bank announced on Tuesday. The decision comes less than a week after the largest US bank reached a deal with regulators and agreed to pay $185m in penalties for its illegal sales practices. More than 5,000 employees were fired by Wells Fargo after an investigation revealed that they were opening deposit and credit card accounts without permission from its customers in order to meet sales quotas enforced by the bank. According to regulators, as many as 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts could have been opened without customers\u2019 consent. \u201cWe are doing this because we want our customer to have full confidence that we are focused on their best interests. We deeply regret what happened and we are committed to making it right,\u201d Richele J Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in an email. As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo agreed to hire a consultant to review its sales practices and refund the fees paid by consumers on the accounts that were opened without their permission. So far, customers have been refunded $2.6m in unwarranted fees. According to the bank, \u201caccounts refunded represented a fraction of 1% of the accounts reviewed, and refunds averaged $25\u201d. The issue of unauthorized duplicate accounts was first reported by the Los Angeles Times in 2013. At that time, a personal banker working at Wells Fargo was expected to sell 20 products a day. \u201cI am not sure how that\u2019s possible within an eight-hour day of work. Pretty much every customer takes an hour,\u201d Khalid Taha, a former Wells Fargo employee, told the Guardian in 2015. \u201c[In 2014], the sales goal dropped to 15 products a day, which is still unreasonable. You don\u2019t sell more than a product per customer. You can, but it\u2019s not that easy. And most of our customers are current customers. They already have several products.\u201d Some employees \u2013 including Taha \u2013 have previously attempted to draw attention to the issue by staging a protest in front of the bank\u2019s headquarters in Minneapolis. About 5,300 employees were fired over a five-year period. Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which levied a $100m penalty on Wells Fargo, said it was not a coincidence that so many employees were involved. \u201cIt\u2019s a systemic breakdown,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cObviously employees were sharing information with one another. They were doing things together. And 5,300 or more of them have now been fired. That was a huge problem. It should not occur at any bank. And it should not have occurred at Wells Fargo.\u201d Cordray pointed out that this is the largest penalty levied by CFPB so far. He added that while there is no indication that this is happening at other banks, all banks with incentive programs should monitor them closely. The Wells Fargo settlement is a \u201cloud and serious warning\u201d to other banks, he said. In a statement announcing the elimination of sales quotas, Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf noted that the bank has strengthened its \u201ccontrol and oversight\u201d over the past several years. \u201cThe elimination of product sales goals represents another step to reinforce our service culture, helps ensure that nothing gets in the way of our ability to achieve our mission, and is consistent with our commitment to providing a great place to work,\u201d said Stumpf.",

    "webTitle": "Greene King to move remaining pub workers off zero-hours contracts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of pub workers in chains including Wacky Warehouse are set to be moved off zero-hours contracts by brewer Greene King over the next year. The Suffolk-based company said it was in the process of moving workers to contracts that guarantee a minimum number of hours, following its takeover of the Spirit Pub Company last year. In 2013, Spirit, the owner of chains including Chef &amp; Brewer and Wacky Warehouse, said that most of its 16,000 employees were on the contracts, which give no guarantee of work from one day to the next. The hospitality industry is the biggest user of such contracts, which have been criticised by unions for not offering workers any security over pay. Greene King, which had already moved its staff from zero-hours contracts before buying Spirit in 2015, said it was working on moving employees to new minimum hours contracts. A spokesman said: \u201cWe do not have zero-hours contracts in Greene King pubs. \u201cSpirit Pub Company, which we acquired last year, does have legacy zero-hours contracts; we identified this as part of our due diligence and planned to remove them as part of the integration.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will be moving to minimum hours contracts for all colleagues in ex-Spirit pubs over the next year.\u201d Last week, official figures showed that the number of people on zero-hours contracts had leapt by 20% in a year to more than 900,000. But there are signs that the backlash against them is forcing employers to reconsider their use. Following criticism of its employment practices, Sports Direct said it would offer 18,000 workers at its shops contracts guaranteeing at least 12 hours\u2019 work a week, although it has emerged that this change could take until the end of the year. On Sunday, pub firm JD Wetherspoon said that it would allow 24,000 staff to choose between a zero-hours contract and one offering fixed hours after a successful trial of the scheme. Its chairman, Tim Martin, told Buzzfeed that around two-thirds of staff had opted to move off zero hours and on to guaranteed contracts, guaranteeing around 70% of the typical number of hours they work each week.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is to buy \u00a310bn of bonds issued by private companies, including Apple and other overseas corporations, as it begins a dramatic expansion of its quantitative easing programme. But the Bank has been accused of handing taxpayer cash to foreign corporations with little connection to the UK, which may simply hand the money back to shareholders. Until now, QE, designed to boost the economy by lowering interest rates, has focused on purchasing and, in effect, cancelling UK government bonds, known as gilts. The Bank said earlier this year, however, that it would expand its asset purchases to \u00a310bn of bonds issued by private companies, as long as they were UK based, or overseas corporations with a major UK presence which were benefiting the British economy. When the list of eligible companies was published on Monday, one major bond dealer said he was astonished at the names included. Verizon, a US cell phone network, is on the list, as is another big US telecoms company, AT&amp;T, despite both firms arguably having minimal operations in the UK. While most bonds are issued by companies so they can invest in their businesses, some US corporations have recently used the bond markets to raise cash simply to hand to shareholders as dividends, or to use it to buy shares in their own company, thus pushing up the share price artificially. \u201cA lot of US corporates have been issuing bonds to finance share buybacks and dividends to shareholders. There can be absolutely no guarantee that the funds raised will be used to invest in the UK,\u201d one senior bond dealer said, on condition of anonymity. The Bank has said it will only buy the bonds of companies \u201cmaking a material contribution to the UK economy\u201d. It defines these companies as those with \u201csignificant employment in the UK or with their headquarters in the UK ... but the Bank will also consider whether the company generates significant revenues in the UK, serves a large number of customers in the UK or has a number of operating sites in the UK.\u201d It said its asset purchase facility corporate bond purchase scheme (CBPS) would stimulate the economy by lowering the yields on corporate bonds, \u201cthereby reducing the cost of borrowing for companies; by triggering portfolio rebalancing into riskier assets by sellers of assets; and by stimulating new issuance of corporate bonds\u201d. Bonds with a face value of about \u00a3110bn will be eligible for buying by the Bank, although the central bank is only planning to buy \u00a310bn of these bonds. However, the senior trader said: \u201cI was incensed when I saw the list and how far it appears to deviate from the aim of the scheme. There are huge inconsistencies in the names included. Apple is on the list, as is Wal-Mart, but at least they own Asda. Manchester airport is on the list, but Gatwick airport is not.\u201d \u201cIf a company name is on that list, it will bring it substantial benefits when issuing new bonds and securing new funding,\u201d he added. The trader accused other investment banks of gaming the system to their own benefit. \u201cMy motivation in trying to expose this is that I am a British taxpayer and I am not happy about seeing the public purse being used to the advantage of certain investment banks.\u201d The Bank of England declined to comment.

      "bodyText": "After an initial attempt to recover from recent losses, leading shares are struggling to cling onto the day\u2019s gains. Oil shares are among the biggest fallers after crude prices slid further in the wake of a downbeat report from the International Energy Agency. The agency said the oil market would be oversupplied until at least the first six months of 2017, given a sharp slowdown in demand and rising stocks. A month ago it predicted suppy and demand would be broadly in balance for the rest of the year, and inventories would fall sharply. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The IEA has joined OPEC in pouring more cold water on the oil price this morning. After OPEC flipped its prediction of dwindling non-OPEC supply in 2017, instead warning that it was set to rise due to a major new oilfield in Kazakhstan coming online, the IEA has issued a stark warning that the pickup in demand seen in the first half of the year has completely evaporated. It has cut its demand forecasts for the second half and the whole of 2017 and is now predicting the glut will remain in the global market for the whole of next year. Oil prices are down this morning, although the real capitulation could come towards the end of the month if OPEC and Russia fail to agree a supply freeze Brent crude is down more than 2% to $47.29 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped 2.46% to $45.15. So BP is down 5.9p at 422.80p while Royal Dutch Shell A shares are 22.5p lower at 1834.5p. A number of mining shares are also under pressure, with Anglo American down 3.9p at 815.6p and BHP Billiton 3.7p lower at 987.3p. Overall the FTSE 100 is up just 5.04 points at 6705.94, with little impact from the better than expected UK inflation figures. Associated British Foods is again the biggest faller after Monday\u2019s disappointing figures, down another 96p to \u00a327.19. Jefferies moved from hold to underperform, saying: Despite the precipitous, full year IMS triggered ABF sell-off, we remain concerned that the Primark investment debate will now revolve around more normalised valuation criteria. With a third successive year of Primark margin falls now expected for 16/17, we value the division on 23 times PE, and see double-digit downside to the stock. Shopping centre specialist Intu Properties has dropped 6.6p to 288.8p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to sell. It said: We do not see the \u2018scenario weighted\u2019 risk/reward as attractive given we would expect Intu to materially underperform in a UK downturn. We note that Intu has high EPS sensitivity to like for like growth and also capital values. Given 97% of asset value is UK shopping centres and given an loan-to-value off 44%, we see high sensitivity to a down-cycle should it occur. We forecast a c.20% capital value decline driving a c.35% decline in net asset value. With the stock trading at a 15% premium to our 2018 NAV forecast, we downgrade to sell. Among the mid-caps, contrasting fortunes for two retailers after their updates. JD Sports Fashion has jumped 71p to \u00a314.04 as it reported a 73% rise in first half profits. But online grocer Ocado is down 44.5p at 277.5p on disappointment at the lack of news on an international tie-up and continuing pressure on its profit margins.",

So <strong>BP</strong> is down 5.9p at 422.80p while <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> A shares are 22.5p lower at 1834.5p.</p> <p>A number of mining shares are also under pressure, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> down 3.9p at 815.6p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> 3.7p lower at 987.3p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is up just 5.04 points at 6705.94, with little impact from the better than expected UK inflation figures.</p> <p><strong>Associated British Foods</strong> is again the biggest faller after <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/12/primark-vows-low-prices-brexit-votes-profits-associated-british-food-abf\">Monday\u2019s disappointing figures,</a></strong> down another 96p to \u00a327.19. Jefferies moved from hold to underperform, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the precipitous, full year IMS triggered ABF sell-off, we remain concerned that the Primark investment debate will now revolve around more normalised valuation criteria. With a third successive year of Primark margin falls now expected for 16/17, we value the division on 23 times PE, and see double-digit downside to the stock.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shopping centre specialist <strong>Intu Properties</strong> has dropped 6.6p to 288.8p as Deutsche Bank moved from hold to sell. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We do not see the \u2018scenario weighted\u2019 risk/reward as attractive given we would expect Intu to materially underperform in a UK downturn. We note that Intu has high EPS sensitivity to like for like growth and also capital values. Given 97% of asset value is UK shopping centres and given an loan-to-value off 44%, we see high sensitivity to a down-cycle should it occur. We forecast a c.20% capital value decline driving a c.35% decline in net asset value. With the stock trading at a 15% premium to our 2018 NAV forecast, we downgrade to sell. </p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, contrasting fortunes for two retailers after their updates. <strong>JD Sports Fashion </strong>has jumped 71p to \u00a314.04 as it reported a 73% rise in first half profits. But online grocer <strong>Ocado</strong> is down 44.5p at 277.5p on disappointment at the lack of news on an international tie-up and continuing pressure on its profit margins.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cheaper hotel rooms, summer clothing bargains and cuts in the cost of alcohol helped peg the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate at 0.6% last month. Confounding City fears of a small rise in the cost of living, the Office for National Statistics said price falls had cancelled out increases in the cost of food, air fares and smaller reductions in fuel than in August 2015. Economists had predicted that the annual inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index would edge up to 0.7% or 0.8% in August due to imports becoming more expensive following the post-Brexit drop in the value of sterling. The ONS said there was some evidence that a cheaper currency was pushing up the cost of fuel and raw materials for manufacturing \u2013 an early indicator of inflationary pressure \u2013 but this had not fed into more expensive prices for consumers. Mike Prestwood, the ONS\u2019s head of inflation, said: \u201cFuel costs falling more slowly than a year ago as well as rising food prices and air fares all pushed up CPI in August, but these were offset by hotels, wine and clothing leaving the headline rate of inflation unchanged. \u201cRaw material costs have risen for the second month running, partly due to the falling value of the pound, though there is little sign of this feeding through to consumer prices yet.\u201d Inflation hovered around zero during 2015 but started to rise in the early months of 2016. Further increases are expected in the coming months as last Autumn\u2019s sharp fall in oil prices cease to have a downward impact. The ONS said so-called core inflation, which strips out food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, also remained unchanged last month, at 1.3%. Indications of inflation in the pipeline came from the ONS\u2019s Producer Price Index, which measures manufacturers\u2019 fuel and raw material costs and the prices charged by industry to wholesalers and retailers. Factory gate prices rose by 0.8% in the year to August, up from 0.3% in July. The ONS said the rises in the past two months followed two years of falling output prices. Meanwhile, the cost of industry\u2019s fuel and raw materials rose by 7.6% in the year to August, up from 4.1% in July. The ONS said this was largely the result of a big drop in oil prices in August 2015 ceasing to have a helpful impact. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said CPI inflation was likely to rise to 2% by the middle of 2017 and hit 3% by the end of that year. \u201cCPI inflation should resume its upward journey in coming months. The effects of sterling\u2019s recent fall on import prices will gradually feed through to consumer prices, while the contribution from the previous falls in commodity prices will continue to wane. Indeed, there were signs of these factors starting to make their way through the inflation pipeline.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Polymer \u00a35 notes to enter circulation today", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "People around Britain will get their hands on the first polymer \u00a35 notes issued by the Bank of England on Tuesday as the smaller, plastic money featuring Sir Winston Churchill goes into circulation. It is a cash revolution six years in the making. Discussions at the central bank over whether to replace the tatty paper fiver with a tougher polymer version started in 2010. Now, following roadshows to gauge public opinion and consultations with cash machine operators and vending machine makers, the Bank of England has printed 440m of the new, shiny notes and they will be available from cash machines and bank counters on Tuesday. For Victoria Cleland, the Bank\u2019s chief cashier whose name is on every one of those notes, it is a momentous day. \u201cIt is really, really exciting and it\u2019s been an incredible journey ... from the very idea of \u2018Ooh, shall we move to polymer?\u2019 to tomorrow morning, I will be out there spending the notes,\u201d says Cleland, who plans to use her first polymer fiver to buy an ice-cream. The Bank spent around \u00a370m on the research, development and printing of the new banknotes and Cleland\u2019s team of 140 staff have been working for years to develop its cutting edge security features, which include a see-through window. Bank scientists have made counterfeit versions to assess how easily the fivers could be copied, and have tested how the notes react in washing machines and in machines full of grit. One of the main reasons for the move to polymer is to improve bank note durability. The fivers have also had to pass health and safety tests, just in case they should fall into the paws of peckish toddlers and pets. Last year, 21,835 notes were replaced due to damage \u2013 5,364 of those were chewed or eaten, the Bank says. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly dogs, and I have heard of a parrot,\u201d explains Cleland. The new design should last around five years, two and half times longer than the outgoing fiver. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, announced the move to polymer notes in 2013, shortly after he arrived in the UK from his native Canada, where polymer bank notes were already in use. His decision followed a public consultation in which 87% of the 13,000 respondents backed the new notes. As Cleland sits in her Threadneedle Street office holding a new fiver, she beams with pride and declares the polymer note has been thoroughly proven to be popular with the public and safer, cleaner and more resilient. \u201cBank notes are just really important to everybody, they are in everyone\u2019s pockets and wallets, so we wanted to be sure that the people in the UK would be happy with the move.\u201d Out on the streets around the Bank, reactions to the new note are overwhelmingly positive when we take some out \u2013 under Bank supervision \u2013 to give people a preview. \u201cThey are a rather attractive design.

She runs her finger around the firm edges. \u201cBut I\u2019m a bit concerned about paper cuts.\u201d Mike Sharpe, a 45-year-old working in IT, describes the new note as \u201ccool\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s better than those grubby paper notes.\u201d But he wants to know how businesses will adapt, and whether they will work in ATMs. Cleland is not worried about this. All the signals from businesses are that they are ready, having had the chance to test protoypes. Her bigger concern is that after months of publicity for the new note, people could end up frustrated if they have to wait to handle one. But as the the Bank gradually withdraws the old fivers, it expects that by early January half of \u00a35 notes in circulation will be polymer. \u201cThe main message is we have produced plenty for everybody. We have got 440m of them so be patient, you\u2019ll get one in the next week or so,\u201d says Cleland. The fiver will be followed by a polymer Jane Austen \u00a310 note next summer and a plastic JMW Turner \u00a320 note by 2020. A decision has yet to be made on the \u00a350 note but Cleland says that is because the last version was only released in 2011, not because the Bank wants to ditch the high denomination notes altogether. Aside from the new notes, her team is also working on other ways of paying, such as digital currencies. Does that mean the Bank is expecting physical money to die out? Not for now, says Cleland. \u201cAlthough there are lots of alternative ways to pay out there we are still seeing strong demand for cash and so that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s really important to make sure it\u2019s fit for the modern age,\u201d she adds. The future of cash is a question that also comes up among our panel of bank note previewers. Tanja Fidan, a 30-year-old German who works at the Herm\u00e8s fashion store opposite the Bank, loves the new note but says she rarely carries cash. \u201cI don\u2019t even carry cards now, I use Apple Pay,\u201d she says.",

      "bodyText": "At the end of this week the governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens will hand over the reins to his current deputy, Philip Lowe. The challenges for Dr Lowe are much different to those which Stevens faced. Where Stevens faced an economy running hot, but where a major economic quake was about to hit the entire world, Lowe inherits the aftershocks of that quake and \u2013 unlike Stevens \u2013 there may be little he can do about it. It\u2019s a mark of both the massive change in the economy over the past decade and the limits of monetary policy power that when Glenn Stevens took over the governorship of the RBA, the cash rate was at 6% and nominal GDP was growing by just under 8%; now the cash rate is at 1.5% and nominal GDP growth is just under 3%: Ten years ago the overriding problem for the head of the RBA was to keep inflation in check. The economy was running so hot, with nominal GDP growth about to go over 9% \u2013 something that hadn\u2019t happened for 17 years \u2013 that even despite the government having a budget surplus, the RBA had to keep raising the cash rate to try its best to apply the economic brakes. When the RBA raised the cash rate to 7.25% in 2008, the average mortgage rate reached 9.6%. It meant that the average monthly mortgage repayments for a new 25 year home loan had gone from $1,682 when Stevens took over to $2,217 in September 2008. And while the interest rate rises and the GFC did put a brake on the growth of the housing market, the average mortgage size \u2013 as with prices in general \u2013 kept going up. In September 2006, the average new mortgage for an established dwelling was $220,400. At the average standard variable rate of 7.8% that meant a monthly repayment of $1,682. In July the average new mortgage was $370,500 and at an average mortgage rate of 5.4% the repayment for such a loan is $2,263 a month: The increase in repayments are not so dramatic when you take into account inflation. In 2016 dollars, the 2006 mortgage repayments are $2,106 a month \u2013 still $157 a month less than they are now. It all serves to reinforce not just the massive increase in the cost of housing over the past 10 years, but also just how changed the economy has become. Those average mortgage rates of 9.6% would now absolutely kill the economy. At that rate, the average mortgage repayments for a $370,500 loan would be (hold your breath) $3,273 a month. What does this mean? Well firstly, forget having to pay interest rates like we did prior to the GFC. It would be almost impossible to imagine such rates occurring again in the next 20 years. To have the conditions where the economy required rate to be raised by 4% or more, would mean GDP growing well above average for a good five or six years straight. It took six years of our biggest investment boom in history for the average mortgage rate to go from 6.05% in 2002 to 9.6% in 2008. It means should the economy require a bit of a slowing (I know, hard to remember such a need) the RBA would only need to slightly touch the brakes, in order to put significant hurt on Australian mortgage holders. To get to the same real mortgage repayments as occurred at the peak in 2008 when the rate was 9.6%, rates now would only need to be raised to 6.85% - which would only need the cash rate to be raised to around 3%. Things have changed so greatly that for the RBA to get mortgage repayments up to where they were raised to prior the GFC, the RBA would now need only to raise them to the level they were cut to during the GFC. But the level of mortgage repayments also highlights the difficulties for the RBA when it comes to stimulating the economy. In the midst of the GFC, the lowest the average mortgage repayment in 2016 dollar terms was $1,992 a month. To reduce repayments to that (assuming no increase in the average mortgage size), would mean the mortgage rate would need to be dropped to around 4.15%. That would require the RBA cutting the cash rate to 0.25% - and that is assuming the banks pass on the full rate cut. This doesn\u2019t really give you much room to move. In such a context it is thus not surprising that despite cuts to interest rates in the past six months, the latest housing finance figures show a significant cooling: Cutting rates at this point is a bit like pushing a piece of string. From last May when the RBA began to once again cut interest rates, the average new mortgage has increased by 10% and the average repayments for those mortgages has risen by 9%. Now the growing size of new mortgages doesn\u2019t affect those already with a loan. Such people just get the benefit of the rate cut. As a result, while overall housing debt to disposable income ratio is at a record high, our debt interest payments have stayed relatively stable: But even here we can see we are paying a lot more of our income in interest repayments than we were in the 1990s and early 2000s, and roughly the same as we were during her GFC. It means even with further rate cuts, new home buyers will be taking on historically high levels of debt. Thus when Philip Lowe takes over as governor of the RBA next week, he is faced with a much different economy and monetary situation that Glenn Stevens. He undoubtedly has much more powerful brakes than Stevens had at his disposal; but his accelerator power is much diminished.",

As a result, while overall housing debt to disposable income ratio is at a record high, our debt interest payments have stayed relatively stable:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing debt and interest payments to income ratios\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a2s64/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But even here we can see we are paying a lot more of our income in interest repayments than we were in the 1990s and early 2000s, and roughly the same as we were during her GFC.</p> <p>It means even with further rate cuts, new home buyers will be taking on historically high levels of debt.</p> <p>Thus when Philip Lowe takes over as governor of the RBA next week, he is faced with a much different economy and monetary situation that Glenn Stevens. </p> <p>He undoubtedly has much more powerful brakes than Stevens had at his disposal; but his accelerator power is much diminished. </p>",
