    "webTitle": "US Federal Reserve raises interest rates and says recovery is on track - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s a quick round-up. The US Federal Reserve has pressed on with the normalisation of interest rate policy, by hiking borrowing costs for the second time this year. The Fed funds rate is now 1% to 1.25%. The Fed is also broadly sticking to its previous guidance for interest rate rises over the next couple of years. Chair Janet Yellen tried to cool speculation that recent weak inflation might make the central bank more dovish. The Fed remains confident that the US economy is recovering, saying: The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Economists said the move shows that the Fed believes the recovery is on track. Ian Kernohan, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, says: \u201cThe Fed made little changes in the language or projections for further interest rate hikes. They acknowledged that inflation was running below target, but also that job gains have been solid. We expect another rate hike and some balance sheet normalisation before the end of the year.\u201d In another sign of confidence, the Fed outlined its plans to start selling off some of the assets bought during its stimulus programme. During a press conference, Janet Yellen said she\u2019d not discussed her future with president Trump. She remains committed to serving her full term (to February 2018). Wall Street took the news in its stride, with the Dow Jones ending the day at a new high thanks to rising financial stocks. The US dollar also strengthened during Yellen\u2019s press conference, as traders anticipated further rate hikes down the line. Scott Minerd of investment firm Guggenheim Partners sums it up: That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW DING DING goes the closing bell on Wall Street. And the Dow Jones industrial average has finished at a record high, up around 0.2% But the technology-focused Nasdaq index has dropped by 0.6%. Capital Economists have provided a brisk summary of the Fed\u2019s decisions today: As widely expected, the Fed raise its policy rate target by an additional 25bp today, to between 1.00% and 1.25% and, despite the recent weakness of core inflation, Fed officials still expect to raise that rate once more in the second half of this year. The Fed also laid out plans for shrinking its balance sheet, with the initial run-off even smaller than we had previously expected, although it offered no specifics on the timing of when that normalisation would begin other than \u201cthis year\u201d. Wall Street isn\u2019t too happy with Janet Yellen\u2019s comments. The Nasdaq index has dropped by 1% after the Fed chair downplayed recent weak inflation data and signalled that US interest rates will continue to rise over the next couple of years. The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.25%, while the Dow Jones industrial average is flat. Finally, Yellen gets a question about apprenticeships, and Donald Trump\u2019s new push to get more Americans to develop their work skills on the job (a specialist subject for the President, of course). Yellen agrees that it\u2019s an important area. It is hard for firms to find workers with appropriate skills right now, as the labor market is so tight. It\u2019s a particular problem for smaller businesses, she explains, as they have less latitude to retrain workers. That\u2019s the end of the press conference Q: Now you are getting ready to reduce your balance sheet, what have you learned about QE and whether it works? Great question, says Yellen, who explains how staff at the Fed, and outside, have done a great deal of work evaluating QE. I think we have learned that it works, it\u2019s a valuable part of the toolkit. How has it worked, exactly? Yellen says QE (buying huge amounts of bonds with new money) succeeded in putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. And it hasn\u2019t caused the \u201crunaway inflation\u201d which some critics feared. \u201cQuite the reverse\u201d says Yellen, dryly. So in future, if the Fed hit an episode of extreme economic weakness its primary weapon would be interest rates. But if it reached the point where it couldn\u2019t cut again (the zero lower bound), QE could be deployed. Q: The president has credited you with being a \u2018low interest rate\u2019 person. Do you agree? Yellen says she \u2018strongly supported\u2019 the Fed\u2019s policy of keeping interest rates at record lows after the financial crisis -- so i guess she\u2019s accepting the accolade, despite having just raised rates! Q: What do you say to the group of economists who are calling for the Fed\u2019s inflation target to be raised? [This group, which includes Nobel laureate Joe Stiglitz, warned that the Fed could trigger a recession if it kept raising rates] Yellen plays a straight bat (unlike the England cricket team today, alas), saying it\u2019s a very important issue. The Fed is open to a wide range of views, and might reconsider its target sometime in the future....ants to take in a wide range of views. Fidelity\u2019s chief economist, Anna Stupnytska, is surprised that Yellen is sounding more cautious - especially about inflation and wage growth. Back to inflation... Q: Is it possible that globalisation, and falling central bank credibility, mean we\u2019ve entered an era of low inflation where it will be very hard to get wages and prices rising again? Yellen doesn\u2019t think that the Federal Reserve\u2019s credibility has been impaired (but what else would a Fed chair say?!). But it\u2019s \u201ccertainly possible\u201d that structural factors are partly to blame, she adds. Yellen says she\u2019s not seen much evidence that Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tax and spending plans have changed consumer or business spending. Q: Is the Fed worried about the recent run of weak inflation futures? Yellen doesn\u2019t sound too worried, saying that inflation can be \u201cnoisy\u201d and affected by idiosyncratic factors. She cites cuts to cell phone contract prices, and some over-the-counter medicines. Onto questions, and the press pack quickly home in on Yellen\u2019s future. Q: Have you spoken to the president about the possibility of serving a second term, and would you be interested? Yellen says she is fully committed to serving her full first term, but she\u2019s not had any discussions with president Trump about a second term. She declines to say whether she\u2019d like to say on when her first term expires (in February 2018). [Background: Trump dropped loud hints last year that he would replace Yellen] Q: Are you disappointed that Trump\u2019s administration haven\u2019t produced any nominees for the Fed\u2019s board of governors? The White House is working hard to find nominees for open slots, Yellen replies. She \u201cvery much hopes\u201d there will be nominations in the not too distant future. Yellen is now outlining the Fed\u2019s plan to start reducing its balance sheet later this year [details here]. She confirms that the Fed will take a cautious approach, initially with a $6bn monthly cap on sales of Treasury bonds and $4bn on mortgage-backed securities. This cap, which is expected to rise every quarter, will avoid any \u201cmarket strains\u201d as the Fed sells some of the assets bought during the financial crisis to stimulate the economy. Yellen also cautions that there is no rush to take decisions about the long-run framework of monetary policy. Big decisions, like the ideal future composition of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, needn\u2019t be taken for \u201cquite some time\u201d. Janet Yellen also acknowledges the shooting in Virginia earlier today, where several people including Steve Scalise, Republican House majority whip, were shot. Our thoughts are with those who were injured this morning, the Fed chair says. Fed chair Janet Yellen explains that today\u2019s interest hike reflects the \u201cprogress\u201d in the economy, which appears to have \u201crebounded\u201d after slowing in the first three months of 2017. A pick-up in global growth is helping US exports, she says. Yellen adds that the job market will probably strengthen further, but cautions that it is near its \u201cmaximum sustainable level\u201d. On inflation, she credits one-off factors for the recent slowdown in inflation. And the bottom line - the Fed continues to expect that gradual increases in borrowing costs will be needed to keep inflation close to target, while sustaining the economic expansion. But, rates are still likely to be lower than in previous economic cycles, she adds. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is holding a press conference to discuss today\u2019s decisions. You can watch it live here. Yellen is explaining that the Fed \u201ccontinues to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace\u201d, as conditions continue to improve in the labour market. The most important news tonight is the new guidelines on Fed balance sheet reduction. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. Stevenson explains: There was never much doubt that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by a further 0.25% at today\u2019s meeting to between 1% and 1.25%. ... More important was what the US central had to say about its plans to rein in its bloated balance sheet, which has ballooned to $4.5trn since the financial crisis as the Fed has bought government and mortgage-backed bonds to underpin the American economy. The Fed said today that it would decrease reinvestment of maturing bonds at a steadily increasing rate until after a year it is holding back $30bn a month on Government bonds and $20bn on mortgage backed securities. The Fed has taken another step towards \u201cnormalisation\u201d, says Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management commented. \u201cRecent economic indicators have not been weak enough to prevent Yellen pulling the lever on the third rate hike in seven months. Yes, inflation remains elusive, and wage growth relatively weak, but the data does not suggest growth has slowed enough to suggest a change in tack. The decision to raise rates doesn\u2019t signal the beginning of \u2018tight\u2019 monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, but it does mark another step towards normalisation, as well as confidence in the long-term recovery of the economy.\u201d Today\u2019s interest rate hike shows that the Federal Reserve is confident that the US economy is recovering, says Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab. Samra adds: Despite recent underwhelming jobs numbers, the underlying US economic data remains robust enough to warrant tightening. While the economy is bouncing back from a weak first quarter, earnings have been strong and even in the wake of continued political uncertainty, corporate confidence remains secure. The market has demonstrated that it is comfortable with gradual rate hikes and will be reassured that the Fed has today committed to its promises. We expect at least one more rate hike this year but incoming data will influence future decisions.\u201d We have some unexpected news - the Fed has outlined how it expects to start reducing its huge balance sheet. Reuters has a great explanation: The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. \u201cThe committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated,\u201d the Fed said in its statement. According to an addendum released with the policy statement, the Fed anticipates that the balance sheet reduction plan would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities. The Fed sees the cap for Treasury securities to be $6 billion per month initially, increasing in $6 billion increments at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month. For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, increasing by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reaches $20 billion per month. The Federal Reserve has updated its dot plot, which shows where each policymaker thinks interest rates will be over the next few years. It shows that 4 policymakers expect rates will remain on hold for the rest of 2017. Eight Fed voters predict one more rate hike -- the central view - and another four expect two. As this chart shows, that means one voter is less hawkish than in March. The US dollar has fallen by 0.4% against a basket of currencies as Wall Street digests today\u2019s announcement. In its prepared statement, the Federal Reserve says that America\u2019s labour market has \u201ccontinued to strengthen\u201d since its last meeting. Economic activity has been \u201crising moderately\u201d so far this year, the Fed says: Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand. The Fed also acknowledge that inflation is \u201csomewhat below 2%\u201d \u2013 a nod to today\u2019s weaker-than-expected CPI data. They add: Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilise around the committee\u2019s 2% objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. Breaking: The Federal Reserve has voted to raise American interest rates today, to a range of 1% to 1.25%. That\u2019s a quarter-point move, and exactly what Wall Street expected ... The Fed has also stuck to its forecast of one more interest rate rise this year. Just over 15 minutes to go, until the Federal Reserve either delivers the interest rate hike that the markets expect, or shocks us by leaving borrowing costs on hold ... Earlier, on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, the consensus seemed to be the US Federal Reserve would be raising rates. George Magnus, economist and senior advisor at UBS said: I think they [the Fed] really want to do this [rate rise] and I think they want to do it because they are trying to normalise the situation. They\u2019re quite worried about sub prime \u2013 in other words less than good quality automobile loans and commercial real estate. So they have other concerns in addition to the economy. After today, though, things might change, because if inflation doesn\u2019t pick up in the United States later this year then the expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep going will be revised. Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said: The US economy is fundamentally a 2% growth economy. All the soft data, the surveys have been great but if you look at the hard data it doesn\u2019t look as great, it doesn\u2019t look terrible either. The US recovery is continuing, it\u2019s not as strong as the markets might suggest ... I also agree that the Fed will hike rates today. As long as the markets are aligned as they are with yields pretty low, the dollar fairly weak but equity markets soaring, it gives the Fed room to hike. Of course they\u2019d like to not just normalise rates but start shrinking their balance sheet but there\u2019s a deadline for that which is when Janet Yellen\u2019s term ends next year. A slump in the oil price after disappointing US weekly inventory figures has seen some of the shine come off stock markets. The FTSE 100 has also been hit by a rise in sterling, which is bad news for the overseas earners which dominate the UK\u2019s leading index. On top of that, commodity companies fell back despite some reasonable industrial production figures from China. There was also some caution among investors ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 26.04 points or 0.35% at 7474.40 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.32% to 12,805.95 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.35% at 5243.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.61% to 20,960.55 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.98% at 10,775.8 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.48% to 800.97 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 9 points or 0.04%. On oil, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Oil prices are in freefall again, thanks to a second consecutive failure of forecasters on the oil inventories front. Stockpiles dropped by much less than forecast, although at least they got the direction right this week, after last week\u2019s shock rise in inventories. What is particularly noticeable is that oil production continues to rise, even as prices fall. It looks like everyone is keen to get as much sold before another rout in prices. WTI now trades at its lowest level in six weeks, with little sign of a turnaround in place. Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate are now down more than 2%. The weekly US oil figures have shown a smaller than forecast fall in crude stocks. The Energy Information Admistration said crude stocks fell by 1.66m barrels last week to 511.55m, lower than the 2.7m drop expected by the market and indicating weaker than expected demand. Gasoline stocks rose by 2.1m barrels compared to forecasts of a 0.5m decline. Crude prices, which have been buffetted by concerns that Opec\u2019s output cuts were having little effect given rising US production, have seen their losses increase following the figures. Brent, down 0.88% before the US data, has now fallen 1.64% to $47.92 a barrel. West Texas Intermediated has seen its losses increase from 0.8% to 1.89%. Back with the dollar, and it has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since the start of November. The single currency currently sits at $1.1286, up 0.64%, after reaching $1.1295. With the uncertainty over the Federal Reserve\u2019s view on further interest rate rises in the wake of the day\u2019s weak data, Wall Street has made a mixed start. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new peak of 21,354 initially, before falling back to 21,334, a gain of around 6 points. The S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.12% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, also believes the weak US data casts doubts on further Federal Reserve rate hikes after today: A double dose of soft economic data sent the US dollar plunging and gold rallying before the Federal Reserve rate decision. Slowing inflation and flat retail sales add to the growing sense that today\u2019s meeting could see the last US rate rise this year. We would be in a state of shock if the Federal Reserve didn\u2019t lift interest rates at its meeting later today.... Movement in the dollar will depend on what kind of signal policymakers give about the next hike, possibly in September. The US economy has not been firing on all cylinders but the Fed risks losing credibility if it backed off from a rate hike when it\u2019s been so heavily intonated. A \u2018dovish hike\u2019 seems most appropriate, which may not be enough to generate enthusiasm for the dollar. With the expectations for further US rate rises after today dimming, the dollar is continuing to weaken. This is to the benefit of the pound, which has climbed above $1.28 for the first time since the UK election. It was a brief moment, but sterling is still up 0.36% at $1.2795. The weaker than expected US inflation and retail sales figures could mean the Federal Reserve being more cautious about further interest rate rises this year, says James Knightley of ING Bank: This [data] creates more of a headache for the Federal Reserve in how it communicates its hiking strategy. They keep talking about slower growth and weaker inflation being transitory (the word was used on nine separate occasions in the minutes to the May FOMC meeting), but the longer we go without seeing growth and inflationary pressures is resulting in the markets becoming less convinced about higher interest rates. With little sign of tax reform and fiscal stimulus coming the Fed will likely sound more cautious on the prospect of an additional hike later this year even though their forecasts will almost certainly include it when released later on today. The dollar has just hit a one week-low against a basket of currencies, as the markets give their verdict to that double-dose of US data. Jamie McGeever of Reuters says today\u2019s inflation figures were much weaker than expected: Matt Boesler of Bloomberg has spotted that the markets are repricing their interest rate hike expectations: Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets wonders if the Fed might even leave interest rates on hold today, rather than delivering the hike that has been priced in by the markets: Chris Vecchio of Daily FX suggests the US dollar will have a volatile day Another newsflash! US retail sales have suffered their biggest decline in 16 months. Retail sales declined by 0.3% in May, new figures from the Commerce Department show. That\u2019s the biggest drop since January 2016, and dashes expectations of a 0.1% rise. It\u2019s another signal that the US recovery might not be as strong as hoped, and means the dollar is getting quite a hoofing. Newsflash: America\u2019s inflation rate has fallen!, surprising the markets and sending the dollar sliding. Consumer prices across the US dropped by 0.1% during May, having risen by 0.2% in April. And that dragged the annual inflation rate down to 1.9%, down from 2.2% a month ago. Core inflation, which strips out the prices of volatile elements like gasoline and food, only rose by 1.7% - the weakest rise since May 2015. This gives America\u2019s central bankers something to think about, as they gather for today\u2019s meeting. It probably won\u2019t stop the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in under six hours time, but it might make them more cautious about the next rise.... Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says Britain\u2019s wage squeeze since the financial crisis struck is \u201cstaggeringly\u201d bad. He writes: Cast your mind back to March 2008. The financial markets have been in turmoil since the previous summer and in the previous month the Labour government has been forced to nationalise the troubled bank Northern Rock. Few realised it at the time but the economy had peaked. A deep and brutal recession was about to begin. In that month, the average basic weekly wage, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3473. The recession officially came to an end by late 2009 and after a couple of years of weak and patchy growth, the worst seemed to be over. Activity picked up, unemployment started to come down. Yet more than nine years after the slump of 2008 began, wages \u2013 the yardstick by which most people judge whether the economy is doing well or not \u2013 have not recovered. In fact, according to the Office for National Statistics, they have gone backwards. The average basic weekly wage, adjusted for movements in prices, now stands at \u00a3458. More here: Over in Europe and eurozone industrial production rose by 0.5% month on month in April, with March\u2019s figure revised up from a 0.1% fall to a 0.2% increase. Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said: The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u2019s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high. Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u2019s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity. ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter: Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up. The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment. Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter. In all, statistics office Eurostat said 154.8m people were employed in the eurozone in the first quarter, the highest number on record. Here are the Liberal Democrats on the fall in real wages. The party\u2019s leader Tim Farron joined the calls for an end to the freeze on public sector pay rises: For a government that used to bang on about the Just About Managing, they are doing diddly squat to help them. This represents the biggest fall in real wages since August 2014. Staff are working more hours, for less pay and with higher levels of stress. More people are living pay cheque to pay cheque and having to struggle at the end of every month to get by. Britain needs a pay rise and it is time the government delivered it, especially for the public sector. Our nurses, care workers, teachers and soldiers have bared the brunt of the economic crisis and seen their pay capped and wages squeezed. Enough is enough. We need to raise the wages of our public sector workers. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s unemployment report: The pound has now dropped into the red, as the City shows its disappointment with Britain\u2019s poor wage growth. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2725. The wage squeeze is a \u201cheadache\u201d for Britain\u2019s government (on top of everything else) says the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Helen Barnard, JRF\u2019s head of analysis, says the labour market has now reached a tipping point which can\u2019t simply be ignored by Westminster. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that employment levels continue to rise and unemployment has fallen again. But the troubling news for the government is the continued squeeze on wages for those are in work. This is the first time that there has been a year-on-year decrease in real total pay since 2014. \u201cWe have reached a tipping point where rising costs are outstripping earnings, leaving millions of just managing families in a precarious position. The election campaign paid precious little attention to the squeezed living standards of low income households and their prospects of finding secure, well-paid work. \u201cIt means the new government must act to ease the strain by lifting the damaging freeze on tax credits, and prioritising plans to drive up pay and productivity across the country.\u201d UNISON, the union, says today\u2019s report shows how much stress the public sector is facing, as it also calls for the 1% pay cap to be ditched. General secretary Dave Prentis warns: \u201cDemand for public services continues to rise, but these figures confirm that the workforce is still being cut. \u201cServices are being starved of funds and staff shortages mean nurses, paramedics, teaching assistants and council employees are having to work even harder, but for less money. \u201cPublic sector workers have not had a proper pay rise since 2011. It is no wonder they feel so undervalued. The public sector pay cap must go.\u201d The governent\u2019s Secretary of State for Work &amp; Pensions, David Gauke, is encouraged that employment remains at record levels. He says: \u201cThis government wants to give everyone the opportunity to succeed, regardless of where they live or their background. \u201cThis is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. \u201cThis is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.\u201d But opposition parties are alarmed by the fall in real wages. Debbie Abrahams MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says: \u201cWe welcome the overall increase in employment, but are deeply concerned that millions remain in low paid, insecure work. \u201cThe Government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts. \u201cWith the cost of basic essentials rising by 2.9 per cent, while wages stagnate, too many of Britain\u2019s families are struggling to get by while Theresa May focuses on holding her unstable coalition of chaos together. \u201cOnly a Labour government will ensure working people\u2019s living standards are protected with a real Living Wage of \u00a310 per hour, and an immediate end to austerity spending cuts. \u201cThe Prime Minister must stand aside and let a Labour government build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u201d John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, suggests the government may have to bow to pressure and end its 1% cap on public sector pay rises, as the TUC and others demand. With inflation likely to be heading above 3% later this year, the squeeze on real pay growth is now getting serious and is likely to dampen real consumer spending growth for some time to come. The cost of Brexit to people\u2019s living standards due to the fall in the pound is becoming ever more apparent. \u201cThe squeeze is even more severe in the public sector, where pay is only rising at around 1%. The sustainability of this pay policy for nurses, doctors, teachers and other key public service workers will come increasingly into doubt as inflation rises to 3% and above later this year.\u201d Today\u2019s report also shows how the public sector has shrunk since the financial crisis. Just 17.0% of all people in work were employed in the public sector, which is the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. There are now 5.42 million people employed in the public sector, down 20,000 in the last year, and the lowest since June 1999. The rise of Britain\u2019s \u2018Gig economy\u2019, with its low-paid, precarious jobs, is surely a factor behind the weak wage growth. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, says it is \u201cremarkable\u201d that pay is so weak when the employment rate is at a record high of nearly 75%. Hard times and near full employment make strange bedfellows, highlighting the extent to which a de-regulated labour market with an abundance of workers available to fill low wage vacancies has altered the UK jobs landscape.\u2019 The Resolution Foundation have crunched today\u2019s figures, to show how Britain\u2019s workers\u2019 pay is still below its levels before the financial crisis (once you adjust for inflation). They also show how the economy is still creating jobs, although some parts of the country aren\u2019t feeling the benefits as much as others: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, also fears that the pay squeeze will hurt growth: The UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages. First-quarter GDP figures were disappoining, while a recent report from VISA confirmed consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Households are being squeezed from both directions, with inflation rising faster than expected and wages rising more slowly. This doesn\u2019t bode well for economic growth \u2013 the UK economy is heavily reliant on the consumer and falling real incomes will eventually translate into lower retail sales. The pay squeeze puts more pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates to curb inflation, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital (whose hopes of stronger wage growth have been firmly dashed). He writes: Wages are climbing at a rate of just 2.1%, or just 1.7% when you excluded bonuses. This run rate is just not enough to sustain consumer spending where it has been of late when inflation is accelerating. Average earnings in real terms slumped by 0.6%, or 0.4% including bonuses. This will have a material effect on GDP growth in the second quarter. The pay-inflation gap is widening despite record low unemployment, which is also a sign of structural problems for the UK economy. Total pay growth was running above 3% in the first half of 2015, when inflation was anchored at around zero. That sweet spot is well and truly over. Real pay is falling across the economy, points out Professor Geraint Johnes, Director of Research at the Work Foundation: On the three month average measure, pay settlements fell from 2.3% in March to 2.1% in April [that\u2019s including bonuses]. The fall in the single month measure is more dramatic \u2013 from 2.4% to 1.2% - though it should be noted that this measure is generally held to be less reliable. On the single month measure, there were falls in average weekly earnings in both the finance and construction sectors in April. There is no sector of the economy in which wages are currently rising as fast as prices. The squeeze in real wages is back, and there seems to be little prospect of an immediate recovery.\u201d Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, has a few theories for why real wages are shrinking again. One could be \u2018slack in the labour market\u2019 - which is economist speak for the fact that the jobs market isn\u2019t working as well as it could. This is usually down to underemployment: people working part-time who want a full-time job or hidden unemployment: people who are not actively looking for work but who would rejoin the workforce if the jobs market were stronger. Another factor is the problem of poor productivity. This isn\u2019t unique to the UK and has been an issue in many developed world economies since the financial crisis. While most economists concur that slowing productivity is one of the most serious problems in their field today, few can agree on the cause and still less on the right response. Whatever the reason, the situation looks pretty bad: The TUC, which represents Britain\u2019s workers, is calling on the government to act now and end its curbs on public sector pay. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the policy (which restricts pay rises to 1%) must go. \u201cReal wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we\u2019ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis. \u201cMinisters must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it\u2019s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. \u201cBritain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.\u201d The fall in UK real wages is likely to hurt economic growth, warns Naeem Aslam of Think Markets. It is the UK consumers who have been pulling the UK economy and if we see them slowing down, it surely means that economy cannot do well Brexit is certainly on the centre stage when it comes to this and I personally believe that investors are feeling the impact of this. Dutch bank ING is alarmed by the slowdown in UK pay growth, at a time when Britain\u2019s political future is so unclear. Bloomberg\u2019s Sarah Rappaport is worried about the impact on the public: Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group is concerned that the link between wages and unemployment appears to have broken down (with unemployment at a 42-year low, labour scarcity should drive earnings up). Today\u2019s report also shows that British workers are suffering the worst wage squeeze in two and a half years. The ONS says: Between February to April 2016 and February to April 2017 in real terms (that is, adjusted for consumer price inflation) total pay for employees in Great Britain fell by 0.4%, the lowest growth rate since July to September 2014. If you include bonuses, average pay grew by 2.1%. That\u2019s better than the 1.7% rise in regular pay, but still not enough to keep up with inflation. The Office for National Statistics says: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.6% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Breaking! Basic pay in the UK economy grew by a meagre 1.7% year-on-year in the three months to April. That\u2019s much worse than expected, and also the lowest rise in regular pay since February 2016. It means that real wages are shrinking at an even faster rate than feared -- inflation was 2.7% in April (and 2.9% in May!) so pay simply isn\u2019t keep pace with the cost of living. Today\u2019s jobs report also shows that the unemployment rate remained at a 42-year low of 4.6%. The number of people out of work fell by 50,000 in the three months to April. The employment total jumped by 109,000 during the quarter, to 31.954. More to follow! The pound is dipping back as City traders brace for the jobs report... The pound should strengthen if today\u2019s wage figures are less grim than feared. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: Unemployment is likely to be decent so the focus is on earnings. Stronger-than-expected wage growth could help support sterling a touch as it will help offset concerns that falling real wages is destroying consumer spending. Yesterday\u2019s inflation beat at 2.9% highlights the problems facing the economy so a sign that earnings are at least trying to keep pace will be welcome and allay concerns that consumers stop spending. City economists expect that total pay rose by 2.4% in the three months to April - but only by 2.0% if bonuses are stripped out. We\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re right in 20 minutes... You can get up to speed on the state of Britain\u2019s labour market with these charts from economist Rupert Seggins: The US dollar is under some pressure today ahead of the Federal Reserve decision, which is helping nudge the pound up. With an interest rate hike today \u2018priced in\u2019, traders are focusing on the tone of the decision from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale expects the Fed to sound cautious about the long-term path for interest rates. The FOMC\u2019s response is likely to be a \u2018dovish hike\u2019 and that\u2019s priced in, to a large degree. Uncertain about how much slack there is in the economy or the labour market, FOCM members are inclined to want to \u2018normalise\u2019 rates while they have the chance, but they seem very pragmatic about the longer-term outlook. So more likely to raise rates now, without overlay hawkish commentary, and then lay the groundwork for another hike in the autumn if markets don\u2019t take fright in the weeks ahead. In the City, the FTSE 250 index - which contains medium-sized UK-focused firms - has jumped by 0.5% in early trading. Housebuilder Bellway is the biggest riser, up 3.6%, after reporting that customer demand for new homes is still strong. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is flat, although its housebuilders (Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Persimmon) are all rising. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Sterling is rising in early trading, hitting its highest level since Britain\u2019s shock general election results landed. The pound has gained a third of a cent to $1.278, as traders brace for this morning\u2019s UK jobs report. It\u2019s also a little higher against the euro, at just below \u20ac1.14. The possibility that Britain could now seek a \u2018softer Brexit\u2019 from the European Union is helping the pound recover. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga explains: Currency investors remained cautiously optimistic over a softer Brexit following last week\u2019s UK election outcome, resulting in a hung parliament. Although the political uncertainty in the UK and pending Brexit negotiations are still in focus, much attention will be directed towards the UK jobs report this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze will be dragged back into the spotlight today, when the latest employment data is released. City economists fear today\u2019s figures will show that wages are falling further behind inflation, which has been driven up to 2.9% in May by the weak pound (as we learned yesterday). Basic pay rises (excluding bonuses) are expected to have fallen to 2.0% in the three months to April. That would mean real wages have kept falling this year, bringing more pain to struggling families across the country. On a more positive note, the unemployment rate may remain at a 42-year low (last month it fell to 4.6% , the lowest since 1975), and the employment total probably kept rising in the last quarter. RBC Capital Markets say: Unless last month\u2019s gains somehow turn out to be a total blip, it wouldn\u2019t be too surprising if the level of employment rises again by close to a triple-digit number of thousands in the three months to April. The rotation of workers out of part-time roles into full-time employment is now an established theme and if we see this trend once more it would imply that slack is being partially eroded as a result of reduced \u2018underemployment\u2019. It\u2019s also a big day for the US economy. America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, is widely expected to raise interest rates today - to a target range of 1% to 1.25% (from 0.75% to 1%). Fed chair Janet Yellen will then face the press and give her views on the state of the economy. Wall Street experts predict she\u2019ll try to squash speculation that the Fed is too hawkish. As Lew Alexander, chief economist at Nomura, put it (via Marketwatch): \u201cWe do expect her to try to be somewhat forceful in conveying...to market participants that their skepticism over hikes after the June meeting may not be warranted.\u201d We also get new eurozone unemployment figures, plus new retail sales and inflation statistics from America. European stock markets are expected to be flattish, as investors hunker down ahead of the Fed decision tonight.

Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit Research, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eurozone enters the second quarter on a good footing. Industrial production accelerated in April, expanding by 0.5% month on month from 0.2% in the previous month. The industrial production increase was broad-based across its main components (with durable capital goods being the only exception), but not across the largest economies. Germany led the way, while France and Italy recorded slight declines. However, part of the weakness is due to some technical factors related to both the Easter break and a bridge-day effect in Italy that weighed on the number of working days and, thus, on factory activity. This might explain why today\u2019s figure, albeit good, seems disappointing when compared to the exceptionally strong manufacturing PMI reading that in April hit a six-year high.</p> <p>Since the most recent surveys continue to point to a rather solid growth in manufacturing activity in the eurozone, it is fair to expect that May\u2019s hard data from the industrial sector will finally reflect this acceleration in output activity.</p> </blockquote> <p>ING Bank economist Bert Colijn pointed out that much of the growth was due to improvements in energy production, which had underperformed in the first quarter due to a mild winter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Growth in production of goods dropped in April though and capital goods production even declined. While the monthly data for production is volatile, this does show that industry continues to struggle on its way up.</p> <p>The outlook for industry does remain bright though as businesses have been indicating that backlogs of work are increasing as new orders are coming in at a faster pace. This will likely translate into accelerating growth over the course of Q2. Still, while backlogs of work have been increasing, this does not mean that Eurozone industry is overheating. Capacity utilisation has been improving over 2016 and is getting closer to peaks seen in previous expansions, but businesses are also still indicating that a lack of demand is limiting production far more than a lack of labour, funding or equipment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile eurozone employment grew by 0.4% quarter on quarter and 1.5% year on year in the first quarter. In all, statistics office Eurostat said 154.8m people were employed in the eurozone in the first quarter, the highest number on record.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-14T11:41:45.428Z\">at 12.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5941174ae4b0bdd87e2f6ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-14T11:02:36.269Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the Liberal Democrats on the fall in real wages.

      "bodyText": "A former senior policy adviser in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, a coalminer in the Latrobe Valley and a family farmer from New South Wales are among a disparate group of Australians who say a universal basic income could significantly improve their lives. The Green Institute has released a new paper, Views of a UBI: Perspectives from Across Australia, that records the views of different Australians on universal basic income (UBI), a contentious policy idea that is slowly gaining international currency. It comes a week after Chris Bowen, the shadow treasurer, argued forcefully against a UBI during a speech to the progressive thinktank PerCapita, calling it a \u201cterrible idea\u201d and urging his Labor party colleagues not to support it. He said Labor should not give up on the principle \u201cof ensuring dignity through work\u201d and said he wouldn\u2019t want to see the government providing \u201cpayments to millionaires\u201d. Tim Hollo, the executive director of the Green Institute, told Guardian Australia that Bowen and other senior Labor figures should not be so quick to dismiss UBI as a future policy option. He said the economy and labour market were changing dramatically, and the labour movement may have to start seriously considering a UBI, as opposed to the idea of full employment, to counter the rise of underemployment. \u201cLabor needs to start grappling again with big questions about the future of work and whether full employment at full-time is where we want to be heading,\u201d Hollo said. \u201cMight we not actually be better off heading towards what John Maynard Keynes was talking about almost 100 years ago, that we should, by this stage, be looking at a 15-hour working week and re-evaluating our ideas of employment and paid work?\u201d The Green Institute is the Greens\u2019 equivalent of the Liberal party\u2019s Menzies Research Centre and Labor\u2019s Chifley Institute. It receives federal funding but its work is published independently of the Greens\u2019 party hierarchy. In its new paper, it asked a disparate group of Australians what their life would be like with a UBI, including: a farmer, a carer, an artist, an Indigenous woman, two people caught up in the Centrelink \u201crobo-debt\u201d debacle, a university student, a coalminer in the Latrobe Valley and a mother. Tjarana Goreng-Goreng, a former senior policy adviser in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, says a UBI may be the policy idea that finally helps to close the gap for Indigenous Australians. Lyndsey Jackson and Amy Patterson, coordinators of the #NotMyDebt campaign against Centrelink\u2019s \u201crobo-debt\u201d debacle, say they support a \u201cthorough conversation\u201d about what a UBI may deliver and how it could be designed. But they warn of the danger of treating UBI as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d. Michael Croft, a farmer from NSW, says a \u201cno strings attached\u201d UBI could be a liberating experience for those caught in \u201cnets of all types\u201d and farmers would be no exception. \u201cFarmers and their families in receipt of UBI would be less constrained by systemic inequities and so freer to innovate, create, adapt, care for country, feed people with good and clean food,\u201d he said. The Australian Greens have argued a UBI should be considered in conjunction with a four-day working week, while the Green party in the United Kingdom has also proposed a UBI and a shorter working week in their current election manifesto. The Green Institute\u2019s paper follows a similar paper from the organisation in December, which argued the rise of contract and casual work meant a shorter working week and UBI may have to become serious policy options in Australia. Bowen has been battling an internal Labor Party push to beef up economic policy, including a campaign for a \u201cBuffett rule\u201d, which would see wealthy Australians forced to pay a minimum rate of tax. Labor\u2019s former treasurer Wayne Swan recently warned Bowen that the ALP needed to avoid being \u201ctrickle-down lite\u201d, or offering voters \u201ca sickening Davos third-way approach\u201d at the next election.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve announced it was raising short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday as the central bank continued to unwind the huge economic stimulus plan brought in after the great recession. After a two-day meeting, the Fed raised the target range of the federal funds rate from 1% to 1.25%, the third consecutive quarterly increase. The move follows a record run of jobs growth in the US that has driven the unemployment rate down to its lowest level in 16 years. \u201cInformation received since the federal open market committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year,\u201d the Fed said in a statement. The committee signaled that more rises were on the horizon and that it \u201cexpects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate\u201d. One member of the Fed\u2019s committee objected to the rate rise. Neel Kashkari, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wanted to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. Kashkari, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the current chair, Janet Yellen, has consistently warned against raising rates, fearing that it might harm the recovery. \u201cWe are still coming up short on our inflation target, and the job market continues to strengthen, suggesting that slack remains,\u201d Kashkari wrote after objecting to a rate rise earlier this year. The Fed also put out a statement about its plans to unwind its gigantic bond portfolio, bought as part of its bid to restart the US economy after the 2007-09 recession. In the wake of that recession, the Fed went on an enormous spending spree, buying bonds in order to keep interest rates down and encourage spending to kickstart the economy. After three rounds of so-called quantitative easing, the Fed acquired $4.5tn worth of bonds, including $1.8tn in mortgage securities. The committee said it planned to \u201cgradually reduce the Federal Reserve\u2019s securities holdings\u201d. In a press conference, Yellen said the Fed intended the sale to be a quiet process that her colleague Patrick Harker, the Philadelphia Fed president, joked should be like \u201cwatching paint dry\u201d. The latest move by the Fed shows that the central bank continues to believe that the US economy is strengthening. Economic activity has \u201cbeen rising moderately so far this year\u201d, household spending has \u201cpicked up\u201d and and hiring remains \u201csolid\u201d, the Fed said. The Fed\u2019s meeting was the first since May\u2019s job report was released. Continued hiring brought the unemployment rate down to a level unseen since 2001 and it was the 80th consecutive month of jobs growth. Hiring has, however, \u201cmoderated\u201d, as the Fed pointed out, and Yellen has expressed concern about the high number of people still in part-time work who are looking for full-time employment. Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst, said: \u201cAs expected, the Federal Reserve followed through with an interest rate hike \u2013 the third in the past six months and fourth in the past 18 months. \u201cBut this could be the last hike for a while. Until we see a reversal of the recent weakness in economic growth, retail sales and inflation, the Fed will be on the sidelines.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Duke of Westminster\u2019s property group is to build 1,500 rental homes in south-east London, one of the capital\u2019s biggest \u201cbuild to rent\u201d developments. The proposed \u00a3500m project will be Grosvenor\u2019s first \u201cbuild to rent\u201d development \u2013 and the first foray into Bermondsey, in south-east London \u2013 in the company\u2019s 340-year history. One of Britain\u2019s biggest property owners, it owns swaths of the capital\u2019s most exclusive neighbourhoods in Mayfair and Belgravia. The firm, owned by 26-year-old Hugh Grosvenor \u2013 who became the Duke of Westminster and Britain\u2019s youngest billionaire last year after his father\u2019s sudden death, is tapping into the rising trend for long-term renting among young professionals. This has led to a growing number of build-to-rent projects in Britain in recent years \u2013 professionally managed rental accommodation in purpose-built blocks, common in many other countries such as the US. Grosvenor plans to construct up to 11 blocks of varying heights on a 12-acre former biscuit factory site in Bermondsey. The tallest tower, with 25 storeys, will be built in the centre of the site, adjacent to a railway line, with a route under the line to The Blue local market. The railway arches will be refurbished as commercial space. Craig McWilliam, chief executive of Grosvenor Britain &amp; Ireland, said the homes were aimed at people on \u201clow and middle incomes who are locked out of London\u2019s housing market\u201d. Some will be made available on a range of discounted market rents, with details yet to be agreed with Southwark council. Catering for a broad range of incomes, including key workers such as nurses and teachers, the Bermondsey project forms part of Grosvenor\u2019s move into more affordable housing projects. Grosvenor Group has been hit by the downturn at the top end of the London housing market. It recently reported a steep fall in returns on its British and Irish property portfolio, its worst UK performance since the financial crisis. It blamed Brexit and the increase in stamp duty on luxury properties. The Bermondsey apartments range from studios to three-bedroom family flats with \u201cgood sizes,\u201d according to Simon Harding-Roots, the firm\u2019s executive director of major projects. Despite the planned swanky entrance area pictured in the draft master plan, he said the firm did not want to create a \u201cyuppie or student ghetto\u201d or a \u201cgated community\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very much about diversity, from students and families to senior living\u201d. He said the project was about \u201cgenuinely responding to the housing crisis in London, and we think we have a role to play\u201d. The company is targeting local residents and Londoners, he stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s a rental product, not an investment product. You would rent the accommodation because you want to live in it.\u201d A master plan unveiled at the start of a public consultation shows the development with a new 600-place secondary school at its heart, alongside 110,000 sq ft of public space and almost 20,000 sq ft of play space. The residential towers will have 85,000 sq ft of shops, cafes, restaurants and cultural spaces on the ground floor. The project has been designed by architects Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. A number of older buildings in the heart of the former Peek Freans biscuit factory, which closed in 1989, will be retained. They are home to small businesses and owned by Workspace Group. McWilliam said: \u201cLondon\u2019s housing shortage is too often creating polarised outcomes, with homes for the few who can afford to buy them, and those allocated social rented accommodation. We want to help create one of London\u2019s greatest neighbourhoods for people of mixed incomes, backgrounds and life stages.\u201d He stressed that Grosvenor would manage all the homes for the long term.",

It blamed Brexit and the increase in stamp duty on luxury properties.</p> <p>The Bermondsey apartments range from studios to three-bedroom family flats with \u201cgood sizes,\u201d according to Simon Harding-Roots, the firm\u2019s executive director of major projects.</p> <p>Despite the planned swanky entrance area pictured in the draft master plan, he said the firm did not want to create a \u201cyuppie or student ghetto\u201d or a \u201cgated community\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s very much about diversity, from students and families to senior living\u201d.</p> <p>He said the project was about \u201cgenuinely responding to the housing crisis in London, and we think we have a role to play\u201d. The company is targeting local residents and Londoners, he stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s a rental product, not an investment product.

The project has been designed by architects Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates. A number of older buildings in the heart of the former Peek Freans biscuit factory, which closed in 1989, will be retained. They are home to small businesses and owned by Workspace Group.</p> <p>McWilliam said: \u201cLondon\u2019s housing shortage is too often creating polarised outcomes, with homes for the few who can afford to buy them, and those allocated social rented accommodation. We want to help create one of London\u2019s greatest neighbourhoods for people of mixed incomes, backgrounds and life stages.\u201d</p> <p>He stressed that Grosvenor would manage all the homes for the long term.</p>",

The Senate on Wednesday passed a motion for an inquiry into the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which is considering a $900m concessional loan to Adani for a railway as part of its massive proposed Queensland coal project. The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters said she would seek to have Adani appear before the inquiry to \u201cgrill them\u201d on their environmental history and \u201cthe allegations of fraud, corruption and the use of tax havens\u201d. Waters said the company would be asked why it needed \u201ca billion taxpayer dollars\u201d if the mine, which would export up to 60m tonnes of coal a year to Asia, was financially viable. A spokesman for Adani, which has denied any wrongdoing in relation to claims of invoicing fraud under investigation in India, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The inquiry motion came a day after reports emerged that Adani Enterprises, the parent company of the Australian mine venture, had been in talks about establishing a weapons venture with an arms business that had earlier been banned in India amid a corruption probe. An Adani spokesman told the Economic Times of India that the company abandoned early talks with the arms business as it was not comfortable with the idea. The motion was passed with Labor and Greens support in the face of opposition by the government. The inquiry, to be run by the economics references committee, will examine the \u201cadequacy and transparency\u201d of the $5b infrastructure fund\u2019s project assessment and approval processes. It will also scrutinise processes around Naif board appointments, including assessments of conflict of interest, and policies to manage these. Jason Clare, the Labor shadow minister for resources and northern Australia, told parliament there had been a \u201ccover up\u201d around governance questions surrounding a Naif board member, Karla Way-McPhail. Clare said an estimates hearing a fortnight ago had established that Way-McPhail, the CEO of two mining services companies that could benefit from Adani\u2019s success, was a \u201cpersonal friend\u201d of the minister overseeing the Naif, Matthew Canavan, and was put forward by him as a board candidate. \u201cAnd this government refuses to say whether she was in the room for [Naif board] discussions about these projects or whether she recused herself,\u201d Clare said. Governance questions like that had prompted the inquiry and a separate Labor call for the Australian National Audit Office to investigate NAIF, he said. The inquiry will look at the adequacy of Naif\u2019s investment mandate, risk appetite statement and public interest test guiding decisions of its board. It will also examine the role of state and territory governments, and any agreements with the federal government, around the fund. Waters claimed the NAIF was \u201cnot about encouraging investment in Northern Australia\u201d but \u201ccreating a slush fund to prop up the dying coal industry\u201d. Clare said it was a \u201cfair bet\u201d that Pippa Middleton\u2019s Northern Territory honeymoon would \u201cprobably deliver more economic development to the north\u201d than the Naif in its first two years. No projects had yet been funded yet more than $600,000 had been spent on salaries and expenses for board members, he said. \u201cAll we know is that over the last two years they have had 119 enquires for funding, they are apparently considering 60 active deals, but there are only four that are currently subject to due diligence.\u201d A spokeswoman for Canavan said: \u201cThe NAIF is accountable to the parliament and will cooperate with requests, as it always has done including through appearances at Senate estimates. \u201cThis inquiry does not add any level of accountability as it is already possible for the Senate to call the NAIF before a committee, even if it\u2019s not on a scheduled estimates day.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Since the May budget one area of dispute has been the raising of the Medicare levy to 2.5% to pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. While the ALP is arguing the new rate should only apply to those earning over $87,000, the progressive thinktank the Austrhighalia Institute has released a paper arguing it is time for the levy to become fully progressive. Progressive taxation has a history of being mangled by treasurers. Joe Hockey did it when talking about the petrol excise and now Scott Morrison has joined the party. When justifying the raising of the Medicare levy Scott Morrison argued that \u201cIf you\u2019re on a higher income, you\u2019ll pay more under our plan. If you\u2019re on lower income, you\u2019ll pay less\u201d. He is right of course only if you talk in terms of nominal figures. Of course someone on $180,000 will pay more in nominal terms than someone on $50,000 \u2013 As the author of the Australian Institute\u2019s report, \u201cTime for a Progressive Medicare Levy\u201d, David Richardson, notes: \u201cTwo per cent of a big number is always going to be bigger than 2% of a smaller number.\u201d Nominal figures tell us nothing about whether or not a tax is progressive. Australia\u2019s income tax \u2013 as with most others in the world \u2013 is a progressive system, which means people pay a higher average rate of tax the more they earn. This occurs by increasing marginal tax rates \u2013 which apply only to the income earned above each threshold (thus for example someone on $200,000 only pays the top tax rate of 45% on the money they earned over $180,000): But the Medicare levy is not progressive. It is a flat tax \u2013 2% no matter how much you earn (with a few exceptions based on family size and income) and it applies to all income. Thus someone on $200,000 pays the 2% Medicare levy on all $200,000, and someone on $70,000 similarly pays 2% on their entire income. As the Australia Institute report notes, moving from a system where the Medicare levy is a flat 2% but with the highest marginal tax rate of 47% (due to the deficit levy) to one where the Medicare levy is 2.5% and the top tax rate is 45%, makes the income tax system less progressive: The sweet spot is $240,000. At that point the 0.05% increase in the Medicare levy is cancelled out by the 2% cut in the top marginal tax rate. Everyone earning above that rate is better off. The ALP has responded to the government\u2019s 2.5% Medicare levy proposal by arguing for the increase to only apply to those earning over $87,000 and also keeping the 2% deficit levy. While that would counter some of the lost progressivity, the Australia Institute has argued that it is time to resurrect an idea from the Henry tax review and make the Medicare levy itself progressive. The Henry tax review noted a couple problems with the Medicare levy. One of these was that it incorrectly leads people to think the levy somehow covers our health expenditure, which it doesn\u2019t. David Richardson notes that while the suggestion of a Medicare levy is needed to pay for the NDIS is a nice enough proposition, \u201cwhen there is a deficit, one could nominate anything and say it \u2018needs funding\u2019\u201d. The Henry tax review also noted that while the Medicare levy appears simple, because of exemptions and because it treats singles differently from couples in ways normal income tax does not, it actually complicates the entire system. The Henry Tax review recommended either absorbing the levy in the income tax system \u2013 ie removing the exemptions and differing treatments for singles and families \u2013 or to make the more progressive by applying it as a proportion of the income tax payable. This is the path chosen by the Australia Institute. The institute estimates that a 8.5% rate on top of people\u2019s average tax rate would make the changes revenue neutral, however for simplicity, it recommends a rate of 10%. How it would work is if you paid an average rate of 20% income tax you would pay an extra 2% in Medicare levy. If you paid an average of 30% in income tax (the rate paid by someone earring around $176,000) you would pay a 3% Medicare levy. The Australia Institute calculates this would mean those earning less than $67,624 would be better off \u2013 a figure they estimate would include 61% of taxpayers: Such a policy would of course bring forward charges that the top income earners are being forced to pay too much tax \u2013 and that our top tax rate would be uncompetitive with other nations. These accusations have already occurred because the ALP proposes keeping the deficit levy. The prime minister recently suggested such a policy with a 49.5% top tax rate \u201cwould send a very poor signal to all Australian workers: don\u2019t bother trying to earn just over two times average full-time weekly earnings\u201d. And yet Australia is actually a low taxing nation for high-income earners. The top tax rate alone is a dumb way to compare income tax systems \u2013 you need to take into account when it kicks in. And despite what you might have heard, on both measures, Australia is nowhere near the top: But the OECD sensibly also looks at the average tax rate, and here Australia does seem to have a high rate. A person on average earnings paid 24.3% average tax in 2016 \u2013 well above the OECD average. But the problem is we don\u2019t have social security contributions taken out in the manner done in other OECD nations. And that skews the average rate down for those nations. The OECD also looks at \u201cnet personal average tax\u201d, which takes into account not only tax paid, but also employee social security contributions and cash benefits they receive. This measure was also used by a tax review done during the Howard government and cowritten by Peter Hendy who until recently was Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s economic adviser. That review noted that the net personal average tax rate was \u201cimportant\u201d because it is \u201ca measure of the employee\u2019s incentive to increase the number of hours they work or to seek promotion\u201d. Using this measure Australia\u2019s tax paid by Australians is well below the OECD average: But the measure I like the most is the \u201ctax wedge\u201d. This measures the difference between what it costs your employer to employ you and what you actually receive. It means we can better compare different tax systems such as those in Europe which include employee and employs social security contributions. The OECD also calculates the tax wedge across different income levels. For those on average full-time earnings (which in 2016 was around $82,000) Australia has a lower average tax wedge than the UK and the US. For those on 220% of average earnings (which in 2016 was equal to $180,000 \u2013 the top tax threshold), Australia had the 9th lowest tax wedge in the OECD: Clearly we need to work harder to send a signal to workers not to \u201cbother trying to earn just over two times average full-time weekly earnings\u201d. Australia\u2019s progressive tax system does not overly penalise high-income earners, but moves to make the tax system flatter by putting more emphasis on measures such as the Medicare levy will shift the burden on to lower-income earners.",

This occurs by increasing marginal tax rates \u2013 which apply only to the income earned above each threshold (thus for example someone on $200,000 only pays the top tax rate of 45% on the money they earned over $180,000):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average income tax rates\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WPtfw/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the Medicare levy is not progressive. It is a flat tax \u2013 2% no matter how much you earn (with a few exceptions based on family size and income) and it applies to all income. Thus someone on $200,000 pays the 2% Medicare levy on all $200,000, and someone on $70,000 similarly pays 2% on their entire income. </p> <p>As the Australia Institute report notes, moving from a system where the Medicare levy is a flat 2% but with the highest marginal tax rate of 47% (due to the deficit levy) to one where the Medicare levy is 2.5% and the top tax rate is 45%, makes the income tax system less progressive:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average income tax rates before and after budget\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GaN3o/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"748\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The sweet spot is $240,000. At that point the 0.05% increase in the Medicare levy is cancelled out by the 2% cut in the top marginal tax rate. Everyone earning above that rate is better off.</p> <p>The ALP has responded to the government\u2019s 2.5% Medicare levy proposal by arguing for the increase to only apply to those earning over $87,000 and also keeping the 2% deficit levy.</p> <p>While that would counter some of the lost progressivity, the Australia Institute has argued that it is time to resurrect an idea from <a href=\"https://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/FinalReport.aspx?doc=html/publications/Papers/Final_Report_Part_2/chapter_a1-1.htm\">the Henry tax review</a> and make the Medicare levy itself progressive. </p> <p>The Henry tax review noted a couple problems with the Medicare levy. One of these was that it incorrectly leads people to think the levy somehow covers our health expenditure, which it doesn\u2019t. </p> <p>David Richardson notes that while the suggestion of a Medicare levy is needed to pay for the NDIS is a nice enough proposition, \u201cwhen there is a deficit, one could nominate anything and say it \u2018needs funding\u2019\u201d. </p> <p>The Henry tax review also noted that while the Medicare levy appears simple, because of exemptions and because it treats singles differently from couples in ways normal income tax does not, it actually complicates the entire system. </p> <p>The Henry Tax review recommended either absorbing the levy in the income tax system \u2013 ie removing the exemptions and differing treatments for singles and families \u2013 or to make the more progressive by applying it as a proportion of the income tax payable. </p> <p>This is the path chosen by the Australia Institute. </p> <p>The institute estimates that a 8.5% rate on top of people\u2019s average tax rate would make the changes revenue neutral, however for simplicity, it recommends a rate of 10%. </p> <p>How it would work is if you paid an average rate of 20% income tax you would pay an extra 2% in Medicare levy. If you paid an average of 30% in income tax (the rate paid by someone earring around $176,000) you would pay a 3% Medicare levy. </p> <p>The Australia Institute calculates this would mean those earning less than $67,624 would be better off \u2013 a figure they estimate would include 61% of taxpayers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Proposed changes to Medicare levy payments\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7IcJr/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\"></iframe>  </figure>  <p>Such a policy would of course bring forward charges that the top income earners are being forced to pay too much tax \u2013 and that our top tax rate would be uncompetitive with other nations. </p> <p>These accusations have already occurred because the ALP proposes keeping the deficit levy. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/increasing-top-tax-rate-to-495-a-penalty-on-success-malcolm-turnbull-says\">prime minister recently suggested</a> such a policy with a 49.5% top tax rate \u201cwould send a very poor signal to all Australian workers: don\u2019t bother trying to earn just over two times average full-time weekly earnings\u201d.</p> <p>And yet Australia is actually a low taxing nation for high-income earners. </p> <p>The top tax rate alone is a dumb way to compare income tax systems \u2013 you need to take into account when it kicks in. And despite what you might have heard, on both measures, Australia is nowhere near the top:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Top income tax rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/o30ar/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the OECD sensibly also looks at the average tax rate, and here Australia does seem to have a high rate. A person on average earnings paid 24.3% average tax in 2016 \u2013 well above the OECD average. But the problem is we don\u2019t have social security contributions taken out in the manner done in other OECD nations. And that skews the average rate down for those nations.</p> <p>The OECD also looks at \u201cnet personal average tax\u201d, which takes into account not only tax paid, but also employee social security contributions and cash benefits they receive. </p> <p>This measure was also used by <a href=\"https://comparativetaxation.treasury.gov.au/content/about_the_authors.asp?NavID=004\">a tax review</a> done during the Howard government and cowritten by Peter Hendy who until recently was Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s economic adviser. That <a href=\"https://comparativetaxation.treasury.gov.au/content/report/html/06_Chapter_4-08.asp\">review noted</a> that the net personal average tax rate was \u201cimportant\u201d because it is \u201ca measure of the employee\u2019s incentive to increase the number of hours they work or to seek promotion\u201d.</p> <p> Using this measure Australia\u2019s tax paid by Australians is well below the OECD average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average tax rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sRL2R/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the measure I like the most is the \u201ctax wedge\u201d. This measures the difference between what it costs your employer to employ you and what you actually receive. It means we can better compare different tax systems such as those in Europe which include employee and employs social security contributions.</p> <p>The OECD also calculates the tax wedge across different income levels. </p> <p>For those on average full-time earnings (which in 2016 was around $82,000) Australia has a lower average tax wedge than the UK and the US. For those on 220% of average earnings (which in 2016 was equal to $180,000 \u2013 the top tax threshold), Australia had the 9<sup>th</sup> lowest tax wedge in the OECD:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average tax wedge\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CtHgk/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Clearly we need to work harder to send a signal to workers not to \u201cbother trying to earn just over two times average full-time weekly earnings\u201d.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s progressive tax system does not overly penalise high-income earners, but moves to make the tax system flatter by putting more emphasis on measures such as the Medicare levy will shift the burden on to lower-income earners. </p>",

Growth in oil supply will outstrip growth in demand during 2018, driven by increasing production from US shale and other countries outside Opec, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The watchdog said its first forecast for 2018 made \u201csobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply\u201d. Oil prices have fallen by about 10% since Opec and non-member countries including Russia recently agreed to extend production cuts until the end of March 2018. The deal was meant to prop up prices, but markets have been unimpressed by the continued curbs. The price of a barrel of oil fell further to $47.12 on Wednesday after new data from the American Petroleum Institute showed US crude stocks had risen 2.8m barrels in the week to 9 June. They had been expected to fall by a similar amount. The IEA has revised its forecast upwards for US oil production this year, and said Brazil and Canada were also expected \u201cto make further gains\u201d. As a result, despite the Opec deal, oil stocks might not fall to the cartel\u2019s desired level \u201cuntil close to the expiry of the agreement in March 2018\u201d, the agency said. \u201c\u2018Whatever it takes\u2019 might be the mantra, but the current form of \u2018whatever\u2019 is not having as quick an impact as expected,\u201d the IEA said in a reference to Saudi Arabia\u2019s promise to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to rebalance oil supply and demand. Efforts to combat the oil glut have not been helped by figures this week that showed Opec as a whole increased production in May because of higher output by Nigeria and Libya, which are not covered by the recent cuts deal. However, the big problem is the US and the speed at which it is adding new oil rigs. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge resource, it\u2019s changed everything,\u201d said Gary N Ross, global head of oil at energy analysts Pira, of US shale. The number of US rigs has climbed to 927, according to the oil services firm Baker Hughes, up from 414 this time last year. The rise has been driven by the oil price climbing back up after an initial deal by Opec and allies last year to cut production by 1.8m barrels of oil a day from January 2017. Ross said surplus oil stocks were being drawn down, \u201cbut not at the rate Opec would like to see\u201d because of US production. He said he believed the price of international benchmark Brent crude would have to drop to $45 a barrel before US rig growth slowed. The analyst also said that the cartel should have \u201cdone more\u201d at its meeting last month, and added that he thought it was in for a period of \u201cperpetual [production] cuts\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain is experiencing a rapid decline in living standards with the biggest squeeze in workers\u2019 pay since 2014, according to the latest official data. Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.6% year on year in the three months to April. It was the weakest data since the summer months in 2014, according to the Office for National Statistics. The decline followed a 0.4% drop in the three months to March. Trade unions reacted with dismay to the figures. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of union umbrella body the TUC, warned that Britain was heading for a fresh crisis in living standards. \u201cReal wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we\u2019ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cMinisters must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it\u2019s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. Britain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.\u201d Len McCluskey, general secretary of Britain\u2019s biggest union, Unite, said millions of workers were struggling to make ends meet. \u201cThe Tories have succeeded in creating the longest period of falling real terms pay since the Napoleonic wars. They are clearly the party of economic mismanagement.\u201d When adjusted for inflation, UK employees are now earning \u00a315 less a week after tax and deductions than they were in March 2008, six months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis. The latest drop in real wages reflects mounting pressure on household budgets, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the EU referendum drives up the cost of goods imported from abroad and feeds through to higher shop prices. The ONS said that before inflation, regular pay growth excluding bonuses slowed to 1.7% year on year in the three months to April. It was much weaker than the 2% growth in pay that had been expected by economists. Pay growth for the three months to March was also revised down sharply to 1.8% from a previous estimate of 2.1%, underlining the pace at which a drop in living standards is taking hold. Prices were rising at a faster rate, with inflation at 2.7% in April, and jumping to 2.9% in May according to ONS data published on Tuesday. The fall in real pay comes despite an employment rate which held 74.8% in the three months to April, the highest since records began in 1971. The number of people in work rose by 109,000 to 31.95 million. Meanwhile the unemployment rate was unchanged at a 42-year low of 4.6% and the number of unemployed people fell by 50,000 to 1.53 million. \u201cThe terrible news on pay comes despite another strong jobs performance, with unemployment remaining at its lowest level in over 40 years,\u201d said Stephen Clarke, economics analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. \u201cThe sharp contrast between our terrible record on pay and strong jobs performance shows that the currency-driven inflation we are experiencing is not feeding through into wage pressures and is simply making us all poorer instead.\u201d The work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, highlighted the jobs figures. \u201cThis is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. This is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.\u201d But Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said Labour was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that millions of people remain in low paid, insecure work. Economists are predicting the pay squeeze will accelerate in the coming months, with inflation likely to rise above 3% and as firms limit pay rises as their own costs rise and the economy weakens. The squeeze is expected to weigh on consumer spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth since the financial crisis. \u201cThe UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages,\u201d said Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown. The weak outlook for consumers and pay is expected to convince policymakers at the Bank of England to look beyond rising inflation \u2013 already well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target \u2013 and leave interest rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% for a prolonged period. Economists at ING bank said policymakers are unlikely to raise rates before 2019. Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills for the CBI business lobby group, said the government must \u201cput the economy front and centre, create stability and ensure the EU negotiations get off to a positive start\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Cast your mind back to March 2008. The financial markets have been in turmoil since the previous summer and in the previous month the Labour government has been forced to nationalise the troubled bank Northern Rock. Few realised it at the time but the economy had peaked. A deep and brutal recession was about to begin. In that month, the average basic weekly wage, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3473. The recession officially came to an end by late 2009 and after a couple of years of weak and patchy growth, the worst seemed to be over. Activity picked up, unemployment started to come down. Yet more than nine years after the slump of 2008 began, wages \u2013 the yardstick by which most people judge whether the economy is doing well or not \u2013 have not recovered. In fact, according to the Office for National Statistics, they have gone backwards. The average basic weekly wage, adjusted for movements in prices, now stands at \u00a3458. This is a quite staggering performance, which breaks all sorts of records for all the wrong reasons. There has been nothing like the current squeeze on real wages in living memory. The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank that concentrates on the living standards of those on middle and low incomes, says the 2010s are on course to be the worst decade for wage growth since the one that included the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. There is certainly no immediate prospect of workers becoming better off. In the past 12 months, wages have grown more slowly than prices. Basic pay in the three months to April 2017 was 0.6% lower than in the same three months of 2016. The increase in prices is pretty easy to explain. Inflation was artificially low as a result of a temporary collapse in oil prices. The cost of crude has subsequently recovered a bit, but the depreciation of the pound since the Brexit referendum has also had the effect of pushing up the cost of living. The continued depressed state of wages takes a bit more explaining. For years, the Bank of England has been predicting that the fall in unemployment will make it harder for employers to attract and retain workers, forcing them to offer more generous pay deals. But that has simply not happened. In the past year, employment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has started to bite: in past times a combination of factors that would lead to pressure for higher wages. But a year ago regular pay was rising by 2.4%; now it is rising by 1.7%. As John Philpott, who runs the Jobs Economist consultancy, noted: \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is that pay growth, however measured, is so weak at a time when employment is at joint record rate of 74.8% and unemployment at a 42-year low of 4.6%, driven almost entirely in the latest quarter by relatively strong growth in full-time jobs for employees on permanent contracts. Hard times and near full employment make strange bedfellows, highlighting the extent to which a deregulated labour market with an abundance of workers available to fill low wage vacancies has altered the UK jobs landscape.\u201d Pay curbs in the public sector are a factor but they are not the whole story. Just as in the early 19th century, private sector employers feel no need to pay higher wages. Despite the fall in the jobless total, they can tap into a large pool of unskilled, deunionised, insecure workers. History is repeating itself.",
