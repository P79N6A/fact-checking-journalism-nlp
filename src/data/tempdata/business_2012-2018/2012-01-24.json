The announcement was made by Bill Knight, one of the FSA report's two external supervisors, under protection of parliamentary privilege. \"It is true that reference to Sir Fred was changed,\" he told an MPs' committee. \"There was [in early drafts] a suggestion he lacked the experience to run an international bank.\" The FSA has said it is unable to disclose who was interviewed for last month's report, including whether or not it spoke to Goodwin.

Initially defending that decision, the FSA chairman, Lord Turner, claimed that a report on the failures at RBS \"would add little if anything to our understanding of what went wrong\". Eventually, under pressure from Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, the FSA agreed to prepare a report for publication. The business secretary, Vince Cable, has privately made clear that there will be no more probing of past events at RBS. He will not use his powers to launch a formal section 432 inspection, as has been common practice concerning past corporate scandals such as Guinness, MG Rover, Maxwell, Lloyds, and House of Fraser. The public, therefore, will have no forensic analysis concerning fault against named individuals at the FSA and RBS, or among the bank's advisers. Knight defended the government's decision not to have a full inspection suggesting they took \"a very long time, cost a great deal of money and are quite often noncommittal\". Some of the MPs disagreed, suggesting the cost, to taxpayers and the wider economy, of RBS's 2008 crisis merited as full an explanation as possible being given to the public. Other countries, including the US, Ireland and Iceland, which have experienced banking crises, have offered much fuller official accounts of events leading up to their financial-sector woes.",

      "standfirst": "As the annual gathering opens Cherie Blair joins others in mapping out the tough challenges ahead for global wellbeing", 
      "body": "<h2><strong>Cherie Blair:</strong> founder, CB Foundation for Women</h2> <p>How to ensure women's economic inclusion, because economies will not thrive unless we do.</p> <p>This issue stretches&#xa0;all the way from the number of women in Davos and the glass ceiling&#xa0;in the developed world, to helping poor&#xa0;women in the developing&#xa0;world set up their own businesses and survive.</p> <p>I don't think the people who go to Davos deny that this is a major issue; many are really committed and understand that it is not tokenism. They &#xa0;read the same reports about the &#xa0;value of investing in women, in terms of education and employment, as I do.</p> <p>The World Food Programme has found that when girls and women earn income, they reinvest 90% of the money in their families. For men, that figure is more like 30% to 40%.</p> <p>I'm a great believer in the gender parity group at Davos: it is not about &#xa0;the&#xa0;exclusion of men, but men and women working together as equal &#xa0;partners to bring about change.</p> <p>We have all heard the Chinese proverb about women holding up 50% of the sky, and we should act on it.</p> <h2><strong>Bill Gates:</strong> co-chair, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</h2> <p>It is inevitable that the conversation at &#xa0;the World Economic Forum will focus &#xa0;on the challenges faced by the global economy. While it's true these are difficult times, in several areas (fuelled by innovation) we're seeing real&#xa0;progress (read more in my <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/annual-letter/2012/Pages/home-en.aspx\">2012 Annual Letter</a>).</p> <p>The most notable signs of success have been in improving global health and agriculture.</p> <p>In both of these areas, we have an opportunity to continue helping the poorest people become more self-sufficient through smart investments.</p> <p>So, amid the debate of the eurozone crisis, I will be asking tough questions about the one billion lives that hang in &#xa0;the balance if global leaders continue &#xa0;to slash international development budgets.</p> <p>Are we ready to deny millions of&#xa0;children affordable, life-saving vaccines?</p> <p>Will we no longer help poor farmers save their families and communities from starvation?</p> <p>We cannot allow ourselves to do less. The fact is, we need to do even more. At Davos and throughout 2012, I hope we talk about how.</p> <h2><strong>Barbara Stocking: </strong>chief executive, Oxfam</h2> <p>For me, meeting world leaders, economic thinkers and heads of the world's biggest corporations means a fleeting chance to influence the path of global development. I will be pushing conversations towards targets for sustainable and fair patterns of consumption and production \u2013 suggesting that GDP growth is only one measure of human success.</p> <p>Rushed encounters while stamping snow from your boots are where historic moves are made in Davos. And, a single dinner next to a head of state can open doors for Oxfam and start setting the tone for the meetings in the year ahead.</p> <p>We are negotiating a difficult path for the successful future of humanity. The challenge for the 21st century is how to ensure all people live free of poverty and deprivation while staying within the natural boundaries of the planet.</p> <p>Oxfam has long argued that the problems faced by the world's poorest stem from our inability to share the planet's resources fairly. The unpalatable truth for the western world &#xa0;is that there are no longer enough to go around \u2013 not if those in the developing world continue to consume them at current levels.</p> <h2><strong>Lord Turner: </strong>chairman, Financial Services Authority</h2> <p>The global financial crisis, which broke in 2007-8, has had a more severe and lasting impact on economic growth than most experts assumed, once the initial shock subsided.</p> <p>That impact has rightly produced a challenge to the overconfident intellectual assumptions of the pre-crisis era \u2013 assumptions never more prevalent than in some pre-crisis Davos meetings.</p> <p>In response, we must ensure we have understood the fundamental causes of the crisis, and ask questions about the economic value of complex financial innovation, trading activity and short-term capital flows, and about the drivers of excessive debt.</p> <p>We need to ask whether financial reforms have been radical enough, but also recognise that avoiding deflation may require careful coordination of appropriate fiscal, monetary and financial regulation policies.</p> <p>But the crisis and its aftermath should also provoke wider questions about the model of global capitalism that has developed over the last 30 years, of which, many Davos attendees are beneficiaries. Why has it produced such &#xa0;rising inequality, and what can we do about it? And what policies and institutions of global governance are required to ensure that global capitalism helps, rather than hinders, the attainment of inherently global objectives, such as countering climate change?</p> <h2><strong>SD Shibulal: </strong>chief executive, Infosys</h2> <p>The world as we know it is changing. The emerging future, and businesses, are being shaped by changing trends in technology, society and demographic profiles. Businesses need to adapt to this new reality and the changing consumer mind-set.</p> <p>Consider this: the number of internet users in the world in 2010 was around two billion, up from about 360 million in &#xa0;2000. That is an unprecedented growth of over 400%.</p> <p>At the same time, the success or failure of products and services is decided even before they hit the street, thanks to online reviews posted and read by millions of users.</p> <p>Take Trip Advisor, one of the world's largest travel &#xa0;information sites, the content for which is created by its users in the form of travel reviews, opinions and discussion forums. It has more than 40 &#xa0;million unique monthly visitors, 20 million members, and around 40m reviews.</p> <p>These astounding numbers, among many others, clearly indicate the undeniable phenomenon of the growing digital consumer. In a world where over half the urban population is below 25&#xa0;years of age, these numbers indicate the emerging future that businesses of tomorrow must adapt to.</p> <h2><strong>Pascal Lamy: </strong>director general, World Trade Organisation</h2> <p>First, do no harm. This central tenet of the hippocratic oath is as relevant to economic policy-makers as to physicians, particularly as the global economic picture grows more ominous.</p> <p>Economists may debate the virtues and drawbacks of stimulus or austerity as the key to exiting the crisis, but they are united in the view that closing down trade would only make matters worse.</p> <p>Shutting your market provokes other countries to respond, and the resulting protectionist domino effect leaves all countries worse off than before.</p> <p>This was the case in the 1930s and is even more so today in an integrated global economy.</p> <p>Participating in the global value chain requires competitive firms to keep costs low. Raising tariffs on imported inputs adds to finished goods' costs, making them less attractive on the global market. To shoot at imports is to shoot oneself in the foot.</p> <p>Thus far governments have been reasonably restrained in applying such measures, but the steady imposition of trade restrictions since the crisis began means that close to 2% of global imports are &#xa0;now affected.</p> <p>Worryingly, new countries are joining the list of those imposing draconian barriers to trade. Trade offers us one of the most reliable routes out of this crisis; governments must not shut it down.</p> <h2><strong>Helen Wong: </strong>CEO and president, HSBC China</h2> <p>The year of the dragon has just begun \u2013 the traditional symbol of power, happiness and good fortune. [China] will be my main subject for discussion in Davos, and I expect this year will be marked as much by caution as by continued economic expansion.</p> <p>In the face of volatile market conditions it's difficult to predict what the year will hold for the global economy, but there are three factors which will have a particular impact on China's economy in 2012, and which will help us hit growth forecasts of 8.6%.</p> <p>First, as fears of a serious economic slowdown in China subside, we could see monetary easing policies putting the focus back on growth.</p> <p>Second, our cash-rich enterprises will further expand their operations and investments around the world, building on the huge progress already made over a decade of China's more outward-looking policies.</p> <p>Third, the process of internationalising China's currency, the renminbi, will continue to gather pace and this will also be a big topic at Davos.</p> <p>In a year that will be defined by China's leadership transition, efforts will also be made to ensure economic stability, steering the economy towards balanced and sustainable development.</p> <p>A beacon of hope for the global recovery, China's economic strength will continue to shine through in 2012, just when the world needs it most.</p> <h2><strong>Sir Martin Sorrell: </strong>chief executive, WPP Group</h2> <p>Jobs and growth. Everyone&#xa0;is worried about the scale of unemployment, particularly in the developed world. In &#xa0;the US there has been a little improvement but unemployment is still over 8%, which is historically very high.</p> <p>In addition, the scale of youth unemployment. In Spain, it's 20% and double that for young people. We know that someone unemployed at the start of their working life has their earning power through the rest of their life sharply reduced \u2013 so that's a big issue.</p> <p>This is what should be discussed. But what will no doubt be talked about is the eurozone crisis, Greek default, the implications of Greek default and its impact on Portugal, Ireland and Italy.

      "bodyText": "Cherie Blair: founder, CB Foundation for Women How to ensure women's economic inclusion, because economies will not thrive unless we do. This issue stretches all the way from the number of women in Davos and the glass ceiling in the developed world, to helping poor women in the developing world set up their own businesses and survive. I don't think the people who go to Davos deny that this is a major issue; many are really committed and understand that it is not tokenism. They read the same reports about the value of investing in women, in terms of education and employment, as I do. The World Food Programme has found that when girls and women earn income, they reinvest 90% of the money in their families. For men, that figure is more like 30% to 40%. I'm a great believer in the gender parity group at Davos: it is not about the exclusion of men, but men and women working together as equal partners to bring about change. We have all heard the Chinese proverb about women holding up 50% of the sky, and we should act on it. Bill Gates: co-chair, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation It is inevitable that the conversation at the World Economic Forum will focus on the challenges faced by the global economy. While it's true these are difficult times, in several areas (fuelled by innovation) we're seeing real progress (read more in my 2012 Annual Letter). The most notable signs of success have been in improving global health and agriculture. In both of these areas, we have an opportunity to continue helping the poorest people become more self-sufficient through smart investments. So, amid the debate of the eurozone crisis, I will be asking tough questions about the one billion lives that hang in the balance if global leaders continue to slash international development budgets. Are we ready to deny millions of children affordable, life-saving vaccines? Will we no longer help poor farmers save their families and communities from starvation? We cannot allow ourselves to do less. The fact is, we need to do even more. At Davos and throughout 2012, I hope we talk about how. Barbara Stocking: chief executive, Oxfam For me, meeting world leaders, economic thinkers and heads of the world's biggest corporations means a fleeting chance to influence the path of global development. I will be pushing conversations towards targets for sustainable and fair patterns of consumption and production \u2013 suggesting that GDP growth is only one measure of human success. Rushed encounters while stamping snow from your boots are where historic moves are made in Davos. And, a single dinner next to a head of state can open doors for Oxfam and start setting the tone for the meetings in the year ahead. We are negotiating a difficult path for the successful future of humanity. The challenge for the 21st century is how to ensure all people live free of poverty and deprivation while staying within the natural boundaries of the planet. Oxfam has long argued that the problems faced by the world's poorest stem from our inability to share the planet's resources fairly. The unpalatable truth for the western world is that there are no longer enough to go around \u2013 not if those in the developing world continue to consume them at current levels. Lord Turner: chairman, Financial Services Authority The global financial crisis, which broke in 2007-8, has had a more severe and lasting impact on economic growth than most experts assumed, once the initial shock subsided. That impact has rightly produced a challenge to the overconfident intellectual assumptions of the pre-crisis era \u2013 assumptions never more prevalent than in some pre-crisis Davos meetings. In response, we must ensure we have understood the fundamental causes of the crisis, and ask questions about the economic value of complex financial innovation, trading activity and short-term capital flows, and about the drivers of excessive debt. We need to ask whether financial reforms have been radical enough, but also recognise that avoiding deflation may require careful coordination of appropriate fiscal, monetary and financial regulation policies. But the crisis and its aftermath should also provoke wider questions about the model of global capitalism that has developed over the last 30 years, of which, many Davos attendees are beneficiaries. Why has it produced such rising inequality, and what can we do about it? And what policies and institutions of global governance are required to ensure that global capitalism helps, rather than hinders, the attainment of inherently global objectives, such as countering climate change? SD Shibulal: chief executive, Infosys The world as we know it is changing. The emerging future, and businesses, are being shaped by changing trends in technology, society and demographic profiles. Businesses need to adapt to this new reality and the changing consumer mind-set. Consider this: the number of internet users in the world in 2010 was around two billion, up from about 360 million in 2000. That is an unprecedented growth of over 400%. At the same time, the success or failure of products and services is decided even before they hit the street, thanks to online reviews posted and read by millions of users. Take Trip Advisor, one of the world's largest travel information sites, the content for which is created by its users in the form of travel reviews, opinions and discussion forums. It has more than 40 million unique monthly visitors, 20 million members, and around 40m reviews. These astounding numbers, among many others, clearly indicate the undeniable phenomenon of the growing digital consumer. In a world where over half the urban population is below 25 years of age, these numbers indicate the emerging future that businesses of tomorrow must adapt to. Pascal Lamy: director general, World Trade Organisation First, do no harm. This central tenet of the hippocratic oath is as relevant to economic policy-makers as to physicians, particularly as the global economic picture grows more ominous. Economists may debate the virtues and drawbacks of stimulus or austerity as the key to exiting the crisis, but they are united in the view that closing down trade would only make matters worse. Shutting your market provokes other countries to respond, and the resulting protectionist domino effect leaves all countries worse off than before. This was the case in the 1930s and is even more so today in an integrated global economy. Participating in the global value chain requires competitive firms to keep costs low. Raising tariffs on imported inputs adds to finished goods' costs, making them less attractive on the global market. To shoot at imports is to shoot oneself in the foot. Thus far governments have been reasonably restrained in applying such measures, but the steady imposition of trade restrictions since the crisis began means that close to 2% of global imports are now affected. Worryingly, new countries are joining the list of those imposing draconian barriers to trade. Trade offers us one of the most reliable routes out of this crisis; governments must not shut it down. Helen Wong: CEO and president, HSBC China The year of the dragon has just begun \u2013 the traditional symbol of power, happiness and good fortune. [China] will be my main subject for discussion in Davos, and I expect this year will be marked as much by caution as by continued economic expansion. In the face of volatile market conditions it's difficult to predict what the year will hold for the global economy, but there are three factors which will have a particular impact on China's economy in 2012, and which will help us hit growth forecasts of 8.6%. First, as fears of a serious economic slowdown in China subside, we could see monetary easing policies putting the focus back on growth. Second, our cash-rich enterprises will further expand their operations and investments around the world, building on the huge progress already made over a decade of China's more outward-looking policies. Third, the process of internationalising China's currency, the renminbi, will continue to gather pace and this will also be a big topic at Davos. In a year that will be defined by China's leadership transition, efforts will also be made to ensure economic stability, steering the economy towards balanced and sustainable development. A beacon of hope for the global recovery, China's economic strength will continue to shine through in 2012, just when the world needs it most. Sir Martin Sorrell: chief executive, WPP Group Jobs and growth. Everyone is worried about the scale of unemployment, particularly in the developed world. In the US there has been a little improvement but unemployment is still over 8%, which is historically very high. In addition, the scale of youth unemployment. In Spain, it's 20% and double that for young people. We know that someone unemployed at the start of their working life has their earning power through the rest of their life sharply reduced \u2013 so that's a big issue. This is what should be discussed. But what will no doubt be talked about is the eurozone crisis, Greek default, the implications of Greek default and its impact on Portugal, Ireland and Italy. What they won't discuss is how the US deals with its deficit. There may be more attention this year than last on issues like wealth inequality, which some are very concerned about, with the Occupy Wall Street movement. But the big issue is long-term economic growth. It's about how to make people feel good and optimistic when they are surrounded by cuts. We've got to give people a long-term vision \u2013 but we don't have that as yet.",

It pinned much of the blame on the debt crisis in the eurozone, where it expects GDP to shrink by 0.5% during this year. On the IMF's central projection, \"most advanced economies avoid falling back into a recession, while economic activity in emerging and developing economies slows from a high pace.\" It is now expecting world GDP growth of 3.3% in 2012, down from the 4.1% it forecast in September. However, the Washington-based lender warned that these projections are \"predicated on the assumption that in the euro area, policymakers intensify efforts to address the crisis\". It also called on governments to avoid imposing drastic spending cuts on already sickly economies. Fiscal tightening is necessary to correct the hefty debt burden left from the boom years, the IMF said, but it, \"should ideally occur at a pace that supports adequate growth in output and employment\". \"Countries with enough fiscal space, including some in the euro area, should reconsider the pace of near-term adjustment,\" it added, in a suggestion that will be widely viewed as aimed at Germany, which is pressing ahead with austerity measures despite its healthy budget position. Growth for the UK in 2012 will be a paltry 0.6%, the IMF says. That's a sharp reduction from the 1.6% the IMF was expecting in September \u2013 but similar to the 0.7% pencilled in by the independent Office of Budget Responsibility. GDP across the 17-member eurozone will contract by 0.5% in 2012 as the region enters a \"mild recession\", the IMF predicts \u2013 a large downgrade from the 1.1% growth it was expecting in September. The new projections also underline the yawning divide between the healthy \"core\" of the eurozone, centred on Germany, and its crisis-hit periphery. Both Italy and Spain are expected to suffer two more years of outright recession in 2012 and 2013, with growth depressed by their latest drastic fiscal austerity measures. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, used a speech in Berlin on Monday to urge eurozone leaders to beef up their bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, which would have to rescue Italy or Spain in the event of a budget crisis. In a separate report also published on Tuesday, updating its Global Financial Stability Review, the IMF rammed home this message, criticising euro-leaders' plans to \"leverage\" the EFSF, which recently lost its AAA credit rating after France and Austria, two of its key guarantors, were downgraded. \"While some proposals to leverage the EFSF have merit, even with a plausible amount of leverage the total amount of firepower available would still likely not be sufficient to contain rising sovereign spreads under stress scenarios.\" The IMF also warns that \"deleveraging\" by eurozone banks, which are being forced by the authorities to reinforce their balance sheets to cope with the crisis, could hit the economic recovery hard in 2012. It calls for a \"gatekeeper\", to assess individual banks' plans for deleveraging, and ensure that, taken together, they won't derail growth by starving Europe's businesses and consumers of credit.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/24/britain-national-debt-tops-one-trillion\" title=\"\">Britain's national debt has breached \u00a31tn</a> for the first time, official figures showed on Tuesday. At the same time, government borrowing fell in December. Here is what City economists made of the numbers.</p> <h2>Allan Monks, JPMorgan Chase</h2> <p>Upward revisions to prior months offset a lower-than-expected borrowing requirement for December. But borrowing overall is on track to meet the OBR's latest 2011/12 projection for a deficit of 8.4% of GDP (\u00a3127bn), with risks of a better outturn</p> <p>More broadly, the details of the monthly data continue to show relatively weak central government revenues (although less so recently) being offset by lower-than-expected current spending. At the autumn statement, the chancellor announced an increase in the levy on banks (to 0.088%) effective from January 2012 in order to address the shortfall in revenues arising from weak growth.</p> <p>Next month's January release of the public finances \u2013 the most important of the year in terms of the collection of tax receipts \u2013 will provide a good indication of where 2011/12 borrowing will come in. If receipts deteriorate only modestly from a year earlier (around \u00a31bn or so) an outturn close to the OBR's latest forecast of \u00a3127bn (which was revised up in the autumn statement) would look likely.</p> <p>If the modest improvement in central government revenues seen in the last two releases continues, while current spending maintains its recent trend, borrowing could well come in a few billion better than the OBR currently expects in 2011/12.</p> <p>Beyond then, the deficit is expected to drop only slightly to \u00a3120bn in 2012/13, but this would bring the deficit to GDP ratio down to 7.6%, based on the OBR's current forecasts.</p> <h2>Daniel Solomon, Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <p>The government's focus on fiscal prudence has delivered one worthwhile reward: low interest rates on its debt. A UK 10-year government bond now has a yield of 2.2%. Although, in signs that markets don't find the UK's debt reduction policies entirely credible, this figures has risen over the month.

      "bodyText": "Britain's national debt has breached \u00a31tn for the first time, official figures showed on Tuesday. At the same time, government borrowing fell in December. Here is what City economists made of the numbers. Allan Monks, JPMorgan Chase Upward revisions to prior months offset a lower-than-expected borrowing requirement for December. But borrowing overall is on track to meet the OBR's latest 2011/12 projection for a deficit of 8.4% of GDP (\u00a3127bn), with risks of a better outturn More broadly, the details of the monthly data continue to show relatively weak central government revenues (although less so recently) being offset by lower-than-expected current spending. At the autumn statement, the chancellor announced an increase in the levy on banks (to 0.088%) effective from January 2012 in order to address the shortfall in revenues arising from weak growth. Next month's January release of the public finances \u2013 the most important of the year in terms of the collection of tax receipts \u2013 will provide a good indication of where 2011/12 borrowing will come in. If receipts deteriorate only modestly from a year earlier (around \u00a31bn or so) an outturn close to the OBR's latest forecast of \u00a3127bn (which was revised up in the autumn statement) would look likely. If the modest improvement in central government revenues seen in the last two releases continues, while current spending maintains its recent trend, borrowing could well come in a few billion better than the OBR currently expects in 2011/12. Beyond then, the deficit is expected to drop only slightly to \u00a3120bn in 2012/13, but this would bring the deficit to GDP ratio down to 7.6%, based on the OBR's current forecasts. Daniel Solomon, Centre for Economics and Business Research The government's focus on fiscal prudence has delivered one worthwhile reward: low interest rates on its debt. A UK 10-year government bond now has a yield of 2.2%. Although, in signs that markets don't find the UK's debt reduction policies entirely credible, this figures has risen over the month. Low expected inflation in the future means that 10-year UK bonds will offer almost no real return if they only pay out 2.2%, so this rate may well continue to climb. Despite these mitigating factors, Tuesday's data will make mixed reading for the government. They are on the right track, but are moving forward much more slowly than they had planned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's projections for deficit reduction, despite having undergone several downward revisions, are still overly bullish. The OBR's latest economic and fiscal outlook publication predicts that annual GDP growth of 3% by 2015 and that public sector net borrowing will have fallen to 1.2% of GDP by 2016-17. The second prediction relies on the first holding true. Since the first prediction is unlikely to hold, the second probably won't either. The new data released by the ONS simply drive home the point that the government is likely to miss its deficit reduction targets. Blerina Uruci, Barclays Capital Despite the progress of recent months, the near-term outlook for public debt is not rosy.

Both we and the OBR expect it to rise steadily over the next three years, breaching the critical 90% level before declining only gradually. This highlights the fact that the government still has a significant challenge ahead if it is to put a brake on the rapid increase in the debt to GDP ratio and achieve its target of starting to cut this ratio by 2015-16.

The company, knowing it was risking defeat on the relevant resolution at next week's meeting of shareholders, now says it wants to \"consult further\" with its owners. Gammell, of course, is a hero among shareholders after pulling off one of the great oil exploration coups of recent decades.

That was last summer. But shareholders only found out a fortnight ago. No wonder they're furious \u2013 their consent was taken for granted. If they let Cairn off the hook, others would try their luck. The best guess is that Cairn will be allowed to return with some form of face-saving fudge \u2013 say, a reduced award to Gammell and his favourite charity, since a $3.5bn return to shareholders is indeed a handsome sum.

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable faced stinging criticism from unions for rejecting calls to put employees at the heart of proposals to tackle soaring executive pay and instead putting the onus on shareholders to restrain multimillion pound deals. Forced to outline his plans on executive pay a day early because of intervention from his Labour shadow, Chuka Umunna, the business secretary said he would give shareholders a binding vote on executive pay deals and try to clamp down on rewards for failure by requiring a vote on payoffs of more than a year's salary. But while some City pay experts welcomed Cable's proposals, campaigners against high pay were not convinced. Paul Kenny, leader of the GMB union and a veteran of the campaigns against pay deals at British Gas in the 1990s, said: \"Expecting fund managers, representing shareholders, who themselves are also on the gravy train, to sort this is putting hope before experience. Cable bottled putting an employee voice on the remuneration committee. He has produced a mouse.\" Cable, forced to the Commons after Umunna was granted an urgent question, said there was \"no magic bullet\" for tackling the problem of bosses' pay rising five times faster than the average wage. \"We cannot continue to see chief executive pay rise at 13% a year while performance on the stock exchange languishes well behind,\" Cable said. His unscheduled performance in the Commons did not impress the Lib Dems' coalition partners. Tory MP Philip Davies told Cable: \"I have heard some drivel in my time but I don't think that in all my years in opposition I have heard as much drivel from the front bench as I have heard from you today.\" His concern, echoed by other Tory MPs, was that Cable was meddling with big business instead of letting it create jobs. Announcing his response to a formal consultation, Cable outlined plans for greater diversity on boards \u2013 including requiring boards to contain two people who had never had seats in boardrooms before \u2013 and to make remuneration reports, which he described as \"impenetrable\", easier to understand. Companies will need to publish a single figure for what a director has been paid rather than the array of numbers now. The fees paid to remuneration consultants who advise boards will have to be disclosed. Asked about bonuses for bankers at bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, Cable replied it was \"above my pay grade\". He is asking the Financial Reporting Council to adopt some measures enforced on banks since the 2008 crisis, such as requiring all companies to be able to \"withhold or recoup\" pay awards to directors when companies have not performed as expected. But he stepped back from forcing wider disclosure on banks to publish the five highest paid staff outside the boardroom. Neither did he tackle the issue of how much pay is too much by requiring companies to publish the ratio of highest to lowest paid staff. To counter criticism of not being radical enough, Cable's department stressed he had taken forward 10 out of the 12 proposals from the High Pay Commission while Deborah Hargreaves, former business editor of the Guardian who chaired the HPC, will run a new high pay centre to monitor executive pay. Sean O'Hare, remuneration partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said Cable's plans \"represent the most significant recasting of executive pay rules for a decade\". Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said it was \"a welcome package of measures\". But with 40% of shares not held by UK investors, there was scepticism about the influence investors could wield. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder advisory group Manifest, said: \"Shareholders are not all British and some of them operate from markets where the whole approach is different.\" Instead of putting workers on remuneration committees, Cable called for a change in the mix of the people who sit on them, to include academics for instance, and to try to prevent the \"cronyism\" caused when directors sit on multiple boards. He said the views of employees should be taken into account when directors' pay is set, pointing out that employees in large companies already have such rights under the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004. Cable's reforms are the latest efforts to keep a lid on boardroom pay, an issue that has flared up regularly since the 1980s when BOC Group's chief executive, Richard Giordano, was the UK's highest paid director with a \u00a3271,000 pay deal. By 2002 Labour was forced to responded to a wave of public outrage sparked by the \"rewards for failure\" for directors of the failed telecoms company Marconi by giving shareholders an advisory vote on pay. Cable wants the advisory vote to remain but for two legally binding votes to be introduced on pay deals of the coming year and on any pay deals represent more than a year's salary. He is to consult on whether the pass rate for a remuneration report should rise to 75% from 50% since the vote was first introduced in 2003 and since when just 18 companies have had their pay deals defeated in the decade since the advisory vote was introduced.",
