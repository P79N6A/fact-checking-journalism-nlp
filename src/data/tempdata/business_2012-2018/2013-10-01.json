      "bodyText": "Senior bankers will face up to seven years in jail if they are found to have committed a new offence of reckless misconduct being proposed by the government as part of a series of measures to clean up the City in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis. The reckless misconduct charge was one of the main recommendations of the high-profile parliamentary report into banking commissioned by the government in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal. It is listed as one of the 86 amendments tabled by the Treasury to the banking reform bill which is also being used to implement many of the ideas of the independent commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, to ringfence high street banks from their riskier investment banking activities. The government stipulates that only individuals who are deemed to be senior managers would face reckless misconduct charges and they must be aware their decisions could cause the bank to fail. Lawyers have questioned whether it will be possible to bring the charge in practice. The government tabled the amendments as other steps were taken by the Bank of England to strengthen the banking sector. It is to conduct annual stress tests of the major institutions and is likely to publish the results each year. Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the new stress testing regime should \"underpin confidence in the banking system\". The Bank \u2013 which could force banks to hold more capital than international standards and will devise the terms of the stress tests each year \u2013 indicated that the tests could expand beyond the top eight firms to smaller banks and also the clearing houses \u2013 known as central counterparties \u2013 which stand between major financial firms during complex trading. But the Bank faced criticism after admitting its financial policy committee, which meets quarterly to look for risks to financial stability, had deliberately withheld information in November last year about the amount of extra capital it believed major banks needed to reach. Paragraphs omitted from the minutes of the FPC's November 2012 meeting were published on Tuesday showing that the committee had agreed \"it would be contrary to the public interest\" to reveal its broad estimates of the shortfalls in bank capital it believed existed at the time. In March this year the FPC said banks had a \u00a325bn capital shortfall and by July Barclays embarked on a \u00a36bn cash call \u2013 due to close this week. The bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have been selling off assets to raise capital. Melanie Bowler, economist at Moody's Analytics, criticised the FPC, saying that withholding information \"raises questions about the committee's credibility\". The newly released paragraphs show that members of the committee were concerned that \"confidence in UK banks \u2013 and hence financial stability \u2013 could be adversely affected\" if ways to solve the shortfalls were not published at the same time. No individual banks are identified but descriptions given of the banks indicate they were talking about Barclays, RBS and Lloyds. The omitted text was released alongside the record of latest FPC meeting in September when it dismissed fears of a house price bubble caused by the government's Help to Buy policies but called on banks to devise clearer strategies for dealing with potential cyber-attacks. The banking reform bill being used to bring in wide-ranging legislative changes is not expected to receive royal assent until next year. The government used its amendments to address the concerns of Andrew Tyrie, the conservative MP who chaired the cross-party parliamentary commission on banking standards and had criticised the government for watering down attempts to \"electrify\" the ringfence between high street and investment banks. The government will now be able to force banks to split up. \"Banks will game the rules unless discouraged from doing so. The revised amendments enable the regulator to split a bank which tries. That creates a strong deterrent against gaming the ringfence,\" said Tyrie. A Treasury spokesman said: \"Today's amendments mark the final part of the government's plan for the biggest ever overhaul of the UK banking system.

      "bodyText": "That's a good moment to stop. Remember, my US colleagues are live-blogging the latest developments in America as the government shutdown continues. It's a damn good read -- including the news that veterans from the second world war pushed down barricades when they discovered they were barred from visiting their own memorial. That's the spirit. President Obama should be speaking on the situation shortly. The big story in Europe tonight is that Silvio Berlusconi's rebellion against the Italian government has stumbled, and may have crumbled. We'll find out tomorrow. This liveblog has all the overnight reaction to the US government shutdown (starting here), including David Cameron's warning that the deadlock could hurt the world economy, early photos, and this video of highlights and analysis Back first thing tomorrow. Cheers all. Goodnight. GW Rome correspondent Lizzy Davies has interviewed one of the radical Five Star Movement's MPs, Paola Carinelli. M5S, which stunned Italy with a strong performance in February's election, is not part of Enrico Letta's coalition. And Carinelli told Lizzy that the party is not planning to support Letta in tomorrow's vote. Carinelli said: If there is this confidence vote we certainly won't be voting for it. We haven't given [done that] for the past six months and we won't be doing it now. The situation has not improved in the past six months- rather, we feel that this government has done nothing that it promised. She added that M5S was united: We have spoken about it between ourselves and we are very sure that we will not vote for the confidence vote\u2026 Everyone confirmed that they will not vote for it. That leaves open the possibility that M5S would abstain, rather than vote against. Carinelli said she was angry that politicians in Rome have spent the last few weeks fighting among themselves, rather than solving Italy's economic problems. She also argued that it would be better to have fresh elections, rather than for Letta to limp on with a \"totally fractured majority\" And she was scathing about the man who triggered this latest crisis: Berlusconi is certainly a man at the end of his road. Now he's doing everything to avoid being kicked out. So, an Italian government confidence vote on Wednesday - that'll either calm the eurozone crisis, or inflame it. And with delicious timing, the European Central Bank will hold its monthly meeting tomorrow too. Mario Draghi is going to get some tough questions about Italy..... Swiftly followed by the story from our Reuters terminal: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta will seek support in parliament to continue at the head of a solid government next year, President Giorgio Napolitano said in a statement on Tuesday after a meeting with Letta. Letta is due to outline a programme of priorities in a speech to parliament on Wednesday and is expected to call a confidence vote afterwards. Napolitano said Letta would seek \"stable commitment for continuing government action from the most immediate deadlines to objectives to be pursued in 2014\". One more key news flash from Italy: 16:58:29 RTRS - ITALY PRESIDENT NAPOLITANO SAYS HAS AGREED WITH PM LETTA TO SEEK SUPPORT FOR SOLID GOVERNMENT WITH OBJECTIVES TO PURSUE IN 2014 Twitter is abuzz wit reaction to the latest twists in Italy: Our Rome correspondent, Lizzy Davies, explains that Silvio Berlusconi could still throw his own support behind Enrico Letta. That would let the disgraced former PM, facing expulsion from the Italian Senate over his tax fraud conviction, to present himself as the responsible man. One constitutional lawyer has already told Lizzy that would be a disaster for Letta, as he'd be much happier to not have to work with the hawkish members of the People of Freedom Party. The lawyer explained: If Berlusconi votes to to give confidence in the government, [Letta] ... ends up being held hostage by Berlusconi's blackmail power\u2026. If Berlusconi votes 'for', it's a tactical choice to try to make the government take decisions which are favourable to him \u2013 on the justice system, for instance \u2013 or political useful for the PdL/Forza Italia election campaign which we will be seeing sooner or later. The Wall Street Journal also flags up that as many as 40 members of Berlusconi's party could be prepared to revolt, and back Enrico Letta's government. And the Italian stock market just closed 3.1% higher, driven by hopes that the immediate Italian political crisis is over. The key measure of market panic over Italy is the yield, or interest rate, on its 10-year bonds. If they're going up, it means fund managers are more worried about political instability. Well, yields are sharply lower this afternoon --- 10-year Italian government debt is changing hands for 4.43% now, down from 4.57% this morning and as high as 4.74% on Monday morning. That means prices are up, as traders dash to hold Italian debt again on the news that Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party is refusing to bring down Enrico Letta's government. Here's a snap of Alfano looking serious, a little while ago, as he left Silvio Berlusconi's private residence, the Palazzo Grazioli in Rome. OK, here's the key quote from Angelino Alfano, the secretary of Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right party: I remain firmly convinced that our entire party should support Letta in a confidence vote. There are no groups or factions. That is a resounding rebuke for Berlusconi -- whose efforts to unseat Letta appear to have turned sour. This won't be the final act in the drama, though -- we probably won't know the score until tomorrow's confidence vote. The Italian stock market has jumped by almost 3% this afternoon, up 512 points at 17,947. Traders are cheering the news that Silvio Berlusconi's party are defying him, refusing to withdraw their support for Enrico Letta's government (some background for readers new to the eurozone crisis -- Berlusconi's PDL party are part of a two-party grand coalition let by Letta, and he has threatened to bring that coalition crashing after being convicted of tax fraud). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets in the City, explains: The rest of Europe\u2019s markets have been led by the Italian FTSE MIB which has bounced back quite strongly as hopes rise that Enrico Letta\u2019s government will be able to limp on in the wake of tomorrow\u2019s scheduled confidence vote, with talk of widening cracks in support of Berlusconi within his own party, after his own party secretary broke ranks to state that the entire party should vote for Letta in any confidence vote. There's also political drama in Italy this afternoon, ahead of a crucial confidence vote in the Rome parliament. The newswires are buzzing with reports that Silvio Berlusconi's party has turned on their leader, and are planning to throw their support behind prime minister Enrico Letta. Shares are surging on the Milan stock market in late trading. Crucially, the party's secretary Angelino Alfano is reported to have urged the People of Freedom party to end their revolt. This Reuters story has the details: A majority of parliamentarians in Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party want to back Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta in a confidence vote on Wednesday, a prominent moderate \"dove\" in the PDL said on Tuesday. Carlo Giovanardi, a Senator and former minister said there was widespread sympathy in the party for Berlusconi in his battle against moves to expel him from parliament for tax fraud but that the majority of senators and deputies did not want to bring down Letta's coalition of left and right. \"We are for keeping this government, which is the sole point of political balance,\" Giovanardi said. He made the comment at the same time as PDL Secretary Angelino Alfano was at the prime minister's office for meetings, along with Letta's uncle Gianni Letta, one of Berlusconi's closest advisers. It comes just three days after Berlusconi ordered his ministers to quit Enrico Letta's government, threatening a new political crisis. This gamble may be backfiring. An early development from Tom's new Shutdown liveblog -- as flagged up early this morning, the Senate has rejected the request for a bipartisan budget conference. Senators voted along party lines, 54-46. More details here. Delighted to report that my US colleagues are not furloughed, and instead have launched a new liveblog covering the shutdown. US government shutdown begins as Congress fails to reach deal \u2013 live The excellent Tom McCarthy is in the chair, and will be covering all the political drama for the day ahead*. I'll do a round-up shortly... \u2022 - and not garbling his chambers of Congress as I unforgivably did earlier. Mark Knoller, White House correspondent for CBS News, rounds up the impact on some US government agencies: Heads-up, the White House has announced that President Obama will give a statement at 12.25pm Eastern Time, or 5.25pm BST. Here, our economics editor Larry Elliott explains the impact of the US Federal government shutdown, and the risk that the US could breach its debt ceiling: It includes highlights of last night's debates in Congress, and the key contributions from the major players in Washington DC. Well worth watching. Tres Knippa, a trader on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, says investors simply aren't worried about the government shutdown. He points out that stock markets have risen during previous shutdowns, particularly those which only lasted a few days. And the deadlock in Washington DC is likely to deter the Federal Reserve from easing off (\"tapering\") on its stimulus package any time soon. Knippa told Bloomberg TV: The point is that this just doesn't matter. And as stocks go, isn't it reasonable to suggest that this pushes back tapering by Ben Bernanke? So a general shrug from the financial markets, apart fro, the drop in the value of the US dollar (still down around 0.2% against the pound and euro). That doesn't increase the pressure on politicians in Congress. Wall Street is open for business, and there is NO sign of panic at the fact that the Federal government is on ice. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 14 points, or +0.1%, in very early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also shrugging off the Capitol Hill deadlock, gaining a few points each. Reaction to follow From the Statue of Liberty to the Washington DC transit system, the signs of the shutdown are clear to see: Willem Buiter, Citi\u2019s global chief economist, has dubbed America as \" the land of Oz run by the munchkins\". Buiter said the shutdown was an irresponsible act, telling CNBC this morning: It really is scandalous that the world\u2019s largest economy looks like the Land of Oz run by the munchkins. Here's the clip: One US government service that is still operating today is the Securities and Exchange Commission, America's financial regulator. Bloomberg's Phil Mattingly is stood outside the SEC headquarters, and reports that it's pretty much operational. That's because the agency has \"carry-over funding\", which allows it to keep running today. However... if the shutdown lasts longer than a couple of weeks, then the SEC could have to close non-essential services. That would include the area that handles filings for stock market flotations. Companies who are looking to file an IPO \"could have a problem\", says Mattingly. And one of those companies is Twitter.... NASA tweets that its non-essential work is now on hold: Our Washington bureau chief, Dan Roberts, compares the last 48 hours to a classic Western: The great US government shutdown of 2013 began, said Iowa senator Tom Harkin, \"like a scene from the Hollywood western High Noon\". There was Democrat sheriff Barack Obama, squared off against a gang of southern gunslingers, both sides determined not to give an inch and prepared to blow each other's brains out to get what they came for. Unfortunately, much of Washington acted as if it had seen this movie before. The metaphorical tumbleweed blowing down the corridors of Capitol Hill reflected not a fear of being caught in the crossfire, but a cynical war-weariness that left many lawmakers on the sidelines until it was too late. After three years of similar standoffs over the federal budget that were resolved at the last minute, no one could quite believe that this one would finish with shots fired. Here's the full piece: US shutdown: Gunslinging and standoffs straight out of Hollywood Just in, a couple of photos from America this morning: Traders on Wall Street are expected to shrug off the shutdown , when trading begins in around 90 minutes time. Having fallen by 128 points, or 0.85%, last night as the deadlock deepened, the Dow Jones is expected to rise around 30 points at the open (although there is still time for that to change). Just spoke with David Madden of IG in the City, who says he's surprised that there's not more of a reaction to the shutdown. In Europe, too, markets are still calm (London's blue-chip FTSE 100 is down just 0.35% today). However, as mentioned before, that could all change as the debt ceiling deadline of 17 October approaches: Equity markets have reacted relatively well to the deadlock in Washington, which has led to the first partial shutdown in 17 years. The failure to reach an agreement over a budget could leave thousands of state workers on a reduced week with no guarantee of back pay. The budget discussions will soon take a back seat to the debt ceiling talks which take centre stage in mid to early October, and these negotiations pose more of a threat to the US credit rating than a partial shutdown. Over in the Pentagon, staff will be calculating which employees can be classed as \"essential\" and thus kept on duty. US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who is in Seoul on an official trip, said America has been reassuring its allies that military services will continue . Last night, President Obama signed an emergency legislation that means serving staff will continue to be paid. Here's more details of Hagel's comments: The Pentagon\u2019s lawyers are reviewing how many of the military\u2019s roughly 400,000 civilians employees expected to be furloughed -- or about half the civilian workforce -- can be considered \u201cexempt\u201d from shutdown provisions and stay on the job, Hagel, the U.S. defense secretary, said today in Seoul. \u201cWe will fulfill our mission of maintaining the the alliances we have,\u201d Hagel said. \u201cBut it does cast a very significant pall over America\u2019s credibility with our allies.\u201d The shutdown \u201cis nonsensical,\u201d and \u201ccompletely irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s needless. It didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d Another key line from David Cameron on UK radio this morning (more details here) is also attracting attention as America wakes up to a partially-shutdown nation . Asked about the implications for the UK economy, the PM was pretty blunt, saying: It is a risk to the world economy if the United States can't properly sort out its spending plans and its deficit reduction plans. Of course that's a risk. US political analyst Daniel Clifton, of Strategas Research, argues that the longer the shutdown lasts, the more Republicans will be blamed. Clifton told Bloomberg TV that a protracted shutdown will put pressure on the party, bringing splits between Tea Party supporters and more centrist members. So while president Obama can continue to \"speak with one voice\", there could be mixed messages and conflict from his opponents. Clifton also predict that the US public will make their feelings known: We know that the phones on Capitol Hill are going to be ringing off the hook. Phil Mattingly, Bloomberg News reporter, isn't confident of early progress in Washington (where it's approaching 7am). There are no meetings planned, he says. And while the Senate will reconvene at 9.30am, it is only likely to reject the Republican's proposal for a bipartisan committee. Mattingly added: We're all in wait and see mode, until constituents start calling in and saying who they blame. And here's a full Q&amp;A on the economic consequences of the US government shutdown: US shutdown: what does it mean for markets and the global economy? I flagged up earlier that David Cameron had cited the US government shutdown as a warning light when on Sky News. He took the same message to radio listeners. Here's more details: Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Cameron gave the US situation as a reason why Britain should stick to the path of fiscal discipline. He said aiming to run a budget surplus was a reasonable and \"perfectly possible\" thing to do. \"It is a reminder to all of us that we need to have properly planned public expenditure systems, properly planned tax, properly planned arrangements for getting our deficit down,\" he said. \"I know some people want to get away from the subject of deficit reduction and sorting our economy out and turning it around, but I think we will have lots of reminders over the coming months, like what's happening in America, that it's absolutely vital we grip it.\" More here: US shutdown shows UK must keep grip on finances, says David Cameron The 17 previous US government shutdowns have been triggered by intractable rows over a range of issues, from defense funding to welfare spending. More often than not it involved a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives -- often facing down Ronald Reagan's White House. Here's your handy cut-out-and-keep guide to the 17 previous shutdowns since 1977: Much angst on Bloomberg TV that America's next employment report will probably be delayed. The monthly Non-Farm Payroll, which shows now many new jobs were created last month, is one of the hottest announcements in the economic world. It is due on Friday, but unless the shutdown ends swiftly the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't have time to complete it. And that will make it very hard for the Federal Reserve to decide whether it should slow its bond-buying stimulus programme (through which it pumps $85bn into the US financial sector each month). Another reminder that the debt ceiling is looming: How much will the shutdown cost? Analysts at IHS have calculated that it will wipe at least $300m off economic output per day, as people who are forced into unpaid leave by the shutdown rein in their spending. That rate will accelerate if the shutdown continues for several days, as people and businesses become more worried about the situation. A week long hiatus would knock 'annualised'* US economic growth down to 2% in the final quarter of 2013, from 2.2%., IHS said. But a three week shutdown, as we saw in the Clinton era, could slash as much as 1.4% off annualised growth. * - roughly four times the quarter-on-quarter rate So it it all the Tea Party's fault? President Obama certainly pinned the blame on that wing of the Republican party, when he gave a televised address to give them a final push: One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government doesn't get to shut down the entire government just to refight the results of an election. You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job, for doing what you're supposed to be doing anyway, or just because there's a law there that you don't like. The Tea Party movement argues for a smaller government, and a less daunting national debt. Some of its supporters have argued that a government shutdown is a good thing, and won't cause serious problems. Over on the Telegraph, Tim Stanley explains this point of view: US Government Shutdown: don't blame the Republicans \u2013 blame whoever spent all the money The bottom line is that the US debt pile has risen through successive presidents. It increased 60% or so under Obama as the president pushed through a stimulus package to ward off a new Great Depression, but had already almost doubled during the previous eight years under George W. Bush. Meanwhile, Europe's manufacturing growth has stumbled, underlining its vulnerability to any shocks from America. My colleague Nick Fletcher has full details here: Eurozone manufacturing growth slips in September Breaking away from America briefly, we have economic news from the eurozone -- the unemployment rate is slightly lower than we thought, but it's not actually falling. The total eurozone jobless rate was 12.0% in August. July's figure of 12.1% has also been revised down, to 12%, Eurostat just reported. That may indicate that Europe's slump is bottoming out, with the economy also growing. However, it could quickly be derailed if events deteriorate in America. And today's data also included plenty of black spots, including Italy's youth jobless rate hitting a record high of over 40%. The last shutdown took place in 1995-1996, when Bill Clinton clashed with the Republican-backed lower house, and its speaker Newt Gingrich. Dr Matthew Ashton of Nottingham Trent University, explains that This Time It's Different: To a certain extent the shutdown is being played as a political theatre, with both Republicans and Democrats blaming the other. The Republicans are in the weaker position though. In 1996 when a similar situation occurred Clinton was actually strengthened by the deadlock and the Republicans came across as inflexible and dogmatic. Whether the same result will play out today though is unclear. The fact that Obama was re-elected less than a year ago might well count against them in the court of public opinion. Ashton also points to the fragile nature of the US recovery, and the pressing need to raise America's debt ceiling before 17 October: Key differences between now and 1996 include the weakness of the US economy and the upcoming vote on the debt ceiling. Anything that looks like it might jeopardise the recovery could have a big impact on both parties' popularity. What's certain is that this will do little to reassure Americans about the democratic process and the ability of their leaders and representatives to behave like grown-ups in the face of a crisis. The 1995-1996 shutdown also had another, unpredictable impact. With White House staff \"furloughed\" (sent home without pay), a young intern named Monica Lewinsky was sent to cover.... Associated Press sums up the deadlock in Washington: For the first time in nearly two decades, the U.S. government staggered into a partial shutdown on Monday at midnight after congressional Republicans stubbornly demanded changes in the nation's health care law as the price for essential federal funding and President Barack Obama and Democrats adamantly refused. As Congress gridlocked, Obama said a \"shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away,\" with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and veterans' centers, national parks, most of the space agency and other government operations shuttered. He laid the blame at the feet of House Republicans, whom he accused of seeking to tie government funding to ideological demands, \"all to save face after making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their party.\" House Speaker John Boehner responded a short while later on the House floor. \"The American people don't want a shutdown and neither do I,\" he said. Yet, he added, the new health care law \"is having a devastating impact. ... Something has to be done.\" There are few issues Republicans feel as passionately about as the health care reform, which they have dubbed \"Obamacare.\" They see the plan, intended to provide coverage for the millions of Americans now uninsured, as wasteful and restricting freedom by requiring most Americans to have health insurance. There were plenty of tired, stressed faces in Washington when time ran out. John Boehner, the House Speaker, held a brief press conference with journalists at 1am local time, or 6am BST. Boehner, who has been criticised for failing to get his fellow Republicans to agree a budget deal, told reporters that \"The House has made its position known very clearly\". He added: We believe we should fund government, and we think there ought to basic fairness for all Americans under Obamacare. The Senate has continued to reject our offers, but under the Constitution, there's a way to resolve this problem \u2014 and that is to go to conference and talk through your differences. And I would hope that the Senate would accept our offer to go to conference and discuss this so that we can resolve this for the American people. But as I flagged up earlier, Senate majority leader Harry Reid is expected to rebuff this proposal. Boerher then took just two questions, in a 73-second Q&amp;A session (Business Insider has the details). Here's more photos from late night and this morning: The US dollar is losing value on the foreign exchange markets, following the first American government shutdown since 1995. It's lost around half a percent so far, pushing the pound up to $1.6238. That's the highest level since 3 January 2013. The euro has risen to $1.357, the highest level since early February. What's Next? Well, much of Washington is asleep right now, but late last night the Republican side proposed creating a bipartisan \"conference\" of lawmakers from both sides to plot a path forward. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene at 9.30am Eastern Time (or 2.30pm BST). Its first job, according to majority leader Harry Reid, is to kill that plan for a conference. That would send the ping-pong ball back into the House of Representative's side of the table. It could then propose a short-term budget that does not include cuts or delays to Obama's Affordable Care Act -- which the Senate would surely approve. Or it could stick to its guns. Non-essential Federal government services will remain closed until a budget to pay for them has been agreed. Worth noting that a key part of Obamacare, the open enrollment period, begins today. That will allow millions of uninsured Americans to start shopping for health insurance (CBS has a full explanation here) Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, explains that the stock markets are calm because traders reckon the shutdown will be brief: Investors are taking the view that a partial shutdown, if resolved quickly, will do little damage to the overall health of the US economy. That does however mean that we will need to hear the right sounds out of Washington to feel confident enough that the shutdown will not damage economic growth. No signs of a crash in European stock markets . The German and French stock markets are up almost 0.5%, as fears ease over the Italian government collapsing. In London the FTSE 100 is down 0.2%. Earlier Asian stock markets were calm, with the Nikkei finishing 0.2% higher and Australia's ASX 200 finishing 0.2% lower. The New York Times also has a handy interactive, explaining how the legislative warfare between the House of Representatives and the Senate resulted in the partial shutdown of the US Federal government: The Back and Forth Over the Shutdown There was a flurry of last-minute moves by all sides in the run-up to the shutdown, in an attempt to get agree a budget to keep funding the US federal government. The crux of the crisis is that Republicans control the Lower House of Representatives, while the Democrats have a majority in the Senate. Proposed budgets bounced back between the Upper and Lower houses, but Republicans continued to demand a delay to Obama's Affordable Care Act in return for a six-week 'stopgap' spending bill. And the Senate refused to budge, stripping out the healthcare section and booting the legislation back. The New York Times explains: In the hours leading up to the deadline, House Republican leaders won approval, in a vote of 228 to 201, of a new plan to tie further government spending to a one-year delay in a requirement that individuals buy health insurance. The House proposal would deny federal subsidies to members of Congress, Capitol Hill staff, executive branch political appointees, White House staff, and the president and vice president, who would be forced to buy their health coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s new insurance exchanges. But 57 minutes later, and with almost no debate, the Senate killed the House health care provisions and sent the stopgap spending bill right back, free of policy prescriptions. Earlier in the day, the Senate had taken less than 25 minutes to convene and dispose of a weekend budget proposal by the House Republicans. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost their minds,\u201d said Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, before disposing of the House bill. \u201cThey keep trying to do the same thing over and over again.\u201d David Cameron, the UK prime minister, has become the first world leader to comment on the US government partial shutdown. Interviewed by Sky News at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Cameron tried to link the Washington deadlock to the wider issue of fiscal responsibility. It is a reminder to all of that we need properly planned budgets, properly planned taxes, properly planned ways to get the deficit down, said Cameron, adding: It's absolutely vital that we grip it. We're not expecting a market panic this morning -- European stock markets will probably be calm. However, that could change, if we don't see signs of progress in America later today. The US economy slid into its first shutdown since 1995 despite Barack Obama appealing to lawmakers to meet their responsibilities and pass a budget acceptable to the Senate. President Obama warned that the consequences would be severe, as America must also agree a deal to raise its debt ceiling before the US debt mountain hits $16.7 trillion (the legal limit), probably on 17 October. He said: Certainly we can't have any meaningful negotiations under the cloud of potential default \u2013 the first in US history. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO private bank, predicted wider economic pain: This is a contrived crisis that is going to have real consequences....It will cause unnecessary volatility in the market and ultimately cost the economy. My US colleagues live-blogged all the drama last night, as the two sides struggled in vain to reach an agreement over a new deal to fund the US government: US government on verge of shutdown - as it happened There were no fireworks at midnight in Washington when time ran out to agree a new budget to fund government services, just a sombre announcement that the shutdown was beginning. Followed by the blame game, with both sides saying the other are at fault (I'll round up the reaction shortly) So who will be hit? Over 700,000 non-essential workers at operations from NASA to the national parks are being sent home. Even the Statue of Liberty will be closed - not the image America likes to present to the world. Late last night, President Obama also signed a bill that will ensure that military staff keep being paid. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have shutdown. A couple of hours ago, the US government began closing down non-essential services and putting hundreds of thousands of \"non essential workers\" on unpaid leave, in the first such shutdown in17 years . Despite last-minute negotiations that ran up to midnight, the US House of Representatives and the Senate proved unable to agree a budget for the new financial year, which began today. With Republicans insisting on cuts to President Obama's Affordable Care Act, and Democrats refusing to budge, time simply ran out. It's the first shutdown in 17 years, and the impact could be felt across the global economy. Our Washington bureau chief, Dan Roberts, explains how the shutdown was triggered: As a midnight deadline to extend Congressional spending authority ticked ever closer, Republicans staged a series of last-ditch efforts to use a once-routine budget procedure to force Democrats to abandon their efforts to extend US health insurance. Three separate attacks on the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, were staged by the House of Representatives, only to be rejected in turn by the Democrat-controlled Senate, which accused Republicans of holding the country to ransom. Shortly before midnight, Senate majority leader Harry Reid marked the end of the process by rejecting House calls for formal talks to reconcile their conflicting positions, arguing it was impossible to negotiate with a \u201cgun to our heads\u201d. \u201cThis is a very serious time in the history of our country,\u201d Reid said. \u201cMillions of people are going to be affected tomorrow and the Republicans are still playing games\u201d But the impact of the shutdown could be felt outside America too, if the warring sides cannot agree a deal soon. And once they've managed that, the US faces the separate challenge of raising its debt ceiling before the middle of October. We'll be tracking the reaction to the shutdown, and explaining what it could mean for the world economy, through the day - along with other key events.",

Lower down the market Iomart lost 14.25p to 276p as three directors of the cloud computing group raised nearly \u00a312m between them by selling shares at 275p each. The bulk of the proceeds - \u00a310m - went to chief executive Angus MacSween. The company also issued an in-line trading update and the \u00a323m cash and share acquisition of Leeds based cloud and disaster recovery specialist Backup Technology. Finally Blur Group, which operates an online marketplace for companies to buy and sell services from advertising to legal help, jumped 16.5p to 440p, as it announced a new non-executive director in the form of Microgen chief executive David Sherriff. Analysts at house broker N+1 Singer said: Blur continues to build and strengthen its operational and management structure to support its strong growth, ensuring it remains well positioned to build on its positive momentum and first mover advantage. We expect the group to announce its third quarter 2013 metrics on 8 October and expect this to confirm continuing strong trajectory.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poundland is aiming for 1,000 stores in the UK and is planning to take its Dealz chain into Europe in the next 18 months after recording a 21% leap in pre-tax profits. The discount retailer, which is chaired by former Tesco finance director Andrew Higginson and has nearly 500 stores, is likely to head for a London flotation next year in the wake of a strong 15% rise in sales to \u00a3880m. Jim McCarthy, the chief executive, said Poundland's sales were lifted by cash-strapped shoppers looking for \"amazing value\" on everyday essentials including health and beauty and household goods as well as food. He added that, while there were emerging signs of a rise in consumer confidence, Poundland would continue to do well. \"The consumer is much better informed now and used to being savvy and careful with their money. I genuinely believe that the consumer has changed forever.\" He declined to comment on whether Poundland would seek a market listing, but the company's private equity owner Warburg Pincus is expected to make a move as the retailer has halved its net borrowings to \u00a312.1m in the past year and its Ireland success has shown it has the potential to expand outside the UK. Shoppers' need for a bargain is driving a wave of expansion by discount retailers including the German grocery stores Aldi and Lidl, as well as Poundland and its rivals Poundstretcher and 99p Stores. Aldi revealed a 40% rise in sales this week. These chains have been stealing market share from bigger rivals, such as Tesco and Asda during the economic downturn. Neil Saunders, managing director of market analysts Conlumino, said Poundland was likely to be \"nibbling away\" market share from a whole range of retailers from Boots to supermarkets and general stores like Wilkinsons. Over a fifth of Poundland's customers are now middle class or affluent and McCarthy says Poundland would benefit from any uptick in the number of shoppers on the high street. He insists that the likes of Aldi and Lidl were much more of a threat to the main supermarkets than Poundland because just 20% of its sales came from groceries. He said: \"That's just a blip on the radar of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's.\" The chain plans to open 50 stores in the UK this year, a similar number to last year, and is rapidly building up its Dealz chain in Ireland, which currently has 26 outlets. McCarthy said the success of Dealz, which launched two years ago, had given Poundland the confidence to go into new markets and it had identified at least one country in mainland Europe where it wanted to open stores soon. \"There is a big market in Europe and it is absolutely ideal for Dealz,\" he said. Poundland's plan for European expansion follows similar talk from B&amp;M Bargains, the discount retailer chaired by Higginson's former colleague at Tesco, Sir Terry Leahy. Saunders said it was not surprising Poundland and others were looking abroad as the opportunities for expansion in the UK were beginning to diminish. But he suggested it might not be an easy ride. \"In the UK we are used to having a generalist store like Woolworths on the high street but in Europe there is a different dynamic. Poundland will have to think about how it fits into the psyche there, because it's as much about that as it is about actually saving money.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's bumpy recovery has reasserted itself following a fall in factory output growth during September, according to the latest CIPS/Markit survey. The manufacturing sector continued to expand, prolonging a six-month period of improvement, but Markit's index of activity shows output fell back to 56.7 from the previous two-and-a-half year high of 57.1 in August. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The main drag on the sector's growth was a slump in export growth as new orders fell to 52.7 from 54 in August. By contrast, domestic orders powered ahead at 59.3, below August's 61.5, but higher than July's 58.3. Employment kept up its expansionary trend in September, improving on August and maintaining a period of jobs growth that dates back to April. Markit's survey showed that all manufacturing industries, besides textiles and clothing, saw some increase in foreign demand over September both from developed markets and emerging economies. Employment and input prices rose at their fastest pace in two years. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: \"This is another solid month for manufacturing with output, orders and employment all up, paving the way for a decent quarter of growth across the sector. The good run of indicators should continue beyond the end of this year with some expansion in manufacturing taking place in Europe, Asia and the US. The economic thinktank, the CEBR, said: \"This was the fifth consecutive month during which employment has risen in the manufacturing sector. The staffing-level recovery was broad-based, as payrolls increased across all manufacturing industries, besides timber and paper. \"Overall, rising employment in the manufacturing sector has the potential to decrease the UK unemployment rate \u2013 which still stood at an elevated 7.7% over April-June 2013 \u2013 or at least mitigate the effect of public sector payroll reductions,\" it said. However, Hopley said the sector faced headwinds that could restrict its expansion in the coming months. She said: \"Ramping up production to meet growing demand given the persistent weakness in investment is one. A second concern is inevitably that the positive outlook globally will be sustained.\" Analysts said an appreciation in the pound in recent months, making exports more expensive, was also likely to be a cause of the slowdown in export sales. Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, said: \"The latest Markit survey could be a blip in an otherwise upward sloping trend because recoveries are seldom a straight-line affair. \"Alternatively, this could be the first sign that the near 5% appreciation in the effective sterling exchange rate is starting to be a dampener on the export facing part of the recovery.\" An improving picture across the continent could also act to bolster demand for British exports. The Markit purchasing managers' index for the eurozone showed expansion at 51.1 in September. Though down on August's 26-month high of 51.4, the survey points to continuing expansion after a long period of recession. Unemployment across the 17 eurozone countries also indicated some stabilising Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, said the unemployment rate was 12% in August, unchanged from the previous month and down modestly from the 12.1% peak recorded in the summer. In total, the number of unemployed people dipped by 5,000 to 19.18 million. Few economists think the eurozone's current economic growth is enough to significantly bring down unemployment, particularly among the young. The manufacturing PMI survey, for example, showed companies in the sector still expect modest job losses. \"Unemployment looks set to fall only very gradually at best,\" said Ben May, European economist at Capital Economics. The Eurostat figures mask huge divergences across the eurozone. While Germany has an unemployment rate of 5.2%, Greece and Spain have over a quarter of their workforce out of a job. The situation among the young is even more acute. Greece and Spain, for example, have over half their under-25s unemployed.

That man, John, was the head of trading at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Brothers\">Salomon Brothers</a>, on the executive board, and only one step below the CEO. It was 1994 and he had been with the firm twenty years as a trader. I had been there just one.</p> <p>I was meeting with him because my boss, and my boss's boss, did not feel comfortable approving my trade, an investment of $200m in Brazil's currency, the real. I believed the currency had a brighter future than many others thought, and John and I met up to talk about it. The smoking ban, only enacted six months before, had pushed us into the fire escape outside his corner office. </p> <p>I made my pitch. He smoked, belched and listened, before asking me a volley of questions. Most focused on how, when and if I could get out of the trade. Some were amazingly na\u00efve about culture as well as finance: \"Can you read Spanish?\" </p> <p>He approved half the trade I wanted: $100m. He tossed his butt on the ground and left, saying, \"It's amazing how quickly gold can turn into shit.\"<br> Two weeks later, my trade was, in fact, starting to act more like shit than gold. To the untrained eye it still looked good, and it was making money, but many of the arguments that had justified the trade were turning out poorly. As I would put it on the trading floor, \"the forwards are acting squishy.\" That meant that the market's confidence in the Brazilian real was starting to dwindle.</p> <p>After a particularly bad day, I was riding the elevator down to the cafeteria when John got on. For most of the ride he chatted with friends about weekend skiing plans. Near the end he turned to me and asked about the trade: \"You thinking of getting out?\" I pointed out that the trade was still making money. He pointed out what had changed. It was clear he now knew more about Brazilian currency than I did.</p> <p>Later, when I told my boss that I was surprised someone so senior knew so much about my trade, he laughed: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"That's his money you are investing. The old managing directors, they still act like partners who own the firm.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>After a restless night I unwound the trade the following morning at a small profit. That saved us a loss about $10m. Two weeks later, <a href=\"http://www.businesspundit.com/10-of-the-worlds-most-dramatic-financial-crises-and-their-lessons/\">Brazil blew up</a>. A currency crisis had started.</p> <p>12 years later, I was working in a different world. Citibank, a firm of roughly 200,000 employees, had digested Salomon Brothers, then a firm of roughly 4,000, and I had moved to the giant bank's proprietary trading department, a special group tasked with placing bets using the banks own money. John, my old boss at Salomon, had moved on to skiing in Colorado.</p> <p>In my final years many of my last trades were approved by \u2013 well, I don't really know what they looked like, since most conversations were held over the phone. Sometimes it would be a gentleman with an Indian accent. Sometimes it was a nervous-sounding man in a satellite office somewhere. For six sweet months it was nobody: I had fallen between administrative cracks in a reshuffle. I set my own limits for trades. </p> <p>No matter who the risk manager on the telephone was, I always liked to imagine him in a faraway stairwell, smoking cigarettes, like John. </p> <p>How many people were between the CEO and me at Citigroup? That's also hard to say. There were many different lines of reporting. Some weaved through maybe 10 people before getting to the CEO, others maybe 15. When I had that first conversation in 1994 at Salomon about the Brazilian real, there were only three people standing between me and the CEO.</p> <p>Salomon in the early 90s, like most investment banks at that time, still had the culture of a private partnership, even though it went public in 1981. Gone were waiters bringing china plates and silverware to trader's desk. Soon to be gone were cigars and open smoking on the trading floor. What was still barely hanging on was a sense of collective ownership, a result of employees having most of their money reinvested in the firm.</p> <p>Investment banks behaved like a federation of financial businesses, united by joint ownership of the risks and the rewards, with each business run by a partner whose money was invested in his and his friends' businesses. (Yes, almost all male.)</p> <p>The result was that risk management \u2013 or, making sure the bank didn't lose more money than it could afford \u2013 was everyone's business. If your friend messed up a trade, then you yourself lost. Consequently, firms were judicious about what businesses they entered and how quickly they grew, often preferring to stay small and keep risk within limits they could understand.</p> <p>They still made mistakes \u2013 which is the nature of taking risks. Salomon messed up royally in 1991, when it was almost brought down by a bid-rigging scandal that required Warren Buffett to save the bank. Yet the smaller size of the banks at the time kept their mistakes from infecting the broader markets.</p> <p>By 2000, the culture of Wall Street had changed dramatically, driven largely by deregulation and the move towards publicly owned investment banks \u2013 the kind with stock listings on the New York Stock Exchange and financial filings with the SEC.</p> <p>What the banking industry had evolved into was an army of megabanks, such as Citigroup and JP Morgan.

That's where your bonus came from. It did not come from making sure the larger bank made sustainable profits.

A variety of different proposals are being touted to address the banking sector's illness. Almost all of them are better solutions than doing nothing at all. Still, until the bond of responsibility between the banker and the bank is restored, Wall Street will continue to behave badly.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain's biggest energy companies has warned Ed Miliband that it would pull the plug on UK investment if Labour pressed ahead with plans to freeze utility bills. Keith Anderson, the boss of ScottishPower, issued the thinly veiled threat in an open letter to the Labour leader following his pledge to freeze energy prices for 20 months should the party regain power in 2015. He said that while the current regulatory framework in the UK encouraged investment on a \"massive scale\", a freeze in domestic prices would hinder the appetite for energy companies to invest in future infrastructure. \"To the extent such a freeze would cause investors to doubt that they will receive an adequate return or to fear future similar interventions, those doubts and fears would be reflected in the appetite to invest,\" he wrote. Anderson outlined ScottishPower's plans to invest up to \u00a315bn and create 4,500 new jobs in the UK, but suggested the Spanish-owned company could divert investment plans to other countries should a freeze go ahead. \"As an international energy company, we carefully analyse all of the major markets in the world. Maintaining principles of sound regulation and avoiding regulatory uncertainty are critical to securing this global investment in the UK,\" he wrote. It was the latest heated response to Miliband's controversial plans, which created a backlash from across the industry and hit share prices in the sector. On Monday SSE said it would remain \"disciplined\" in the face of Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices. Anderson rejected the Labour leader's assertion that energy companies have been unfairly profiteering for too long. \"Of course, there are entirely understandable and widespread concerns about consumer prices. It is a long way from multibillion-pound projects, decades in the building, to an unwelcome bill for a low-income pensioner or a family with a squeezed income in the middle of winter. Affordability is a key issue and one that we are constantly seeking to address. We take our commitment to consumers very seriously.\" He said that by spending close to \u00a3500m over the past five years on making over one million more homes more energy efficient, ScottishPower was helping UK households to save \u00a3100 a year. The company's boss also hinted that a move to freeze prices would undermine the government's energy market reforms, set in motion by Miliband when he was energy secretary in the previous government. Companies will be handed subsidies in a bid to encourage \u00a3110bn of investment in low carbon electricity. \"We have welcomed the political consensus around this framework for reform. This is key to building the confidence so essential to attracting the investment that the country needs. \"Division in this area will simply make it harder for any government to deliver the necessary investment in the energy system,\" Anderson wrote.",

The US recovery remains fragile, as the Fed stressed last month when it decided to continue buying $85bn (\u00a352bn)-a-month worth of bonds, instead of \"tapering\" QE. A major wobble, throwing the spotlight back on to the health of the US public finances, is the last thing the nascent upturn needs; and it could also exacerbate markets' anxiety in the run-up to the potentially fraught debate over raising the government's budget ceiling in mid-October. How will the UK be affected? If the shutdown is short-lived, probably very little; if it is prolonged, then the uptick in sterling could continue, and a stronger pound is the last thing George Osborne wants as he tries to rebalance the economy towards exports, so that Britain can \"pay its way in the world\". There is also a risk that as investors turn their minds to the dangers of debt-burdened developed economies struggling to generate a sustainable upturn, they start to scrutinise the policies of other such states \u2013 including the UK. George Osborne's grim pledge in his Conservative party conference speech that austerity will continue until 2020 may partly have been aimed at reminding international markets that the UK system is different to America's, and he has no intention of being diverted from his deficit-cutting course. What about the rest of the world? Any prolonged shutdown would rapidly start to hit US consumer spending, as hundreds of thousands of public sector workers are furloughed; and that will crimp America's demand for imports from the rest of the world. At the margins, weaker investor confidence, and the dollar depreciation that has so far been the main financial impact of the shutdown, could also slow the flood of capital into the US that was one of the key trends in international markets over the summer. The switch from riskier markets to the perceived safety of America drove up exchange rates and bond yields in many emerging economies, forcing central banks in several countries, including India and Brazil, to take emergency action. A renewed sense of crisis in the US is likely to stem that flow, particularly after the Fed had already raised questions about the health of the US economy when it declined to \"taper\" QE in September. What will China think? Beijing's attitude is the key to one of the more subtle potential implications of this latest budgetary wrangle. China holds a mountain of US assets, mostly Treasury bonds, effectively IOUs from Washington \u2013 the by-product of running huge trade surpluses over the past decade and a deliberate policy to keep the Chinese currency, the yuan, cheap. However, Chinese politicians have repeatedly expressed concern over recent years about the growing risks of this large exposure to the US, as Washington has appeared increasingly unable to bring tax-and-spending policy under control. When the US was stripped of its AAA credit rating by Standard &amp; Poors in August 2011, after a previous partisan wrangle over raising the government's debt ceiling \u2013 not a problem suffered in autocratic single-party states \u2013 China reacted with fury. Xinhua, the official news agency, said: \"The days when the debt-ridden Uncle Sam could leisurely squander unlimited overseas borrowing appear to be numbered. To cure its addiction to debts, the US has to re-establish the common sense principle that one should live within its means.\" Since then China has deliberately moved towards making the yuan more convertible on international markets, which would allow it to appreciate, and reduce the need to pile up potentially risky US debts \u2013 a policy that in the long term could remove the biggest buyer of US debt from the markets, potentially making it far more costly for America to borrow. Simon Derrick, of BNY Mellon, suggested the lack of outraged comment over the current budget impasse may suggest \"the Chinese government has already made its mind up about what it needs to do and sees little point in complaining any further\".",
