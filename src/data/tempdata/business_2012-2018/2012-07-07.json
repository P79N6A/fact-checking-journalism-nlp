Parliament will continue its investigation of the background to the case this week, with Agius, and Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker appearing before the Treasury select committee which took evidence from Diamond last week. The FSA's chairman Lord Turner has also been put on notice that his attendance may be required before the committee. How's the industry's public image? In the torrid days that followed the financial crisis, bank bosses seemed blind to the public furore that followed the multibillion-pound rescue of the sector by taxpayers and the Bank of England. More recently, bankers have realised there is an image problem. The Libor scandal has thrown dynamite on an industry whose image was tarnished by rocketing pay deals and the swashbuckling attitude of its traders, and politicians of all parties have competed to prove that they would like to see the industry brought to book, taking big bets on financial markets. Diamond tried hard to present Barclays as a good corporate citizen; and the bank spends millions of pounds on advertising and sponsorship \u2013 backing such as of football's Premier League, to bolster its PR credentials. What's the reality? Diamond argued to MPs that the offences that led to the fine took place among a handful of staff in an organisation that employs 144,000. Staff in Barclays high-street banking business are on far lower salaries, and work in an atmosphere that could not be further from the cut-and-thrust of the trading floor. But mis-selling scandals such as PPI mean that even the high-street arms of banks have marred their reputations \u2013 and that was before the IT crisis that hit RBS last month. Up to 13m customers of the group, which includes NatWest, were unable to use their accounts for up to 10 days, and in the case of its Ulster Bank arm the problem will not be fixed until next week \u2013 a whole month of computer chaos. Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, apologised to the bank's exasperated customers, and said he would not be taking his bonus for a second successive year \u2013 having waived a \u00a3963,000 payment in January under pressure from the public although it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to placate customers. What is the UK doing about it? The immediate political fallout of the Libor crisis is the creation of a cross-party committee, chaired by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, which will look at the wider issue of the culture and practices in the banking sector during what George Osborne has called the \"age of irresponsibility\". There are still calls by Labour for a full-blown public inquiry, although efforts to push this through the Commons failed this week after a rowdy debate by MPs.

GlaxoSmithKline, Britain's biggest pharmaceutical group, has been selling anti-depressant drugs in the US for unapproved uses on children, concealing critical evidence from US regulator the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relating to a diabetes product, and offering lavish entertainment to doctors willing to promote its medicines. The problems came to light because of whistleblowers inside the company and adds to a string of other settlements with pharmaceutical firms that lead critics to claim problems are endemic in the sector.

    "webTitle": "In Orgreave, hope rises from the fields where miners fought and lost", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The final years of Orgreave colliery were a brutal footnote in Britain's postwar industrial history. One of many economic casualties that litter the south Yorkshire coal belt, it will be remembered most for a pitched battle between thousands of police and picketing miners in 1984, when it was a British Steel coking plant that converted coal into industrial fuel. In scenes that smacked of a medieval military engagement, one side kitted out with helmets and shields fought to let trucks out, and the other, in incongruously everyday jeans and jackets, was driven back by baton charges as it scrambled to keep them in. It remains a defining moment in an epochal industrial dispute, and was even restaged in a civil-war-style recreation by the artist Jeremy Deller, featuring former participants from both sides. So it is hard to credit that those scenes unfolded outside what is now the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), built on the former site of the Orgreave and Waverley colliery complex. If you strain your neck, from the top floor of the AMRC you can glimpse where the confrontations took place, but the surrounding hi-tech buildings, and the industrial future that they promise, obscure the view. Jamie McGourlay, who works at the AMRC as a representative of Rolls-Royce, one of the companies that funds the centre, points out the expanse of a colliery site that once stretched \"as far as the eye can see\". After the site shut down in the 1990s, he says, \"this was the cemetery of the Sheffield steel and mining industry\". But on the ground floor a new industrial cycle is starting from the cradle, not the grave. Work is taking place that belies the overalls-and-spanners image that industrialists and politicians say is still hampering manufacturing's appeal to new generations. The AMRC is a sophisticated manufacturing laboratory, run by the University of Sheffield and backed by major private sector players, led by Boeing. Rolls-Royce and BAE are also on board as backers. It is developing breakthroughs in machining technology \u2013 in basic terms, taking a lump of metal and turning it into a high-quality product through drilling, cutting and grinding. For instance, machining is vital for Rolls-Royce. The turbine blades for its aircraft engines operate to approximately 10 microns of tolerance, or a fraction of the width of a human hair. This cavernous 6,400 sq metre facility has no production lines churning out cars, tools or TVs. Instead, groups of academics, apprentices and Rolls-Royce, Boeing and BAE employees develop techniques, hopefully sowing the seeds for breakthroughs that will sustain British industry for years to come. McGourlay points to engine casings and fan blades, describing these objects as \"one step\" away from being factory-finished items. If the new techniques being honed here are approved, they will then become part of the production process for products such as these casings and fan blades. According to Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, Britain's hopes for maintaining a foothold in global manufacturing lie in research and development \u2013 generating new ideas. The AMRC is attempting to bridge a gap that many frustrated industrialists feel is a chasm: the disconnection between cutting-edge university research and companies. McGourlay says that before these centres sprang up, universities were making breakthroughs that had no commercial home, while companies could not justify the cost and time of imaginative research and development. At Orgreave, the problems are reconciled. The university runs the centres, and the industrial groups provide materials, expertise and funding. The government also provides a third of the funding through grants and its Technology Strategy Board (TSB). McGourlay says a \"fundamental flaw\" in new manufacturing technology is getting ideas from the lab to the market. He adds: \"Colleagues in America refer to this middle ground as the valley of death. We found that what was needed to fill the gap was a new link between universities and the private sector.\" He and his colleagues are not trying to emulate Dyson and produce a next-generation vacuum cleaner. Instead, they hope that their breakthroughs will make a difference at an earlier stage, in the manufacturing process, by giving British businesses the edge over competitors. If a company can make an engine turbine blade better and more efficiently than a rival product from China, Brazil or India, then it has a chance of cancelling out the competitive advantage that emerging companies enjoy from cheaper labour costs. \"If we want to remain competitive in manufacturing in the UK and offset labour costs, we need to make step-changes of 50%, 70% in things like efficiency, capability and quality in order to compete with the likes of China,\" says McGourlay. \"Too often we produce black boxes where we just turn a handle and something comes out. This lets us know how the black box actually works \u2013 and that intelligence is the competitive edge.\" The AMRC has galvanised the local economy. Two miles down the road on the edge of Sheffield, a steel product company called Tinsley Bridge is using the AMRC's composite facilities to research making a new, lighter stabiliser bar for trucks. Mark Webber, the company's managing director, says having a \"world-class facility\" on your doorstep draws in big hitters who create smaller supply chain companies in their wake. \"It is attracting leading-edge companies into the city, like Rolls-Royce, and these companies in turn will procure components locally, while demanding world-class standards. So it will improve the capability of the entire supply chain in the area. For us, as an SME and a global, exporting business, having access to the AMRC reassures our customers that we can compete in the modern world.\" Richard Wright, executive director of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce, says the centre has unlocked potential. \"It was a long-term investment at a time when manufacturing was not really the in thing in the UK, in 2002-03 when there was a different impression of manufacturing. If you take a long-term view of things you can build something special. Because we have invested in that area we are now seeing the benefits in terms of a buoyant advanced manufacturing centre in the region. Rolls-Royce has decided to open two factories here. It has allowed the region to up itself by more than one gear.\" At a gathering of car industry executives in London's Docklands, a senior figure at the government body behind the AMRC initiative says the programme has been important in portraying the UK as a fleet-footed manufacturing base, able to come up with new ideas and put them to commercial use. Under the TSB's \"catapult\" programme, the Sheffield AMRC is one of seven high-value manufacturing centres, with the University of Strathclyde, University of Bristol and University of Warwick also establishing sites. Andrew Everett, head of transport at the TSB, says the body has helped encourage foreign car companies to expand in the UK. Referring to Britain's largest car plant, the Nissan site in Sunderland, he says: \"Nissan are putting the Leaf [electric car] and the battery manufacturing plant there. The culture that we have developed in the UK through our activities has helped Nissan see the UK as a place that does innovation.\" Projects like the Sheffield AMRC, he says, give academic entrepreneurs and business a space to co-operate \u2013 something the private sector cannot do on its own. \"We de-risk the funding for that level of expertise,\" says Everett. In other words, the government is acknowledging that there are areas of Britain's manufacturing base where the state needs to play a permanent role. As a setting for the interview, Docklands, is appropriate: the heartland of Britain's financial services industry. For all the car industry's success in recent years, it still needs to unlock investment from the financial community, which will in turn spur the creation of more small and medium sized businesses in the supply chain. At Orgreave, at least, a new industrial ecology is being nurtured. The AMRC is just one part of an advanced manufacturing park that includes a nuclear facility, run by Sheffield and Manchester universities, dedicated to testing machine tools for nuclear components. Rolls-Royce is building a facility that will specialise in advance casting, or producing the basic metal shapes that are then cut and ground into products \u2013 one manufacturing step behind the work being carried out at the machining facility. In another breakthrough, partners in the AMRC are working on a training facility that will generate 200 fully fledged industrial apprentices per year. As McGourlay says: \"They are not just creating new technologies, they are creating the next generation of engineers.\" In 2006, Guardian readers nominated the battle of Orgreave as one of the most neglected events in Britain's radical past. Yet as the efforts of Deller show, its impact lingers. In David Peace's novel about the miners' strike, GB84, the importance of the confrontation is emphasised by one of the protagonists. \"Everything was Orgreave now. Everything had to be done to close Orgreave.\" For a new generation of professionals it has, in its own way, reopened.",

If you take a long-term view of things you can build something special. Because we have invested in that area we are now seeing the benefits in terms of a buoyant advanced manufacturing centre in the region. Rolls-Royce has decided to open two factories here. It has allowed the region to up itself by more than one gear.\"</p> <p>At a gathering of car industry executives in London's Docklands, a senior figure at the government body behind the AMRC initiative says the programme has been important in portraying the UK as a fleet-footed manufacturing base, able to come up with new ideas and put them to commercial use. Under the TSB's \"catapult\" programme, the Sheffield AMRC is one of seven high-value manufacturing centres, with the University of Strathclyde, University of Bristol and University of Warwick also establishing sites.</p> <p>Andrew Everett, head of transport at the TSB, says the body has helped encourage foreign car companies to expand in the UK. Referring to Britain's largest car plant, the Nissan site in Sunderland, he says: \"Nissan are putting the Leaf [electric car] and the battery manufacturing plant there. The culture that we have developed in the UK through our activities has helped Nissan see the UK as a place that does innovation.\"</p> <p>Projects like the Sheffield AMRC, he says, give academic entrepreneurs and business a space to co-operate \u2013 something the private sector cannot do on its own. \"We de-risk the funding for that level of expertise,\" says Everett. In other words, the government is acknowledging that there are areas of Britain's manufacturing base where the state needs to play a permanent role.</p> <p>As a setting for the interview, Docklands, is appropriate: the heartland of Britain's financial services industry. For all the car industry's success in recent years, it still needs to unlock investment from the financial community, which will in turn spur the creation of more small and medium sized businesses in the supply chain.</p> <p>At Orgreave, at least, a new industrial ecology is being nurtured. The AMRC is just one part of an advanced manufacturing park that includes a nuclear facility, run by Sheffield and Manchester universities, dedicated to testing machine tools for nuclear components. Rolls-Royce is building a facility that will specialise in advance casting, or producing the basic metal shapes that are then cut and ground into products \u2013 one manufacturing step behind the work being carried out at the machining facility.</p> <p>In another breakthrough, partners in the AMRC are working on a training facility that will generate 200 fully fledged industrial apprentices per year. As McGourlay says: \"They are not just creating new technologies, they are creating the next generation of engineers.\"</p> <p>In 2006, Guardian readers nominated the battle of Orgreave as one of the most neglected events in Britain's radical past. Yet as the efforts of Deller show, its impact lingers. In David Peace's novel about the miners' strike, <em>GB84</em>, the importance of the confrontation is emphasised by one of the protagonists. \"Everything was Orgreave now. Everything had to be done to close Orgreave.\" For a new generation of professionals it has, in its own way, reopened.</p>",

A question of balance At the same time as Tucker fields questions from members of parliament on the Treasury select committee, Sir Mike Rake, Barclays' deputy chairman (and chairman of BT and easyJet), will be up in front of the House of Lords' EU subcommittee.

It's not easy to do final assembly lines in different parts of the world.\" While it may look like corporate bravado on the part of Airbus, it could have implications for the UK. Airbus and its parent, EADS, are major employers in the UK, accounting for 17,000 jobs \u2013 many of them highly skilled engineers. This is why the Airbus order-book matters here and why a move to Alabama might cause consternation. Some 15% of Airbus production takes place in the UK, led by a world-class wing manufacturing plant in Broughton, north Wales, and at its design and testing facility in Filton near Bristol. This is a rivalry that matters.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Watching Wednesday's gruelling (for viewers) three-hour Treasury select committee hearing, it was hard to know who to feel most furious with: cucumber-cool Bob Diamond, or the flummoxed MPs who failed, again and again, to land the killer blow. We certainly learned more about the state of parliamentary democracy in 21st-century Britain than the inner workings of Barclays. For one thing, the links between the mighty financial sector and the men and women who are meant to represent the public are deep and complex. Two members of the committee are ex-Barclays insiders, albeit in the dim and distant past; another, Mark Garnier, had a career as a City fund manager; while Tory MP Michael Fallon had to declare an interest before questioning Diamond, because he's a non-executive director of Tullett Prebon, a brokerage that the Financial Services Authority has asked to help it with its Libor-fixing inquiry. Of course, a career in finance shouldn't disqualify anyone from public office; and you'd hope a banking background would give MPs the insight and the lingo to hold Diamond firmly to account: Jesse Norman, one of the Barclays alumni on the committee, has often been a thoughtful commentator on the state of modern finance, for example. Yet, as so often throughout this crisis, the finance geeks were asking the wrong questions. It took Labour's John Mann, an old-fashioned constituency MP for the former mining area of Bassetlaw, to nail Diamond by encapsulating the reason it was right for him to resign: \"Either you were complicit, grossly negligent or incompetent.\" Apart from that exquisite moment, there was little to ruffle Diamond, who must have flown back to the US a relieved man. The inescapable conclusion to draw from his non-mauling is one that Ed Balls \u2013 for his own political reasons, of course \u2013 had already come to since the Libor-rigging scandal first broke: that a Commons inquiry, even one chaired by the independent-minded Andrew Tyrie, would be too weak, and too hamstrung by private interests and political point-scoring to succeed. The extraordinary hold Britain's banking sector has gained over Westminster and the reins of economic power over the past 25 years is a story that transcends political parties and extends before and beyond the financial crisis of 2008-9. For Thatcher's Tories, unleashing the City in the Big Bang reforms of 1986 meant building a more go-getting, entrepreneurial economy where capital would flow freely and \"wealth creators\" could flex their muscles. For Labour, which consciously wooed the money men to win their confidence in the early 1990s, a strong City meant bumper tax revenues to be spent on the health service, schools and infrastructure. Both parties enjoyed the swagger that came with attracting some of the world's best-known financial firms \u2013 Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, UBS \u2013 to the heart of the City and the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf. Yet not only did those freewheeling financial capitalists not bring the new, shiny economy and the permanent prop for the public finances the politicians hoped for, they also skewed and corrupted business and society in their image. The overvalued pound that resulted from billions of dollars of capital flooding into London from the US and elsewhere intensified the squeeze on an industrial sector already struggling to compete with cheaper suppliers from overseas. Unheard-of rewards from once-obscure careers such as bond trading and hedge fund management lured wonks away from universities and corporate R&amp;D departments into the Square Mile. And it wasn't just their double-shot lattes and graph-paper shirts the American bankers brought with them. A big bucks, heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bonus culture, which took root on trading floors in the 1980s (see Liar's Poker) and was given a sheen of respectability by business school neologisms such as \"incentivisation\", led to a pay explosion as profits soared. Once bankers were raking it in, other bosses who had once held their own with the City boys wanted to get in on the act, and the age of remuneration consultants, \"golden parachute\" rewards for failure and seven-figure bonuses had well and truly arrived across corporate Britain. But out in the real world, meanwhile, little of the money being churned around London's financial markets found its way into productive investments to build up the capacity of the economy for the long term. Some went to fuel an unsustainable property boom, convincing hundreds of thousands of people they could be buy-to-let millionaires; but much of it was just lent back and forth between a handful of giant financial players placing ever riskier bets. And those tax revenues that were so useful for Gordon Brown in the age of \"prudence\" and \"stability\" went up in smoke when taxpayers were forced to spend tens of billions of pounds bailing out the financiers, who were anything but grateful, let alone humble. The public deserves a thoroughgoing, independent inquiry into the culture, structure and economic impact of banking, because they know that politicians of all stripes \u2013 just like the rest of us \u2013 have been taken for a ride.",
