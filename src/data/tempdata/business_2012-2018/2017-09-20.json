      "bodyText": "Right, time to wrap up. Here\u2019s a quick summary. Almost a decade after the financial world plunged into its biggest crisis in generations, the US Federal Reserve has taken the landmark decision to start unwinding some of the stimulus it created to ward off a second Great Depression. The Fed will start cutting its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October, initially by just $10bn per month. Fed chair Janet Yellen said the normalisation process would be gradual and predictable. Policymakers also left US interest rates unchanged, at 1.25% to 1.5%. The Fed committee expects to raise borrowing costs once more time this year, followed by three raises in 2018. During her press conference, Yellen admitted that the Fed doesn\u2019t really understand why inflation hasn\u2019t returned to target. She also predicted that the US economy would suffer short-term damage from Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria. But there was no new insight into Yellen\u2019s future; the Fed chair hasn\u2019t met with president Trump recently, and refused to say if she wanted to serve a second term once her first stint ends in February 2018. Investors are taking the Fed\u2019s decisions well, with shares finishing a little higher in New York. The US dollar has jumped, while US government debt has weakened, as investors brace for the Fed\u2019s policies to hit the markets. From New York, my colleague Dominic Rushe sums up the day: The Federal Reserve has announced it will begin the great unwinding of the gargantuan stimulus programme it began close to a decade ago in the teeth of the worst recession in living memory. As widely expected, the Fed voted to start reducing its portfolio starting in October, and kept interest rates at a range of 1% to 1.25%. The move, announced after a two-day meeting by Fed officials, will start the gradual reduction of the central bank\u2019s $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities, bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy. \u201cThe basic message here is that US economic performance has been good,\u201d Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference. The Fed\u2019s decision had been made because \u201cwe feel the US economy is performing well\u201d but she added the Fed could reverse course if conditions changed.... Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s full story: That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW and NF Wall Street has taken today\u2019s news in its stride. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 share indices have both closed slightly higher, at new record highs. But... short-term US government debt continues to sell off. The yield (interest rate) on two-year Treasury bills is pushing higher, following the news that the Fed will trim its balance sheet. Reaction to the Fed\u2019s announcement keeps flooding in. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management predicts the Fed will unwind its balance sheet slowly, as it takes a step into the unknown. It has taken a decade for policymakers to begin to understand the effects of quantitative easing and with that debate still raging, markets will need to absorb the impact of its reversal. Because of the uncertainty this could entail, we expect the Fed to adopt a \u2018do no harm\u2019 approach. The fact that the Fed is even willing to begin this process indicates their confidence in the direction of the US economy and markets should not be perturbed by any new policy approach. Sophia Ferguson of State Street Global Advisors says the Fed will be watching economic data closely, especially following recent hurricane damage: In spite of record low unemployment and increasingly loose financial conditions, benign wage growth kept hawkish members of the committee grounded, with a downward drift in the longer-run expected policy rate path as represented by the dot plots. With 11 out of 16 participants calling for another rate hike before the end of the year, the decision to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1.25% provides a welcome respite for the FOMC to evaluate the economic data over the coming weeks and months; the pause reduces the risk of pre-emptively removing policy accommodation, yet leaves ample fuel in the tank should inflation start to accelerate more aggressively than forecast in the second half of the year. James McCann of Aberdeen Asset Management says the Fed has \u201cfired the starting gun\u201d on unwinding its QE programme. This is set to be a marathon, rather than a sprint, with a slow-but-steady runoff in Treasury and Mortgage Backed Security holdings to begin in October. This step reflects rising confidence that the recovery is sufficiently durable to withstand a slow withdrawal of emergency policy measures, a full ten years after the financial crisis struck. Nicholas Wall of Old Mutual Global Investors, says the Fed wanted to get its balance sheet reduction underway before the committee is shaken up next year (possibly with a new Fed chair). The strong economy and loose financial conditions also gives the central bank confidence that the market will be able to handle the extra bond issuance. Rick Rieder of asset management giant BlackRock predicts the European Central Bank will slow the pace of its own stimulus programme soon (that\u2019s not the same as actually unwinding it, though) Back in the markets, investors now believe there\u2019s a 60% chance of a US interest rate rise in December, to 1.5%. That\u2019s up from 50% before today\u2019s announcement. And finally, a question that gets to the heart of the matter.... Q: Are you bothered that financial conditions are actually looser than before you raised interest rates four times? Yellen says the Federal Reserve has tightened policy since late 2015 because the US economy has been recovering, and the labor market has strengthened. There are risks on both sides to our objectives, she warns. Tighten too early, and we risk hurting the economy and keeping inflation permanently low. But wait too long, and we risk the economy overheating. That would ultimately force us to raise rates fast, leading to a recession. So the Fed is treading a careful path as we aim to hit our mandate, she concludes. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Reaction to follow..... Yellen expresses concern about the massive cyber attack at credit monitoring agency Equifax. She calls it a \u201cserious breach\u201d and urges Americans to carefully monitor their credit reports. Q: What would it take for the Fed to start QE again? Yellen gives a long answer, repeating that the Fed could potentially expand its balance sheet in future if there was a \u201cmaterial shock\u201d to the economy, meaning interest rate cuts weren\u2019t a strong enough responce. Perhaps significantly, she talks about how \u201cfuture policymakers\u201d will have to decide this issue. A hint that she doesn\u2019t expect to be renominated for a second term? Here\u2019s a video clip of Janet Yellen\u2019s (deservedly) stinging criticism of Wells Fargo: Q: Will you take action against Wells Fargo over its huge misselling scandal? Yellen roasts Wells Fargo, saying its actions are \u201cEgregious and unacceptable\u201d. The Fed is working very hard to understand the root causes of Well Fargo\u2019s problems, and decide the appropriate action. [Background: a year ago, we learned that Wells Fargo staff had created 1.5m deposit accounts and 565,000 credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent, to meet their sales targets] Q: Will there be operational problems when vice-chair Stanley Fischer steps down (early) next month? It will deprive the Federal Reserve of its quorum of four governors. Yellen pays tribute to Fischer\u2019s contribution to the Fed, saying she appreciated his \u201cwise council and friendship\u201d. She says the Fed can carry out its duties with only three governors, but hopes that Congress will approve some new appointees to the Fed board. Asked about financial regulation, Yellen says it\u2019s important that reforms put in place since the crisis stay put. She adds that regulations could be \u2018tailored\u2019 to avoid undue burden on the sector. Ah, the elephant in the room..... Q: Your current term expires in February 2018 - Have you discussed the situation with Donald Trump, or had any thoughts about your plans? Janet Yellen says she intends to serve her current tern, and will not comment on whether she wants to stays on beyond that. She has not had a further meeting with Trump, since one early meeting shortly after he became president. Refreshingly, Janet Yellen says the Fed doesn\u2019t know why inflation is below target this year. We need to \u201cfigures out\u201d if the factors are persistent of transitory, she adds. Here\u2019s Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, on the Fed\u2019s balance sheet reduction plan: As expected, the Fed has fleshed out its plans for reining in the size of its balance sheet. This has ballooned since the financial crisis on the back of America\u2019s massive quantitative easing stimulus programme. The balance sheet has expanded to $4.5trn since the financial crisis. The plan is to start reducing it from next month and to progressively accelerate the rate at which bonds are returned to the public market. The Fed hopes that by telegraphing its $1trn to $2trn taper, it can avoid unsettling bond and equity markets. Yellen reminds the press conference that the Fed has now raised interest rates four times in this cycle, and it still thinks the recovery is on a \u201cstrong track\u201d. Q: The Fed is locked into reducing its balance sheet, and raising interest rates in a gradual fashion. So what will you do if economic conditions don\u2019t turn out as you expect? Yellen denies that the Fed is \u2018locked in\u2019 to a particular path. We are assessing incoming data, and these plans are subject to change. What won\u2019t change, though, is our commitment to delivering price stability and full employment, she adds. Yellen says that the Fed could \u201cstop its balance sheet rolloff\u201d in future, if adjusting interest rates is \u201cinsufficient\u201d to respond to changes to the economic outlook. Q: Is the Fed concerned that markets are at, or close to, record highs? Yellen replies that it\u2019s not easy to see how asset prices will affect the economic outlook, but the Fed is \u201ctaking account of asset prices when setting monetary policy\u201d. Onto questions, and the first one is a zinger. Q: Why the Fed is unwinding its balance sheet when core inflation is consistently below target, and the unemployment rate for Black Americans is 8% (much higher than the 4.4% national average). Yellen replies that it is a \u201cconcern\u201d that inflation is below the 2% target. The Fed still believes it will rise, but will adjust policy if needed. Yellen repeats that the Fed\u2019s balance sheet will be shrunk gradually and predictably. It will start by cutting its holdings by up to $10bn per month this autumn; a small change designed to help the markets adjust. This cap will rise to $50bn per month by next autumn. But....she also flags up that the Fed could adjust its balance sheet in future, if circumstances demanded it. Policy is not on a preset cause, says Yellen - a reminder to the markets that events could yet force the Fed to chance course. On interest rates, Yellen says the Federal Fund Rate won\u2019t have to rise much further to get back to a \u2018neutral stance\u2019. Yellen warns that US economic growth in the current quarter will be hurt by the recent hurricanes that battered Florida and Texas (as well as the Caribbean). Inflation will also be pushed higher, temporarily, because gasoline has become pricier. However, this won\u2019t \u201cmaterially\u201d affect the long-term path of the economy, she adds. Yellen also expresses sympathy, on behalf of the Fed, for those who have suffered from Irma and Harvey. Over in Washington, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has sat down to face the press and explain today\u2019s decisions. She starts by predicting that the US economy \u201cwill continue to expand over the next few years\u201d, and that the Fed\u2019s accommodative monetary policy stance will help create more jobs. Yellen adds: We expect the job market will strengthen somewhat further\u2019 She says the Fed\u2019s balance sheet reduction plan will be gradual and predictable. What does \u2018reducing the Fed\u2019s balance sheet\u2019 mean in practice? Well... once the financial crisis stuck, the US central bank created more than a trillion of new dollars to buy American government debt, and bonds backed by mortgages. This chart, from Bloomberg, reminds us how the Fed unleashed three quantitative easing programme in an attempt to prop up growth, fight unemployment and keep inflation higher. So now, the Fed is planning to cut back, by cutting the amount of assets on its books. Those QE programmes drove asset prices to record levels, such as bond prices and equities. Kully Samra, UK managing director of Charles Schwab, warns that markets could wobble once the Fed\u2019s plan gets underway. Robust fundamental data and solid corporate earnings should allow the bull market to continue, but political, fiscal and monetary uncertainties still present risks. The Fed\u2019s announcement today to start unwinding the balance sheet has already been priced in by markets, but we continue to believe the Fed\u2019s \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d could be the cause of some heightened volatility, especially as the impact on the real economy remains largely unknown.\u201d Wall Street has reacted calmly to the news that the Fed will start unwinding its balance sheet in October. The main stock indices have dipped slightly, with the Dow down 0.25% and the S&amp;P 500 losing 0.1%. Cue the sarcasm: Skimming through the Fed statement, it appears that policymakers are still confident that the US economy is recovering. Here\u2019s a flavour: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. The dollar has jumped by 0.4%, reversing its weakness before the Fed\u2019s announcement. Traders are reacting to the news that the Fed still expects to raise interest rates once more this year, and three times in 2018. In the markets, the yield on short-term US debt has jumped, meaning bond prices have fallen. The Fed also flags up the damage suffered by hurricanes in recent weeks. It predicts inflation could push higher in the short term, but hopes the US economy will bounce back: Today\u2019s statement says: Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship. Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term. Importantly, some Fed committee members have become more dovish about the path of interest rates in 2018. The new Dot Plot (in yellow) shows that two hawkish policymakers have pulled their horns in (one was expecting rates to hit 3% next year!) There\u2019s also very little consensus about where rates will be in 2019.... Boom! The Fed says it will start shrinking its balance sheet in October. That means it will beginning the task of unwinding the stimulus it injected into the US economy once the financial crisis began. Breaking! The Federal Reserve has left interest rates unchanged at today\u2019s meeting, at up to 1.25%. Fed policymakers are also sticking with their prediction of one more rate hike this year. More to follow... The dollar is dipping slightly as traders brace for the Fed statement to hit the wires. This has pushed the pound up to $1.359, up 0.8% of a cent today. Oliver Jones of Capital Economics predicts that the Fed will sound more dovish about interest rates today. He suspects they will drop the notion of another rate hike in 2017, and push it into 2018. Jones writes: While the federal funds rate is almost certain to stay on hold on this occasion, updates to FOMC members\u2019 median forecasts \u2013 which are currently for one more rate hike this year and three further three hikes in 2018 \u2013 will be closely scrutinised as usual. Although we no longer expect the Fed to raise rates again in 2017, we are still expecting four rate hikes in 2018 as inflation rebounds. Wall Street is becalmed, with less than 30 minutes until the Fed announcement, which is followed by Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 2 points, or a measly 0.01%, having hit a record high last night. Do play along with Fed Bingo at home, or in the office. Fingers crossed, and seatbelts buckled, please.... Today\u2019s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is one of the most eagerly anticipated in a while. But what will Wall Street, the City, and investors around the world be looking for - and what will it mean for the rest of us? 1) Will the Fed raise interest rates today? Spoiler alert: this is seen as very unlikely. We\u2019ve already seen two US interest rate rises this year, and American inflation probably isn\u2019t bubbling away enough to justify a third today. 2) So when will rates go up? Previously, the Fed has predicted it will raise borrowing costs three times in 2017, and it has already hiked in March and June. Today, it will release a new Dot Plot, showing how policymakers expect borrowing costs to move. If they don\u2019t change 2017\u2019s dots, and they don\u2019t hike today, then a December hike would remain possible (but not certain). 3) Is it time to unwind the stimulus, and how? The big news from today\u2019s meeting will probably centre on the Fed\u2019s plans to normalise monetary policy and trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, including $2.5 trillion of US government debt. That balance sheet swelled during the Fed\u2019s various QE stimulus programmes, mopping up hundreds of billions of dollars of government and mortgage-backed bonds. Economists predict that the Fed will announce that it will start unwinding this programme. But it may be reluctant to move fast. One option is to stop buying new bonds when existing debt matures. The Fed is the first of the Big Four central banks to reach this point, so it is treading a path which the ECB, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England will hope to follow. 4) What\u2019s the hurricane damage? New economic forecasts will be released today, which may attempt to quantify the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. 5) Yellen\u2019s future in focus. Janet Yellen\u2019s first term as Fed chair ends in early 2018. Is she considering running again, or ruling herself out following criticism from Donald Trump? She recently breakfasted with the president\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka, so reporters will want to hear Yellen\u2019s thinking. 6) How do the markets take it? Investors seem remarkably relaxed about the prospect of QE being unwound, with markets at record highs. But might they have a change of heart when the deed is done? Loose monetary policy has driven asset prices higher for years, so withdrawing it could dent spirits.... World markets are hovering around new highs, with the MSCI All Country World Index up another 0.09% to 487.82. But overall investors are - mostly - sitting on their hands ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, due in just under two hours. The exception, as previously mentioned, is the Spanish market, which has been rattled by the tensions in Spain surrounding a proposed independence referendum for Catalonia. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 3.3 points or 0.05% at 7271.95 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.06% to 12,569.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.08% to 5241.66 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.31% to 22,355.58 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.83% lower at 10,292.1 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 0.64% to 757.98 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.1% at 22,392. Most European markets (and indeed the US as well) are treading water ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting. An exception is Spain, where the Ibex has dropped 1% after growing tensions over the proposed Catalonian independence referendum, with police arresting political officials in Barcelona. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With the exception of the IBEX 35, it has been an uninteresting day for European indices. Catalonia has been calling for a referendum on independence for some time, and the fragile state of the Spanish economy has exacerbated it. Spanish police have raided the headquarters of the Catalonian government and scenes of unrest on the back of this has weighed heavily on the Spanish market. The move by the Spanish authorities is likely to stoke independence calls, and this spooked investors. Ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting, here is ING Bank\u2019s crib sheet: Oil prices have been moving higher recently on hopes that Opec and its partners would extend their production cuts designed to deal with a global supply glut. Indeed, crude is on track for its biggest third quarter gain in 13 years. However they have now come off their best levels after the US Energy Information Administration reported a bigger than expected rise in crude stocks last week. Markets continue to drift ahead of the Fed meeting. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite effectively not moving after the bell the Dow Jones still managed to flirt with a fresh all-time high \u2013 that\u2019s just how consistent it has been in the last 3 weeks. Whether it can continue to build may be dependent on how the dollar reacts to September\u2019s statement from the Federal Reserve \u2013 which in turn could come to depend on a) how cautious Yellen and co. are in regards to reducing the $4.5 billion balance sheet, and b) what kind of (December) rate hike signals are sent out. For now, however, the greenback is sitting firmly on its hands. The dollar is down 0.3% against the pound, 0.1% against the yen and flat against the euro. Sterling is also up 0.2% against the euro, the currency receiving a bit of good news in the form of this morning\u2019s surprisingly strong UK retail sales reading. As for the European indices, sterling\u2019s strength is once again weighing on the FTSE, which slipped 0.2% as the day went on having risen 0.3% during the morning. In the Eurozone there wasn\u2019t a lot going on, with the CAC flat at 5225 and the DAX slipping below 12550 \u2013 if only just \u2013 following a 0.1% fall. More weak data from the US, with the effects of Hurricane Harvey starting to be felt. US existing home sales fell 1.7% to 5.35m units in August, down from 5.44m in July and the lowest level since this time last year, mainly due to a lack of supply. The National Association of Realtors said Harvey, which hit Texas in the last week of August, had seen helped push sales in Houston down 25% year on year. Without that decline, existing home sales would have been unchanged in August. Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said: Steady employment gains, slowly rising incomes and lower mortgage rates generated sustained buyer interest all summer long, but unfortunately, not more home sales. What\u2019s ailing the housing market and continues to weigh on overall sales is the inadequate levels of available inventory and the upward pressure it\u2019s putting on prices in several parts of the country. Sales have been unable to break out because there are simply not enough homes for sale. Some of the South region\u2019s decline in closings can be attributed to the devastation Hurricane Harvey caused to the greater Houston area. Sales will be impacted the rest of the year in Houston, as well as in the most severely affected areas in Florida from Hurricane Irma. However, nearly all of the lost activity will likely show up in 2018. Some deal news from Japan. Reuters reports: Toshiba Corp has agreed to sell its prized semiconductor business to a group led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, a key step in keeping the struggling Japanese conglomerate listed on the Tokyo exchange. Toshiba said it had signed a contract for the deal worth about 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the latest and perhaps final twist in a deal that only hours earlier had seen the company leading toward an agreement with its U.S. joint venture partner Western Digital Corp. The decision to sell the world\u2019s No. 2 producer of NAND memory chips... was made at a board meeting earlier in the day. Toshiba said the agreement assumed the deal would weather legal challenges raised by Western Digital. A Western Digital spokeswoman said the company did not have an immediate comment. US investors are in wait and see mode ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision and the press conference from chair Janet Yellen. But markets still remain at record levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 both edged up 0.01% at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.04%. If the US Federal Reserve is more hawkish than expected on interest rates and its balance sheet plans, then the US dollar could move sharply higher after its recent weakness, reckons Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com: In making their decisions, policymakers at the Fed are likely to take into account last month\u2019s sharper-than-expected rise in CPI inflation, and weigh this against somewhat softer macro pointers elsewhere in the economy. But with employment remaining healthy and inflation being so close to its target, the Fed may get the market ready for another rate rise in December and also provide a plan for balance sheet normalisation. In other words, the Fed may be more hawkish than dovish at this meeting. If so, we would expect the dollar to rip, especially against currencies where the central bank is still very dovish \u2013 for example, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. This outcome may also be modestly negative for the US stock markets. If the dollar rises and stocks fall, then gold\u2019s response may be relatively muted, although as a dollar-denominated commodity it too should fall. Obviously if the Fed comes across as more dovish than hawkish then one would expect the opposite reaction in these markets. After hitting record highs last night, Wall Street is expected to open calmly in 30 minutes time. That means the MSCI World stocks index remains at record levels, after fairly unspectacular sessions in Asia and Europe today. Investors are braced for today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting at 2pm East Coast time, followed by Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference. As explained earlier, the Fed isn\u2019t expected to raise interest rates today, but it will give new guidance about future rate hikes. Crucially, it is also expected to outline how, and when, it will start unwinding its huge stimulus programme. Investors are hoping that Fed chair Janet Yellen and colleagues will tread cautiously to avoid causing market upheaval. But are they too relaxed? Unravelling a $4.5 trillion balance sheet is no easy task; any gyrations in bond prices or the US dollar\u2019s value will have global ramifications, potentially triggering surges of capital around the world. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale, the French bank, says today\u2019s meeting will all be about BSN - balance sheet normalisation. Starting BSN if that\u2019s the right term, is a return to \u2018peace-time\u2019 policy before Janet Yellen departs (if she does). It\u2019s also an leap into relative unknown (never been done before) which is happening into a market which seems as relaxed as a teenager getting ready for a bungee jump. This market knows no fear. A thought for the day, as we await news from the Fed: There\u2019s drama in Russia today, as one of the country\u2019s largest banks seeks help. B&amp;N has sought a bailout from the central bank; making it the second bank to hit trouble in three weeks. The FT\u2019s Max Seddon has more details: B&amp;N Bank, Russia\u2019s 12th largest bank by assets, is one of three top privately held banks highly exposed to Otkritie \u2013 Russia\u2019s largest private lender until the central bank rescued it last month \u2013 through an informal group known as the \u201cGarden Ring.\u201d The central bank estimates Otkritie may have a balance sheet hole of up to 400bn rubles; senior Russian bankers say the final total may be twice that. Russia\u2019s central bank has confirmed it is in talks with B&amp;N\u2019s owners and will decide on a bailout in the near future. Reuters has an interesting line too.... B&amp;N Bank staff declined to comment outside its head office, three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Kremlin, while a truck belonging to a firm called Shredder Express, which offers mobile document shredding, was parked on a private road in front All this week, the Guardian has been turning a spotlight on the escalating problem of debt in the UK. Today, the boss of Britain\u2019s second-biggest doorstep lender, has told us about how illegal money lenders are targeting council estates, in search of vulnerable customers to sign up. Paul Smith, the chief executive of Morses Club, claims that people who have been turned down by official lenders are most at risk. \u201cLoan sharks live in the same block of flats that our customers live in, they live in the same council estates, they drink in the same pubs, they go to the same betting shops. You don\u2019t find a loan shark, a loan shark finds you. \u201cSo the typical approach would be at a school gate to a mother: \u2018I see your kid\u2019s toes are hanging out of their shoes, it breaks my heart. Can\u2019t you get a loan off Provident?\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I can\u2019t, I failed to pay up on the last one, I can\u2019t get another one.\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll lend you \u00a3500. Don\u2019t worry about when you have to give me it back, I\u2019ll pop around every week and you can just pay me\u2019 \u2013 but the repayments never cease.\u201d More here: A New York credit ratings agency set up after the financial crash by former private investigator Jules Kroll has shunned London for its European headquarters because of Brexit.

No\u00e9 said Dublin didn\u2019t have the cluster of talent that London has. So, he is \u201caggressively targeting Irish diaspora in London and New York, particularly people with Irish girlfriends or wives to see if they would come back home to Dublin.\u201d Asked if the soaring cost of housing - rental and sales - was a deterrent, he replied. \u201cThe cost of housing is not so much the issue, it\u2019s more people\u2019s families ties, as it is always in moving people from one country to another.\u201d This chart highlights how Britons spent more on non-food items in August, and also relied more on internet shopping and catalogues (non-store spending). Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management argues that this is an encouraging sign that consumers aren\u2019t \u201cdead and buried\u201d despite Brexit uncertainty. This is a promising sign for an industry that investors have shunned in recent months due to headwinds such as a rising minimum wage, and higher input costs in line with the Sterling fall. The pound is now moving in the right direction for importers, and moderate inflation could be coming into play - lessening competitive pressures and making it easier for these companies to absorb rising input costs. Notably the performance of non-store retailers is impressive, and demonstrates a continued trend towards online shopping, which in itself makes retailers more international, and less vulnerable to a weak pound. Here\u2019s Capital Economics\u2019 take: Credit Suisse has joined the ranks of City experts predicting that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in November, from 0.25% to 0.5%. But they add a proviso - such a rate hike would be a mistake. In a new report to clients today, Credit Suisse argues that the UK economy hasn\u2019t reached the point where monetary policy needs to be tightened. In their view, growth is too weak, especially as Brexit is creating \u201cshort-term political noise\u201d. They say: We think the BoE has misdiagnosed the amount of slack and growth potential in the UK economy. The hike is unlikely to have a profoundly negative impact on the economy, but there is a risk of a non-linear response to the first rate hike in ten years. A tighter response to an (entirely) externally driven inflation overshoot today runs the risk of a sustained inflation undershoot in the future. Jamie McGeever of Reuters also questions whether UK wages are really rising fast enough to justify a hike. Britain\u2019s economy will lag behind most international rivals next year, as the eurozone\u2019s recovery strengthens That\u2019s according to the OECD, which has just updated its economic forecasts. The good news is that the Paris-based thinktank sees Europe\u2019s economy catching up with America. In particular, it has hiked its forecast for Italian growth to 1.2%, from 0.8%. The OECD says: The upturn has become more synchronised across countries. Investment, employment and trade are expanding. But the bad news is that Britain\u2019s growth is expected to slow, from 1.6% in 2016 to just 1% in 2018. That would put the UK at the bottom of the G7 growth league! Here\u2019s our news story about the OECB forecasts: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, reckons UK shops benefitted because more people stayed at home this summer (as foreign holidays are rather pricier since the Brexit vote). He also believes that the first UK interest rate in a decade is imminent: \u201cIt is encouraging that retail sales proved resilient and bounced back in August. Anecdotal reports from retailers suggest that spending may have been helped by more \u201cstaycations\u201d in response to the weakness of the pound which pushes up the cost of overseas travel. \u201cThe underlying picture has not changed greatly, though. In the past three months, retail sales volumes were just over 2 percent up on a year ago - and the annual growth rate has been hovering around 2 percent for most of this year. This is substantially below the growth rate of around 4.5 percent recorded in the three years 2014 to 2016 when inflation was much lower. \u201cThese latest figures will give further encouragement to the Bank of England to follow up their recent statements on the need to raise interest rates. The first rise in UK interest rates for over a decade has now become even more likely - and we could see this happen at the next MPC meeting in November.\u201d Hold on a moment, though. The Bank of England\u2019s latest healthcheck on the UK economy suggests that consumers are cutting back. The BoE\u2019s latest Agents Survey, just released, suggests that cautious shoppers are cutting back, or buying cheaper items. Higher inflation, though, means they\u2019re having to pay more at the tills. The survey is based on interviews with around 700 companies across the UK. Here are the key points: Consumer spending growth had eased slightly further in values terms. Manufacturing output growth had risen again, with exports supported by the past fall in sterling. Investment intentions were consistent with modest growth in spending over the year ahead. Recruitment difficulties had edged higher and broadened slightly. Pay awards were clustered around 2%\u20133%. Consumer goods price inflation had picked up further, largely reflecting the effects of the past fall in sterling feeding through into retail prices. Consumer services price inflation had also edged higher Jake Trask, FX research director at OFX, reckons the jump in retail spending in August will encourage Britain\u2019s central bank to raise interest rates soon: \u201cFor the Bank of England, this data is yet more evidence that an interest rate hike is needed sooner rather than later, in an effort to get inflation back under control. Should CPI print 3% or higher in October, then we may see a rate hike as early as November, when the next quarterly Inflation Report is due. \u201cFormer Monetary Policy Committee doves, Andrew Haldane and Gertjan Vlieghe, have already indicated that they\u2019re close to switching sides, so the Bank will only need one other Committee member to join them before the rate can rise back to pre-Referendum levels.\u201d The acceleration in UK retail sales last month is surprising, given household incomes are being squeezed by inflation. It may show that people are borrowing more, warns Neil Wilson of ETX Capital: Economics journalist Dharshini David also flags this up: Economist Rupert Seggins points out that these monthly figures can be volatile... ...but the underlying picture is that people are still spending. UK retail sales have now risen for three months in a row, as this chart shows: Breaking! UK retail sales were much stronger than expected in August. The Office for National Statistics reports that retail sales jumped by 1.0% last month, beating City forecasts, and suggesting that consumers are still hitting the high street. The ONS says: In August 2017, the quantity bought (volume) in the retail sales industry increased by 1.0% compared with July 2017; with other non-food stores and non-store retailing as the main contributors to growth. Compared with August 2016, the quantity bought increased by 2.4%; the 52nd consecutive month of year-on-year increase in retail sales. Year-on-year contribution of food stores remains flat whilst there was a fall in the contribution of growth within petrol stations, showing that contributions to the overall growth came from non-essential items. This has sent the pound jumping over half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.3587, as traders calculate that this makes a November interest rate rise more likely. Reaction to follow.... Britain\u2019s small businesses don\u2019t share the sense of optimism in the markets. Confidence among UK firms has taken a tumble in the last three months, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. It\u2019s Small Business Index has dropped to just +1 this quarter, down from +15 in April-June, and near to the -3 seen after last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. Mike Cherry, FSB National Chairman, blamed economic factors: \u201cRising inflationary pressure and a weakening domestic economy are the twin drivers of plummeting confidence among small firms and consumers alike. There\u2019s big news in the steel industry this morning. Tata Steel has signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d with German steel manufacturer ThyssenKrupp to merge, creating Europe\u2019s second largest steel group. This ends uncertainty over the future of Tata\u2019s operations in the UK, including the Port Talbot steelworkers which was recently threatened with closure. But it\u2019s not all good news; Tata and ThyssenKrupp are already planning around 4,000 job cuts. The FT\u2019s Jonathan Eley sees further consolidation ahead: Unions have said they \u201ccautiously welcome\u201d the deal. Here\u2019s the full story: Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank fears that markets could react badly if the Federal Reserve announces that it will start unwinding its stimulus programme, and cut the size of its balance sheet. He argues that investors are simply too relaxed, given the risks of geopolitical instability around the globe: The big news event on 20 September will be the report of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee \u2013 we believe the central bank will finally announce plans to start selling its massive holding of bonds. This is likely to begin in October. Meanwhile, the Fed is unlikely to move interest rates. What does this mean for the US dollar? Possibly a shock. Markets are calm \u2013 too calm, really, like those western films where the sheriff rides into an empty town. Despite the tensions in North Korea and the Middle East, despite a see-sawing US president, despite implied volatility, willingness to take risks is historically unprecedented, which we know could end in tears. Markets continue to rationalize this, by seeing low inflation, solid growth and gradual central bank normalization. We\u2019re not so sure. A balance-sheet unloading could end the \u2018feel good\u2019 environment, sending both bond and stock markets southward. Asian markets remained calm today, despite Donald Trump\u2019s threat to \u2018totally destroy\u2019 North Korea. The South Korean won strengthened a little, shrugging off Trump\u2019s remarkable attack on \u2018rocket man\u2019 Kim Jong Un. European markets have also opened softly too, with the FTSE 100 gaining 9 points to 7283, and Germany\u2019s DAX pretty flat. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Despite myriad different macro-events fighting for attention \u2013 including a deadly earthquake in Mexico, the latest hurricane devastation in the Caribbean, Donald Trump\u2019s sabre-rattling speech at the UN and Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit boasting \u2013 the markets are only interested in one thing this Wednesday: September\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. World stock markets are at record highs as investors await tonight\u2019s Federal Reserve decision. The MSCI All Country World Index has nudged up to 487.66, up from 487.37 yesterday. That extends its recent run of record highs, as markets begin the autumn in good spirits. That follows another solid day\u2019s trading on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P both hit record highs. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Investors are buckling up for another Fed policy update which may contain news and/or hints about the timing of further policy tightening by way of balance sheet unwinding and the next rate hike. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe have one thing at the top of their agenda today - the Federal Reserve. America\u2019s top central bankers are meeting today to set monetary policy, and it could be a red letter day in the recovery from the financial crisis. The Fed is expected to take the historic move to start unwinding its massive stimulus programme, concluding that the US economy is strong enough to cope without a helping hand. \u201cMassive\u201d isn\u2019t an understatement. After the crisis began in 2008, the Fed bought tens of billions of dollars of government bonds each month, swelling its balance sheet to a mighty $4.5 trillion. It now has to decide how to unwind this money-printing programme without spooking the financial markets. The Fed is likely to tread carefully; it\u2019s not expected to raise interest rates today, for example. Policymakers will also indicate whether they expect borrowing costs to rise this year, and where they expect rates to peak in a few years, by using the Fed\u2019s famous Dot Plot. Here\u2019s the old dot plot (each blob shows where one Fed committee member expects rates to be each year). Today\u2019s arrangement of dots will be closely scrutinised, says Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: The element that investors are going to pay a lot of attention is the update on the dot plot. We expect the Fed to show more softer approach to the future interest rate hike. According to their last projection, the Fed expected seven rate hikes by the end of 2019. However, in the new forecast, the market is widely expecting them to drop one interest rate hike. The immediate question is whether the Fed still expects to make one more interest rise this year (assuming they don\u2019t hike tonight). The Fed will also release new economic forecasts, and could also talk about the impact which the hurricane season will have on US growth. The markets aren\u2019t really sure what to expect, so we\u2019re looking at a cautious day\u2019s trading until the Fed announcement comes at 7pm UK time, or 2pm in New York. The agenda: 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for August. They\u2019re expected to be flat month-on-month, having risen 0.5% in July. 10am BST: OECD publishes its latest global economic outlook. Will it repeat its warning of a Brexit slowdown in 2018? 7pm BST: Federal Reserve decision released. 7.30 BST: Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference",

Is she considering running again, or ruling herself out following criticism from Donald Trump?

In other words, the Fed may be more hawkish than dovish at this meeting.</p> <p>If so, we would expect the dollar to rip, especially against currencies where the central bank is still very dovish \u2013 for example, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. This outcome may also be modestly negative for the US stock markets. If the dollar rises and stocks fall, then gold\u2019s response may be relatively muted, although as a dollar-denominated commodity it too should fall.

      "bodyText": "If you find B&amp;Q\u2019s stores to be labyrinths for the unwary, stay away from the acronym-heavy financial statements of the parent company, Kingfisher. The group even has to provide a glossary, presumably for the benefit of readers whose concentration weakens at the umpteenth mention of the CPR , COGS and GNFR wonders being brought about by the ONE programme. ONE, oddly, doesn\u2019t stand for anything. It just indicates Kingfisher\u2019s ambition to run itself as a single company, rather than letting its nine European do-it-yourself businesses do their own thing. The promise from the chief executive, V\u00e9ronique Laury, is that, by 2021, unification will yield annual profits \u00a3500m better than BAU (business as usual, obvious). The City\u2019s stance in recent months has been: are you sure? Scepticism has flowed from the fact that Kingfisher seemed to confuse itself. The superficially simple plan to put near-identical ranges into chains in the UK, France, Poland, Spain and so on, yielded \u201cdisruption,\u201d meaning stock shortages, in year one of ONE. The better news in Wednesday\u2019s half-year update is that Laury is sticking to her forecasts, including the \u00a3500m. As for the idea aired by some City analysts that a break-up would be better for shareholders, it is not up for debate. Having got this far, it\u2019s probably fair to keep going. Recall, though, that it was as long ago as 2008 that Kingfisher launched its first unification programme. That effort evaporated, either because the group was distracted by heavy losses in China at the time, or because a top-to-bottom reorganisation of a company with 77,000 people in 10 countries is extremely difficult. One suspects the City will remain sceptical, and for good reason. Better-than-expected interim profits gives confidence that forecasts of \u00a3777m will be hit this year. But the promised \u00a3500m self-help gain implies a figure close to \u00a31.2bn after three further laps of the track. Really? In this slow market? Impressive if it happens, but the break-up lobby will become louder at the slightest WFD (whiff of further disruption). Tata Steel Europe and ThyssenKrupp: happy merger? It\u2019s hard to quibble with the commercial logic behind the proposed merger of ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel\u2019s European steel operations. The market, as everybody knows, is over supplied and under constant pressure from Chinese exports. Life ought to become modestly easier for both parties if they shelter under a single, but bigger, umbrella. Specifically, the duo can point to \u20ac400m-\u20ac600m (\u00a3353m-\u00a3530m) of annual savings from merging sales and administration, sharing research and development and streamlining distribution. About 4,000 jobs out of 48,000 will be lost. European competition regulators are hardly in a position to grumble about the continent\u2019s second and third largest players getting together. They, like everybody else, can see the effects of cheap Chinese imports. What\u2019s more, the combination would still be smaller than ArcelorMittal. UK unions, too, fresh from the fight to secure Tata\u2019s Port Talbot plant in south Wales, can also see the industrial sense. Everybody happy, then? Happier, maybe, but two long-term points needed to be recognised. First, whatever the partners say about their current harmonious approach, 50:50 joint ventures are tricky. Thyssen, for example, could come under pressure to get out altogether over time. A semi-detached owner is not ideal. Second, joint ventures make the politics messier. UK unions want assurances that ThyssenKrupp\u2019s pension liabilities will be ring-fenced \u201cwith a cast-iron guarantee that UK steelworkers will never fund German pensions\u201d. That seems a reasonable demand, especially in light of Tata\u2019s pension deal with UK regulators. Yet German unions are themselves regarding the merger suspiciously. International tensions could be the norm. There are three big plants here \u2013 Port Talbot in south Wales, Ijmuiden in the Netherlands and Duisburg in Germany. Current commitments to all three are being maintained, but internal competition for long-term investment will only intensify. Gentler winds in the steel industry would blow those problems away \u2013 but nobody is predicting that. Find the pilots, Ryanair It\u2019s one thing for Ryanair to say it has taken on extra customer service staff to manage the knock-on effects of cancelling 2,100 flights over the next six weeks. But its big long-term problem seems to be how to find more pilots, and how to keep them happy. As we report today, the crew are preparing to reject an offer of a cash bonus if they give up days off. That hostility suggests the origins of the crisis run deeper than a mess-up in rostering schedules.",

    "webTitle": "The great unwinding: Fed begins slow demise of its post-crash stimulus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve has announced it will begin the great unwinding of the gargantuan stimulus programme it began close to a decade ago in the teeth of the worst recession in living memory. As widely expected, the Fed voted to start reducing its portfolio starting in October, and kept interest rates at a range of 1% to 1.25%. The move, announced after a two-day meeting by Fed officials, will start the gradual reduction of the central bank\u2019s $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities, bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy. \u201cThe basic message here is that US economic performance has been good,\u201d Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference. The Fed\u2019s decision had been made because \u201cwe feel the US economy is performing well\u201d but she added the Fed could reverse course if conditions changed. Yellen, has said she is hopeful the unwinding will be as uneventful as \u201cwatching paint dry\u201d and the Fed plans to reduce its balance sheet in such a slow and steady manner that it will not affect the wider economy. Stock markets have continued to set new records despite Yellen\u2019s clear signals that the giant sell-off is coming and that interest rates are likely to continue their slow and steady climb back towards historical norms. But the sell-off is just as unprecedented as the massive stimulus programme that came before it and others have expressed skepticism that the unwinding will proceed as smoothly as Yellen has expressed. In June, JP Morgan Funds\u2019 chief global strategist, David Kelly, called Yellen\u2019s comments a \u201ctad complacent\u201d. Writing after Yellen\u2019s last press conference he praised Yellen\u2019s ability to fine-tune \u201cthe message the Fed is trying to convey and in deflecting political questions that she would do well to avoid\u201d. But he warned that her belief that the US economy was bouncing back from a slowdown in the first quarter may be too optimistic and that the reduction in the balance sheet, combined with rising interest rates, \u201cwill very likely push long-term interest rates higher over the next few years. While still low inflation should limit the back up in yields, it will likely feel a little worse than \u2018paint drying\u2019 for investors heavily allocated to the long end of the treasury market,\u201d he wrote. Former Fed chair Ben Bernanke started the giant stimulus programme, known as Quantitative Easing (QE), in 2008 after the financial crisis plunged the world economy into the worst recession since the Great Depression. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet of treasury securities and US-backed mortgage-related securities grew from about $800bn to $4.5tn as the central bank moved to stimulate economic growth by reducing longer-term interest rates, such as those for mortgages and corporate bonds. The programme has successfully kept interest rates down and US unemployment has fallen steadily from a peak of 10% in October 2009 to 4.4% in August this year. But while most economists see a clear link between low rates and record high stock markets the extent to which QE contributed to the fall in the unemployment rate is more controversial, and likely to remain so. Even one of the Fed\u2019s own economists has questioned the impact of QE. \u201cEvaluating the effects of monetary policy is difficult, even in the case of conventional interest rate policy,\u201d St Louis Fed economist Stephen D. Williamson wrote recently. \u201cWith respect to QE, there are good reasons to be skeptical that it works as advertised, and some economists have made a good case that QE is actually detrimental.\u201d The European Central Bank began a similar QE programme in March 2015 and is expected to continue the stimulus into 2019.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former owner of BHS has told a court he did not receive demands for information from the pensions watchdog as he was \u201coffshore on a boat\u201d. Dominic Chappell, who headed Retail Acquisitions which bought BHS for \u00a31 from Topshop entrepreneur Sir Philip Green about a year before the department store fell into administration, has been accused of failing to provide information to the pensions regulator. The regulator is investigating the sale of the retailer, which had a pension deficit of as much as \u00a3571m when it collapsed last year. In February, Green, a billionaire who owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to Chappell, agreed to hand over \u00a3363m to rescue the scheme in a deal with the regulator. It is attempting to get information from Chappell and is understood to be seeking as much as \u00a317m from Chappell and Retail Acquisitions in relation to the scheme. At Brighton magistrates court, Chappell pleaded not guilty to three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents without a reasonable excuse, contrary to the Pensions Act 2004. The 50-year-old initially told the court he had not seen the summons from the pensions regulator or any of the formal documentation. When asked why by district judge William Ashworth, Chappell replied: \u201cBecause I was away, I did not have internet access when I was away. I was offshore, on a boat.\u201d While he didn\u2019t give more details, a yacht owned by Chappell, Maverick 5, was entered in the Rolex Fastnet, the world\u2019s largest offshore yacht race, which ran from Cowes to the Fastnet Rock near Ireland from 6 August finishing in Plymouth on 10 August. Representing himself in court, Chappell said a copy of the summons had not arrived at his remote country home either. He told the court he was set to meet his lawyer on Tuesday but his representative was now \u201cout of the country dealing with family circumstances\u201d. Chappell asked for the hearing to be adjourned, but instead, the judge gave him some time to read the documents before entering his plea. He was sent a formal warning notice by the regulator in November in which it made clear it would use its legal powers to seek funds towards supporting the BHS pension scheme. He had six months to reply and set out his case after which a determinations panel, independent of the investigations team, should decide whether he had to make a contribution and how much it should be. The case has now been adjourned until a four-day hearing starting on 8 January. Pensions experts have warned that the legal battle could take years. Although the regulator can legally force Chappell to make a payment, he can take an appeal against such a decision to the supreme court.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s consumers continued spending after the summer sales, despite the steepest annual growth in non-food store prices in almost three decades. Growth in retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August after the Office for National Statistics revised the figure for July up to 0.6%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations for an increase of 0.2%. The pound leapt against the dollar on the figures, which add weight to a potential rate hike by the Bank of England for the first time in a decade. Spending in clothing stores continued, the ONS said, despite price increases after the end of the busy summer period, likely to be as a result of sales promotions ending. Footwear stores also fared well in the back-to-school shopping season. Kate Davies, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cWe are seeing strong price increases across all store types compared with a year ago, reflecting wider inflationary pressures. However, we are still seeing underlying growth in sales volumes, and with strong growth in non-essential purchases as consumers continued to buy more from non-food stores.\u201d British households are coming under sustained pressure from rising prices, putting a squeeze on living standards. The consumer price index measure of inflation rose to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. Wages are failing to keep pace, with a cut of 0.4% for real average earnings. Prices have soared as the pound dropped to its lowest levels since the mid-1980s in the aftermath of the Brexit vote last year, pushing up the cost of imports. The jump is particularly sharp in some areas, such as petrol, textiles, clothing and footwear. Non-food stores and online shops recorded their highest year-on-year price growth since March 1992, at 3.2% and 3.3% respectively. Still, consumers are continuing to spend, with these sectors driving the growth in retail sales in August, both in terms of value and volume. While wages are failing to keep pace with inflation, more people are in work than at any time since the mid 1970s. But there are fears households are using debt to keep on spending amid the squeeze. Stephen Boyle, chief economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \u201cWhile rising employment means more people are earning and can spend, that can\u2019t account for the growth in retail sales. Either we dipped into our savings or we borrowed more last month.\u201d The quantity bought within food stores remained flat on the month, whereas petrol stations showed increases in both the amount spent and quantity bought, at 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. Shoppers are increasingly heading online. Average weekly spending via the internet in August was \u00a31.1bn, an increase of 15.6% compared with the same month a year ago. Excluding automotive fuel, the amount bought by value accounted for 16.4% of all retail spending, up from 15% a year ago. However, economic and political conditions ahead for shoppers are far from ideal, which some economists expect will lead to a slowdown in spending. \u201cWe still expect growth in retail sales volumes to disappoint over the coming months,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s cancellation of thousands of flights across Europe due to a backlog of staff leave has raised alarm bells in Italy over its attempt to buy the troubled flag carrier Alitalia. The Irish airline, which has experienced huge growth in Italy and controls 24.3% of the market, compared with Alitalia\u2019s 17%, made a non-binding offer for its lossmaking rival in July. But the scrapping of 2,000 flights across Europe, 702 of these to and from Italy, between now and the end of October, has raised questions as to whether Ryanair would be capable of reviving Alitalia. With the sale of the airline likely to become a political sticking point as Italy prepares for a general election before May 2018, the transport minister, Graziano Delrio, said the impact of the cancellations was \u201cvery serious\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s caused a huge amount of inconvenience for Italians and we insist on the absolute respect for passengers\u2019 rights,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will monitor the situation, but we can\u2019t make allowances for such a huge amount of disruption.\u201d Last year, Delrio praised Ryanair after it announced plans to invest \u20ac883m (\u00a3783m) in Italy, creating 2,250 jobs and opening 44 new routes. Following an outcry from stranded passengers, Ryanair admitted on Tuesday that it had \u201cmessed up\u201d on the rostering of staff holidays, leading to a shortage of pilots. The airline said the cancellations were designed to improve punctuality, which fell below 80% in the first two weeks of September. But the move has left Italians, already frustrated by the turmoil at Alitalia, doubting the level of service that might be provided if Ryanair\u2019s takeover bid went through. Fabrizio Premuti, the president of the Italian consumers\u2019 association, Konsumer, told the Guardian: \u201cRyanair is a very important contributor to the Italian economy, but they have made a big mistake. \u201cThe shock that the airline has created has left people thinking that we will try to cure a sick flagship company with a medicine that will make it even worse.\u201d Alitalia, which was founded in 1946 and is one of Italy\u2019s biggest employers, went into administration in early May, with the government providing a bridging loan for about six months while a buyer is sought. The government has said there will be no bailout after previously spending about \u20ac7bn of state funds to keep it afloat. Ten companies are reported to have made non-binding offers. If no buyer is found, Alitalia will be wound up, leading to about 200,000 job losses. \u201cThose responsible for selling Alitalia will have to pay close attention and consider the best interests of the country and Italian citizens,\u201d Premuti said. \u201cWe need to find a way to ensure that Alitalia stays alive, but with all the guarantees. In this respect, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Ryanair will be able to ensure this.\u201d Andrea Giuricin, a transport expert at the thinktank Bruno Leoni, said Ryanair\u2019s treatment of staff could impact public opinion and how the Italian government handles the sale process. \u201cItaly has reacted very sensitively to the Ryanair announcement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut regarding the sale, I don\u2019t believe that Ryanair is all that interested in Alitalia. The two business models are completely different. It was perhaps using the process for publicity, which is typical of Ryanair.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Queensland government report has confirmed coal from Adani\u2019s Abbot Point contaminated nationally significant wetlands during Cyclone Debbie but there appeared to be \u201cno widespread impact\u201d. But Adani will be forced for the first time to monitor indefinitely the environmental health of the Caley Valley wetlands after the coal spill in March, when cyclonic rainfall overwhelmed the port\u2019s storage ponds. An Adani spokesman meanwhile said the company\u2019s decision to fight the environment department over a separate $12,900 fine for a floodwater breach at the port\u2019s oceanfront during the cyclone was about \u201cthe principle, not the amount\u201d. The Guardian understands Adani\u2019s decision to contest the fine raises the possibility of a court case in which environmental officials could lay further charges carrying a potential $1m fine if evidence of harm emerges. But the spokesman said the report released on Wednesday backed Adani in its stand that it had caused no environmental harm and \u201cwe have [further] evidence to prove that and we\u2019re happy to show that in court\u201d. \u201cWhy is a multibillion-dollar company worrying about a $12,900 fine? It\u2019s the principle, not the amount,\u201d he said. When asked why it was contesting a technical licence breach the company itself reported, the spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019ll fight that in court.\u201d A science department report found a coal concentration of 10% in sediment samples around the point where Adani released coal-laden floodwater into the wetlands in March. But the report, based on samples taken a month later, found \u201cno evidence of widespread contamination\u201d with the concentration dropping to 2% further away from the discharge point and less than 1% throughout the broader wetlands. The environment department also found that Adani did not breach its temporary release licence near the wetlands, with floodwaters containing 80mg per litre of suspended solids, under the 100mg per litre limit. The department launched an investigation in April after Mackay Conservation Group raised concerns about aerial imagery showing the blackened wetlands after the cyclone. Adani itself reported a breach at the oceanfront release point of more than eight times the coal levels allowed under its licence. The environment department said in a statement it had found \u201cvery little visual evidence of fine coal particles across the wetlands as a whole and it appears that, where fine coal particles have been observed, there have been no widespread impacts on the wetlands\u201d. In reference to the satellite pictures appearing to show contamination, the department said: \u201cThe appearance of water bodies in remotely sensed imagery can be affected by several factors, including the depth and clarity of the water, the angle of the sun and the sensor when the image is captured.\u201d An upshot of the science department report is an order by environmental officials that Adani for the first time monitors and reports indefinitely on conditions in the wetlands, not just compliance at its floodwater release point. The department on Monday gave Adani \u201cnotice to prepare an environmental evaluation\u201d that includes \u201cadditional monitoring and identification of any adverse impacts on the Caley Valley wetlands\u201d. The report identified \u201ckey information gaps\u201d including \u201clack of baseline sediment quality data\u201d that limited the interpretation of survey results. The environment department said it would \u201cconsider whether further action is required in line with the department\u2019s enforcement guidelines\u201d. Asked to confirm whether the ongoing investigation of environmental harm from the oceanfront coal spill could result in more charges being laid in court proceedings Adani itself had initiated, a departmental spokesman said he was unable to respond by deadline. While the report cast doubt on claims of \u201cmassive contamination\u201d, environmental groups contend it shows Adani cannot be trusted to run the port as an export hub for its Carmichael mine, the largest proposed thermal coalmine in Australia. The Australian Marine Conservation Society claims its own testing of water samples at the time found coal pollution significantly higher. Peter McCallum, a Mackay Conservation Group coordinator who visited the contamination site with environmental officials, said it was \u201cclear to me that there was coal everywhere we looked\u201d. \u201cAdani\u2019s stormwater handling facilities and environmental monitoring at its Abbot Point port are obviously inadequate. If the Carmichael mine is built and more coal moves through Adani\u2019s terminal, the risks of coal-related pollution will rise.\u201d But the Adani spokesman said the report \u201cshows there\u2019s been no environmental harm, as we\u2019ve said\u201d. The company agreed with the department on increased monitoring and \u201cin fact we\u2019ve already started doing that\u201d, he said.",

    "webTitle": "UK growth will trail Italy, France and Germany next year, says OECD", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Italy, France and Germany will grow faster than Britain next year as Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on consumer confidence and deter much-needed business investment, according to the latest economic forecasts by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The UK\u2019s GDP growth will drop from 1.6% this year to 1% next year, in line with the OECD\u2019s previous forecast, but Italy\u2019s national income will grow by 1.2% in 2018, up 0.4 percentage points from the forecast in the June. Germany and France were already on course to beat the UK with growth rates of 2.1% and 1.6% respectively in line with a bounce-back in activity across the eurozone. The OECD said: \u201cIn the United Kingdom, GDP growth has continued to slow with an easing of consumption and investment growth. A further slowing is expected in 2018, while uncertainty remains over the outcome of negotiations around Brexit.\u201d The forecasts put pressure on the chancellor Philip Hammond to lift the economy with a spending boost in his autumn budget on 22 November. Ministers are understood to be lobbying the Treasury for extra cash to offset planned cuts to services and to cover a wage rise for public sector workers. MPs are also concerned that private sector investment will be mothballed while Brexit talks continue, damaging the economy\u2019s long-term growth rate. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, who chairs parliament\u2019s treasury select committee, said: \u201cWe have been hearing for some time that business investment has been slowing down and today\u2019s OECD report bears that out and crystallises the fears that many of us had about Brexit dragging down our economy.\u201d Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: \u201cBrexit is set to turn Britain into the sick man of Europe again.\u201d Shadow chancellor John McDonnell urged the government to change course on the economy to prevent a slump in investment. He also highlighted the OECD warning that a bubble in the housing market remained a threat to the UK\u2019s financial stability, especially with an increase in interest rates by the Bank of England possible before the end of the year. The OECD said: \u201cBritain\u2019s labour market remained robust after a fall in unemployment to below 4.5% and record level of employment. But weak productivity and real wage growth persist. \u201cThe depreciation of the sterling has modestly improved export prospects but also pushed up inflation, dampening purchasing power and private consumption.\u201d It added: \u201cIn the United Kingdom, house prices are elevated relative to rents, raising financial stability risks if rising interest rates were to trigger a housing market correction.\u201d Japan, which has suffered from one of the slowest growth rates in the G7 for the past 25 years, will also see its GDP growth rate accelerate to a higher level than the UK\u2019s in 2018 after the Paris-based club for the world\u2019s richest countries revised its economic outlook for next year. The US and Canada will also enjoy strong growth in 2018, leaving the UK to sit at the bottom of the G7 growth league. Economists at the OECD were among many forecasters to predict a slump in Britain\u2019s fortunes following the referendum, but were forced to revise their thinking following a strong recovery in the second half of last year that sent the growth rate for 2016 to 1.8%. A slowdown in the first quarter of 2017 to 0.2% and 0.3% in the second appears to show that the slowdown was delayed. Global GDP growth is projected to increase to about 3.5% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018 from 3% in 2016, slightly improved since the organisation\u2019s last economic outlook. It said: \u201cThe recovery of business investment and trade remains weaker than needed to sustain healthy productivity growth. Wage growth has been disappointing, keeping inflation at low levels. Strong future growth in emerging market economies will depend on deeper reform. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cOur economy has grown continuously for four years and a record number of people are in work. \u201cThis is a strong record but we are not complacent. We must continue our focus on restoring productivity growth which is the only sustainable way to deliver higher wages and higher living standards for people across the country.\u201d The OECD said: \u201cThe upturn has become more synchronised across countries. Investment, employment and trade are expanding.\u201d However, it warned that \u201cstrong and sustained medium-term global growth is not yet secured\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bidders for UK stock market listed companies must lay out more detailed plans for their target, including location of its head office and research and development investment, under proposed rules put forward by the takeover watchdog and backed by the government. The new rules, which were published in a consultation document on Tuesday, also give companies, unions and other employee representatives more time to respond to bids in changes which follow the controversial \u00a3115bn attempted takeover of Unilever by Kraft Heinz earlier this year. Ahead of the general election in June, the Conservatives promised that deals driven by \u201caggressive asset-stripping or tax avoidance\u201d would no longer be welcome. Theresa May vowed that bidders would have to be clear about their intentions, and their promises will have to be legally binding. Her pledge came after unions voiced fears over the 9,000 jobs in Britain that could have been affected by the Unilever deal, with Unite calling for a change to takeover rules that would take more account of employees. Unilever chief executive Paul Polman argued that defending companies needed more time to audit detailed cost-savings set out by their potential owners. The acquisition of Cambridge-based technology firm ARM by Japan\u2019s SoftBank last year also highlighted concerns over the loss of important British technology assets to overseas buyers. Under pressure from the UK government, the Japanese bidder eventually made legal commitments to keep ARM\u2019s headquarters in Cambridge and at least double the UK workforce in the next five years. Greg Clark, the business secretary, welcomed what he called \u201cvaluable changes\u201d proposed by the Takeover Panel which he said would \u201cgive companies subject to a bid more time to prepare their response\u201d. He also pledged to publish proposals this autumn that address the national security concerns that can arise from foreign investment. He said these would \u201cset out further measures to safeguard national security, while ensuring the UK remains a global champion of free trade and investment\u201d. Under rules introduced in 2011 after the much-criticised takeover of Cadbury by Kraft, which resulted in a factory being closed despite promises to the contrary, bidders must already make clear their plans for the target business, its employees and pension scheme. But bidders\u2019 statements under that rule have often been vague and sometimes misleading, so the panel now wants more specific information on the location and function of a company\u2019s headquarters, plans for research and development and any material changes to the conditions of employment or the balance of skills and functions among management and employees, or redeployment of fixed assets. A statement of these intentions must be made at the time a bidder announces a firm offer to shareholders and any later changes made clear. The new rules stop short of demanding that all plans announced must be legally binding. However, the bidder must say if its plans are merely intentions or a firm undertaking, which it would then have to confirm to had taken place within 12 months of the deal being finalised. Previously the detail of plans for a company being taken over could be delayed until the offer document was posted, potentially 28 days after the formal bid was made. The offer document and intensions of the future for employees, might alternatively have been published on the same day as the formal offer, giving only two weeks for unions or target companies to put forward their views on the deal within a circular which must be sent to shareholders under a set Takeover Panel timetable. Under new rules the offer document cannot be posted until two weeks after the firm offer, unless otherwise agreed by the target company, giving more time for board directors and unions to respond. \u201cWhat the panel is doing is forcing bidders to crystallise and reveal their plans in greater detail earlier in the process, when they commit to a deal,\u201d said Oliver Lazenby, an expert in corporate law at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. \u201cThe panel would say that any considered bidder would have thought about those things anyway and it shouldn\u2019t be a huge inconvenience to include them in a public statement. But it could be argued this is adding further to the burden on bidders particularly in takeovers of distressed companies.\u201d Unite national officer Rhys McCarthy said: \u201cThis is a step in the right direction, but it doesn\u2019t go far enough to address the UK\u2019s woeful takeover rules where the overriding factor is usually how much money can be thrown at shareholders rather than other considerations such as the national interest, jobs and communities.\u201d The Takeover Panel said comments on the planned changes should be filed by 31 October.",

      "bodyText": "India\u2019s Tata Steel has paved the way for a merger of its European operations with the German steel manufacturer ThyssenKrupp, creating Europe\u2019s second largest steel group after ArcelorMittal. Tata said the two companies had signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d to create a 50/50 joint venture based in Amsterdam, with an annual turnover of about \u20ac15bn (\u00a313.3bn), 48,000 employees, and annual shipments of about 21m tonnes of flat steel. The two companies have been in talks to combine their European operations since Tata abandoned plans to sell its UK steel business last year, safeguarding the immediate future of the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. A major hurdle to the merger was removed last month, when Tata reached an agreement over its \u00a315bn pension scheme. The tie-up is expected to result in about 4,000 job losses, split between the two companies and affecting both administrative and manufacturing roles. Tata and ThyssenKrupp expect to make annual cost savings of between \u20ac400m and \u20ac600m by combining their sales and administrative functions, research and development, and procurement and logistics. Roy Rickhuss, chairman of the coordinating committee representing the Unite, GMB and Community unions, said: \u201cThe steel trade unions cautiously welcome this news and recognise the industrial logic of such a partnership. This would create the second biggest steel business in Europe, which could deliver significant benefits for the UK. \u201cAs always, the devil will be in the detail and we are seeking further assurances on jobs, investment and future production across the UK operations. As a priority, we will be pressing Tata to demonstrate their long-term commitment to steelmaking in the UK by confirming they will invest in the reline of Port Talbot\u2019s blast furnace No 5.\u201d The business secretary, Greg Clark, said it was an \u201cimportant step\u201d for the future of Port Talbot. \u201cThe government has been working hard with the unions to secure a sustainable future for Tata Steel in the UK, its 4,000 employees at the Port Talbot site and its supply chain. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp is an important next step in establishing their shared ambition for Port Talbot as a world-class steel manufacturer, with a focus on quality, technology and innovation.\u201d The joint venture will be named ThyssenKrupp Tata Steel and is expected to be up and running in late 2018, following further negotiations, due diligence, and subject to approval from relevant authorities and shareholders. \u201cUnder the planned joint venture, we are giving the European steel activities of ThyssenKrupp and Tata a lasting future. We are tackling the structural challenges of the European steel industry and creating a strong No 2,\u201d said Heinrich Hiesinger, chief executive of ThyssenKrupp. ThyssenKrupp said the combined companies would start to review their production network in 2020, to identify further savings and integration opportunities. The German company added that the outcome of the Brexit negotiations would have a bearing on decisions. \u201cThe scope for optimisation also depends on numerous external factors such as the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the implications that follow,\u201d it said. In a separate development, Frank Field, the Labour MP and chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions committee, has written to the pensions regulator asking for assurances that the new pension arrangements for Tata Steel workers are adequately funded in the long term, and that members can be certain they will receive the reduced benefits that they are now being promised.",
