The pet business is thriving and is resilient \u201cacross economic cycles\u201d, according to the company\u2019s filing. Pet ownership in the US climbed to 63.8m households in 2014, up from 61.2m in 2010. And even as most Americans were affected by the recession, there was apparently one area where they were not cutting costs: their pets. \u201cSpending on pets has consistently increased, even during the last recession, and is projected to reach $76.6bn in 2015, up from $62.7bn in 2010 and $47.2bn in 2005, with average household spending of approximately $1,150 per year at the end of 2014,\u201d according to Petco\u2019s filing. This boost in spending is all due to \u201cpassionate and loyal pet parents\u201d who view their pets as family, explained Petco. The company pointed to a survey that found 87% of dog owners and 82% of cat owners considered their pet a member of their family. Additionally, a majority of pet owners believed that pets have a positive impact on their physical and mental health. The caring pet parents are looking out for their pet children by buying natural (read: organic) food, which often comes with a higher price tag driving up the sales. Many of these pet parents, who like to splurge on furry members of the family, are millennials. \u201cPet ownership among the technology savvy millennial generation (age 18 to 29) was 59% of households in 2014 compared to 50% of households in 2010,\u201d according to Petco. \u201cMillennials have higher average intended pet spend compared to baby boomers (age 50 to 68), with 76% of millennials indicating that they would splurge on certain items for pets compared to 50% of boomers.\u201d Since millennials like to shop for their pets online, Petco plans to link stores, web and mobile in an integrated digital platform. As of June, the company estimates that it is responsible for about 16% of the total US pet specialty chain and independent retail market share. Petco, which is based in San Diego, hopes to raise $100m. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith and JP Morgan are among the IPO\u2019s underwriters. Petco went private in 2006 after a $1.8bn leveraged buyout by TPG Capital and Leonard Green.",

      "bodyText": "A company\u2019s reputation is precious. Once lost, it is mightily hard to recover. Think Gerald Ratner, who once famously described the jewellery he was selling as \u201ccrap\u201d. Think BP after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Or G4S, which seemed to have trouble preventing prisoners from escaping and bungled the Olympics security contract. As a result, it is easy to see why Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive, thought it necessary to respond speedily to a piece in the New York Times that claimed the company he founded was guilty of cruel employment practices. This was no ordinary expos\u00e9: the NYT piece ran to more than 5,000 words and was based on more than 100 interviews. It claimed one woman returning to work after treatment for thyroid cancer was given a poor staff review, and told the company was more productive without her. \u201cI don\u2019t recognise this Amazon,\u201d said Bezos in an email to staff, \u201cand I hope you don\u2019t either.\u201d This is not saying that the NYT is wrong, merely that Bezos has no personal knowledge of such cases. It is the sort of language politicians use when they want to give the impression that something is untrue when they suspect or know full well it isn\u2019t. Amazon is a retailing phenomenon with revenues of almost $90bn (\u00a358bn) last year. Its soaring share price has made Bezos a wealthy man, even though massive investment in new capacity means it struggles to make a profit. The NYT allegations pose two distinct threats to that continued success. One is that consumers decide the company is tainted and take their business elsewhere, even if it costs them extra to do so. The second is that Amazon finds it hard to recruit and hold on to staff. Modern management theory suggests that happy workers are more productive workers. In his email, Bezos invited staff to quit if they were unhappy. \u201cI strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company.\u201d What he should be doing is inviting them to form a trade union. Rarely can the case for organised labour have been made more powerfully than in the claims of bad management practice catalogued by the NYT. Private sector unions are an endangered species in the US but it is worth remembering that they were originally formed as a response to exploitation by 19th century mill owners. In the stories of Amazon keeping a cowed workforce under the lash with non-stop pressure, bullying and psychological warfare, Bezos is the 21st century equivalent. Europe must learn lessons from Japan It is the Asian powerhouse that has become the workshop of the world. It is the country that has moved the world\u2019s centre of economic gravity to the east. It is the nation that the US sees as its biggest rival and threat. China in 2015? No, Japan in the late 1980s, when its stock market was booming. It was a time when the real estate value of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was said to be greater than the whole of California, and a quarter of a century of stagnation and on-off deflation was still in the future. Japan\u2019s latest growth figures were poor. The economy contracted by 0.4% in the second quarter and Abenomics \u2013 the three-arrow policy named after prime minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 is failing. Attempts to boost exports through a cheaper yen are being blunted by currency depreciations elsewhere. Consumer spending is held back by fears of VAT increases to come. Further quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan in an attempt to boost activity looks highly likely this autumn. There are lessons for both China and the west in Japan\u2019s quarter century in the economic doldrums. The lesson for China is that the good times can end quickly. In the second half of the 1980s, Japan was growing at an average rate of 5%. The model was based on building up industrial capacity and exports. An overabundance of debt fuelled a stock market and property boom that generated juicy returns for an ageing population. Sound familiar? It should. China\u2019s growth is slowing. It has far too many unprofitable factories. It is struggling to prevent share prices from collapsing. It is ripe for a crash. The lesson for the west is that economic torpor can be prolonged by overhasty policy tightening and by a failure to clean up the banking system. At various times after Japan\u2019s economy hit the wall in 1990, policymakers in Tokyo used tentative evidence that things were improving to raise interest rates and push up taxes. On every occasion, the result was to halt recovery and push the economy back into deflation. So far, the US has avoided going Japanese. Washington has not been saddled with zombie banks that are alive but incapable of lending, and it has given growth a higher priority than deficit reduction. Europe has been slower to learn the lessons and has suffered as a consequence.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "QVC, the television shopping channel, has bought the mom-focused online retailer Zulily for $2.4bn. Zulily is a \u201cflash-sale\u201d retailer that sells toys, onesies, lotions and women\u2019s apparel at a steep discount from traditional retail pricing for a brief time, then it\u2019s gone. A Fast Company profile of the company from earlier this year described the appearance of its offices as looking \u201clike the world\u2019s nicest Crate &amp; Barrel swallowed a pediatrician\u2019s office\u201d. QVC, part of John Malone\u2019s Liberty Interactive, is so often the target of parody that it\u2019s easy to forget how profitable the shop-from-your-couch network is: it made $8.8bn last year and its airtime is coveted real estate for eager retailers. The six-minute segments (simulcast on YouTube), during which interested viewers call in to buy the items being displayed, can generate tens of thousands of dollars in sales and generate exposure to the huge daytime TV audience in the US for a wannabe mogul\u2019s jewelry or fashion designs. Zulily has been something of a distressed asset in recent months: the stock was downgraded by Goldman Sachs in July from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d on fears that the company\u2019s user base was getting tired of the service and leaving it behind at rates that couldn\u2019t sustain the company\u2019s growth. Still, Goldman estimated that the company has some 2.8 million active customers. The company started off very strong, with four rounds of funding including a series D of $85bn led by blue-chip Silicon Valley investor Andreessen Horowitz. Founded in 2010, Zulily went public in November 2013 and its stock surged 71% on the first day of trading and reached a peak market cap of $7bn the following February.

      "bodyText": "Airbus has finalised a record $26.6bn (\u00a317bn) deal to sell 250 A320neo planes to an Indian budget airline in a boost for engineers working for the European aerospace group in the UK. The deal with no-frills carrier IndiGo, which confirms an earlier provisional order for the planes, is the single-largest order for Airbus. The wings for Airbus\u2019s A320 planes will be made at Broughton in north Wales, before being sent on to aircraft production lines in Hamburg, Toulouse or China. The company employs 16,000 people in the UK and produces 1,000 aircraft wings a year at the Broughton plant. The aerospace industry is worth about \u00a324bn a year to the UK economy and it is seen by the government \u2013 along with the automotive sector \u2013 as a poster child for British manufacturing. However, Airbus has warned recently that a British exit from the EU could threaten the presence of the Franco-German group in the UK. Speaking in May, the UK head of Airbus, Paul Kahn, said: \u201cIf, after an exit from the European Union, economic conditions in Britain were less favourable for business than in other parts of Europe, or beyond, would Airbus reconsider future investment in the UK? Yes, absolutely.\u201d The latest deal extends the lead of Airbus in the most lucrative market in commercial aerospace, for narrow-body planes, where it is pitched against US rival Boeing. The A320 family of planes, which includes the A320neo, the latest, most fuel-efficient model, are the most popular single-aisle aircraft in the world, with more than 11,800 orders to date and 6,600 aircraft delivered to 400 different airlines. The plane competes against Boeing\u2019s 737 and upgraded 737Max. The US company has had 2,831 orders for is 737 Max plane, while Airbus has received more than 4,100 orders for the A320neo, including the latest IndiGo deal. \u201cIt fills us with pride that IndiGo, India\u2019s largest airline and one of the early launch customers for the A320neo, is coming back for more of our benchmark aircraft,\u201d said John Leahy, Airbus\u2019s chief operating officer. IndiGo is India\u2019s largest airline by market share and was founded in 2006 by entrepreneur Rahul Bhatia and former US Airways chief executive Rakesh Gangwal. The airline is growing rapidly on the back of demand for air travel in India, as millions take to the skies for the first time. India\u2019s air travel market is forecast by the International Air Transport Association to become the third largest in the world by 2031, as well-established air travel markets in the US and Europe give way to the Middle East and Asia. Manufacturing plans at Airbus have reflected that shift in demand, with Airbus signing a deal for its second factory in China last month. It already operates an A320 assembly line in the city of Tianjin. IndiGo\u2019s A320neo planes will take off from 2018, with Airbus expected to deliver the planes between 2018-2026. The deal makes IndiGo the largest customer for the A320 family of aircraft.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An unexpectedly weak US manufacturing figure for New York sent a mini-shock through markets on an otherwise relatively quiet day. But shares soon recovered their poise, as investors awaited the week\u2019s key vote on the Greece bailout in the German parliament, as well as a possible vote of confidence by Syriza which could lead to new elections as early as next month. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down 0.44 points or 0.01% at 6550.30 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.41% to 10,940.33 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.57% at 4984.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.69% to 23,407.99 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.19% better at 10,900.3 As previously reported, the Athens marked edged up 1.04% at 680.94 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 39 points or 0.23%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. A survey in Germany seems to show people are not overly thrilled with the agreement with Greece: Greece\u2019s stock market has ended the day higher although banking shares are still under the cosh. The Athens index is up 1.04% at 680.94, but the banking index has dropped 8.67% as concerns about recapitalisation continue. Piraeus Bank is down 13.61% while Eurobank Ergasias has fallen 12.12%. Here\u2019s our report on the latest comments from Yanis Varoufakis, who has once more attacked the bailout proposals: Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has accused European leaders of allowing oligarchs to maintain their stranglehold on Greek society while punishing ordinary people in a line-by-line critique of the country\u2019s \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) bailout deal. Varoufakis said the Greek parliament had pushed through an agreement with international creditors that would allow oligarchs, who dominate sections of the economy, to generate huge profits and continue to avoid paying taxes. The outspoken economist published an annotated version of the deal memorandum on his website on Monday, arguing throughout the 62-page document that most of the measures imposed on Greece would make the country\u2019s dire economic situation worse. The full story is here: Some talk about a possible Greek election date: Back with the US and some strong housing figures. US housebuilder sentiment rose to its highest level in nearly a decade, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Its market index rose from 60 in July to 61, in line with expectations and the highest since a matching reading in November 2005. The association\u2019s chief executive David Crowe said: Today\u2019s report is consistent with our forecast for a gradual strengthening of the single-family housing sector in 2015. Job and economic gains should keep the market moving forward at a modest pace throughout the rest of the year. The better news has helped markets recover some of their poise after falling back sharply in the wake of poor New York manufacturing figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down just 2 points, the FTSE 100 is 7 points lower and Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 79 points. Here are the reported terms of the ESM financing assistance for Greece, as revealed by Bild\u2019s Dirk Hoeren: Here are the falls on the Dow: Wall Street has opened sharply lower, predictably. With oil still around six-year lows and the poor New York state manufacturing figures pointing to a slowdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 123 points or 0.7% in early trading. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin raising interest rates this year, perhaps as soon as the September meeting, but such a move would cause concern if the world\u2019s biggest economy is starting to splutter. Best not to pay too much attention to this US data, reckons Rob Carnell at ING (although it being a quiet August day, markets already have of course): The latest Empire manufacturing survey is a good reminder of why we don\u2019t pay much attention to regional activity surveys \u2013 to be charitable, they are a bit choppy. In this case, the Empire survey fell from a moderate reading of 3.86, to -14.92. And you have to go right back to 2009 and the heart of the financial crisis to find anything this bad. For what it is worth, and in our opinion, it is not a lot, the new orders and shipments series utterly collapsed this month. Inventories, which had been heading down, fell further, as did the average workweek (in complete contrast to the last labour market report). Interestingly, despite this apparently dismal; backdrop, although the index of employees fell slightly, it remained positive. Odder still, the outlook for six-months\u2019 time improved to 33.64 from 27.04, with new orders and shipments then expected to be strong or picking up. We doubt there is much merit in these expectations either. There will be a bunch of other regional activity surveys out in the coming weeks. Even when they all point in the same direction, this need not give the correct steer for the national ISM survey, or for the strength of national manufacturing. But this is a quiet week, so markets may give this more attention than it deserves. Oh dear. A key survey of the US manufacturing sector has just hit its lowest level since the great recession, and markets aren\u2019t happy. The Empire State index, which tracks factory activity in the New York area, slumped to -14.92, from +4.75 in July. That\u2019s the weakest reading since November 2009, with manufacturers reporting a slump in new orders and deteriorating economic conditions. The reading has hit European stock markets, as it raises new concerns over the strength of the US recovery at a time when the Fed is (maybe) close to raising interest rates. The FTSE 100 is now down 35 points, or 0.5%, at 6530, and the German DAX is also dropping into the red.... Back in Greece, health minister Panagiotis Kouroumblis has predicted that autumn elections could be needed, Reuters reports. Kouroumblis told Skai TV that it would give the government the authority needed to implement the plan: \u201cElections are not the best choice ... but for the economy to pick up there must be political stability. To implement such a serious programme with painful measures, you cannot do that without a popular mandate.\u201d Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis agrees that a confidence vote could quickly lead to elections (as explained earlier): Angela Merkel is now attending a Christian Democrats party board meeting today; another chance to shore up support ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Greek bailout vote. Merkel\u2019s grand coalition has 504 out of the 631 seats in the Bundestag. Thus, she can cope even if 120 MPs do defy her, as Bild reckons today. CDU/CSU MPs will take their lead from Wolfgang Schauble as much as Merkel herself, argues Carsten Nickel of Teneo Intelligence. He writes: What counts in the Bundestag (much more than the IMF), meanwhile, is the endorsement of Germany\u2019s most popular politician, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who single-handedly guarantees support from a number of sceptics within CDU/CSU. His support voiced in Greece-sceptic tabloid Bild am Sonntag is the cornerstone for yet another unsurprising result this Wednesday. Finally, some economic data. And the latest survey of eurozone trade suggests that the weaker euro is helping exporters. The eurozone\u2019s trade surplus jumped to \u20ac26.4bn in June, according to Eurostat, up from \u20ac16.0bn a year earlier. Exports were 12% higher than in June 2014, at \u20ac182.7, while imports rose just 7% year-on-year to \u20ac156.4bn. Imports have been lagging exports since the eurozone debt crisis began, as demand waned in the face of austerity and recession. One of Angela Merkel\u2019s close allies, Michael Fuchs, says he hasn\u2019t decided whether he\u2019ll support the Greek bailout in Wednesday\u2019s vote. The crucial issue, Fuchs told Bloomberg TV, is whether the International Monetary Fund will definitely be involved in the deal: The IMF won\u2019t make that decision until October, though, so German MPs may have to trust their chancellor when she says the Fund will come on side. Greece\u2019s third bailout has cleared one hurdle this morning by being approved by the Lithuanian cabinet, according to the Baltic News Service. Angela Merkel could suffer the biggest rebellion of her career as chancellor, when the Bundestag votes on the Greek bailout deal. German tabloid Bild reckons that 120 CDU/CSU MPs could oppose the plan, twice as many as broke ranks at an earlier vote in July. That explains why Merkel took part in last night\u2019s TV interview, to short up support ahead of Wednesday\u2019s vote. Another Syriza rebel, former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, has been hard at work critiquing the bailout deal. Spoiler alert: he\u2019s not a fan. Over 55 pages (plus appendices), the economics professor outlines why he fought against such a deal. Varoufakis fears it will merely further fuel Greece\u2019s \u201csix year old debt-deflationary cycle\u201d, with impossible growth targets and unachievable measures: Greek bank stocks are rallying this morning, on relief that eurozone finance ministers agreed to the bailout deal on Friday night. The ATG index is up by 1.5% in early trading in Athens, with financial shares gaining 5%. Two Syriza MPs who rebelled last week have warned that the party cannot rally around the bailout deal. Thanasis Petrakos told the Mega TV channel that: We do not intend to overthrow the government, but rather get it off the bailout course. And Stathis Leoutsakos took a similar line on Skai TV, warning that: \u201cThe bailout cannot be the programme of Syriza, it falls outside its values, these are incompatible notions.\u201d If their allies take a similar view, Greece could be heading into early elections this autumn. A glance at last Friday\u2019s vote on the bailout deal shows that Alexis Tsipras is far from certain to win a confidence vote. Although 222 MPs (out of 300) backed the plan, almost half of those came from opposition parties such as the right-wing New Democracy, centrist To Potami and left-wing Pasok. Just 118 government MPs voted in favour. Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party holds 149 seats, while its coalition partner ANEL holds 13. Yesterday, Pasok announced it would not support the government in a confidence vote, echoing New Democracy\u2019s position. Pasok said: \u201cThe government has signed the third and most onerous bailout. All the negative consequences for the country and its citizens bear the signatures of Mr Tsipras and [ANEL leader] Mr Kammenos. We have no confidence in the Tsipras-Kammenos government and of course will not give it if we are asked.\u201d Greece\u2019s energy minister also hinted this morning that the country could \u201cgo to elections soon\u201d, in as little as three or four weeks. And if that happens, Alexis Tsipras would be pushing for an outright majority, Panos Skourletis told Skai TV: \u201cBased on my feeling of how things stand... I think such a goal is attainable,\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) A Greek government minister has dropped a clear hint that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will call a confidence vote in the coming days. Energy minister Panos Skourletis predicted this morning that the rebellion among government MPs over the third bailout will force Tsipras to test his authority in parliament. Skourletis told Skai TV that: I consider it self-evident after the deep wound in Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group for there to be such a move [a confidence vote]. Tsipras had to rely on opposition parties to get support for the bailout plan in a vote last Friday; 32 Syriza MPs voted against it, and another 11 abstained. A confidence vote could trigger early elections this autumn, giving Tsipras the opportunity to reshape his party and win a new mandate. But it would also obstruct efforts to agree the debt relief measures demanded by both Athens and the IMF.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be fighting off the August lull today, I fear, as policymakers and traders take a summer breather after a fairly turbulent 2015. On the agenda..... 1) Greece. European national parliaments will be asked to approve the country\u2019s third bailout this week, after it was signed off by finance ministers on Friday night. Wednesday\u2019s vote in the Bundestag could be critical, given German concern over this latest loan. Angela Merkel (back from her hols) has already tried to stem dissent, telling a TV interview last night that she has no doubt that the IMF will play a role. But for that to happen, debt relief will be needed - something that will play badly with many of Merkel\u2019s own MPs. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, senses trouble ahead.... 2) China. Investors are edgy after last week\u2019s shock yuan devaluations, which sent ripples through global markets. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The events in China were a timely reminder to investors that all may not be well with the world\u2019s second largest economy, as the authorities attempt to reinvigorate a flagging economy, at a time when economic data in some of its key export markets are also showing signs of flagging. Currency markets in particular will be looking for signs of further weakness in the Chinese currency given the comments by the Chinese central bank at the weekend, which warned markets to expect further two way volatility in the coming weeks. While Chinese authorities aren\u2019t likely to openly admit they want a slightly weaker currency, last week\u2019s actions saw the die cast and it seems improbable that the yuan won\u2019t slowly weaken in the coming weeks, and in the process exercise further downward pressure on global inflation. Some Asian markets have dipped overnight, as they await Beijing\u2019s next move: European markets are expected to rally a little, though, partly on relief that Greece has secured its third bailout - even though implementing the tough measures demanded by creditors will be tough. Here\u2019s IG\u2019s opening calls: FTSE 100: 6586 +36 points German DAX: 11057, +72 French CAC: 4985 +29, Spanish IBEX: 10951, +72 Italian FTSE MIB: 23407, +159 I\u2019ll be tracking all the action (such as there is) through the day....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has accused European leaders of allowing oligarchs to maintain their stranglehold on Greek society while punishing ordinary people in a line-by-line critique of the country\u2019s \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) bailout deal. Varoufakis said the Greek parliament had pushed through an agreement with international creditors that would allow oligarchs, who dominate sections of the economy, to generate huge profits and continue to avoid paying taxes. The outspoken economist published an annotated version of the deal memorandum on his website on Monday, arguing throughout the 62-page document that most of the measures imposed on Greece would make the country\u2019s dire economic situation worse. His first insertion makes clear his dismay at the dramatic events of last month, when the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was forced to accept stringent terms for a new bailout amid calls from Germany for Greece\u2019s temporary exit from the eurozone. Varoufakis, who resigned from his post in June, said: \u201cThis MoU [memorandum of understanding] was prepared to reflect the Greek government\u2019s humiliating capitulation of 12 July, under threat of Grexit put to Tsipras by the Euro summit.\u201d Folllowing the July summit, Athens agreed a three-year memorandum of understanding last week that will release \u20ac86bn of funds, much of it to repay debts related to two previous rescue deals. In exchange, Athens will implement wide-ranging reforms including changes to the state pension system and selling off government assets. But Varoufakis said a reform programme overseen by the troika of lenders \u2013 the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2013 would only enslave ordinary workers and families by imposing tough welfare cuts while letting foreign companies grab domestic assets cheaply through privatisations. He said billionaire business owners in Greece would also escape scrutiny. In the memorandum it says: \u201cFiscal constraints have imposed hard choices, and it is therefore important that the burden of adjustment is borne by all parts of society and taking into account the ability to pay. Priority has been placed on actions to tackle tax evasion.\u201d In answer, Varoufakis said: \u201cAs long as it is not committed by the oligarchs in full support of the troika through their multifarious activities.\u201d The memorandum goes on to say: \u201cThe authorities plan to benefit from available technical assistance from international organisations on measures to provide access to health care for all (including the uninsured).\u201d To which Varoufakis responds: \u201cie using advice of well paid foreign \u2018technocrats\u2019 as a substitute for funding, nurses, doctors and equipment\u201d. The deal memo also refers to rolling out a \u201cbasic social safety net\u201d in the form of a guaranteed minimum income (GMI]. That provision \u201cwould be great, except that not one fresh euro will be made available for the GMI program whose funding will be siphoned off existing benefits provided by the Greek state, e.g. child benefit,\u201d says Varoufakis. As finance minister, Varoufakis opposed any deal with Brussels that he believed would consolidate the strategy of the previous five years of bailouts. He argued that combining financial aid with severe cuts to state spending was the main reason why Greek unemployment had soared to more than a quarter of the working population and shrunk the economy by 25%. Varoufakis was succeeded at the finance ministry by his colleague Euclid Tsakalotos who went on to negotiate the current agreement. Last week, after the memorandum passed into Greek law, Tsakalotos said the deal would take Greece forward and create a more stable financial system. Varoufakis said the deal was flawed in many ways as he picked his way through the memorandum. For instance, property taxes based on out-of-date and inflated values would hit ordinary households; that a reliance on expensive advisers and consultants would deny the health service vital cash; and a reduction in investment funding by Brussels would stifle the recovery. He said the troika had wrecked the pension system, which remains an essential economic prop for many households. Warning that removing state subsidies from pensions would create a vicious circle, he said: \u201cThe pension cuts necessary will be so large that aggregate demand in Greece will fall again so much that employment will suffer further thus hitting again the pension funds.\u201d His intervention came as the German parliament prepares to vote on the bailout agreement on Wednesday. If, as expected, German MPs approve the deal it will pave the way for the first disbursement of aid on Thursday, allowing Greece to meet a \u20ac3.2bn payment due to the European Central Bank. Meanwhile, the Greek government appears likely to call a confidence vote following a rebellion among lawmakers from the ruling Syriza party over the country\u2019s new bailout deal, senior ministers said on Monday. Energy Minister Panos Skourletis described such a parliamentary vote as \u201cself-evident\u201d following Friday\u2019s rebellion when almost a third of Syriza deputies abstained or voted against the agreement. With Syriza\u2019s left wing showing little sign of returning to the party fold, Skourletis also raised the possibility of early elections should Tsipras lose a confidence motion. Tsipras had to rely on opposition support to get the bailout deal through parliament, and another minister argued that elections would be a way of achieving political stability.",

      "bodyText": "Brompton Bicycle is doubling the size of its factory floor space to meet growing international demand for its folding bikes. The British manufacturer aims to make 100,000 bikes a year by 2021, so is moving to an 86,000 sq ft plant in Greenford, west London, which is nearly twice the size of its current base in nearby Brentford. Although Brompton is only moving a few miles down the road, it marks a shift in gear for the company that began life in its inventor\u2019s west London flat in 1975. The company said staying in the capital was essential to its identity: \u201cWe are committed to London. Brompton was born from a need of city living, our staff are Londoners and the city continues to to inform how Brompton develops.\u201d Its chief financial officer, Lorne Vary, said Brompton had spent a couple of years looking for the right site, but was prepared to pay the London property premium to retain its skilled workforce. The manufacturer invests 18 months in training its brazers, the craftsmen who put the steel frame of the bike together. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a highly skilled workforce \u2026 and we really wanted to take our staff with us,\u201d Vary said. \u201cAdditionally in the overseas market Made in London is very strong; British manufacturing is held in high esteem, so to a lesser degree that was important. \u201cBy keeping manufacturing in London we have got better control over it rather than it being outsourced.\u201d Overseas buyers bought 80% of the 45,000 bikes Brompton sold last year, with demand growing strongly among urbanites in Asia and the US. Vary said of the target to make 100,000 bikes a year by 2021: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge goal to hit. We would love to hit it five years from now ... but realistically [it is] probably six years from now.\u201d The growth of Brompton into the UK\u2019s largest bicycle manufacturer marks a transformation since Andrew Ritchie began designing its first bike in 1975 from his flat in South Kensington, west London. The name was borrowed from the Brompton Oratory, the imposing Roman Catholic church next to Ritchie\u2019s flat. In the early years, Brompton attracted a niche market of enthusiasts, but production took off after 2002 when the company reorganised its production line and began taking on more skilled staff. It made \u00a33.4m profit on a turnover of \u00a328m last year and employs 240 staff, more than half of which have skilled manufacturing jobs. Brompton exports its bikes to 44 countries, and has stores in cities in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Thailand and China. The move to Greenford is already under way and is expected to be completed by January 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Falling oil prices and a strong pound are likely to have anchored inflation at zero for a second successive month in July, giving further reason for Bank of England policymakers to delay raising interest rates. City economists said official figures to be published on Tuesday are likely to show consumer price inflation (CPI) remained at zero last month. The rate, which is used by the government as its official measure to set pensions, wages and benefits, fell to 0% in February, and has remained close to that level ever since. It is now 18 months since CPI was at the Bank\u2019s 2% target, and economists suggest it will not return to that level soon. The measure hit a low of -0.1% in April, and some analysts forecast that cuts in utility bills, and a fresh decline in petrol prices with retailers passing on recent falls in oil prices, could see it fall back below zero later in the year. \u201cLooking ahead, inflation is likely to turn negative again for a couple of months,\u201d said Samuel Tombs of consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cSupermarket competition should drive petrol prices down before long. In addition, British Gas will cut its gas prices by 5% in late August and other utility companies are likely to follow suit.\u201d Chris Hare, analyst at investment bank Investec, agreed. He said: \u201cOur call on the CPI is that inflation will remain at zero in July, although we judge that there is a material chance that it will ease back into negative territory.\u201d Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, said inflation may have nudged up in July, but only to 0.1%, despite a fall in petrol prices of about 0.7% on the month. However, Kristin Forbes from the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committe said yesterday that keeping rates at a record low when the economy was growing at its pre-crisis trend and earnings were rising at a robust pace risked \u201ccreating distortions\u201d and \u201cundermining the recovery\u201d. Writing in the Telegraph, she said: \u201cMaintaining interest rates at the current low levels during an expansion risks creating distortions. Therefore, interest rates will need to be increased well before inflation hits our 2% target. Waiting too long would risk undermining the recovery\u2014especially if interest rates then need to be increased faster than the gradual path which we expect.\u201d Oil prices have halved since last summer and the prospect of sanctions being lifted against oil-producing Iran, adding to the glut in supply, has pushed the price of Brent crude to below US$50 (\u00a332) a barrel. This fall has been passed on to consumers, and recent weeks have seen a flurry of price cuts on forecourts, with the average price of diesel falling to its lowest level in five years at less than 113p a litre. At some garages diesel now costs less than 108p a litre, and the RAC has predicted that it could continue to drop to below \u00a31. The strength of the pound \u2013 up by 20% over the past couple of years \u2013 is also putting downward pressure on CPI because it means imports are cheaper. The Bank\u2019s last monetary policy summary, published at the same time as it announced its last decision to keep interest rates on hold, said the drag on import prices was expected to push down on inflation \u201cfor some time to come\u201d. City analysts pushed their forecasts for the first rate rise since 2007 into next year \u2013 and possibly next summer \u2013 following the most recent meeting of the monetary policy committee, when just one out of nine MPC members voted for a rate rise. The Bank concluded: \u201cThe near-term outlook for inflation is muted. The falls in energy prices of the past few months will continue to bear down on inflation at least until the middle of next year. Nonetheless, a range of measures suggest that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\u201d Historically low inflation has prevented the MPC from raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5%, despite relatively strong economic growth. However, the Bank governor, Mark Carney, has suggested the decision to tighten policy \u201cwill come into sharper relief around the turn of the year\u201d, prompting speculation of an increase at the start of 2016. Subsequently, Carney has stressed that this was a personal view, not the collective opinion of the MPC. In an interview with the Sunday Times, David Miles, who steps down from the MPC this month, said that the case was building for a rate rise, despite inflation being likely to stay low. Miles, who in six years on the MPC has never voted for a rise, said he had come closest to doing so at the last vote, but was put off by factors including falling commodity prices. The economist, whose second term on the MPC finishes at the end of August, said there was \u201cno great hurry\u201d to raise rates, but with large parts of the economy \u201coperating in a fairly normal way\u201d there was a case for starting to increase rates. \u201cThere is always a reason to delay but I\u2019m wary about that,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThe stock of uncertainty is constantly being replenished.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Employment may be growing stronger than it has for a number of years but people feel neither confidence in the economy nor joy at the news about employment growth. It\u2019s hardly a surprise: wages and household income are growing at levels that would normally be associated with a recession. Coming off the back of the record low growth in the wages price index, the latest figures for average weekly earnings show that for male workers total earnings in the 12 months to May rose just 0.5% \u2013 easily the lowest on record, reflecting the lack of income growth in the economy at the moment. Average weekly earnings \u2013 unlike the wages price index \u2013 are not weighted. Thus, if there is a shift from high-paying jobs \u2013 such as those in the mining industry \u2013 to lower paid work, then the average will fall (or rise slower) even if wages are rising. In the past year, while employment has grown, a sizable shift from high-paying jobs to lower paying ones has occurred: Of the 10 industries which saw an increase in employment, only four pay above-average wages: Take, for example, the shift of workers out of the mining industry into construction. Male full-time workers in the mining industry earn on average $2,601 a week, but the industry lost 33,300 workers over the past 12 months. The construction industry added 23,500 workers, as the housing construction market heats up. But construction pays less than the mining industry \u2013 just $1,529 a week \u2013 below the average male full-time wage of $1,591. Thus the rise in the average earnings of full-time workers is dampened due not just to slow wage growth in each industry, but because of the greater numbers of people shifting to lower paying jobs. Overall, average full-time earnings grew by just 2.01% in trend terms \u2013 the lowest annual growth since the 1990s recession: The greater rise in full-time earnings than total earnings reflects that in the past year, part-time employment has grown faster than full-time work. The pathetic growth is even more striking when you consider that the last time full-time average earnings grew by such a low amount, the unemployment rate was 10.8%. Our wages and income growth is akin to that experienced during recessions. Yet while our GDP growth is certainly not strong, no one is suggesting the economy is shrinking, and employment growth over the past 12 months is stronger than any time since 2012. Christopher Kent, the assistant governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, last week addressed this issue in a speech to the Queensland branch of the Economic Society of Australia. He noted the unemployment rate was expected to remain largely flat (ignoring month-to-month variability) and that \u201cemployment growth\u201d was running faster than \u201cthe growth in the working-age population\u201d. The RBA has been wrestling with why this is occurring, given the economy is growing at a speed that would normally suggest the unemployment rate should rise. Kent firstly noted that the population growth has been a bit below what was previously expected \u2013 mostly owing to a decline in migrants seeking work here. He also noted that wage growth has been lower than normal and that there has been a growth of jobs in more labour-intensive industries. Mining, for example, may be well-paying but it is not especially labour intensive, unlike jobs in the services sector \u2013 such as accommodation and food services, art and recreation services, healthcare and social assistance \u2013 which experienced strong employment growth over the last 12 months. Thus we have a situation where GDP growth is low, so there isn\u2019t much demand in the economy which would drive higher wages. Employment growth is taking place in areas that are more labour intensive, but also lower paying. Combined, this means low wage and low economic growth but also stronger \u2013 or at least, better than expected \u2013 employment growth. What it does not equal is strong growth of national income. In the past year and a half, with the massive drop in export prices, Australia\u2019s national income per person has fallen. Thus, while the economy itself has been growing, we have not on average been getting any richer. Mostly this is reflected through falling export prices which flows through to larger profits. But the impact on workers\u2019 income is pronounced as well: While the correlation between national income growth and average earnings is not precise, since the decline in national income per capita in 2013 there has also been a sharp drop in the growth of average earnings. So it\u2019s not surprising people don\u2019t believe the relatively good news about employment growth. Essentially, people are able to get work more easily than in the past few years but it\u2019s not as well paid. When you\u2019re in such a situation, it\u2019s pretty easy to roll your eyes at positive news on the employment front. The good news \u2013 of a sort \u2013 is that the lower wages growth, coupled with our falling exchange rate, has allowed us to become much more competitive compared with overseas nations. Our real exchange rate has fallen 15% in value the past two years: In time this improved competitiveness will hopefully lead to increased exports and income from those exports. This in turn leads to greater employment in those sectors and hopefully stronger income and wages growth. Sure, that\u2019s cold comfort for many. Right now wages and incomes are growing as though we are in a recession. The only positive is that, partly because of that weak income and wages growth, at least unemployment is not rising as it would if we were really in one.",

He also noted that wage growth has been lower than normal and that there has been a growth of jobs in more labour-intensive industries. </p> <p>Mining, for example, may be well-paying but it is not especially labour intensive, unlike jobs in the services sector \u2013 such as accommodation and food services, art and recreation services, healthcare and social assistance \u2013 which experienced strong employment growth over the last 12 months.</p> <p>Thus we have a situation where GDP growth is low, so there isn\u2019t much demand in the economy which would drive higher wages. Employment growth is taking place in areas that are more labour intensive, but also lower paying. </p> <p>Combined, this means low wage and low economic growth but also stronger \u2013 or at least, better than expected \u2013 employment growth. </p> <p>What it does not equal is strong growth of national income. </p> <p>In the past year and a half, with the massive drop in export prices, Australia\u2019s national income per person has fallen. Thus, while the economy itself has been growing, we have not on average been getting any richer. </p> <p>Mostly this is reflected through falling export prices which flows through to larger profits. But the impact on workers\u2019 income is pronounced as well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8SRRj/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the correlation between national income growth and average earnings is not precise, since the decline in national income per capita in 2013 there has also been a sharp drop in the growth of average earnings. </p> <p>So it\u2019s not surprising people don\u2019t believe the relatively good news about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/aug/10/look-past-the-statistical-comedy-the-jobs-figures-are-actually-great-news\">employment growth</a>. </p> <p>Essentially, people are able to get work more easily than in the past few years but it\u2019s not as well paid. When you\u2019re in such a situation, it\u2019s pretty easy to roll your eyes at positive news on the employment front. </p> <p>The good news \u2013 of a sort \u2013 is that the lower wages growth, coupled with our falling exchange rate, has allowed us to become much more competitive compared with overseas nations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/05/limping-gdp-growth-six-things-about-the-state-of-australias-economy\">Limping GDP growth and six things about the state of Australia's economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our real exchange rate has fallen 15% in value the past two years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bbSZK/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In time this improved competitiveness will hopefully lead to increased exports and income from those exports. This in turn leads to greater employment in those sectors and hopefully stronger income and wages growth. Sure, that\u2019s cold comfort for many.</p> <p>Right now wages and incomes are growing as though we are in a recession. The only positive is that, partly because of that weak income and wages growth, at least unemployment is not rising as it would if we were really in one.</p>",
