      "bodyText": "Rick Haythornthwaite, a former chairman of Network Rail who was criticised for allegedly presiding over a \"gravy train\" of executive pay excess at the infrastructure company, has been given the chairman's role at Centrica, the owner of British Gas. The current chairman, Sir Roger Carr, who was at the forefront of attacks on Ed Miliband over the Labour leader's promise to freeze energy bills, is standing down and will be replaced at the end of the year. Haythornthwaite will join the board of Centrica as a non-executive director on 14 October and will succeed Carr at the turn of the year. He has already been handed a job on the remuneration committee which decides pay levels for the top team. No salary has been disclosed for the new chairman, although Carr took home \u00a3490,000 last year. Executive pay is one of a number of issues that have badly tarnished the reputation of the wider energy supply sector and undermined trust between companies and the public as well as politicians. Centrica came under fire in March this year for sharing out a \u00a316.4m pay pot among senior management including chief executive Sam Laidlaw, who took home almost \u00a35m last year at a time when consumer bills soared after a cold winter. Carr praised Haythornthwaite, saying he held a wide range of skills of use to his new company. \"He brings invaluable industry experience from his time at BP, a deep knowledge of consumer relations from MasterCard and a proven record of government and regulatory body engagement from Network Rail,\" said Carr. In return Haythornthwaite said he felt privileged to succeed Carr and work for a company which was \"so relevant not only to its customers, employees and shareholders but also to the broader societies that it serves\". The Oxford-educated executive, who himself earned \u00a3250,000 a year for a two-day week at Network Rail, clashed with the government and union leaders in the summer of 2010 when he approved a \u00a32.4m bonus pot for the top six directors.

Last year's losses were $79m (\u00a349m) and there is no prospect of a dividend. Its service is definitely popular since there are 215 million users and industrial relations are wonderful because many of the employees are set to become extremely rich. But its challenge is to convert popularity into meaningful revenues and profits.</p> <p>Undecided?

But the cost of backing down for the Republicans could be a fracturing of their party. To take that step, they need a strong excuse.</p> <p>A mini-crash on Wall Street might fit the bill. The US Treasury's warnings of the \"catastrophic\" impact of default would then seen to be credible and real. The Republicans could then retreat while claiming that, unlike Obama and the Democrats, they took the decent and patriotic course by putting the immediate interests of America first.

This is a logical conclusion since it is difficult to imagine why any elected official would be complicit in allowing a default to happen. However, over recent days both the Yen and the Swiss Franc have been creeping higher and stocks indices are appearing a little nervous suggesting that investors have started to position themselves for a worsening in the situation in the US.

But President Obama yesterday was also taking risks in a manner verging on the irresponsible when he exhorted financial markets to show more anxiety over the government shutdown. He seemed irked that the US equity market, relying on a record of strong performance after previous shutdowns, had been positioning for a rally rather than collapsing in a way that would pressure his Republican opponents.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lewis adds later:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A key question is whether financial markets will go on believing in a twelfth-hour resolution of the fiscal conflict in Congress, or whether, at some point ahead of the debt ceiling deadline, they will start to take Mr Obama's warnings of impending chaos seriously. There can be no doubt that much might be at stake. The US Treasury is claiming that it could not prioritise federal debt service payments over other outlays, though that attitude may well be no more than part of the Administration's negotiating position. Servicing the debt as a priority certainly seems a more practical solution, if the Treasury really wanted to avoid default, than the more fanciful suggestions of invoking the Fourteenth Amendment or issuing a trillion-dollar coin. The truth seems to be that the US Treasury does not want to open up an avenue of escape from the impasse that would take pressure off the Republican leadership.</p> <p>The intransigence of the parties in this dispute, if it is maintained, could lead markets to begin to attach some weight to the possibility that a default might occur. After all, a default would have devastating consequences, foremost in the derivative and money markets but spreading to all global financial markets.</p> <p>The situation offers an interesting exercise in game theory.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T12:39:11.756Z\">at 1.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-524ea55ce4b0c4d027486a37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T11:53:45.498Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Looks like <strong>Wall Street</strong>&#xa0;may claw back some of yesterday's losses when trading starts in a little over 90 minutes time.</p> <p>The futures markets suggest the Dow Jones index will crawl higher by about 30 points, or 0.2%.</p> <p>Most European stock markets are now a little higher, as traders digest <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boehner-said-to-be-flexible-on-debt-ceiling-vote-2013-10-03?dist=beforebell%20%20\"><strong>those reports that House Speaker John Boehner is prepared, if needed, to work with Democrats to end the deadlock</strong></a> (by&#xa0;proposing budget legislation that doesn't have the support of a majority of House Republicans).</p> <p>As Brenda Kelly of IG puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying sentiment seems to be marginally hopeful of a resolution from the US government.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-524ea3d4e4b0c4d027486a36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T11:21:44.762Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77990849-f4e2-4743-9d3e-73d008450ed9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380885613809/f719420f-5d76-47f6-bf14-e13eade055c7-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho (L) intervenes during the biweekly debate with his presence at the Parliament, accompanied by the Vice Prime Minister Paulo Portas (C) and by the Minister of Finance Maria Luis Albuquerque (R), in Lisbon, Portugal, 04 October 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in parliament today.

      "bodyText": "That's a good moment to end, with our US team covering the details of the US shutdown talks in their new liveblog here. I'll be back on Monday. Have a good weekend, all. Thanks and goodnight. GW My US colleague Tom McCarthy is live-blogging all the action, and in action, in America today: Government shutdown: 'This isn't some damn game,' House speaker says \u2013 live That includes coverage of House speaker John Boehner telling reporters \"This isn't some damn game!\" and insisting that Republicans simply want to ensure 'fairness' for Americans under Obamacare. Those jitters over the US debt ceiling and government shutdown dragged on the FTSE 100 all day, and the UK blue chip index has closed 4 points higher at 6453. Other markets did better - Italy was the stand-out performer, with the FTSE MIB jumping 1.6%. Relief over prime minister Enrico Letta's victory in Wednesday's vote of confidence hasn't dissipated yet. As Michael Hewson of CMC puts it: This subsidence in the Italian political crisis and the damage to Berlusconi\u2019s credibility appears to have given some investors more confidence that further political surprises could be less likely in the future. While that may be true it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the current coalition still remains very divided and fragile. Over in Palermo, in Sicily, Italian students have been protesting today against plans to cut school spending, and to call for a new economic plan. The students burned a cardboard cutout with the heads of several political figures, including Silvio Berlusconi, his close advisor Gianni Letta, and Sicilian president Rosario Crocetta. All three were blamed for Italy's current economic crisis. Here's Phillip's story on the IMF's report on Ireland: Ireland will need EU support when bailout ends this year, says IMF And here's a great photo of Angela Merkel and delegation arriving for the coalition talks today: While in Germany, there are reports that talks between the CDU and SPD parties will resume in 10 days time. Grand Coalitions, it seems, don't happen overnight The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for Ireland, and warned that Ireland will need a helping hand from the EU to return to the financial markets when its bailout programme concludes at the end of the year. In a new report (just released) on the Irish financial programme, the IMF cut its GDP forecast for 2014 to +1.8%, down from 2.2% previously. It also expects growth of just 0.6% this year, down from 1.1%. Our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, reports: A slowing economy, sky high debts and a weak banking sector mean Ireland will need support from the European Union when its current bailout ends later this year, the International Monetary Fund said in a report on Friday. In a clear call that Brussels should accede to Irish demands for a credit line next year, the IMF warned that Dublin\u2019s recovery will be hampered without cheaper funding for its ailing banks. The report will prove a blow to the Irish government, which is under pressure domestically to maintain business and consumer confidence in the face of significant economic headwinds. In particular, export growth, which has underpinned the economy\u2019s recovery, has fallen in 2013. The IMF said that while exports have picked up moderately in recent months, the recovery will not stop Ireland\u2019s debts hitting 123% of GDP by the end of the year. Making matters worse, the poor state of the country\u2019s banks is holding back the domestic economy. So, to recap, a cross-party Italian Senate committee has recommended that Silvio Berlusconi should be expelled from the Senate, following his conviction for tax fraud in August. The proposal for Berlusconi's expulsion will have to be ratified by a vote of the full Senate which is expected within the next three weeks. This gives the former PM the opportunity for a face-saving resignation instead. The committee was dominated by the former prime minister's political opponents, and had been expected to vote for his expulsion. The decision is another blow to Berlusconi's future as a political force in Italy, two days after his attempts to bring down prime minister Enrico Letta's government failed. As if Silvio Bersluconi didn't have enough problems, he's also due to begin a one year period of house arrest, or community service, as part of his tax fraud sentence (he lost his final appeal in August). That won't necessarily end his involvement in Italian politics, as Alberto flags up: However, Wednesday's humiliation \u2013 when a swathe of his People of Freedom party rebelled against him \u2013 means his future remains unclear. Although, with Berlusconi, you never know for sure... Here's more instant reaction to the recommendation that Silvio Berlusconi should be banned from the Italian Senate, following his tax fraud conviction. Silvio Berlusconi could potentially pre-empt the upcoming expulsion vote by surrendering his Senate seat first, points out Italian political expert Alberto Nardelli: Breaking news out of Italy: The Senate committee considering Silvio Berlusconi's fate has voted to recommend his expulsion from the Upper house. That's a newsflash on Reuters now -- and pretty much what analysts expected. That's not the finally final decision,, though. There must be a full vote on the floor of the Senate, within 20 days. 04-Oct-2013 15:36 - ITALIAN SENATE COMMITTEE VOTES TO RECOMMEND EXPULSION OF SILVIO BERLUSCONI FROM SENATE AFTER TAX FRAUD CONVICTION 04-Oct-2013 15:40 - ITALIAN SENATE COMMITTEE SAYS WILL PRESENT ITS RECOMMENDATION TO EXPEL BERLUSCONI TO FULL SENATE FOR VOTE WITHIN 20 DAYS Mohamed El-Erian went on explain that the US government shutdown will knock around 0.1% to 0.2% off US GDP each week. If the shutdown is temporary, then the lost output won't be too great and some of it can be recovered. However, he warns: If it lasts for months, it's going to be very different. It won't be temporary and reversible El-Erian also pointed out that pressure is building on politicans in Washington to agree a deal, as the global audience watches with increasing incredulity. He said: This is not a way to run a government. This is not a way to present yourself as a credible leader of a global economy. Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of bond-trading giant Pimco, is discussing the US government shutdown and the looming debt ceiling on Bloomberg TV. He's arguing that the markets aren't too worried about the shutdown, as traders have \"looked through the initial impact and decided, rightly, that most of this is temporary and reversible\". Why? Business and consumer confidence won't be badly hit by a short slowdown, as they're used to the US government being disfunctional. The market is saying, this is not great news, but it's not bad. However, El-Erian adds that people are much more concerned about the debt ceiling, and the need to raise the US's legal limit on borrowing before it runs out of headroom. As he put it: It looks like some politicians are playing Russian Roulette with the debt ceiling. And if the game goes wrong, he added, it would be potentially catastrophic for the US and global economy. Most people don't expect that to happen, El-Erian said, because the consequences of a technical default on US Treasuries are too scary to contemplate. Reports from Berlin that the first round of talks between Angela Merkel's CDU party and the Social Democrats has ended. Statements to follow -- which may show whether the eurozone's largest economy is any closer to getting a new government. Economics professor Nouriel Roubini warns that President Obama's decision to cancel this weekend's trip to Asia, so he can focus on the federal government shutdown, will have negative consequences: A very quiet start on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500 are pretty much flat in the first few minutes of trading. Looks like plenty of hand-sitting until there are some developments in Washington. The yield on one-month US debt is inching up again, briefly hitting a four-year high of 0.2%. That shows prices are falling as some investors are selling up rather than risk America's political crisis escalating into a full-blown technical default. The earlier proviso applies, though --prices are still high, and these yields still imply the debt is very safe. A bit less safe than before politicians on Capitol Hill triggered the partial shutdown of America's government in a row over healthcare reforms. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, predicts that the US dollar could get more volatile if America's politicians cannot resolve the deadlock soon. She writes: The relatively subdued tone in asset prices this week confirms that investors are still judging the chances of a US debt default as small. This is a logical conclusion since it is difficult to imagine why any elected official would be complicit in allowing a default to happen. However, over recent days both the Yen and the Swiss Franc have been creeping higher and stocks indices are appearing a little nervous suggesting that investors have started to position themselves for a worsening in the situation in the US. The longer the impasse in Washington continues to bigger the flight to quality is likely to be. If the crisis drags on, then the credibility of US Treasury bills could be at risk, Foley adds, as the US government approaches its debt limit.That could mean the euro becomes a safe haven for investors: Gold, cash and other tangible assets could be in increased demand if the current stalemate drags into next week. In the foreign exchange world, we expect that the yen and the Swiss franc will continue to make headway vs. the US dollar. Insofar as the Eurozone can boast a comfortable current account surplus in addition to high levels of liquidity it is likely that the EUR will also see upside potential vs. the greenback if US politicians fail to overcome the impasse over the weekend. Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities has sent over a research note on the US debt ceiling, and the government shutdown. He says the repercussions of a US federal debt default are literally incalculable, but would probably be several times as dramatic as the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Here's some highlights: Republican extremists in the House of Representatives have been taking undue risks with the faith and credit of the US government. But President Obama yesterday was also taking risks in a manner verging on the irresponsible when he exhorted financial markets to show more anxiety over the government shutdown. He seemed irked that the US equity market, relying on a record of strong performance after previous shutdowns, had been positioning for a rally rather than collapsing in a way that would pressure his Republican opponents. Lewis adds later: A key question is whether financial markets will go on believing in a twelfth-hour resolution of the fiscal conflict in Congress, or whether, at some point ahead of the debt ceiling deadline, they will start to take Mr Obama's warnings of impending chaos seriously. There can be no doubt that much might be at stake. The US Treasury is claiming that it could not prioritise federal debt service payments over other outlays, though that attitude may well be no more than part of the Administration's negotiating position. Servicing the debt as a priority certainly seems a more practical solution, if the Treasury really wanted to avoid default, than the more fanciful suggestions of invoking the Fourteenth Amendment or issuing a trillion-dollar coin. The truth seems to be that the US Treasury does not want to open up an avenue of escape from the impasse that would take pressure off the Republican leadership. The intransigence of the parties in this dispute, if it is maintained, could lead markets to begin to attach some weight to the possibility that a default might occur. After all, a default would have devastating consequences, foremost in the derivative and money markets but spreading to all global financial markets. The situation offers an interesting exercise in game theory. Looks like Wall Street may claw back some of yesterday's losses when trading starts in a little over 90 minutes time. The futures markets suggest the Dow Jones index will crawl higher by about 30 points, or 0.2%. Most European stock markets are now a little higher, as traders digest those reports that House Speaker John Boehner is prepared, if needed, to work with Democrats to end the deadlock (by proposing budget legislation that doesn't have the support of a majority of House Republicans). As Brenda Kelly of IG puts it: The underlying sentiment seems to be marginally hopeful of a resolution from the US government. Back to Lisbon, and the Portuguese prime minister's speech in parliament. After telling MPs that Portugal's economy probably grew last quarter, Pedro Passos Coelho also denied that the country will need a second aid package (as many analysts fear). He said: Avoiding a second bailout means fulfilling what has been agreed under this programme and that's what the government is doing. The current bailout package ends in mid-2014 Is another scandal brewing in the financial markets? Swiss regulators have begun a probe into whether foreign exchange rates may have been manipulated. The country's markets regulator said this morning it was conducting investigations into several Swiss banks. It is also helping to examine whether \"multiple banks around the world\" were also potentially involved in any wrongdoing. The UK authorities began a similar probe in June. Jill Treanor has the story here: Swiss authorities investigate potential manipulation of \u00a33tn currency markets Dow Jones's currency expert Katie Martin has been chasing the Swiss banks: Swiss Regulator Probing Banks Over Foreign-Exchange Manipulation There was some surprise in the City that a market as massive, and transparent, as foreign exchange trading could be successfully manipulated. But while currencies are traded against each other all the time, there are daily 'fixes' where the official rates are set, at 4pm London time. A large order at 4pm could, perhaps, move the market enough to influence the fix. However, it would be tricky to do, as this quote from the Dow Jones/WSJ story shows: \"Our expectation is that we will lose, not make money, on the fixes,\" said one senior foreign-exchange banker speaking on condition of anonymity. \"If you are a trader, and you try to hedge yourself before the flows hit the market, people think you are front-running. If you trade during the one-minute fix window, people think you are banging the close [trying to affect fix levels]. If you try to hedge afterwards, you're an idiot.\" The cost of insuring US debt against default has inched up to a new two-year high today. Data from Markit shows that a one-year credit default swap (which would pay out if the US were to default on a 12-month bond) has risen by seven basis points to 58bps (Reuters flags up). That's the highest rate since the last time America came close to hitting its debt ceiling. 04-Oct-2013 11:05 - US ONE-YEAR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS RISE 7 BPS ON DAY TO 58 BPS, HIGHEST SINCE AUG 2011 - MARKIT Unusually, it also costs more to insure a one-year US bond than a five-year one (in normal conditions it's the other way around, because of the extra uncertainty over a longer time frame). That 'inversion' shows that investors are considering the prospect of America failing to repay 12-month bonds if it cannot raise the debt ceiling in time. 04-Oct-2013 11:06 - US ONE-YEAR CDS TRADES 17 BPS ABOVE FIVE-YEAR RATE, WIDEST GAP SINCE JULY 2011 - MARKIT However, 58bps is still a very cheap price to pay insurance on a sovereign default. In practice, it means it costs $58,000 to insure $10m of US 12-month debt, up from $51,000 yesterday. The yield (or interest rate) on shorter-term US bonds has also risen this week, showing increased fears over a possible default. However, the bonds are still trading very close to their full face value, as this graph shows: Senior members of Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats , and their Christian Democrat allies, have gathered in Berlin ahead of preliminary coalition talks with the Social Democrats today. From these photos, it looks like Merkel has chosen to wear the teal-coloured jacked she also wore at her post-election press conference (where she joked about picking a neutral colour rather than hinting at some coalition partner preference for the 'Red' SPD, or the Greens) Negotiations with the SPD will be tricky, and could last for weeks. The party is wary of another grand coalition with Merkel, having seen suffered an electoral backlash last time. Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, has told MPs that the country's economy continues to claw its way back from recession, at the start of a speech on the country's bailout programme. Coelho told parliament that the latest data suggests there was \"positive economic growth\" in the third quarter of 2013. Portugal is officially out of recession , with a surprisingly strong GDP reading of +1.1% between April and June. Coelho also claimed there were signs of recovery in the jobs sector, despite Portuguese unemployment rising sharply since its austerity programme began. 04-Oct-2013 10:16 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS WE'VE HAD NET JOBS CREATION IN PAST YEAR Yesterday, Portugal's troika of lenders said its prospects had improved -- but didn't give any leeway over its tough targets for spending cuts and tax rises. More to follow.... Veteran City commentator David Buik of Panmure Gordon confirms that the Royal Mail flotation is a hit: Finally Panmure Gordon keep hearing good vibes about next Tuesday\u2019s close of the Royal Mail\u2019s IPO. It appears to be heavily oversubscribed with a few hedge funds reputed to have subscribed for hundreds of millions of shares. Expectations are that Goldman will price the issue at the top end of the range at 330p due to heavy demand. Early indications are that trading will start in the 375-380p range. Trading starts next Friday 11th October 2013. The word in the City is that the Royal Mail selloff is proving very popular with investors. Such is the demand that the new shares will be priced at the higher end of the guidance issued last month, according to the BBC's Robert Peston. The government originally reckoned shares would be sold at between 260p and 330p - but they now won't cost less than \u00a33 each, and could be 330p. So, a bigger windfall for the UK in the short term. But it'll also bolster critics who reckon the UK is blundering by selling Royal Mail now it's on a stronger financial footing. Britain's car sector continues to leave the rest of Europe in the dust, with September sales hitting their highest level since the financial crisis began. Sales in September (when a new registration place came in) jumped by 12.1% to hit 403,136 registrations. The first time monthly sales have beaten the 400k mark since March 2008. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) also reported: Private registrations have risen by 16.7% over year-to-date, helping overall market rise by 10.8%. More than 1 in 7 new cars registered is UK-built Recent recovery in new car market supported by strong growth in private sector and also further gains by fleet/business market. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said the data reflected \"growing economic confidence\u201d in the UK. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: Very strong sales in the key month of September are particularly good news for the car industry while also providing more evidence that the economy is sustaining its improved performance. Quite a contrast with the falling car sales reported in Europe through the year. Some argue, though, that we shouldn't celebrate more vehicles clogging up the road, guzzling petrol.... Over in Italy, a Senate committee has begun a hearing on whether Silvio Berlusconi should be ejected from the country's upper house following his tax fraud conviction. There's a live feed here Should the committee vote to strip him of his Senate seat, the decision would then pass back to the Senate for a full vote, in around two week's time. The Financial Times reports this morning that US banks are stashing extra reserves of cash into the nation's ATMs, in case the US government shutdown and looming debt ceiling sparks a dash for cash. Three of the country\u2019s top-10 banks are implementing a plan last used in the summer of 2011 -- the last time America flirted with not raising the debt ceiling. From the FT: Bank preparations for a debt default involve daily conference calls between lines of business to try to anticipate problems. One senior executive said his bank was delivering 20-30 per cent more cash than usual to cash machines in case panicked customers tried to withdraw funds en masse. US deposits of up to $250,000 are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation but previous severe market disruption \u2013 notably during the financial crisis \u2013 led to significant withdrawals regardless of the government\u2019s guarantee. An employee of a second large bank said it was also increasing deliveries of cash. \u201cDo you have cash on hand in your vault? That\u2019s a consideration,\u201d he said More here: US banks fill ATMs with extra cash (registration required) As expected, most European stock markets have dropped into the red. No major falls, just another early morning of shares sliding while traders worry about events across the Atlantic. The main indices are down around 0.2%, although the Italian FTSE MIB has crept higher, as this image shows: US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has issued a clarion call to America's politicians to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling swiftly. In a bluntly written article in USA Today, Lew warned that the country's \"seniors, veterans and kids\" would be among those to suffer if America were to default on its borrowings, because it had hit the legal debt limit of $16.7trn. Lew began with a scathing comment about the deadlock in Washington: It might be hard to believe, but there is a dangerous debate underway in Congress right now over whether the United States, the world's strongest economy, should pay all of its bills. He then explains that the stock market would tumble, and social security and Medicare services would take a hit, if America blundered through its debt ceiling. The United States cannot be put in a position of having to choose which commitments it should meet. How could we possibly decide among supporting our veterans, maintaining food assistance for children in need, or sending Medicare payments to hospitals? Here's the full piece: Jack Lew: U.S. failure to pay bills hurts everyone Some traders in the City are taking comfort from reports that John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, has told allies he won't let America default. According to the New York Times, Boehner has told allies that, if it came to it, he'd manage to drive legislation to raise the ceiling through the House. The NTY explains: Speaker John A. Boehner has privately told Republican lawmakers anxious about fallout from the government shutdown that he would not allow a potentially more crippling federal default as the atmosphere on Capitol Hill turned increasingly tense on Thursday. They came even though he has so far refused to allow a vote on a Senate budget measure to end the shutdown that many believe could pass with bipartisan backing. They also reflect Mr. Boehner\u2019s view that a default would have widespread and long-term economic consequences while the shutdown, though disruptive, had more limited impact. Chris Weston of IG argues that these 'private comments' from Boehner are an encouraging sign: Is sanity starting to prevail in the US? Not yet, but there are signs that Washington will avert a worst-case scenario. There were also signs of rising jitters on Wall Street last night, where the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both lost 0.9%. That then fed through to Asia, where the Australian index dropped 0.5%. Good morning, and welcome our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the eurozone, the world economy and the business world. The US government shutdown continues to cast a shadow over the global economy, as we enter a fourth day of deadlock in Washington DC. Japan's Nikkei index just hit a one-month low, and we're expecting shares to fall (although not dramatically) in Europe too. It comes as President Obama cancels his scheduled trip to Asia, and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew issues another warning over the looming debt ceiling (more on that shortly). Concern is growing that the shutdown will drag on, hurting the global economy and even leading to the US technically defaulting on its debts if it doesn't hike its debt limit by the October 17 deadline. With the scheduled US jobs data cancelled, investors have little to calm their mounting anxiety that the shutdown could turn into something pretty damn serious. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei posted a fall of 0.94%, down 132 points to 14024. That means it has lost 5% this week, the biggest weekly fall since August. As Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale reminds us, investors started the week believing the US shutdown wasn't a problem: What else is afoot? Well, with no US jobs data to entertain me I'll be watching for progress in the German coalition talks , which begin today. We'll also have an eye on Greece, of course. And in the City, we'll be reporting on a profits warning from Carpetright (the CEO's departing too), and the news that Barclays has reported a 95% take-up for its rights issue. Plus any other big developments through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Taxpayers could lose out on more than \u00a3500m in the controversial privatisation of Royal Mail, Labour has warned. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, attacked the government sell-off after a leading City analyst said the coalition had undervalued the 497-year-old postal service by more than \u00a31bn. Nearly two-thirds of the company is being sold. \"It is truly shocking that taxpayers are set to lose out to the tune of half a billion pounds because the government has undervalued Royal Mail, as this [Panmure Gordon stockbrokers] report suggests,\" he said. \"This analysis suggests that the true value of Royal Mail's shares is a third higher than the price the government is getting for its stake.\" Umunna said taxpayers \"will not forgive ministers if it turns out they have bungled the sale of this centuries-old institution and sold it on the cheap\". Gert Zonneveld, managing director of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said he was convinced the government's official valuation of Royal Mail at \u00a32.6bn-\u00a33.3bn was a significant undervaluation. Zonneveld believes Royal Mail is worth \u00a33.7bn-\u00a34.5bn, when compared with listed postal services in other countries. \"I'm so convinced they [the government] got it wrong,\" Zonneveld said. \"I think they're more than \u00a31bn too low.\" Under Zonneveld's valuation, Royal Mail would join the FTSE100 list of Britain's biggest companies, which means tracker funds will be forced to buy the stock. The Department for Business, which is running the sale, said: \"The valuation will be determined by the book building process. The government has no intention to change the price.\" The government's valuation was based on advice from investment banks Goldman Sachs and UBS after \u00a321.7m in fees was paid to advisers. Zonneveld predicted the controversial sell-off would be a raging success with the shares expected to soar by as much as 30% when they float on the stockmarket on 11 October. \"I think this is going to be massively oversubscribed,\" he said. \"Institutional investors who want \u00a310m will increase their order to \u00a350m because they know their orders will be scaled back.\" Hedge funds are clamouring to buy shares, according to financial pundit David Buik. He tweeted: \"I am hearing that a few hedge funds have subscribed for 100s of millions of shares in Royal Mail IPO!\" The massive demand means Royal Mail's stock will almost certainly be priced at the top end of the 260-330p-a-share price range, giving the company a market value of \u00a33.3bn. The strong demand means retail investors \u2013 the public \u2013 may not get all of the shares they have applied for. Retail investors will be allocated 30% of the shares on offer, with 70% going to banks and institutional investors. Orders for shares close on 8 October. The government is selling up to 62% of Royal Mail, with 10% given away to the company's 150,000 staff. It is the biggest privatisation since John Major sold the railways in the 1990s. Stockbroker ETX Capital said it was experiencing exceptional demand from retail investors and expected the shares to rise to 337-365p on the first day. Broker Hargreaves Lansdown said it would stay open all weekend and until midnight on Tuesday to cope with the phenomenal public demand for the shares. After the shares are listed on the stock exchange on 11 October, banks will be able to start trading. Retail investors will not be able to sell their shares until 15 October. Umunna also raised concerns that the true value of Royal Mail's property assets, including prime sites in central London, have not been properly reflected in the government's valuation. The Royal Mail sale prospectus lists three London sites as being surplus: the eight-acre site at Mount Pleasant in Islington, which Labour said could be sold for up to \u00a31bn to luxury property developers; Nine Elms, valued at up to \u00a3500m; and a site at Paddington. In its sale prospectus, Royal Mail estimated the value of its estate, which includes more than 2,000 properties across the country, at just \u00a3787m. Royal Mail pointed out that sites similar to its London properties have attracted much lower valuations than those suggested by Labour. A spokesman for the Department for Business said: \"Royal Mail was clear about its intentions around property in the prospectus. The company disclosed details of its three major surplus sites currently undergoing pre-development work (including the Nine Elms site).\" He added that most of Royal Mail's other properties were not available for redevelopment because they were vital to the company's operations.",

Tesco's European performance was particularly poor, with profits down 70%. And after its failure in the US - it is selling its Fresh &amp; Easy chain to billionaire Ron Burkle - it has put its Chinese stores into a joint venture.</p> <p>But after falling as low as 342p following Wednesday's results announcement, Tesco's shares ended the week at 361.5p, down 3.5p on the day and just 0.5p on the week.</p> <p>It was Citigroup which upgraded, moving from sell to neutral and lifting its price target from 285p to 350p. Analyst Alastair Johnston said much of Tesco's troubles was now priced into the shares:</p> <blockquote> Tesco's operating data remains grim. We do not expect any medium-term pick up. The big change is that these facts seem well established. Most investors are fully cognizant of the operational challenges facing the group we think. </blockquote> <p>Both Credit Suisse and Macquarie kept their outperform ratings, although Credit Suisse clipped its price target from 430p to 420p. It said:</p> <blockquote> For a diverse company like Tesco, all rarely goes well at the same time. But surprises such as the scale of the Europe first half miss need to be eradicated. Also, we think it unlikely the shares outperform materially until earnings downgrades end. We cannot be sure of either yet, and there is no obvious imminent catalyst to suggest a share price rally. But we think Tesco is doing the right things in key areas to secure sustained improvement, and this direction of travel is more important to us than even a big one division miss. And the shares are low-rated, on just 10.6 times 2014 PE compared to the sector on 13.3 times so, in our view, have a way to rally before longer-term debates about growth and returns become share price drivers. <br> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Macquarie said:</p> <blockquote> The UK is clearly on the mend with stable profitability. Asia can bounce back in the second half with Korean restrictions having annualised. Finally, Europe now is an immaterial 5% of the group profit which could potentially recover. With improving cash generation, better focus on returns and a secure dividend, we believe Tesco is attractively valued at these levels. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall, the US government shutdown and the approaching deadline of 17 October to raise its debt ceiling dominated sentiment during the week and sent markets lower. But with investors hoping that a compromise would be reached between the Democrats and Republicans over the current budget impasse, the declines were relatively muted. One of the main US economic indicators, the monthly non-farm payroll figures, was due out on Friday but fell victim to the government shutdown.</p> <p>Meanwhile there were some positive developments in the eurozone, with a threatened collapse of the Italian government averted when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, contrary to earlier threats, decided to back the coalition in a confidence vote.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished up 4.84 points on Friday at 6453.88. Over the week the index lost almost 60 points. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote> Markets are still in wait and see mode in the absence of today's scheduled US employment report with little in the way of meaningful trading volumes going through, as traders chose to start their weekends early. In essence it's been a case of \"no payrolls, no interest\" as markets end the week on a broadly positive note. </blockquote> <p><strong>Standard Life</strong> was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 on the day, up 8.7p to 354.1p after a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove. The bank put an overweight rating on the insurer's shares, forecasting a possible \u00a3300m special dividend to shareholders later this year:</p> <blockquote> We think it will continue to benefit from 1) UK operational leverage, 2) growth potential in Standard Life Investments (SLI) and 3) a secure dividend. We estimate that earnings at the new style UK business will treble to \u00a3262m by 2015, driven by vertical integration and operational leverage (i.e. increasing revenues and fixed cost base). SLI growth remains attractive given positive GARS [Global Absolute Return Strategies] fund flows, and increasing recognition for non-GARS funds like MyFolio....There is \u00a30.8bn of excess capital at the holding company and \u00a30.3bn at Canadian operations which in our view provide strong support for future dividends. We now forecast a special dividend of \u00a30.3bn in 2013 which we believe is well covered from holding company cash and further dividend from Canada in the second half of 2013. </blockquote> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> slipped 1.65p to 271.35p after it announced a 95% takeup for its \u00a35.8bn rights issue. The remaining shares were sold in the market at 268p each to raise \u00a3463m. Analyst Ian Gordon at Investec raised his recommendation from add to buy and said:</p> <blockquote> Although we continue to regard the imposition of a June 2014 deadline to meet a new and contrived 3% adjusted leverage target as unjustified, the rights issue it triggered appears to have been a reasonably successful exercise in damage limitation. <br> In terms of what will transform Barclays into a bank delivering acceptable and sustainable returns on equity, our view is simple. In contrast to government shutdowns (which we see as a profoundly good idea, the only problem being their apparently partial/temporary nature) Barclays needs much less radical surgery. The rights prospectus stated that it \"is on track to meet the \u00a318.5bn cost target...for 2013\". Not good enough! It can, should and, we believe, will do better. Weak FICC [fixed income currencies and commodities] trading revenues should be matched/offset by major reductions in variable compensation, while recent rand/US dollar depreciation offers further assistance on sterling costs.

It closed 1.1p better at 438.25p yesterday. Analysts at Societe Generale said:</p> <blockquote> BP has argued repeatedly that the terms of the multibillion-dollar settlement for economic losses arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident had been misinterpreted by court-appointed claims administrator Paul Juneau, allowing unaffected businesses to receive money. <br> With claims still coming in and still to be settled under the disputed methodology, BP had warned (as fully expected by the market) that it would have to start paying additional claims out of its [profit and loss account] by making additional provisions as early as the third quarter results. BP's legal team will now need to review the court decision and decide if that should still be the case, and if so, on what basis BP's accountants should calculate future claims. But the bottom line, in our view, is that if a business cannot prove Macondo impacted it, then it should not be in receipt of BP shareholders' cash and those who do not deserve compensation should not be awarded compensation. </blockquote> <p><strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> added 6p to 745p despite saying first half profits had been hit by cold spring weather in the US and a slow start to the summer, hitting sales of its sweetener products such as Splenda. The division's profits for the six months were expected to be lower than the same time last year, and it said the outcome of the sweetener pricing rounds would affect its performance in the final quarter. But overall it expected another year of profitable growth.

Lawyers for rival Nestl\u00e9 managed to overturn a previous judgment that would have prevented other manufacturers from wrapping their products in the same Dairy Milk tone. The row revolved around a specific shade of purple \u2013 defined as Pantone 2685C \u2013 which the Birmingham-based manufacturer maintains it has used since the first world war. It is used on its bestselling Dairy Milk bars and other sweets. The appeal court in London did not rule that pure colours alone cannot be used as trademarks but said Cadbury's definition of the \"predominant colour\" of its packaging fell short of the necessary precision. The company, the judges said, was attempting to register \"multiple signs\", involving using the purple shade in many different graphical permutations rather than a single, consistently presented block of colour. Cadbury had argued that trademarking Pantone 2685C would not give it an unfair competitive advantage over other chocolate manufacturers as so many other shades were available. In granting the appeal by Nestl\u00e9, one of the three appeal judges, Sir John Mummery, said: \"The mark applied for thus lacks the required clarity, precision, self-containment, durability and objectivity to qualify for registration. \"To allow a registration so lacking in specificity, clarity and precision of visual appearance would offend against the principle of certainty.

Analyst Ian Gordon at Investec raised his recommendation from add to buy and said:</p> <blockquote> Although we continue to regard the imposition of a June 2014 deadline to meet a new and contrived 3% adjusted leverage target as unjustified, the rights issue it triggered appears to have been a reasonably successful exercise in damage limitation. <br> In terms of what will transform Barclays into a bank delivering acceptable and sustainable returns on equity, our view is simple. In contrast to government shutdowns (which we see as a profoundly good idea, the only problem being their apparently partial/temporary nature) Barclays needs much less radical surgery.

      "bodyText": "Banks were in focus as the market continued to be nervous about the US government shutdown and its debt ceiling. Barclays has slipped 2.15p to 270.85p after around \u00a3400m worth of shares will be sold in the market. These represent the remaining shares after a 94.6% takeup of its \u00a35.8bn rights issue. Analyst Ian Gordon at Investec raised his recommendation from add to buy and said: Although we continue to regard the imposition of a June 2014 deadline to meet a new and contrived 3% adjusted leverage target as unjustified, the rights issue it triggered appears to have been a reasonably successful exercise in damage limitation. In terms of what will transform Barclays into a bank delivering acceptable and sustainable returns on equity, our view is simple. In contrast to government shutdowns (which we see as a profoundly good idea, the only problem being their apparently partial/temporary nature) Barclays needs much less radical surgery. The rights prospectus stated that it \"is on track to meet the \u00a318.5bn cost target...for 2013\". Not good enough! It can, should and, we believe, will do better.
