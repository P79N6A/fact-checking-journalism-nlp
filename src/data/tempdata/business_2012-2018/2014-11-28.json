      "bodyText": "The price of oil fell for the second day in a row on Friday, wiping billions off the values of oil companies and putting huge investments at risk after Thursday\u2019s decision by Opec to maintain the cartel\u2019s existing production levels. The cost of the benchmark Brent blend slumped below $72 a barrel before rallying slightly but some industry experts \u2013 including the chief executive of Rosneft, Russia\u2019s largest oil producer \u2013 have predicted that crude values will keep on going down, possibly as low as $60. If this were to happen it would mean that the price of oil had dived by nearly 50% in less than six months. If the price stayed at that level for any amount of time it would radically change the landscape for producers and consumers alike in the UK. Here are five potential consequences. Petrol and diesel prices The big four supermarkets sliced another 2p off the price of fuel on Friday in reaction to the crude slump. When the price of oil was $60 in December 2006, the price of petrol at the pumps reached 88.2p a litre and diesel 93.7p. This compares with a current average price \u2013 before the wave of 2p cuts on Friday \u2013 of 122.4p for petrol and 126.95p for diesel. Since then British motorists have seen increases in the fuel duty and VAT levied by the government. Unless the government cuts fuel duty and VAT, the cost of petrol and diesel might not fall to the levels seen on the forecourt eight years ago. The AA says there is usually a time lag between pump prices falling and motorists using their vehicles more, so families may choose to spend their savings on food rather than drive more. The commercial sector \u2013 road hauliers \u2013 would benefit from lower fuel costs, as would the airlines and the shipping industry. That should lead to lower consumer prices for food and even commodities such as steel, which require a lot of energy to make. Scotland\u2019s oil economy and Treasury tax receipts The North Sea offshore oil industry tipped \u00a36.5bn into the pockets of the taxman in 2012-13, and is an important driver of the Scottish economy, as the Scottish National party (SNP) made clear during the referendum on independence. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, argued that $24tn (\u00a315tn) worth of oil and gas was still waiting to be extracted, but these figures were premised on a crude price of $100 a barrel. An oil price substantially below that would complicate the SNP\u2019s costings for an independent Scotland, which would be looking to the North Sea for a sizeable contribution in tax and jobs. The offshore lobby group Oil &amp; Gas UK said that even before the recent fall in crude prices there had been a huge drop-off in exploration activity in the North Sea. The organisation has been lobbying George Osborne hard to reduce taxes in his autumn statement next week in a move to improve the situation. Mike Tholen, Oil &amp; Gas UK\u2019s economics director, said on Friday that a prolonged period of $60 oil would be disastrous for investment and jobs. \u201cDecommissioning [oil platforms] would become the biggest activity and that would be a crying shame. It would cost the Exchequer a fortune [in tax breaks] to take the stuff away and mean oil left in the ground.\u201d Inflation Lower energy prices have helped to hold down UK inflation, which reached 1.3% in October on the CPI measure \u2013 just above its lowest level in five years. The Bank of England estimates that a $1 a barrel increase in oil adds 0.1% to inflation over a two-year period. But one of the reasons why energy prices are falling is that demand for the product is not as high as expected. That is in turn because the global economy, with the exception of the US, is not powering ahead. Lower oil prices and lower inflation should be a boost to economic growth, at least in those countries such as Britain, which are not dependent on producing commodities, as Russia or Venezuela are. So $60 oil would significantly cut inflation, giving comfort to the Bank of England which, like other central banks, worries about how to pitch interest rates when goods and service prices are rising. Expectations of lower inflation has made buying government debt less attractive and pushed 10-year yields on US Treasury bonds to five-week lows on Friday. Dominic Rossi, a director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: \u201cThe fall in oil prices will boost economic activity.\u201d HSBC analysts said in a research note that corporate profits would be pushed up as a consequence and equity markets should benefit. Alternative energy A slump in the oil price to $60 should drive down the gas price, leading to lower household heating and lighting bills in Britain \u2013 so long as the Big Six energy suppliers passed on the gains. It would also lead to more gas-fired power stations being used to generate electricity, which would damage profits for nuclear power stations and windfarms. The gas price is not directly linked to the oil price in Britain, though it has broadly followed oil\u2019s downward trajectory in the UK. Crude prices are down in Britain this year by about 33%, while wholesale gas has fallen in value by 17% and coal by 12%. The price of wholesale electricity in the UK is down 12% this year at \u00a348.80 a megawatt hour (MWh). Peter Atherton, utility analyst at Liberum Capital, says a prolonged period of $60 oil could be expected to drive down electricity prices below \u00a345 a MWh, which would cut profits for existing nuclear plants and be very painful for renewables. \u201cIt would destroy value on existing renewable energy projects and make it difficult to raise financing for future projects,\u201d said Atherton. One project in particular would look like a bad deal for the taxpayer in a $60 world: the first nuclear reactor constructed in Britain for a quarter of a century. The government is backing a guaranteed payment of \u00a396.90 a MWh for EDF\u2019s new atomic plant at Hinkley in Somerset, which would look like an even worse deal for the UK if the oil price slumped further. Fracking Lower oil and gas prices could fatally undermine the government\u2019s desire to see a shale industry take off in Britain. The rate of drilling in the US \u2013 the fracking pioneer \u2013 has fallen dramatically since the price of gas there plunged from $12 per million British thermal units (mmBTU) to $3. The value of gas in Britain currently is the equivalent of about $12 to $14 per mmBTU, and many experts believe it could cost UK shale drillers such as Cuadrilla Resources about $8 to $10 to extract. If $60 oil dragged down gas prices to $8, that could make it uneconomic to continue with UK fracking unless the industry came up with new ways to cut costs. It would also make imports of liquefied natural gas a potentially cheaper option. But no one really knows whether gas can be fracked in Britain economically because almost no wells have been drilled yet. The UK Onshore Operators Group says oil and gas firms are long-term thinkers and unlikely to be blown off course by short-term price fluctuations, certainly in the exploration phase. Ken Cronin, UKOOG\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThere are also a number of reasons why the UK wants gas, including to displace coal.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Next, the high street retailer run by multimillionaire Tory donor Lord Wolfson, is bussing in hundreds of Polish people to work in its Yorkshire warehouse after claiming to have failed to hire enough British people. The company, which made profits of \u00a3695m last year, admitted that it began recruiting Poles for minimum-wage seasonal warehouse jobs 5-10 days before advertising the roles in the UK. Next said it was not preferentially hiring Polish people, but had started the recruitment drive in Poland first because it needed more time to bring people over from the continent. \u201cThere are not enough people to recruit in the local area,\u201d a Next spokesman said. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t filled the jobs. The reason they do it in Poland first is because it takes longer [before they can start work at the warehouse].\u201d The company has hired about 500 British and 240 Polish people for a total of 840 warehouse roles required over the Christmas shopping and January sales period. The spokesman said the jobs were advertised on Next\u2019s website, in jobcentres and on UK recruitment websites. Next is still actively recruiting in the UK and Poland for 100 more staff. The Yorkshire and Humber region has the second-highest unemployment rate in the country, after the north-east, with 7.2% of people out of work compared with the national average of 6.1%. Next and its Polish recruitment agency have arranged a fleet of buses to drive the 240 Polish recruits 1,180 miles from Warsaw directly to its warehouse in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire. The first of the buses began arriving last month, with up to seven coaches travelling in convey according to the Daily Mirror, which first reported the Polish recruitment drive. The Polish workers are charged \u00a3100 a head for the journey, which takes about 19 hours not including stops according to Google Maps. When they arrive at Next\u2019s warehouse, the Polish recruits are charged \u00a350-\u00a365 each per week for shared room accommodation provided by local landlords. The Next spokesman said the accommodation, which is arranged by its Polish recruitment agency, was \u201cmaximum two people per room\u201d. Next said the posts vary from a few weeks to a few months. Staff aged over 21 will be paid \u00a36.50 an hour \u2013 the minimum wage. The spokesman said they could be eligible for a bonus worth up to 60% more, but not until they completed 12 weeks\u2019 service. The GMB union, which represents Next workers and has embarked on a nationwide tour demanding staff are paid the living wage of \u00a37.85, said it was outrageous that jobs were being offered in Poland before the UK. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, which represents Next workers, said: \u201cAll over Europe there are labour agencies exploiting posted workers on a massive scale. Internal EU-wide union estimates show that approximately one million workers are exploited as posted workers annually.\u201d \u201cFrom Lindsey Oil Refinery to food production, we have seen workers recruited in certain member states by agencies and exploited. They were shipped in literally in order to undermine the terms and conditions of existing workers on those contracts. Both sets of workers have been let down by UK government, the European commission and the European court. \u201cOn exploitation \u2013 don\u2019t blame the exploited; damn those who exploit. This has been repeated up and down the country over recent years. And that is part of the discontent that extreme political parties turn into xenophobic rhetoric to win votes.\u201d The GMB said it met Polish workers off the buses and handed them leaflets in Polish encouraging them to join the union. Wolfson, who owns 1% of Next\u2019s shares worth more than \u00a3100m, was paid \u00a34.6m last year. In the current year, his basic salary rises 2% to \u00a31.1m but his total pay is likely to exceed \u00a36.2m with his long-term incentive plan and annual bonus included \u2013 even after excluding a bonus he has chosen to share among staff for the last two years. Wolfson has donated more than \u00a3400,000 to the Tories since 2006 and advised the party on economic policy before the last general election. He was made a peer by the government in July 2010. He has had no formal role with the Conservatives since 2010, but is married to Eleanor Shawcross, one of George Osborne\u2019s economic advisors.",

There is growing concern about the political implications for oil-producing countries of a prolonged slump in prices, especially Iran, Algeria and Venezuela, which have high-cost production and heavy public spending commitments. Russia, which derives half its budget revenue from oil and gas, is already struggling with a collapse in the value of the rouble and an economy fast moving into recession.

      "bodyText": "A late update -- the sell-off in the oil price is picking up pace tonight. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has dropped under the $70 per barrel, for the first time since May 2010. New York crude is also on the slide. European stock markets ended the day flat, as investors divested the implications of the oil price slide (great for consumers, tricky for central bankers, bad for vulnerable producers, end of an era for Opec?). Chris Beauchamp of IG sums it up: It it looks like the power of OPEC to maintain a balance in the market has been severely weakened, if not broken entirely. Supply gluts are set to stay with us into 2015, and the geopolitical ramifications will be felt throughout the globe, not least in relation to Russia and Putin\u2019s attempts to reconstruct a Moscow-led sphere of influence. Time for a recap: Falling energy prices have helped to drag inflation across the eurozone down to a five-year low. The euro area consumer price index rose by just 0.3% annually in November, with energy prices tumbling by 2.5% over the last year. Economists urged the European Central Bank to react to the tide of disinflation with fresh stimulus action; Holger Schmieding of Berenberg hopes to see a corporate bond-buying programme announced next week... ...and the CEBR\u2019s Danae Kyriakopoulou reckons it\u2019s time for a sovereign bond-buying programme UBS\u2019s former chief economist, George Magnus, though, argues that we should welcome lower oil prices -- they will, after all, give consumers more firepower: The latest unemployment figure also show the eurozone economy is in a bad way. The jobless total rose by around 60,000 last month, leaving the rate stuck at 11.5%. In Italy, the unemployment rate spiked to 13.2%, a record high. Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, though, is refusing to change his position; he told an audience in Berlin that central banks don\u2019t have an \u201cAladdin\u2019s Lamp\u201d to fix the situation. The slump in the oil price has hit energy stocks on both side of the channel, and driven down the Russian ruble to a record low. Over in Brussels, EC officials have given France and Italy more time to comply with the stability and growth pact Full story: Brussels defers punishing France and Italy for breaking eurozone rules And retailers on both sides of the Atlantic have been busy with Black Friday mania. There have been scuffles, fights over cheap TVs and general mayhem at some stores - and the police aren\u2019t happy: We have another liveblog here with all the details: Black Friday shoppers fight for bargains - live updates Greece has reached a deal with its creditors after weeks of disagreement over its 2015 budget plans, according to media reports. Details are vague, but it could be enough to get the troika back to Athens to review the state of play. Helena Smith reports from Athens: At the eleventh hour prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 two-party coalition appears to have come to some agreement with the country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Officials say Greece agreed to roll back on several of its \u201cred lines\u201d after Samaras worked the phones last night. The leader cut the deal after conversing with European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, German chancellor Angela Merkel, ECB president Mario Draghi, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde and EU Economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici, all of whom emphasized that it was imperative international inspectors returned to Athens ASAP. Samaras, is currently in behind-door discussions with his deputy, Evangelos Venizelos, and it remains to be seen how the socialist leader will react to the news. Venizelos had repeatedly ruled out concessions that would further hit austerity blighted Greeks. Local media reports suggest that Samaras has agreed to further cut pensions \u2013 abolishing all for those under the age of 62, the crossing of a huge \u201cred line\u201d if true. The changes will be put to parliament on December 7 \u2013 in time for the last euro group meeting of the year in Brussels on December 8th when Athens hopes to discuss its \u201cpost-bailout\u201d era. Government officials said Athens was also in discussion about extending its economic adjustment programme with creditors for \u201ctechnical reasons.\u201d Earlier today, Moscovici announced that the European commission was eager to see auditors return to Athens to complete their economic review imminently. \u201cThe government must swiftly take all the necessary measures so that the ongoing program is complete,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s economy grew by 0.7% in the third quarter of this year, data just released shows. That\u2019s slower than in April-June, when GDP expanded by 0.9%.l, but beats forecasts. It matches Britain\u2019s growth too, but means Canada lagged behind the US (which grew by almost 1% during the quarter). The European Central Bank\u2019s hawk-in-chief, Jens Weidmann, has rejected calls for a new monetary stimulus programme. The head of the Bundesbank also insisted that Germany should not abandon its fiscal plans. Weidmann told an audience in Berlin that there\u2019s no \u201cAladdin\u2019s Lamp\u201d that can be rubbed vigorously to cure Europe\u2019s ills. Monetary policy cannot magically raise a country\u2019s growth potential for a sustained period of time, Weidmann argued, saying:. \u201cOne must be clear that central banks do not have an Aladdin\u2019s Lamp that you just have to rub to make all wishes come true. \u201cIn particular, it is an illusion to think that one can raise the growth potential of an economy for the long term or create jobs sustainably with the means of monetary policy.\u201d That suggests he won\u2019t be bounced into a full-blown QE programme next week. Weidmann said the tumble in the oil price is effectively a stimulus boost of its own, as it will give eurozone consumers more cash to splash. And suggestions that Germany should ditch its plan to balance its budget this year were slapped down: \u201cCalls for a public fiscal stimulus plan in Germany to boost the eurozone economy are amiss.\u201d Dow Jones has more details. This morning\u2019s fall in eurozone inflation to a five-year low has not spooked the financial markets. The euro has gained around 0.15% against the US dollar today, to $1.248 against the US dollar. There\u2019s little action in the bond market either (are traders being distracted by Black Friday?!) Edward Knox, currency analyst for Caxton FX, says the inflation data \u201chasn\u2019t come as a major surprise to the market\u201d. However.... This won\u2019t however lessen the concern felt by ECB policy members as the downward trend for inflation continues unabated. Falling energy prices have been a large source of this deflationary pressure in the 18-nation bloc, and yesterday\u2019s landmark decision by OPEC to not cut production will likely see energy prices fall further still. With this is mind, and the \u2018spectre of stagnation\u2019 still looming all eyes will turn to next week\u2019s ECB monthly policy meeting to see what action is taken.\u200e That\u2019s a reference to Bank of England governor Mark Carney\u2019s recent warning that \u201cthe spectre of economic stagnation\u201d was haunting Europe, and threatening the UK..... Over in America, traders are rousing themselves from their post-Thanksgiving torpor and heading back to Wall Street. At least, some are. Many have awarded themselves a four-day weekend by taking today off too. But those who do struggle in are expected to drive down energy stocks, in response to the oil price slide: EXXON MOBIL DOWN 4.3% IN PREMARKET TRADING AS CRUDE OIL TUMBLES CHEVRON CORP DOWN 4.1% PCT IN PREMARKET TRADING AS CRUDE OIL TUMBLES HALLIBURTON CO DOWN 4.4% IN PREMARKET TRADING AS CRUDE OIL TUMBLES U.S. SHARES OF BP PLC DOWN 6.3% IN PREMARKET TRADING AS CRUDE OIL TUMBLES CONOCOPHILLIPS DOWN 4.3% IN PREMARKET TRADING AS CRUDE OIL TUMBLES The prospect of a glut of oil seeping across the global economy has hit energy firms hard today, driving European stock markets into the red. More than $32bn has been wiped off the European oil and gas sector, according to Reuters data. Investors are reacting to the prospect of the oil price falling further, as Opec continues to produce its 30 million dollars per day. Bill Hubard, chief economist at Markets.com, explains: \u201cWe are seeing continued oversupply,\u201d \u201cI think $70 a barrel will be the new norm. We could see oil go considerably lower.\u201d Brent crude is currently $72.80/barrel, and New York crude is around $69/barrel, close to the four-year-plus lows set this morning. In London, the selloff has knocked 40 points off the FTSE 100. Edinburgh-based engineering firm Weir Group, which has interests in oil and shale exploration, is leading the fallers, down over 8%. If you strip out all the volatile factors, such as energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, then core eurozone inflation was unchanged this month at +0.7%. Eurostat has more details here. Danae Kyriakopoulou, CEBR economist, says \u201cthe time has come\u201d for the ECB to start a sovereign bond-buying quantitative easing programme. Kyriakopoulou explains how the weak inflation and high unemployment are two sides of the same euro: The main contributions to weakening price growth are coming from food and energy prices \u2013 energy prices fell by 2.5% year-on-year in November, today\u2019s data showed. These are hardly the type of goods that consumers can decide to forgo in the expectation that they will be cheaper in the near future. Even so, weak demand and elevated unemployment are also playing a part in keeping inflation subdued \u2013 which is why inflation in the Eurozone is so much lower that other advanced markets such as the US and the UK where the energy and food price dynamics are largely similar. It\u2019s hard to see the ECB\u2019s hawkish members being bounced into full-blown QE next week. But if inflation falls much lower, the pressure could be intensive by the early 2015... This chart, via the CEBR, shows how inflationary pressures in the eurozone have been falling for the last two years, while the unemployment rate has stuck stubbornly high. Over in Brussels, the new European Commission has given France and Italy some breathing space to hit European budget targets. Our correspondent Ian Traynor reports that Paris and Rome have got until next spring to deliver on their pledges of sweeping changes to labour markets and other structural reforms. \u201cAs a new commission, we\u2019re not seeing it as a priority to punish countries,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis of Latvia, the new commission vice-president in charge of the euro, told The Guardian and other European newspapers. Just in - Brazil has pulled out of recession, narrowly. GDP rose by a meagre 0.1% in the third quarter of 2014, having shrunk in the first six months of this year. The economy is still 0.2% smaller than a year ago. Holger Schmieding of Berenberg has warned that euro inflation will remain below the ECB\u2019s target \u201cfor as far as the eye can see\u201d. Schmieding had been relatively optimistic about the eurozone economy until recently. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Schmieding blamed Russia\u2019s military action in Ukraine for derailing the recovery. That hit business confidence in Germany hard, he says. So, from growing at 2%, German\u2019s economy was dragged to a near-standstill. The European Central Bank should react to the drop in inflation by buying corporate bonds, starting at next week\u2019s meeting, he argues. The ECB is currently buying up asset-backed securities (bundles of bonds, basically) in an attempt to stimulate lending and expand the money supply. But it could widen the programme to include debt issued by companies. The fall in eurozone inflation is bad, although not unexpected, news for the ECB, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. The only crumb of comfort for the ECB \u2013 and it is not much of one \u2013 is that November\u2019s renewed drop in inflation was entirely due to an increased year-on-year drop in energy prices. There is likely to be more of that on the way given the slump in oil prices! Behind the headline jobless rate of 11.5% are stark differences in unemployment across the eurozone. The lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Germany (4.9%) and Austria (5.1%), and the highest in Greece (25.9% in August 2014) and Spain (24.0%). Unemployment rates have fallen in 22 countries over the last year, but actually increased in five, highlighting how the eurozone economy is struggling. The biggest increases over the last 12 months were recorded at opposite ends of the eurozone; in Italy (12.3% to 13.2%), and Finland (8.3% to 8.9%). There are currently 24.413 million men and women out of work across the European Union, Eurostat says. That\u2019s the population of Netherlands and Switzerland put together. And in the eurozone, there are 18.395m out of work. And the totals have got bigger this month; partly due to seasonal factors, I guess. Eurostat reports that the number of persons unemployed increased by 42 000 in the EU28 in October, and by 60 000 in the euro area. There\u2019s no respite in Europe\u2019s jobless crisis. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 11.5% last month, partly due to the rise in Italy\u2019s jobless rate (see earlier) The drop in eurozone inflation isn\u2019t sharp enough to force dramatic new action from the European Central Bank next week, reckons Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole. Falling energy prices were the main factor dragging eurozone inflation down month. They\u2019ve shrunk by 2.5% over the last year -- and are likely to keep falling given Opec\u2019s decision. Breaking: The eurozone has slipped closer to deflation. Prices across the single currency rose by just 0.3% this month, compared to November 2013, down from 0.4% a month ago. The surge in Italy\u2019s unemployment rate today is a grim reminder that its economic situation has worsened over the last year: And here\u2019s why the Russian stock market is sliding: The Russian stock market is also feeling the Opec blues this morning. The RTS index has tumbled by 3.4% this morning, in a broad-based selloff, following warnings that the weak oil price will trigger a deep recession this year: Newsflash from Moscow -- the economy minister has said that Russia\u2019s oil price forecast for 2015 will be cut, following yesterday\u2019s Opec meeting. Bad news from Italy... the country\u2019s jobless rate has jumped to a new record high. The Italian jobless rate jumped to 13.2% last month, as its recession continues to wreck havoc in its economy. This is the first time it\u2019s been over 13% since records began in 1977. Statistics body Istat reports that the number of people in employment fell by 0.2%in October, to 22.374m. The unemployment total surged by 2.7%, to 3.410. And young people remained in the firing line -- the youth unemployment rate rose to 43.3%, from 42.5% last month. Back in the financial markets, the Russian ruble has slumped to new record lows as the impact of Opec\u2019s price war hits home. The ruble slumped to the brink of 50 rubles to the US dollar this morning. Russia is a big loser from Opec\u2019s decision not to cut production levels. It needs the oil price to be at least $90 per barrel for its industry to be profitable, so Brent crude\u2019s slump to $71.89 is seriously bad news for Moscow. City firm Renaissance Capital reckons that Russia\u2019s economy will suffer a deep recession next year: What has Britain become? There were some frankly unpleasant scenes at Asda\u2019s Wembley branch a few minutes ago, as these video clips from the FT\u2019s Kadhim Shubber show: I\u2019m not sure this Black Friday frenzy is doing much for UK productivity: Over in Wembley, Asda just threw open the doors at its store for Black Friday. My colleague Sarah Butler is there, and reports that more than 400 people were queuing - one arrived at 1am., and another admitted crying off work sick. There were even cheerleaders (not the weather for it) Online shopping may let you avoid the cold, but there\u2019s no escape from the queues: At least there\u2019s no danger of pushing in.... US retail giant Walmart has recorded its second-highest online sales day ever, as Americans flocked to buy bargains during Thanksgiving. Walmart just reported that 22 million shoppers raced to its stores yesterday. And Laura Phillips, senior vice president of merchandising, Walmart U.S, didn\u2019t hold back on the hyperbole, declaring that last night was \u2018awesome\u2019. We saw lines for tablets and TVs snaking throughout the stores, and with our exclusive 1-Hour Guarantee, customers left happy. Unlike in North London and Manchester, where the police were called.... The most popular items were tablet computers, televisions, children\u2019s clothes and and video games and consoles. And, Disney Frozen Snow Glow Elsa dolls were one of the top toys of the night. Phillips added: We sold enough food storage containers to hold 4.5 million pounds of Thanksgiving leftovers and we sold enough towels to line the banks of the Mississippi River*. *- maybe that\u2019s another American tradition.... Building society Nationwide has reported that the UK housing market continues to slow down this month. Prices rose by 0.3% in November, down from 0.5% in October. That pulled the annual rate of house price inflation down to 8.5%, from 9.0% a month ago. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says the housing market continued to \u201csoften\u201d this month, despite unemployment continuing to fall. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase in September was almost 20% lower than at the start of this year, he points out, adding: \u201cForward looking indicators, such as new buyer enquiries point to further softness in the near-term. However, if the economy and the labour market remain in good shape and mortgage rates do not rise sharply, activity is likely to pick up in the quarters ahead.\u201d Britain\u2019s police forces are urging UK shoppers to calm down, having been called to several stores already today as people wrestle for a Black Friday bargain. The latest American tradition to cross the Atlantic, Black Friday, got off to a bang, a few shoves and several phone calls to the police today. British retailers have embraced the US habit of offering \u2018unmissable bargains\u2019 the day after Thanksgiving, sending hordes of consumers racing to stores which opened as early as midnight. My colleague Rupert Neate was dispatched to North-East London, where disgruntled shoppers reported queue-jumping was rife; some even had TVs ripped from their hands amid the scrum. He writes: More than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items \u2013 TVs \u2013 for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticising the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. Full story: Black Friday sales: police attend supermarkets amid scuffles Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Disinflation, disinflation, disinflation. That\u2019s the mantra today, after the oil price slumped to its lowest levels in over four years. Opec\u2019s decision yesterday to effectively launch a price war, rather than cut its supplies, is a boost to millions of consumers and many businesses across the globe. But it does pose a taxing problem for central bankers, as they try to stimulate weak economies and avoid deflation. At 10am we get the latest eurozone inflation figures, and unemployment too, and they are expected to show that Europe fell closer to deflation this month. The annual inflation rate is tipped to fall from 0.4% to just 0.2%, while the jobless rate could remain at 11.5%. The oil price has fallen again this morning, with Brent crude hitting $71.5 per barrel -- down from as high as $78 yesterday before Opec\u2019s meeting: Oil price plunges after Opec split keeps output steady Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons Mario Draghi must have been a little gutted when Opec voted to leave production levels at 30 million barrels per day: The new reality is the US one of the largest oil producers in the world which they weren\u2019t beforehand, and as such the balance of power has shifted with OPEC, Russia and the US as the largest producers of crude oil, which means that OPEC now only control about one third of global oil production. As such we could well see Brent prices drop towards $60 a barrel, a level that Rosneft chief Igor Sechin suggested could be seen early next year, and a level that could well cause some major financial problems to some US shale producers as well as a lot of OPEC members. Not forgetting Russia, of course.... Also coming up today.... It\u2019s Black Friday, which means UK shoppers have been racing to the stores in search of a bargain. There are already reports of scuffles and queue-jumping, and a Tesco store has been closed. There\u2019s also Nationwide\u2019s latest house price survey (just released, more on all that shortly..)",

      "bodyText": "Black Friday shopping fever has engulfed the UK, with fights breaking out between bargain-hunting shoppers, stores forced to close, and retailers\u2019 websites crashing as shoppers scrambled to grab discounted goods. Police were called to at least 16 Tesco stores around the country after staff were overwhelmed by 500-strong crowds battling over discounted TVs, kitchen goods and clothing. The scenes led one senior police officer to call on shoppers to ask themselves: \u201cWhat on Earth was I doing?\u201d A number of stores were closed after fights broke out between shoppers trying to get their hands on sale stock. A police spokesman said a woman was injured at a Tesco store in Stretford, Manchester, \u201cafter being hit by a falling television\u201d. A man was arrested on suspicion of assault at a Tesco store in Salford. Greater Manchester police used their Twitter feed to urge customers to keep calm. Many shoppers were determined to bag a bargain, regardless of what it was. Louise Haggerty, a hairdresser and waitress shopping at 1am at a Sainsbury\u2019s in north-east London, said: \u201cI got a Dyson but I don\u2019t even know if I want it. I just picked it up.\u201d The 56-year-old said she had wanted a new flatscreen TV, \u201cbut so many people pushed in the queue, we didn\u2019t have a chance. People were behaving like animals, it was horrible.\u201d At the same store, Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, had two trolleys full of bargains. \u201cI got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you the prices, but I know they\u2019re bargains.\u201d The Black Friday extravaganza was imported from the US only two years ago but has captured the imagination of both retailers and shoppers. Visa Europe estimated that more than \u00a3500m would be piled on to its cards during the sale period. Retail worker Shaun Thompson said he saw a member of staff with a black eye after a disturbance at Tesco in Stretford. The 21-year-old, who went to the store to buy a set of headphones, said about 1,000 people descended on the store. \u201cPeople were fighting with each other, fighting over TVs,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never seen anything like it in my life. It was quite scary.\u201d There were also disturbances in Scotland, with stores in Glasgow and Dundee closed by police. Officers were also called to Cheshunt, the Hertfordshire town which is home to Tesco\u2019s head office, where there were two assaults. A woman in her late 60s sustained a cut to her leg and a woman in her 70s suffered hand injuries. Asda drafted in 2,000 extra staff, including security guards, to help manage the sale and it said most shoppers had queued in an orderly fashion. By mid-afternoon, the supermarket said it had rung up 2m sales since 8am, making it the busiest single trading day of the year so far. It sold more than 8,000 TVs in first hour, and more than 10,000 tablets in the first two hours. Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester, blamed retailers for the mayhem: \u201cThe events of last night were totally predictable and I am disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty. \u201cThis created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. It does not help that this was in the early hours, when police resources are already stretched.\u201d Ian Hopkins, Greater Manchester deputy chief constable, said the scenes at some Tesco stores were \u201cakin to mini-riot\u201d, with people trampling on each other. The fallout included three arrests and a shopper with a broken wrist. A security guard was also punched. Hopkins said: \u201cPeople need to take a long, hard look at themselves and ask, what on Earth was I doing?\u201d Hopkins had spoken to Tesco senior executives earlier and told them the events were predictable and the force\u2019s \u201cscarce resources should not be used to bail out stores when they\u2019ve not planned effectively\u201d. The websites of several big retailers including Currys, John Lewis and Tesco struggled to cope with demand on Thursday night and throughoutFriday. At 10pm on Thursday, the Currys website was showing a queue of more than 70,000 people trying to get in, even though special-offer TVs and electrical gadgets were not available until 8am the next day. Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said it appeared that the number of people looking for bargains had taken everybody by surprise despite all the preparations. \u201cFrom a retail perspective the frenzy of interest has mixed implications,\u201d he said. \u201cTake-up on sales today is likely to undermine the potential for purchases later in the Christmas shopping period. The waiting times and overloading of stores is also unlikely to be good for the reputations of the retailers involved.\u201d The number of shoppers on London\u2019s Oxford Street was up nearly 20% on last year between 9am and midday, according to the New West End Company. John Lewis said the number of visitors to its website between midnight and 6am was 30% up on Black Friday last year, with most logging on between 12am and 1am in a bid to get the best deals. Its fastest-selling deal was an Apple iPad mini at just under \u00a3200. Internet retailer Very.co.uk said it was handling 30,000 orders per hour \u2013 a rate of eight a second, compared with a peak of three a second last year. The retailer said it was selling a \u00a3299 PS4 games console package every 0.75 seconds. Currys said web traffic was five times higher than last year, with Samsung TVs, DeLonghi coffee machines, iPads, Bose Bluetooth speakers and Hotpoint washing machines most popular. Goods were going through the tills at a rate of eight sales every second. Currys said the only problem with its website was \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d and that it had used a queue system to be fair to customers. \u201cThe deals are stonking, lots of customers getting great deals!\u201d Currys said. The trend for midnight surfing was confirmed by data from Postcode Anywhere which said the number of online visits was up nearly 40% between midnight and 1am, compared with the previous day. The highest number of night-time orders came from Birmingham, Belfast and Glasgow.

      "body": "<p>Black Friday shopping fever has engulfed the UK, with fights breaking out between bargain-hunting shoppers, stores forced to close, and retailers\u2019 websites crashing as shoppers scrambled to grab discounted goods.</p> <p>Police were called to at least 16 Tesco stores around the country after staff were overwhelmed by 500-strong crowds battling over discounted TVs, kitchen goods and clothing. The scenes led one senior police officer to call on shoppers to ask themselves: \u201cWhat on Earth was I doing?\u201d</p> <p>A number of stores were closed after fights broke out between shoppers trying to get their hands on sale stock. A police spokesman said a woman was injured at a Tesco store in Stretford, Manchester, \u201cafter being hit by a falling television\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c949916ca91f13f7031a8da77577743b6efff74\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417198758408/86a07148-34e1-4216-a234-c724125a8990-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Black Friday, Blyth\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers carry bargains from the Asda store in Blyth, Northumberland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raoul Dixon /North News &amp; Pictures Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A man was arrested on suspicion of assault at a Tesco store in Salford. Greater Manchester police used their Twitter feed to urge customers to keep calm.</p> <p>Many shoppers were determined to bag a bargain, regardless of what it was. Louise Haggerty, a hairdresser and waitress shopping at 1am at a Sainsbury\u2019s in north-east London, said: \u201cI got a Dyson but I don\u2019t even know if I want it. I just picked it up.\u201d The 56-year-old said she had wanted a new flatscreen TV, \u201cbut so many people pushed in the queue, we didn\u2019t have a chance. People were behaving like animals, it was horrible.\u201d</p> <p>At the same store, Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, had two trolleys full of bargains. \u201cI got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\u201d he said. \u201cI&#xa0;couldn\u2019t tell you the prices, but I know they\u2019re bargains.\u201d</p> <p>The Black Friday extravaganza was imported from the US only two years ago but has captured the imagination of both retailers and shoppers. Visa Europe&#xa0;estimated that more than \u00a3500m would be piled on to its cards during the sale period.</p> <p>Retail worker Shaun Thompson said he saw a member of staff with a black eye after a disturbance at Tesco in Stretford. The 21-year-old, who went to the store to buy a set of headphones, said about 1,000 people descended on the store. \u201cPeople were fighting with each other, fighting over TVs,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never seen anything like it in my life. It was quite scary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4dbbc1c9d3a97ab72d224a49b241d4201725668\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417198864455/e75de359-0881-45d5-8469-29916b46ad46-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Black Friday, Wembley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shopper at the Asda store in Wembley. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parry/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were also disturbances in Scotland, with stores in Glasgow and Dundee closed by police. Officers were also called to Cheshunt, the Hertfordshire town which is home to Tesco\u2019s head office, where there were two assaults. A woman in her late 60s sustained a cut to her leg and a woman in her 70s suffered hand injuries.</p> <p>Asda drafted in 2,000 extra staff, including security guards, to help manage the sale and it said most shoppers had queued in an orderly fashion.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon, the supermarket said it had rung up 2m sales since 8am, making it the busiest single trading day of the year so far. It sold more than 8,000 TVs in first hour, and more than 10,000 tablets in the first two&#xa0;hours.</p> <p>Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester, blamed retailers for the mayhem: \u201cThe events of last night were totally predictable and I am disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty.</p> <p>\u201cThis created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. It does not help that this was in the early hours, when police resources are already stretched.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Hopkins, Greater Manchester deputy chief constable, said the scenes at some Tesco stores were \u201cakin to mini-riot\u201d, with people trampling on each other. The fallout included three arrests and a shopper with a broken wrist. A security guard was also punched. Hopkins said: \u201cPeople need to take a long, hard look at themselves and ask, what on Earth was I doing?\u201d</p> <p>Hopkins had spoken to Tesco senior executives earlier and told them the events were predictable and the force\u2019s \u201cscarce resources should not be used to bail out stores when they\u2019ve not planned effectively\u201d.</p> <p>The websites of several big retailers including Currys, John Lewis and Tesco struggled to cope with demand on Thursday night and throughoutFriday. At 10pm on Thursday, the Currys website was showing a queue of more than 70,000 people trying to get in, even though special-offer TVs and electrical gadgets were not available until 8am the next day.</p> <p>Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said it appeared that the number of people looking for bargains had taken everybody by surprise despite all the preparations. \u201cFrom a retail perspective the frenzy of interest has mixed implications,\u201d he said. \u201cTake-up on sales today is likely to undermine the potential for purchases later in the Christmas shopping period. The waiting times and overloading of stores is also unlikely to be good for the reputations of the retailers involved.\u201d</p> <p>The number of shoppers on London\u2019s Oxford Street was up nearly 20% on last year between 9am and midday, according to the New West End Company.</p> <p>John Lewis said the number of visitors to its website between midnight and 6am was 30% up on Black Friday last year, with most logging on between 12am and 1am in a bid to get the best deals. Its fastest-selling deal was an Apple iPad mini at just under \u00a3200.</p> <p>Internet retailer Very.co.uk said it was handling 30,000 orders per hour \u2013 a rate of eight a second, compared with a peak of three a second last year. The retailer said it was selling a \u00a3299 PS4 games console package every 0.75 seconds.</p> <p>Currys said web traffic was five times higher than last year, with Samsung TVs, DeLonghi coffee machines, iPads, Bose Bluetooth speakers and Hotpoint washing machines most popular. Goods were going through the tills at a rate of eight sales every second.</p> <p>Currys said the only problem with its website was \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d and that it had used a queue system to be fair to customers. \u201cThe deals are stonking, lots of customers getting great deals!\u201d Currys said.</p> <p>The trend for midnight surfing was confirmed by data from Postcode Anywhere which said the number of online visits was up nearly 40% between midnight and 1am, compared with the previous day. The highest number of night-time orders came from Birmingham, Belfast and Glasgow.</p> <h2>Deals worth fighting for</h2> <p><strong>Sainsbury\u2019s</strong></p> <p>Dyson Animal Vac from \u00a3319.99 to \u00a3159.99</p> <p>Blaupunkt 40\u201d TV from \u00a3299.99 to \u00a3149.99</p> <p><strong>Asda </strong></p> <p>Polaroid 40\u201d LED TV from \u00a3219 to \u00a3139</p> <p>Samsung Galaxy Note 8\u201d from \u00a3249 to \u00a3149 Coleman 400 ATV 4X4 Quad Bike at \u00a33,500, from \u00a36,500 Little Tikes Playhouse \u00a349, down from \u00a399.99</p> <p><strong>Carphone Warehous</strong>e</p> <p>\u00a3220 off a HTC One (M8) so there\u2019s no upfront cost, plus \u00a324.99 a month on contract.</p> <p><strong>Currys PC World</strong></p> <p>\u00a380 off Apple MacBooks and iMacs</p> <p>\u00a3400 off Samsung 55\u201d LED TVs</p> <p><strong>John Lewis </strong></p> <p>Half-price Delonghi Prima Donna S Bean-to-Cup coffee machine, stainless steel at \u00a3514.45</p> <p>\u00a3100 savings on Imacs and MacBooks</p> <p>John Lewis 60JL9000 LED HD 1080p 3D Smart TV, 60\u201d with Freeview HD &amp; 2x 3D Glasses down \u00a3400 to \u00a3999</p> <p><strong>Debehams</strong></p> <p>Nespresso Chrome Citiz, \u00a3150 from \u00a3220</p> <p>DKNY Delicious Night Eau de Parfum 50ml \u00a324.50, down from \u00a349</p> <p><strong>Toys R Us</strong></p> <p>MiP, \u00a339.99, down from \u00a379.99</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK retailers have enthusiastically embraced Black Friday, the US\u2019 post-Thanksgiving sales day, offering large discounts and opening many stores at midnight. But there were ugly scenes in some stores as shoppers battled for cut-price products, and the police were called to 15 separate Tesco stores overnight to deal with scuffles. Greater Manchester police said three people were arrested, one woman suffered a broken wrist, a wheelchair-user had a TV dropped on her, and a security guard was punched after disturbances were reported at seven separate Tesco stores in its region. The chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Sir Peter Fahy, has been highly critical of Tesco: The events of last night were totally predictable and I am disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty. This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. Tesco said it would be working with police ahead of next year\u2019s Black Friday to avoid similar scenes. Asda \u2013 where shoppers were knocked to the ground in its Wembley store \u2013 said the rest of its stores were peaceful and extra security had been employed. Big name websites, including Tesco, Curry\u2019s, Argos and John Lewis, struggled to cope this morning with the volume of demand. But retailers were upbeat, with many reporting soaring sales figures. Visa predicted that \u00a3518m will be spent online on cards today, making today the biggest internet shopping day in history in the UK. My colleague Oliver Laughland has ongoing live coverage of Black Friday in the US. This liveblog is closing now. Thank you for reading. My colleague Oliver Laughland in the Guardian\u2019s New York office will be liveblogging US Black Friday developments \u2013 you can keep up with that here. I\u2019ll post a summary of UK Black Friday news on this liveblog shortly. My colleague Lauren Gambino in New York reports that scores of demonstrators in Missouri, around the St Louis area, are taking part in a retail boycott over the death of unarmed teen Michael Brown: The retail boycott, which uses the hashtag #BlackOutBlackFriday on Twitter, is the latest strategy by protesters to draw attention to issues snapped into focus by the Missouri teen\u2019s death: racism, economic inequality and police brutality in America. Monday\u2019s grand jury decision not to indict white policeman Darren Wilson for killing Brown on 9 August led to days of violent protests in a number of American cities. Beginning on Thanksgiving night, dozens of activists turned up at major retailers around the St Louis area with protest signs. They chanted \u2018Hands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u2019, a cadence of the movement, as shoppers whizzed past in search of heavily-discounted TVs and vacuums. The demonstrations, staged at an area Target and multiple Walmarts, were brief and peaceful. As of mid-morning, there had been no reports of arrests related to the protests. In at least one instance, protesters were ordered by police to leave, and they did so peacefully, Reuters reported. More protests are expected throughout the day on Friday. You can read the full report here. More figures here, courtesy of Press Association: Visa has predicted that \u00a3518m will be spent online on cards today, which would mean it is the biggest internet shopping day in history in the UK. It estimates that online transactions will top 8.5 million today alone, up 22% on 2013. Another 500 million is forecast to be spent online on Monday, meaning the UK will shop its way to a \u00a31.7bn \u201ccyber weekend\u201d with a predicted record 31 million online transactions. Almost half of UK shoppers (47%) say they intend to buy a Black Friday deal, according to retail analysts Verdict. Spare a thought for the shop workers dealing with the often \u2026 over-enthusiastic shoppers today. My colleague Jana Kasperkevic has spoken to low-paid retail workers about life behind the bargain signs: These workers earn minimum or near-minimum wage, bringing home less than $1,000 (\u00a3637) a month. In 2013, 468,000 retail workers earned minimum wage or lower. According to Pew Research Center, 1.4 million cashiers \u2013 the most common part-time job \u2013 earn less than $10.10 an hour. Previous interviews with part-time Walmart workers have shown that often they bring anywhere between $200 to $400 home every two weeks. As an economic contribution, this is thin. The workers, despite being employed, end up relying on government assistance in the form of food stamps and housing subsidies. And when the food stamps run out, they turn to their communities and the local food banks. You can read the full interviews here. Another update on the morning\u2019s sales, this time from the New West End Company, which represents stores on Oxford Street in London. It reports a 19.5% uplift in footfall year-on-year between 9am and midday, with a 29% uplift in footfall between 9am and 10am. Jace Tyrrell, deputy chief executive of the New West End Company said: We are expecting a record amount of \u2018lone ranger\u2019 shoppers coming up to Oxford Street to hunt for the perfect gift on their own, as well as families this weekend. Both groups will contribute to our projection of \u00a3150m over a single three-day weekend. Stores are reporting brisk trade this morning \u2026 The relatively new UK phenomenon of Black Friday coincides with the final November pay day, a pivotal purchasing time for gift-buying in the run-up to Christmas. Currys PC World says today has seen its \u201cbiggest ever start to Black Friday\u201d. (I think it is fair to point out that Black Friday is barely of toddler age in the UK.) It reports: Web traffic was up five-fold from last year and stores saw significantly increased footfall throughout the morning. The most popular products were large-screen Samsung TVs, DeLonghi coffee machines, iPads, Bose Bluetooth speakers and Hotpoint washing machines. Overnight 70% of customers shopped via mobile and tablets, switching to 60% logging on from desktops as the morning went on. There have been no reports of fights in stores, says the firm\u2019s e-commerce director, Jeremy Fennell: Across the country we\u2019ve seen customers ready to shop with queues outside a number of stores, but everything has been very well organised and in good spirits, with no reported incidents. A further update to the tally of Tesco stores that called in police last night, taking the total to 15. South Wales police say they were called to four Tesco stores: two in Cardiff, one in Bridgend and one in Merthyr Tydfil. No other stores in the area called in the police, Sarah Butler reports. My picture desk colleagues have put together this gallery of Black Friday images from the US: Gwent police force has confirmed that they were called out to Tesco in Spytty retail park, Newport, at midnight. But they say that crowds were calmed by store staff and police and there were no arrests. That takes it to 12 Tesco stores where police were called in. My colleague Sarah Butler has this analysis on why Tesco stores have seen far more disturbances \u2013 and calls to police \u2013 than other stores: I think Asda learned from their disasters last year and \u2013 at the store I went to this morning in Wembley at least \u2013 they had brought in a lot of extra staff and were carefully controlling the number of shoppers they were letting in the door: only 20 or 30 at a time. There were a few scuffles at the beginning, with some quite hairy looking TV footage from inside the crowd, but it was largely calm. Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s opened their stores at midnight and Tesco opened far more. Sainsbury\u2019s had only five stores open, so the chances of late-night trouble were higher at Tesco. Asda has issued an update on its Black Friday morning trading \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the supermarket\u2019s busiest single day of the year so far, with more than two million transactions between 8am and noon: Over 8,000 TVs were sold in the first 60 minutes. 3,500 Beats by Dre headphones were sold by 9am. Over 1,000 BMX bikes were sold by 9am. Sold out of X Box 360 250GB Console with Halo &amp; Forza by 9am. Over 10,000 tablets sold in the first two hours alone. Asda opened 440 stores for Black Friday deals and says most customers \u201cqueued in an orderly fashion alongside other shoppers\u201d. But a spokesperson added: We do not condone the behaviour of a very small number of people in our Wembley store this morning. Despite our extensive planning and additional security colleagues there was an isolated incident when the store opened. The sale has run smoothly in all our other 440 participating stores. (A 40-inch flatscreen TV on sale at \u00a3139 sparked a crush at Asda\u2019s Wembley store this morning.) While UK shoppers seem to be enthusiastically embracing this US import, reports suggest American interest in Black Friday might be waning a little. Mind you, this might be because some stores began their discounts yesterday, on Thanksgiving itself. The Associated Press files this update: The crowds were thin early Friday morning in parts of the country, but traffic is expected to pick up throughout the day. Analysts and store executives were heartened to see that shoppers seem to be buying more than just the doorbusters. Bridget McNabb, of Kansas City, Kansas, stopped at a mostly empty suburban Target around 5.30am. Friday after a solid day of holiday cooking. \u201cI started the dishwasher and came in,\u201d she said. Her goal was a coffee pot for her niece. But first, the 55-year-old \u2013 who said she was \u201cold enough to know better\u201d than to be out so early \u2013 stopped at the electronics department. \u201cThey have a great deal on a TV my husband wants to get his hands on,\u201d she said. She was only momentarily disappointed after a store worker told her the $119 TV had sold out the night before. \u201cI\u2019ll pop online later,\u201d she said. Last year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2% to $9.74bn, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it\u2019s still uncertain how stores will fare Friday. In a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. This year, it was clear that retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. That could mean plenty of bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed over the discount offerings on Friday. With stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1% to $611.9bn. That would be the biggest increase since 2011. Greater Manchester police has put together a YouTube statement from its deputy chief constable Ian Hopkins, addressing the behaviour of Tesco shoppers \u2013 and the retailer itself \u2013 last night: In it, Hopkins says \u201cpeople have been trampling on each other\u201d. Scenes in some Tesco stores overnight were, he adds, \u201cakin to a mini riot\u201d. He says that in Tesco stores across Greater Manchester: Three people were arrested. One woman suffered a broken wrist. One wheelchair-user had a TV dropped on them. A security guard was punched. People need to take a long hard look at themselves and ask, what on earth was I doing? Tesco should have had appropriate security and stewards, Hopkins adds, pointing out that GMP has lost 1,500 officers in the last three years and does not want to use its \u201cscarce resources\u201d on \u201cpredictable\u201d events such as these. The Associated Press has filed a round-up as Black Friday sales get underway in the US: Millions of Americans are expected to head out in search of steep discounts today. The National Retail Federation forecasts holiday sales will grow 4.1% to $616.9bn, the biggest jump since 2011. It\u2019s a make-or-break time for many retailers, which on average get 20% of their annual sales during the holiday shopping season. Businesses are taking steps to keep crowds under control. Such efforts were stepped up after 2008, when a Wal-Mart worker died after a stampede of shoppers. Best Buy, for instance, has a ticketing and line process that starts two hours before doorbusters to ensure an orderly entrance into its stores. The company also says stores held training sessions last weekend to prep for this weekend\u2019s rush. At Target, deals are spread throughout the stores and signs direct shoppers to hot items. And the company says every store has a crowd-management captain for inside and outside the store. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone remembers their manners. Wendy Iscra noted it got a little competitive at Wal-Mart in a Chicago suburb where she where she was shopping Thanksgiving. \u2018People were shoving each other in there,\u2019 the 40-year-old said. The National Retail Federation expected 25.6 million shoppers to head to stores on Thanksgiving, which would be slightly down from last year. The numbers aren\u2019t in yet, but there were crowds across the country. Macy\u2019s said more than 15,000 people were lined up outside its flagship location in New York City\u2019s Herald Square when the doors opened at 6pm. In the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois, the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store was full about a half hour before deals started at 6pm., including $199 iPad minis. And thousands of people were at Citadel Outlets in Los Angeles, which opened at 8pm on Thanksgiving for a \u2018Moonlight Madness\u2019 all-night sale. Hordes of cars inched past rows of palm trees wrapped in red and white lights. Sky News reports that Tesco has put out a statement after police were called to several of its stores last night, and the chief constable of Greater Manchester police criticised the retailer for \u201cinsufficient\u201d security: In the interests of customer safety, a small number of stores contacted police last night to help control crowds. Tesco says it is working with police ahead of next year\u2019s Black Friday sales. Sarah Butler sends a further update, this time from Police Scotland: Police in Scotland confirmed they were called to only one store \u2013 Tesco in Dundee, where they were called out because concerns about a large crowd. There were no arrests. That makes 11 UK Tesco stores where police were called. I think Nasa might have won Black Friday: A quick reminder for those not terrified into hiding by the coverage of Black Friday so far that our updated guide to the best deals today can be found here. The chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Sir Peter Fahy, has been highly critical of the Tesco stores that witnessed outbreaks of violence and overcrowding last night: The events of last night were totally predictable and I am disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty. This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. It does not help that this was in the early hours when police resources are already stretched. Across Greater Manchester large supermarkets already make significant demands on policing through calls to shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and thefts of fuel from their petrol stations \u2013 much of which is preventable. We just ask these stores to work with us to reduce the demands on policing and reduce the risks of disorder and crime. Greater Manchester police has now sent us this statement. It says two arrests were made, and one woman taken off in an ambulance with minor injuries, after disturbances were reported at seven separate Tesco stores in greater Manchester: Police have been called to seven Tesco stores across Greater Manchester following disturbances at Black Friday sales events. At 11.37pm on Thursday 27 November 2014, officers were called to Tesco Central Park, Wigan after reports of several hundred people trying to enter the store. Two men were ejected before control was regained. Officers were also called to Tesco on Ashton Road West at 11.40pm yesterday, after more than 500 people attended the store. The Tesco store at Ellesmere Shopping Centre in Walkden was closed down after a crowd of more than 500 people attended. Shoppers were asked to leave. The Tesco Extra in Stretford was closed after fights broke out between shoppers trying to get their hands on sale stock. A woman suffered minor injuries after being hit by a falling television and an ambulance was called. The store was closed at 12.36am, just over half an hour after the sales event started. Shortly after 1.05am on Friday 28th November 2014, police were called to Tesco on Woodrow Way, Salford. One man was arrested on suspicion of assault after his conduct in store was challenged by staff. He threatened to \u2018smash\u2019 a staff member\u2019s face in. At 12.40am on Thursday, officers were called to Tesco Extra on Barton Road, Middleton, following reports that around 200 people would not leave, despite being told stock had all gone. Doors had been locked but they refused to leave. No arrests were made. Shortly after 12.05am on Friday, police called to Tesco Extra on Stockport Road, Hattersley, following reports of fighting in store. Approximately 300 people were present in store and staff were advised to close. One man was arrested for a public order offence. My colleague Sarah Butler sends an update on calls to police from Black Friday stores: Greater Manchester police say they were called out to seven Tesco stores today; the London Metropolitan police confirmed they had been called to three Tesco stores. Both forces said they hadn\u2019t been called to any other stores. Sainsbury\u2019s says no police were called to any of its stores and there was no \u2018major disruption\u2019. She reports that the chaos and shopper-shouldering \u2013 at Tesco stores and elsewhere \u2013 now seem to be mostly under control. Some images from Black Friday sales. This is Currys PC World in Solihull: These from the US \u2013 South Portland, Maine: And a cheerful-looking queue in Wembley, north London: Manchester shopper Jamie Hook, speaking to BBC News now, is saying that Tesco staff last night were \u201cdiving for cover\u201d as Black Friday shoppers piled on to bargains, \u201cclimbing over self-service tills \u2026 I could hear shouting\u201d. Staff members had to block an exit with trollies, he says. He left with only the grocery shopping he\u2019d gone in for, he says: \u201cNo bargains.\u201d A spokesperson for John Lewis sends this update on the retailer\u2019s morning, predicting it will be their biggest-ever single day of online trading. \u201cAll of the shops successfully opened at 8am\u201d, which admittedly is not something that normally needs pointing out. But these are not normal times \u2026 The website started churning out deals from midnight, and here are some stats for the period from then until 7am: Between the hours of midnight and 6am, traffic to johnlewis.com was up 307% on Black Friday 2013. The biggest peak was between 12am and 1am as people went online to get the best deals. Traffic on smartphones made up 40% of total visits to the site. John Lewis is currently selling one Nutribullet* every 30 seconds. The fastest selling deal so far is the Apple iPad mini, Apple A5, iOS 7, at \u00a3199. (*Had to google Nutribullet, which looks to be a juicer that \u201cbursts open seeds, cracks through stems, and shreds tough skins\u201d. Just \u00a369.95 today, seed-haters.) Good afternoon, this is Claire Phipps taking over from my hardworking colleagues Jennifer Rankin and Hilary Osborne, who need to nip off for a cut-price coffee maker. The Black Friday rush continues in UK stores, of course, plus shoppers in the eastern reaches of the US are currently waking up (those who haven\u2019t been camping outside stores overnight, that is) to their own set of bargains/Vines of people elbowing each other for Hoovers. We\u2019ll have updates throughout the day. Sarah Butler, the Guardian\u2019s retail correspondent, has just been speaking to police in London. She reports: Metropolitan police said they had only been called to three supermarkets and they were all Tescos - in Edmonton, Willesden and Surrey Quays. They said there had been no arrests or serious disturbances.. One theory on the origins of Black Friday... I expect retailers prefer the explanation that it is the day in their financial year when they start making profits. Still confused about why adults are fighting each other for flat-screen TVs in the small hours of the morning? Then you need to read Dean Burnett\u2019s guide to surviving Black Friday... Functioning humans are seemingly reduced to the mentality of swarming creatures mindlessly desperate to obtain something. It\u2019s like piranhas attacking a cow carcass, except instead of a cow it\u2019s a discount flatscreen TV, and instead of teeth the piranhas have credit cards. This analogy does break down a bit admittedly, but not as much as social norms on Black Friday, so I feel it\u2019s warranted. Read on here More scenes of mayhem at Asda in Wembley courtesy of the chief correspondent of ITV\u2019s Good Morning show. A tussle for a TV at the same Asda. It is not just Britain that has imported America\u2019s Black Friday madness. The shopping days has also taken of in Brazil, as shown by this scene from Sao Paulo. Kenneth Rapoza, a contributor to Forbes, told the Toronto Star that the event has become more popular in Brazil. It\u2019s not crazy like in the US, but there are more stores participating every year. It\u2019s a cultural phenomenon in Brazil because Brazil in general, and especially the middle class and wealthy Brazilians, love to copy American culture. But the joke on the street is that customers are paying 50% less for items that have been marked up by 200%, he said. Birmingham had the highest number of people doing online shopping in the small hours, according to data crunchers at Postcode Anywhere. The researchers looked at the number of people logging onto retail websites between midnight and 8am this morning. I haven\u2019t seen any numbers, but here are their top ten online shopping cities. Birmingham Belfast Glasgow Manchester Newcastle Sheffield Liverpool London Nottingham Cardiff The leader of the Scottish National Party council group in Inverclyde, Christopher McEleny, has an idea for an alternative to today\u2019s shopping frenzy. Internet experts are also faulting retailers for not doing enough to ready their websites, for the Black Friday surge in demand. Big name websites, including Tesco, Curry\u2019s, Argos and John Lewis have been struggling to cope this morning. Michael Allen, vice president of Dynatrace, a company that advises firms on apps and websites, said the failings will damage their brands. Brands know that their digital channels are strategic, but seems like they still struggle to be fully prepared. Digital channels demand the same level of planning and commitment as, for instance, physical stores hiring extra staff on the floor today to cope with demand. In addition, when executed well, Web sites and mobile apps barely need additional staff for this important day. An update on that last post: at 9.35 this morning, Greater Manchester police had arrested three people at different supermarkets. One of the UK\u2019s most senior police officers has blamed retailers for not providing enough security, after Black Friday discounts sparked chaos and violence around the country. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said the stampede was entirely predictable. The events of last night were totally predictable and I am disappointed that stores did not have sufficient security staff on duty. This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. It does not help that this was in the early hours when police resources are already stretched. Across Greater Manchester large supermarkets already make significant demands on policing through calls to shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and thefts of fuel from their petrol stations - much of which is preventable. Greater Manchester police took to social media to try and stop the madness. Here is a quick rundown of the mayhem Shortly before midnight there were reports of several hundred people trying to enter Tesco Central Park in Wigan. Two men were ejected before control was regained. The Tesco at Ellesmere Shopping Centre in Walkden was closed after a crowd of more than 500 people turned up. The Tesco Extra in Stretford was closed after fights broke out between shoppers trying to get their hands on sale stock. A woman was injured by a falling television and an ambulance was called. Via Press Association My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty wrote earlier this year about Edmonton in north London, where some of the scenes of chaos took place overnight. This morning he tweeted: Here are some of the scenes at Asda in Wembley this morning, via Sarah Butler, who was there when the doors opened. Shoppers were welcomed by cheerleaders, belting out Asda songs. For some shoppers the main point was getting a bargain and it didn\u2019t really matter what it was. Tesco\u2019s website seems to have recovered - and has some offers left: \u00a350 off an iPad mini seems to be one of the better deals, along with a Blaupunkt 50\u201d HD LED TV. Over at Amazon, you\u2019d better act fast if you want to bag a Frolicat Bolt Automatic Laser Light at a hefty 58% off, as the deal ends in just over an hour. Is that the worst deal out there? Let us know if you spot anything you\u2019re less inclined to buy. There is the usual Twitter backlash - not just reporting on the chaotic scenes, but commenting on the chaos: Just looking at the Currys site again and now there\u2019s 30 minute wait: Earlier we reported on Currys online queue (7am). More from Sarah Butler again, this time on TVs, which seem the focal point of today\u2019s bargain hunting: As if the scenes from shops around the country are not eye-popping enough, this website claims to be using data from Visa to show how much Brits have spent so far in real-time - it currently reckons that \u00a3212m has gone through the tills. High street stores were expecting to bag \u00a3200m from the day, so they might be in line for an early Christmas present. A warning from the police (HT @SimonNeville): More videos from the Twittersphere: Vine has some ugly scenes: Sarah continues: Asda in Wembley had 50 people in store just to manage BF event, double amount from last year, and the same again on the tills, elsewhere in the shop. Estimate between 400 and 500 in the queue and they were still letting them in in batches at 9 ... Sarah reports: Vinay, the first in the queue at Asda in Wembley said he had arrived at 1am. \u201cI got a cab as I came yesterday and they told me to get here early. There was no-one here but it was worth it. The TV was so cheap I had to come.\u201d My colleague Sarah Butler is as Asda in Wembley and has been since the doors opened at 8am. Follow @whatbutlersaw for minute-by-minute updates Two people have been arrested in Manchester, according to this tweet from the local police: At the same time as shoppers were deluging stores, others were logging on from home to bag online deals - or rather trying to. Before midnight, Currys\u2019 website already had a virtual queuing system in place, and as the clock ticked over into Friday, other retailers\u2019 websites started to crack under the pressure. Tesco\u2019s website is still suffering: Good morning and welcome to our Black Friday blog. This is the first year that the event has been adopted on such scale in the UK, with most major retailers promising a host of limited special offers. Unfortunately as well as importing the deals, we also seem to have imported the in-store mayhem that\u2019s become familiar in the US. My colleague Rupert Neate was in north London overnight - here he reports scenes of chaos: \u201cPeople were behaving like animals, it was horrible,\u201d said one shopper. \u201cI only saw two security guards.\u201d",

Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, says it\u2019s still uncertain how stores will fare Friday.</p> <p>In a fiercely competitive retailing climate, stores have been opening earlier into Thanksgiving. <strong>This year, it was clear that retailers pushed the best deals to Thanksgiving to get shoppers first before they run out of money. </strong>That could mean plenty of bargain hunters who wanted to keep Thanksgiving sacred will feel disappointed over the discount offerings on Friday.</p> <p>With stores offering more deals earlier in the month, the holiday weekend has become less important. But the period still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales are expected to rise 4.1% to $611.9bn. That would be the biggest increase since 2011.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e60ad18881327f9829361aaccdd908fd5353e0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417183267808/000a6145-7dab-48f8-ab51-8c1189687107-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bargain hunters outside a Target store in Fairfax, Virginia, showing British shoppers how to queue nicely\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bargain hunters outside a Target store in Fairfax, Virginia, showing British shoppers how to queue nicely</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5478790be4b0cee6fa56267e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-28T13:38:08.646Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greater Manchester police</strong> has put together a YouTube statement from its deputy chief constable <strong>Ian Hopkins</strong>, addressing the behaviour of Tesco shoppers \u2013 and the retailer itself \u2013 last night:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6mrAOR0yLg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6mrAOR0yLg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins talks about the issued raised by Black Friday shopping.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In it, Hopkins says \u201cpeople have been trampling on each other\u201d.

It\u2019s a make-or-break time for many retailers, which on average get 20% of their annual sales during the holiday shopping season.</p> <p>Businesses are taking steps to keep crowds under control. Such efforts were stepped up after 2008, when a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/29/wal-mart-blackfriday-shoppersstampede\">Wal-Mart worker died after a stampede of shoppers</a>.</p> <p>Best Buy, for instance, has a ticketing and line process that starts two hours before doorbusters to ensure an orderly entrance into its stores. The company also says stores held training sessions last weekend to prep for this weekend\u2019s rush.</p> <p>At Target, deals are spread throughout the stores and signs direct shoppers to hot items. And the company says every store has a crowd-management captain for inside and outside the store.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t mean everyone remembers their manners. Wendy Iscra noted it got a little competitive at Wal-Mart in a Chicago suburb where she where she was shopping Thanksgiving. \u2018People were shoving each other in there,\u2019 the 40-year-old said.</p> <p><strong>The National Retail Federation expected 25.6 million shoppers to head to stores on Thanksgiving, which would be slightly down from last year</strong>. The numbers aren\u2019t in yet, but there were crowds across the country.<br></p> <p>Macy\u2019s said more than 15,000 people were lined up outside its flagship location in New York City\u2019s Herald Square when the doors opened at 6pm. In the Chicago suburb of Naperville, Illinois, the parking lot of a Wal-Mart store was full about a half hour before deals started at 6pm., including $199 iPad minis.</p> <p>And thousands of people were at Citadel Outlets in Los Angeles, which opened at 8pm on Thanksgiving for a \u2018Moonlight Madness\u2019 all-night sale. Hordes of cars inched past rows of palm trees wrapped in red and white lights.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10bc73fed925d094cbecb9880e367bfd15c34656\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417181063590/e7d80648-b1d7-49fa-acc6-1ae89776a61e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Shoppers entering the Macy's store in New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers entering the Macy\u2019s store in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Taggart/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-28T13:26:37.765Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54787441e4b078686e9c2e54\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-28T13:14:52.197Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tesco statement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sky News reports that <strong>Tesco</strong> has put out a statement after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/nov/28/black-friday-uk-shoppers-fight-for-bargains-at-london-supermarkets-live#block-54787347e4b00d7876ba1b4a\">police were called to several of its stores</a> last night, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2014/nov/28/black-friday-uk-shoppers-fight-for-bargains-at-london-supermarkets-live#block-54786d8ae4b00d7876ba1b44\">chief constable of Greater Manchester police criticised the retailer</a> for \u201cinsufficient\u201d security:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the interests of customer safety, a small number of stores contacted police last night to help control crowds.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tesco says it is working with police ahead of next year\u2019s Black Friday sales.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54787347e4b00d7876ba1b4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-28T13:08:03.724Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sarah Butler </strong>sends a further update, this time from Police Scotland:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Police in Scotland confirmed they were called to only one store \u2013 Tesco in Dundee, where they were called out because concerns about a large crowd.

BG\u2019s shares were the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, closing more than 8% down, which will affect the ultimate value of the shares awarded to Lund.</p> <p>The package is causing controversy with investors because it breaches a pay policy they agreed to only six months ago. It includes a salary set at \u00a31.5m for five years and is around seven times more than Lund earned at Statoil. The salary alone, according to Glass Lewis, is more than 30% above that of the bosses of BP and Royal Dutch Shell, the other two main rivals listed in London.</p> <p>The vote is regarded as a major test for investors as BG is the first major company to have broken its own policy since the business secretary, Vince Cable, introduced rules last year guaranteeing shareholders such a say over long-term pay.</p> <p>Deborah Gilshan, the corporate governance counsel at Railpen, said she would not back the award.</p> <p>\u201cRailpen will not be supporting this pay package at the meeting on 15 December as we do not consider it is in the long-term interests of our beneficiaries.</p> <p>\u201cWe are now calling on the fund management industry to consider the long-term interests of their clients by voting against this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a situation no board should put its shareholders in and our concerns are not limited to the situation at BG Group itself but the wider implications it has for the UK marketplace,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Legal &amp; General, which owns 2.7% of BG\u2019s shares, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/24/bg-group-boss-pay-deal-criticised\" title=\"\">spoke out earlier this week</a> to say that BG could set a precedent by abandoning its pay policy so quickly. Aviva also said it was concerned.</p> <p>A BG spokesman said: \u201cWe believe Helge Lund is the right person to lead BG Group. His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry. The shareholder vote on Helge Lund\u2019s pay is in line with the letter and spirit of corporate governance legislation.\u201d</p>", 
      "bodyText": "BG Group is facing mounting criticism over a \u00a325m pay deal for its new chief executive, with all the main investor advisory bodies raising concerns about the package offered to Helge Lund. The influential US-based advisor Glass Lewis on Friday added to the chorus of dissenting voices by saying shareholders in the oil and gas group should reject the package as it stands. There are expectations that the company will meet investors for discussions over the package for Lund, who is being offered a one-off \u00a312m in shares and up to \u00a313.5m a year if he hits performance targets. The award of shares is being put to a vote scheduled for 15 December and the company has warned shareholders that Lund is \u201cnot obliged\u201d to join the company if it is not approved.

Glass Lewis\u2019s verdict comes after those of rival advisory bodies ISS, the Investment Management Association, Manifest and Pirc. This heaps pressure on the BG chairman, Andrew Gould \u2013who has been standing in as chief executive since April and recruited Lund \u2013 as well as the chairman of the remuneration committee, Sir John Hood. Manifest has suggested the meeting should not go ahead for now and Glass Lewis said that as Lund was not due to join until March there was \u201csufficient time to revise the terms of the award, or devise an alternative award structure under the existing policy\u201d. Attaching new performance targets to the award of shares may help defuse the situation, as Glass Lewis said the current ones were \u201csomewhat vague personal objectives that appear to set the bar quite low\u201d. The row over pay comes as BG\u2019s shares were sent sliding on Friday after Thursday\u2019s decision by the major oil-producing countries not to cut production to shore up world oil prices. BG\u2019s shares were the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, closing more than 8% down, which will affect the ultimate value of the shares awarded to Lund. The package is causing controversy with investors because it breaches a pay policy they agreed to only six months ago. It includes a salary set at \u00a31.5m for five years and is around seven times more than Lund earned at Statoil. The salary alone, according to Glass Lewis, is more than 30% above that of the bosses of BP and Royal Dutch Shell, the other two main rivals listed in London. The vote is regarded as a major test for investors as BG is the first major company to have broken its own policy since the business secretary, Vince Cable, introduced rules last year guaranteeing shareholders such a say over long-term pay. Deborah Gilshan, the corporate governance counsel at Railpen, said she would not back the award. \u201cRailpen will not be supporting this pay package at the meeting on 15 December as we do not consider it is in the long-term interests of our beneficiaries. \u201cWe are now calling on the fund management industry to consider the long-term interests of their clients by voting against this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a situation no board should put its shareholders in and our concerns are not limited to the situation at BG Group itself but the wider implications it has for the UK marketplace,\u201d she said. Legal &amp; General, which owns 2.7% of BG\u2019s shares, spoke out earlier this week to say that BG could set a precedent by abandoning its pay policy so quickly. Aviva also said it was concerned. A BG spokesman said: \u201cWe believe Helge Lund is the right person to lead BG Group. His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry. The shareholder vote on Helge Lund\u2019s pay is in line with the letter and spirit of corporate governance legislation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI got a Dyson but I don\u2019t even know if I want it. I just picked it up,\u201d Louise Haggerty, a 56-year-old hairdresser and waitress, said of her 1am trip to the Black Friday sales. \u201cIt was mental in there. It was crazy. It was absolutely disgusting, disgusting.\u201d Haggerty had ventured out to the 24-hour Sainsbury\u2019s in Harringay, north-east London, with a friend in the hope of snapping up a bargain flat screen TV. \u201cBut so many people pushed in the queue we didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe poor woman who was second in the queue was pushed out by the crowd of youths, she didn\u2019t get anything. \u201cPeople were behaving like animals, it was horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI only saw two security guards.\u201d Frustrated with not being able to buy a Blaupunkt 40\u201d TV reduced from \u00a3299.99 to \u00a3149.99, Haggerty rushed to pick up a Dyson Animal Vac, down from \u00a3319.99 to \u00a3159.99. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how much it costs, I don\u2019t know even know if I\u2019m going to buy it. I just wanted something,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lads in there three, four, five tellies. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d One of those lads was Andy Blackett, 30, an estate agent, who had two trolleys full of bargains. \u201cI got two coffee makers, two tablets, two TVs and a stereo,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you the prices, but I know they\u2019re bargains.\u201d But his mate Henry Fischer, a 19-year-old student, wasn\u2019t as successful. \u201cSomeone snatched my telly from me \u2013 it\u2019s cos I\u2019m the smaller one.\u201d Blackett, Fischer and some mates had driven to Sainsbury\u2019s at 12.45am after retreating from the \u201cbedlam\u201d of Tesco\u2019s 24-hour Lea Valley store, where the Black Friday sale started at midnight. \u201cTesco was scary so we came here instead,\u201d Blackett said. More than a dozen police officers attended the Tesco store on Glover Drive, Upper Edmonton, as scuffles broke out between eager and frustrated shoppers. Customers were seen tearing down cardboard hoardings put in place to hold back sale items until the stroke of midnight. Tesco delayed the sale of its most popular sale items \u2013 TVs \u2013 for almost an hour until police brought the situation under control. One officer was overheard criticising the manager for failing to ensure adequate security and suggested the sale should be suspended altogether. The Tesco store is across the road from an Ikea that was the scene of riots when it opened with a midnight sale in 2005. Police intervened at other stores including Tesco in Willesden and Surrey Quays, just before the doors opened at midnight. Greater Manchester Police said at least two people have been arrested at Black Friday sales events already this morning. The force said on its Twitter feed: \u201cKeep calm people!\u201d. South Wales Police also reported receiving a number of calls from staff at Tesco stores after they became \u201cconcerned due to the volume of people who had turned up to sale events\u201d. One of the first purchasers of a flatscreen TV, when TV sales began just before 1am, was James Alled, 30, a businessman, who bought two and was already negotiating to sell one of them to someone further down the queue. \u201cI bought them for \u00a3250, I\u2019ll sell it to you for \u00a3350, \u00a3300 cash,\u201d he said. Further back in the queue Christine Ball, 62, wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI got here at 10.15pm and I\u2019m further back now than when I got here\u201d she said. \u201cNone of that lot know what a queue is.\u201d Ball, who like most of the shoppers had not heard of the US-inspired Black Friday sales until this year, said she had come out especially to buy her grandson a TV for Christmas. \u201cNot one of those massive ones, just a normal one at \u00a3100 or so,\u201d she said. In her basket was a pint of semi-skimmed and a loaf of bread. \u201cTelly, milk and bread \u2013 the necessities,\u201d she said. Mel Mehmet, 23, had been to Black Friday sales last year and had expected queues, but said the atmosphere in Tesco scared her this time. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy really having it a midnight \u2013 the police must have more important things to do at night than be called to sales. \u201cWe\u2019re going to PC World first thing, their sale starts at 8am.\u201d Online the scenes were less hectic but shoppers still faced frustrations: Currys had a waiting list for customers, who had to join a queue (see above). Those eager to snap up bargains on John Lewis also faced similar problems.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s low-wage recovery has restricted income tax receipts and wrecked the government\u2019s plans to cut the deficit, according to a TUC study. The trades union body said the government is collecting \u00a317bn less in income tax this year than predicted by the government\u2019s independent forecaster. The TUC said: \u201cIf earnings growth had been in line with the forecast made in June 2010 by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), income tax receipts this year would be \u00a3176bn. But the Treasury is now expected to collect just \u00a3159bn in 2014/15 \u2013 \u00a317bn less than forecast.\u201d Coming only days ahead of George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement, the figures highlight the difficulties facing the chancellor as he seeks to close the gap between government income and spending. The public finances improved slightly in October but the Treasury is still unlikely to meet its budget goals before next year\u2019s general election. Osborne said in March he aimed to slim the budget deficit by more than 10% over the following 12 months, helped by Britain\u2019s fast-recovering economy. The October shortfall was a bit narrower than expected but the creation of low-wage jobs, which entitle workers to tax credits and housing benefit, has knocked him off course. Economists said the chancellor\u2019s target looks almost impossible to hit. Osborne is due to present a half-yearly budget update next week, which will probably include higher borrowing forecasts, leaving little scope to offer sweeteners to voters. Analysts said low corporation tax receipts were as much to blame for this year\u2019s shortfall as lacklustre income tax payments for the continuing hole in the government\u2019s finances. But the TUC said a recovery that has delivered mostly part-time and self-employed jobs ranks as a major factor undermining the Treasury\u2019s ability to cut the annual spending deficit. The OBR\u2019s forecasts in 2010 were considered cautious at the time after it assumed wage increases would be lower than the pre-recession trend. According to TUC figures, a line drawn from the pre-recession years to the current year would show a trend taking income tax receipts to \u00a3189bn, or \u00a330bn more than the figure now expected. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s failure to get wages growing again has not only left families far worse off than in 2010, it\u2019s put the public finances in a mess too.\u201d She said the the economy had become adept at creating low-paid jobs, but not the better paid work that brings in income tax. In response to calls for further welfare cuts to balance the budget over the life of the next parliament, O\u2019Grady added: \u201cWe can\u2019t cut our way out of this problem any more than we can dig ourselves out of a hole. More austerity would only keep us stuck in a downward spiral. The chancellor should use next week\u2019s autumn statement to invest in growth and to put a wages recovery at the top of the agenda.\u201d",
