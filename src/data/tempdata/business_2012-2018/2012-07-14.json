      "bodyText": "The \"London Whale\", Bruno Iksil \u2013 the JP Morgan trader who oversaw a catastrophic series of complex bets at its City headquarters, and who was finally harpooned on Friday \u2013 is now estimated to have cost his employer $5.8bn and counting. Mike Cavanagh, the man JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon put in charge of investigating what went wrong, told investors he had uncovered \"numerous embedded risks that this team did not understand and were not equipped to manage\". The mathematical model the bank was using to assess the risks of its almighty bets was, Cavanagh said, \"sloppy and incompetent\". At first sight, the whale's costly voyage through the choppy seas of finance appears to be another cautionary tale, after the Libor scandal, about the immoral and reckless behaviour of the banking class. It is: but it can also been seen as compelling new evidence that today's sprawling financial institutions, with balance sheets the size of countries, have simply become too big and complex to manage or regulate effectively.

In fact, Iksil was taking such huge bets on a little-known index known as CDX IG 9 that he was distorting the entire market. The fact that many banks had been allowed to become \"too big to fail\" was one of the major lessons policymakers took away from the tumultuous events of 2008 and 2009, when taxpayers around the world paid such a heavy price for preventing the financial system from collapsing. Ever since, they have focused on equipping regulators with new powers, and trying to insulate ordinary savers' deposits from the banks' riskiest activities, through the much-amended Volcker rule in the US, and the Vickers reforms in the UK. Yet none of this tackles the mighty power of banks that remain too big to fail, too dominant across too many markets to offer genuine competition to savers, and \u2013 as Dimon's failure to hunt down the whale ultimately shows \u2013 too big to manage. Buckles now has little security at G4S Asked by the New Statesman in April this year to sum up his leadership style in three words, G4S chief executive Nick Buckles replied: \"No excuses, please.\" It was a line entirely in tune with the polished corporate image that G4S is a hard-driving, top-performing services company that delivers on its promises. Yes, there have been cock-ups over the years \u2013 escaping prisoners and so on \u2013 but they tended to be isolated incidents.

But it's hard to imagine him in his post come the Christmas re-runs of the sporting highlights. More of the same in Spain Just a fortnight has passed since the Brussels summit when Spain claimed to have wrung crucial concessions from the formerly immovable Frau Merkel. Spain would be given an extra year to meet its deficit targets, and allowed to receive rescue funds directly into its clapped-out banking sector without the ignominy of a full-blown bailout. But the briefest glance at Mariano Rajoy's latest budget cuts, announced last week and worth an extraordinary \u20ac65bn over two years, should be enough to disabuse anyone who thought the cult of austerity was waning in the eurozone. Rajoy may have avoided the humiliation of a team of inspectors from the International Monetary Fund picking over his policies, but analysts pointed out that the harsh package, including a VAT rise and swingeing cuts in local government, was almost exactly what they would have prescribed. As Dario Perkins of Lombard Street Research put it last week: \"Just when you fear sense and pragmatism might prevail, European policymakers resort to type and order is restored.\"",

      "bodyText": "Charting a path from school or university into the 21st century workplace was already tough for young people even before the Great Recession tore into businesses throughout the country and left more than a million under-24-year-olds unemployed. But a new report, produced jointly by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the TUC and thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), calls for urgent action to make Britain's complex labour market more \"youth friendly\", and prevent a generation of young people being trapped in unemployment \u2013 particularly those who leave school at 16 or 18. Richard Excell, of the TUC, one of the co-authors of the report, said: \"Possibly the key economic task coming out of the crisis is how we create an economic model that has job opportunities for people with less than degree-level skills.\" Katerina Rudiger, of the CIPD, says that's not just a challenge for schools, but for businesses too. \"We have got a bit frustrated with the public debate on this because quite often it centres around young people not having the right skills, and we think that's a bit too simplistic,\" she says. \"Employers are much more engaged in other countries, and they really see it as part of their responsibility to prepare young people for work.\" The report says: \"Compared to other northern European countries, young people in the UK are largely left to navigate the transition to work and responsible adulthood alone, and the support they receive varies wildly across different families, communities and employers.\" In Germany, for example, with its famously powerful manufacturing sector, there is a clear route from school into a carefully structured apprenticeship for the many young people who choose not to pursue a university education. In total there are 1.5m apprentices, studying one of 342 subjects, in what is known as a \"dual-learning\" system. Employers \u2013 in co-operation with unions \u2013 provide on-the-job training for three days a week, while state governments set the curriculum for the two days a week students spend in the classroom. Studying for an apprenticeship usually takes three years. Lutz Ewald, from the department of vocational training at the German trade union IG Metall, says apprenticeships give young people both \"practical experience and theoretical knowledge\". \"It gives a perspective for young people and it minimises the risk of unemployment,\" he says. The British coalition government has been keen to expand apprenticeships as part of its solution to rising youth unemployment, and the number has quadrupled over the past four years, to more than 450,000 in 2011; but only a small minority of these posts appear to have gone to young people plucked from the dole queue. Last year, 70% of apprenticeships went to firms' existing employees, instead of new staff brought in from outside. There have also been concerns about the quality of some of the training offered. A recent report by the public accounts committee found that a fifth of adult apprenticeships \u2013 those for over-19s \u2013 lasted just six months or less, and warned that these short courses were likely to be of \"no real benefit\". However, Rod Kenyon, director of employers' group the Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network (AAN), says a good, well-planned apprenticeship can leave a young person with excellent preparation for the real world of work. He says: \"You will find that many of the leading figures in engineering and manufacturing now were former apprentices.\" He concedes that there is less evidence about the effectiveness of apprenticeships in sectors such as retailing and IT, where they are less well established. But in engineering, for example, he says the school-leaver who has spent a couple of years in a workplace, earning money and developing their skills, is \"a formidably good candidate, relative to the rather raw academic graduate who's just sat in lectures\". Apart from the question of whether some apprenticeships offer the right kind of grounding for young people, the report also raises the question of whether schools do enough to equip students for the world of work, or guide them about what options are available. Kenyon of the AAN says: \"I think some of the issues go back to schools, and what happens in schools, and preparing people for work: that's where the damage is done. That's where the 16-year-old falls down, because he's not been given the right equipment to go to an employer and say, 'take me on'.\" Professor Chris Winch, of King's College, London, an expert in education policy, told a seminar at the IPPR last week for the launch of the report: \"Botched entry into the labour market can have long-term effects on young people.\" He cited the example of the Austrian system of careers education, in which guidance is given to both parents and pupils, starting in their fifth year of schooling; and where in their final years, each child is given 32 hours of careers education a year, including work placements. In England, by contrast, legislation forces schools to \"secure access to\" independent and impartial careers advice; but as of 2011, when the latest Education Act came into force, the government does not specify how much time must be spent on it, and it need not be face-to-face: schools can choose to direct pupils to a website or telephone helpline, for example. Yet, Winch argues: \"If there is high youth unemployment, that would seem to make the need for careers guidance all the more pressing.\" Tim Thomas, head of employment affairs at manufacturers' group the EEF, places the responsibility firmly on the shoulders of schools. \"The overwhelming evidence that we get is that young people coming out of schools are ill-prepared for the workplace. That's coming from companies of all sizes, in all parts of the country.\" Martina Milburn, chief executive of the Prince's Trust, says: \"I think there is a big disconnect between the skills businesses need and the things we teach in schools \u2013 and I also think young people are not being given the vision of what they can achieve.\" She describes a scheme run by the trust called \"Get Into\", which works with employers to prepare young unemployed people from disadvantaged backgrounds for an apprenticeship. A recent example involved Waitrose, which took 12 young people who had been unemployed for periods of up to eight years into its logistics department, matching each with a mentor and giving them support and a clear idea of the potential career paths they could follow. Eight months later, 10 are still in jobs with the firm. There are plenty more examples of firms working constructively with local schools: Mike Jones, head of human resources at Siemens UK, cites the firm's \"Girls Into Engineering\" programme, which tries to enthuse Year Nine students about potential careers. \"It's a really important thing for us: we call it our 'entry-level pipeline',\" he says. \"We need to get the right people coming in from schools.\" But the problem identified in this latest study is that where some European countries have a systematic, structured approach that connects young people, employers and education-providers, the UK has a smattering of forward-thinking, well-intentioned firms and charities, struggling to pick up the many young people who have fallen down the gap between education and work.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At six o'clock on a dreary Monday evening, an exhausted Marcus Agius walked into the Bank of England to meet its governor, Sir Mervyn King. Less than 12 hours earlier, Agius \u2013 a quietly spoken, old-school former investment banker \u2013 had announced his decision to quit as the chairman of Barclays, proclaiming that the buck stopped with him for the Libor-fixing fiasco. Agius had hoped that his personal sacrifice would take the heat off Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, who had spent the day rehearsing for what looked likely to be a bruising hearing before the Treasury select committee in 48 hours' time. But no sooner had Agius stepped into the meeting with the governor than it became obvious that his resignation was far from the end of the story. Instead, King made it clear in no uncertain terms that it was Diamond who must go. With less than 12 months left before his 10 turbulent years at the top of the Bank draw to a close, King's bold move against Diamond must have been taken with at least one eye on history. As other players in the dramatic days of 2007 and 2008, including the then-chancellor Alistair Darling, have given their versions of events, King's record has come under close scrutiny. He has been accused of failing to grasp the seriousness of the situation during the fraught build-up to the Northern Rock rescue in 2007, lecturing MPs about the \"moral hazard\" of bailing out institutions just days before emergency assistance had to be extended to the crippled lender. Even in the summer of 2008 \u2013 shortly before the UK entered the deepest recession for generations \u2013 King appeared to be more concerned about inflation than the impact of the turmoil in the financial sector. At the Bank's inflation report press conference that August, he predicted that growth in the year ahead would be \"broadly flat\", as the economy absorbed higher commodity prices and an \"adjustment\" in credit markets. After a blizzard of evidence was released by the New York Federal Reserve on Friday, he also faces the charge that he knew the Libor market was malfunctioning in 2008 and failed to act. King recently admitted that the Bank should have \"shouted from the rooftops\" its concerns about the build-up of risks in the financial sector; but his critics say he downgraded the importance of the banking sector in the Bank's work, seeing it solely as a regulatory concern to be handled by the FSA. \"He's been rightly criticised for being very slow off the mark,\" says one former senior policymaker. However, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers drove the world economy into a synchronised downturn in late 2008 and 2009, and shocking details of the risky behaviour of some banks has emerged, King, with the zeal of the convert, has been among the most powerful advocates of a tough crackdown. He has called for a full split between banks' risky investment activities and their high street branches, and used the most recent financial policy committee press conference, in the immediate aftermath of the Barclays fine, to condemn the \"shoddy\" behaviour of the financial sector. So King's involvement in ousting Diamond \u2013 a man who has earned close to \u00a3100m since 2006, against the governor's \u00a3305,000 a year \u2013 was the action of a man keen to demonstrate that he is not an ivory-tower academic, but someone willing to battle on behalf of a public that feels it has been failed by the banks. \"The governor was very careful to say that he had no power to direct us, but he felt that this was sufficiently important, as indeed it was, for us to be told in absolute terms what the situation was,\" Agius said, reliving the crucial meeting during his own appearance before MPs last week. With his calm delivery belying the drama of the situation, Agius explained that he was flanked by Sir Michael Rake, the former top accountant and most senior non-executive director at Barclays. \"The two of us had a conversation with [King], in which it was made very plain to us that Bob Diamond no longer enjoyed the support of his regulators.\" In the words of Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, it was the equivalent of handing a \"loaded revolver\" to Diamond, who had in any case been coming around to the idea that his position was untenable. It is rare for such an insight into the inner workings of the regulatory authorities to be made so public. That it was King, rather than Financial Services Authority (FSA) chairman Lord Turner, who delivered the fatal blow was a foretaste of the immense power the Bank will have when it regains the job of overseeing the City under the coalition's plans for shaking up financial regulation. The Bank will not be handed its new role until after King departs next summer; but Darling has already described the governor, with his current constellation of powers, as a \"sun king\". One former monetary policy committee member describes him as a \"control freak\". The governor's own version of Diamond's demise will be given to the same committee of MPs on Tuesday, when he will no doubt be asked why the regulators took five days to act following the record \u00a3290m fine that was slapped on Barclays. Turner \u2013 himself a contender for King's job \u2013 appears on Monday and will want to explain why it was the governor and not him who administered the coup de grace. Agius told MPs that he had checked with the FSA that the governor was speaking on their behalf. He was. Such is King's power that Agius revealed he had even cleared with him the back-up plan hastily put in place by the non-executives, in which Agius took over as executive chairman while a new chief executive was sought. \"The governor made it perfectly clear that any decision would be taken by the board or by Bob Diamond individually, but it would have been foolish in the extreme of us not to have referred back to him with our interim proposals. That would have been taking a risk that would have been unwise,\" said Agius. The rumours and allegations about who was involved in the plot to fiddle Libor, and the rumbustious parliamentary hearings in which officials have been forced to defend their own role during the financial crisis, have effectively become a very public first-round job interview for those vying to succeed King. Paul Tucker, the City's favourite Bank insider, who has spent his career building up to becoming governor, was forced to appear before MPs to explain his dealings with Diamond at the peak of the financial crisis; Turner, the obvious external candidate, will need to explain why the FSA hadn't acted earlier to rein the bank in, despite having raised concerns in a damning letter to Agius in April. But it will be King, the last of the key policy players from the financial crisis \u2013 Darling, Brown, Lord Myners, Baroness Vadera \u2013 still in post, who faces the toughest challenge. He must convince MPs and the public that he is not a narrow-minded intellectual snob who failed to see the financial system was about to bring the economy crashing down, but a scourge of City wrongdoers, willing to push his powers to their limit to protect the public from crooked bankers.",

      "bodyText": "Believe it or not, I still bump into people who have a good word to say about George Osborne. One of them even had a part in the chancellor's education, although I hasten to add that it was not Michael Gove. However, even those with a good word to say about the most dangerous chancellor I have known have been shaking their heads at his recent behaviour. Yet it does not take a psychologist to see why Osborne has been making unseemly insinuations, and evidently false allegations, about an unlikely link between the shadow chancellor and the Libor affair. The plain fact is that the prime minister and chancellor have become obsessed with Ed Balls. This is partly because he gets under their skin with his taunts in the Commons, but it is principally because he has been right about the economy and they have been wrong \u2013 disastrously wrong. They are not entirely culpable. When they came into office they were almost frightened out of their wits by the picture of the economy painted to them by the Treasury and the Bank of England, as was their coalition partner, deputy prime minister Nicholas Clegg, who changed his mind about the economy overnight. Unfortunately, they were given the wrong advice. Now, one would expect the Treasury, one of whose main roles is to control public spending, to seize the chance of pointing to the deficit and calling for cuts. After all, the Treasury felt guilty about having become a spending department under Gordon Brown \u2013 although the degree to which Labour's spending contributed to the deficit has been grossly exaggerated. Prime responsibility lies with the Great Recession. The record shows that the governor of the Bank of England's concern about the deficit also had a huge influence on the prime minister and chancellor. Nevertheless, politicians are elected to take the real decisions. They can listen to officials, but they are big boys and the ultimate responsibility lies with them. (In which context, Lord Healey, the Labour chancellor from 1974 to 1979, reminded a recent gathering that he had been offered the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund in the late 1970s, but did not see himself as a civil servant, ultimately responsible to politicians.) What happened with Osborne was that the deflationary advice from Treasury and Bank in 2010 was music to his ears. He had a plan. It was to \"do a Thatcher\": conduct a scorched-economy policy for several years, and then lead on to a triumphant recovery and a resounding election victory in 2015. Then he would, in due course, succeed Cameron as prime minister. Well, as Robert Browning wrote in The Lost Leader, for Osborne it is likely to be a case of \"never glad confident morning again\". The chancellor is rattled, and it shows. Way back in August 2010, Balls delivered his celebrated Bloomberg speech, in which he warned of the mistakes the government was making in stopping a manifest, if slow, economic recovery in its tracks. We now have the governor of the Bank of England himself acknowledging: \"The economy has basically been flat for two years and doesn't show a great deal of signs of impending recovery.\" The National Institute of Economic and Social Research agrees, adding that \"the period of depression is likely to continue for some time\". (The NIESR defines \"depression\" as \"a period when output is depressed below its previous peak\".) The good news, if you can call it that, is that the NIESR believes that the recession is over \u2013 technically, at least, because it defines \"recession\" as a period when output \"is falling or receding\". For how long, though? According to a survey by Deloitte of corporate finance officers, there is a danger of a \"triple-dip recession\" within the next two years, with companies cutting back rather than expanding. The prime minister says he wants Britain to be \"the most competitive country in the world\". He and his chancellor should pay more attention to people who have real experience of running industry, such as Lord Paul, chairman of the Caparo group, who told the House of Lords recently that the banking crisis had had a \"crippling impact on credit availability, particularly to small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises\". Government initiatives so far have had precious little effect, and Paul repeated his call for \"a new corporate institution dedicated to industrial finance, a high-powered, well-endowed industrial bank\". But enterprises still need demand, and demand is, to coin a phrase, in short supply. Neither the government nor the Bank was responsible for the knocks to demand caused by higher commodity prices. But the management of demand is a delicate business, and the increase in VAT, the austerity talk, and the austerity plans themselves were huge mistakes. Until recently the strategy amounted to relying on the impact of a large devaluation in boosting exports and import substitution. But now King says that he is worried about the outlook for exports \"because sterling has risen over the past year\" \u2013 and then there is \"the state of the euro area\". No wonder the chancellor is trying to divert attention by attacking Balls. It is cheap entertainment \u2013 but it is not an economic policy.",
