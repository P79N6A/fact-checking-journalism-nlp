      "bodyText": "Investors from the world\u2019s three largest economies are increasingly sceptical about doing deals in the UK due to uncertainty over Brexit, according to a report from one of the world\u2019s top accounting firms. The UK dropped out of the top five global destinations for mergers and acquisitions for the first time in the seven-year history of the EY Global Capital Confidence Barometer survey. Sentiment among investors in China, the US and Japan \u2013 the top three economies in the world \u2013 showed the biggest downturns, due to fears Britain will no longer offer a \u201cgateway into Europe\u201d, the report said. Around 82% of Japanese respondents declared themselves less confident about investing due to Brexit-related turmoil, while 56% of those from the US and 53% from China agreed. \u201cBrexit may not have created the initial turmoil some feared but investment uncertainty is clouding the UK\u2019s longer-term economic prospects,\u201d said Steve Ivermee, a managing partner at EY. He said the survey \u201chighlights the size of the government\u2019s task as it starts to reposition the UK \u2026 For businesses, reassuring overseas investors and setting out clear trade priorities with favoured nations is a priority.\u201d The UK fell to seventh in the list of the most attractive countries to pursue corporate deals, above India and below Japan, despite the weakness of sterling making British assets cheaper for foreign firms. The last EY survey, released before the EU referendum in May, put the UK second only to the US as a country in which to pursue takeovers and mergers. Investors in India, Russia and Europe still favour the UK, the report said, while EY said the UK\u2019s fundamentally strong economy meant companies \u201cdon\u2019t look ready to run for the exit \u2026 Nevertheless, smaller inflows into new and existing operations are concerning in the context of falling domestic investment and the UK\u2019s negative current account,\u201d said Ivermee. Brexit is also proving a worry for domestic businesses, the survey found. While 87% of those surveyed see the UK economy as stable, around 92% expect Britain\u2019s exit from the EU to affect their ability to hire skilled people.",

      "bodyText": "A majority of the British public will back extra government spending on road, rail and housing to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure, according to an exclusive poll for the Guardian that indicates strong support for Philip Hammond to boost public investment in next month\u2019s autumn statement. Almost two-thirds of Britons agree the country is not doing enough to meet its infrastructure needs and 76% believe investment in infrastructure is vital to future economic growth. The survey also found that 44% backed higher government borrowing to fund fresh investment, with only 16% opposed and 40% unsure either way. The poll comes amid growing concerns from business groups that the government is moving too slowly in developing an industrial strategy under new business secretary Greg Clark. The EEF, which represents manufacturing employers, said ministers needed to \u201cspeed up plans to introduce a consistent and coherent long-term industrial strategy\u201d to overcome the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and Britain\u2019s trading relationship with Europe. It said \u201cswift implementation\u201d was vital to prevent the economy from stagnating as \u201cthe UK steers its tricky way towards Brexit\u201d. The chancellor has publicly wavered over how much to increase government spending on infrastructure projects. In the aftermath of the referendum he promised to tear up his predecessor\u2019s budget and back proposals from Number 10 to develop an industrial strategy before denying he was planning a \u201cspending splurge\u201d. He is under pressure to widen the scope of the government\u2019s support for infrastructure improvements following a series of forecasts that predict the economy will slow next year. Official figures this week are expected to show the rate of growth has already halved and could worsen further in the run-up to Christmas and next year as higher import prices from the falling pound eat into household spending power. Terry Scuoler, head of the EEF, said: \u201cIt is not enough to talk about an industrial strategy \u2013 it is time for the government to draw a line under the stop-go efforts of the past and to demonstrate its commitment.\u201d The Ipsos Mori poll is the first to ask the British public their attitude to infrastructure in a way that is comparable with the firm\u2019s surveys in other countries. It found that support is substantially higher in Britain for government-backed improvements than the global and G8 averages, where support was 34% and 31% respectively. Twice as many people in the UK are comfortable with the idea of foreign investment in new infrastructure as are not, with 42% in favour and 20% against, if it means that projects can be delivered more quickly, making Britons more comfortable with foreign investment than the 37% average across the G8. Shown a list of the different types of projects, almost half of the 1,000 people interviewed online nominated new housing as a top priority while 45% chose flood defences and 44% rail infrastructure. Ben Marshall, a research director at Ipsos Mori, said the survey showed \u201cinstinctive backing\u201d for the government\u2019s emerging approach to infrastructure after it found more people back borrowing to fund projects than don\u2019t. \u201cGovernment action is likely to be most welcomed in terms of housing and rail but also flood defence and local roads. We also know, though, that support for infrastructure is very conditional; people want to be convinced that projects will lead to benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also pretty pragmatic. Provided it accelerates progress, more are comfortable with foreign investment than are not. There is, though, a clear demand for adequate involvement of local communities,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Major transport infrastructure projects built in the past 15 years cost $28bn more to build than first promised, a Grattan Institute report has found. The report, released on Monday, found a 24% mark-up compared to promised cost, largely due to premature announcement of projects before proper cost assessments. The Grattan Institute\u2019s transport program director, Marion Terrill, investigated all 836 projects valued at $20m or more that were planned and built since 2000, the first comprehensive analysis of all cost overruns in that time. \u201cMost projects come in reasonably close to their promised cost \u2026 the problem is that when projects do exceed their promised costs, the overruns can be spectacular,\u201d the report says. The 17% of projects that exceed their promised cost by more than half accounted for 90% of the over-budget costs. Rather than measuring cost overruns from the point that a formal cost-benefit analysis was completed or a funding commitment was made, the report looked at the cost compared to the price tag when government ministers or opposition politicians first announced a project. It noted that once an elected government announced a project, the public treated that as a commitment. \u201cWe treat a promise to build a particular project for a particular cost as a real promise,\u201d it said. The worst projects for cost overruns were Western Australia\u2019s Forrest highway between Perth and Bunbury and New South Wales\u2019 Hunter expressway which both cost more than four times the amounts initially promised. The report found that premature announcement, often in the lead-up to an election, was the biggest culprit in cost overruns. The 32% of projects that were announced early led to 74% of the value of cost overruns, it found. \u201cIt comes as no surprise that ad hoc announcements prior to formal budget commitments tend to be extremely optimistic,\u201d it said. The report said the pattern of \u201cpromising poor quality or under-developed project ideas in election campaigns was troubling because politicians find it very hard to back down from promises\u201d when the true cost of the project is revealed. The Grattan Institute described as a \u201cmyth\u201d the idea that cost overruns were caused by changes to project scope, like extending a road or adding a train station. In fact, only 11% of cost overruns were directly attributable to changes in scope. The report recommended governments should not be able to commit public money to transport infrastructure until an independent evaluation and the underlying business case had been tabled in parliament. That would overcome pressure placed on evaluators to overestimate projects\u2019 benefits, it said, citing the Victorian auditor general\u2019s report into the East-West link which offered advice in accordance with the government\u2019s preferred outcome \u2013 to build the project. \u201cLimiting premature announcements could substantially reduce cost overruns,\u201d it said. The report also recommended that standalone legislation should be required for projects to cost $1bn or more because it would \u201cencourage bipartisanship when risk and complexity are high\u201d. Such a requirement may have averted the Napthine Coalition government entering contracts for the East-West link only to have the Andrews Labor government scrap it after the November 2015 Victorian election. The report also recommended that Infrastructure Australia publish information about projects and the Productivity Commission to produce ratings of whether the businesses cases for them had been reliable.",

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating a \u00a33.6m sale of shares to small investors in a company claiming to revive the Our Price records brand. Our Price was Britain\u2019s second-biggest chain of music stores in the mid-1980s, but after a series of owners, its last shop closed in 2004. The brand was acquired by Lee Skinner, who has attached it to short-lived businesses such as Our Price Furniture and Our Price TV. Investors have not lost money in the transaction, although the cash is being held in a third-party escrow account. The FCA is allowing Our Price to use limited funds, but large-scale spending is barred to protect shareholders. Early last year, Skinner sought to raise \u00a31.5m by offering shares to private investors in a new company, Our Price Records Ltd, at 60p a share, valuing the company at \u00a310.5m. After a second round of share sales, Our Price raised \u00a33.6m. Despite using the Our Price name and logo, the company was not seeking to tap into the vinyl revival. Instead, Skinner said he would use the well-known brand to become a force in online retailing, as a shop window for discounted goods from leading brands. The share prospectus said the company would use the funds to launch its website and pay for advertising. It said the \u201cexit plan\u201d was to list on the stock market or sell to a trade buyer for \u00a3100m within three years. In late 2015, the FCA started examining the share sale and in January 2016, the regulator wrote to shareholders to say it was investigating. Skinner wrote to shareholders on 27 April saying Our Price\u2019s problems stemmed from its accountants, Leigh Carr, not being authorised to approve the prospectus. The FCA wrote to shareholders on 3 May saying Leigh Carr\u2019s lack of authority was \u201conly one facet of our investigation\u201d and that it was examining whether unauthorised sales agents breached company law, whether Our Price knew about any breaches, and the accuracy of promotional material sent to consumers. Skinner told the Guardian that he was ready to launch the business in January and the FCA investigation had prevented him from doing so. \u201cEverything as far as I\u2019m concerned has been done totally legitimately with the objective of a flotation or a trade sale within three years, once Our Price had rebuilt itself. That was always and still is the objective,\u201d he said. Leigh Carr did not respond to requests for comment. The FCA declined to comment. Our Price\u2019s prospectus said it would receive commission on discounted products offered through its website. It said there were \u201carrangements in place\u201d with more than 250 big brands, including John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer and easyJet holidays. The prospectus projected sales of \u00a31.9m in the first year of business, rising to \u00a318.8m two years later, and for pre-tax profit to soar from \u00a3424,404 to \u00a317.4m in the same period. Our Price\u2019s annual return, filed in June, showed 260 investors had bought 4.9m shares at 60p or \u00a31 a share. In addition, Skinner owns 12m shares and his fellow director Karen Ferreira owns 3m. The 2000 Financial Services and Markets Act says anyone inviting consumers to make investments should be authorised unless the content of the communication is approved by an authorised person. Breaches of the act are a criminal offence. Our Price shares were marketed by firms claiming to be stockbrokers or wealth advisers. The FCA has warned that at least three of these \u2013 Global Capital Wealth, Goodman &amp; Banks and Gemini Asset Management \u2013 are unauthorised and has included them on a list of possible scam outfits. The regulator has been trying, through its ScamSmart campaign, to clamp down on unauthorised agents selling shares. Frank Booy, a retired scientist, spent \u00a321,000 on Our Price shares when he was cold-called by selling agents including Gemini. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money. As a scientist, you wander round the world working in different countries for a short time and you effectively don\u2019t get a pension. I was hoping to get some money from this,\u201d he said.",

However, in the first official verdict on how the economy has performed since the Brexit vote, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is expected to say growth more than halved from 0.7% in the second quarter to 0.3% between July and September. If the economists polled by Reuters are correct, it would be the slowest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2015, but would rule out the prospect of a technical recession \u2013 defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 in the second half of the year. The figure would also beat the latest forecasts from Bank of England policymakers, who were predicting at the time of the August inflation report that third quarter growth would come in at 0.1%. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cEncouragingly, the gamut of data has provided evidence that the slowdown has not been too stark and our best guess is that gross domestic product rose by 0.3% in the third quarter.\u201d The relative resilience of the UK economy since the Brexit vote on 23 June has largely been attributed to a willingness among consumers to keep spending, as well as strength in the services sector. However, the GDP data on Thursday is expected to show a weaker picture for the industrial and construction sectors. The International Monetary Fund has predicted that Britain will be the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries in 2016, with growth of 1.8%. The Washington-based fund accepted that its warning of a post-Brexit vote financial crash had proved too pessimistic. However, fears are mounting that a relatively resilient performance from the economy in the immediate aftermath of the leave vote could be short lived, with 2017 expected to be more challenging. The IMF is predicting that growth will slow to 1.1% next year and economists believe the finances of consumers and businesses will come under increased strain in the coming months. The pound has fallen by 18% against the dollar since the EU referendum, and a weaker currency is expected to drive prices higher as it makes imports more expensive. Inflation rose to a near two-year high of 1% in September, above analysts\u2019 expectations, from 0.6% in August, partly because of an increase in clothing and fuel costs. With inflation expected to rise to 3% next year and wage growth running at 2.3%, according to the latest ONS data, economists are warning of a renewed squeeze on living standards as price rises start to outpace pay increases. Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWe expect the economy to suffer in 2017 as the uncertainties facing businesses and consumers are magnified by the triggering of article 50. \u201cConsumers are highly likely to face markedly diminishing purchasing power over the coming months, as inflation rises appreciably and earnings growth is limited by companies striving to limit their costs.\u201d",

The Washington-based fund accepted that its warning of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum\">post-Brexit vote financial crash</a> had proved too pessimistic.<br></p> <p>However, fears are mounting that a relatively resilient performance from the economy in the immediate aftermath of the leave vote could be short lived, with 2017 expected to be more challenging.</p> <p>The IMF is predicting that growth will slow to 1.1% next year and economists believe the finances of consumers and businesses will come under increased strain in the coming months.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/uk-government-bond-sell-off-continues-keeping-pressure-on-pound\">pound has fallen by 18%</a> against the dollar since the EU referendum, and a weaker currency is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">expected to drive prices higher</a> as it makes imports more expensive. Inflation rose to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">near two-year high</a> of 1% in September, above analysts\u2019 expectations, from 0.6% in August, partly because of an increase in clothing and fuel costs.</p> <p>With inflation expected to rise to 3% next year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/uk-employment-rate-at-record-high-despite-brexit-vote\">wage growth running at 2.3%</a>, according to the latest ONS data, economists are warning of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/rising-inflation-expected-to-hit-consumers-pockets-pound-sterling-dollar-brexit\">renewed squeeze on living standards</a> as price rises start to outpace pay increases.</p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWe expect the economy to suffer in 2017 as the uncertainties facing businesses and consumers are magnified by the triggering of article 50.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers are highly likely to face markedly diminishing purchasing power over the coming months, as inflation rises appreciably and earnings growth is limited by companies striving to limit their costs.\u201d<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A consortium made up of private-equity firms and the Church of England has received at least \u00a3180m from Royal Bank of Scotland for backing the bailed-out bank\u2019s aborted attempt to float off 300 branches on the stock market. The Edinburgh-based bank, 73% owned by the taxpayer, has already admitted that the ill-fated attempt to carve out the 300 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn (W&amp;G) brand has cost \u00a31.5bn. Documents filed at Companies House shed light on the sums paid by RBS to the consortium \u2013 which, as well as the Church of England, included Corsair Capital and Centerbridge \u2013 formed three years ago to participate in the flotation of W&amp;G. In a complex deal, they put \u00a3600m into RBS through a bond, which was intended to be exchanged for shares when the new bank floated on the stock exchange. RBS may reveal further costs associated with the troubled branch spinout when it publishes its third-quarter results on Friday, at the end of a week in which rival bailed-out bank Lloyds Banking Group also reports, along with Barclays. The sale of the 300 branches was forced upon RBS by the EU as a penalty for its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008. It has run into repeated problems and must now be completed by the end of next year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, warned last month that RBS faces unchartered territory if he cannot find a solution. An attempt to sell the branches to Santander collapsed in 2012 and the deal with the consortium clinched the following year. But any attempt at stock market flotation was abandoned in August and the bank is now looking for a buyer. The consortium was to have ended up with a stake of between 30% and 49% when W&amp;G floated and the \u00a3600m bond converted into shares. The consortium used \u00a3330m of its own money to pay for the bonds and borrowed \u00a3270m off RBS. Documents at Companies House for Lunar Investors \u2013 a limited-liability partnership set up by members of the consortium \u2013 show that in the period 26 September 2013 to end-December 2015 RBS paid \u00a3184m in interest to the holders of the bond. The consortium was charged \u00a318m in interest for its \u00a3270m loan. RBS said at the time the transaction was announced in September 2013 that it would pay the consortium a rate of interest between 8% and 14% a year. The documents at Companies House indicate that RBS was paying the higher rate of interest to the investors. It paid \u00a3100m for the 15-month period to end of December 2014 and \u00a384m for the 2015 calendar year. RBS would not comment on the payments, nor would Corsair. The Church Commissioners, which manages \u00a37bn of the Church of England\u2019s investments and helps funds dioceses and parishes and helps pay the pensions for clergy, said it had invested in W&amp;G \u201cdue to our belief in the importance of competition in the banking sector and the vital role of challenger banks. \u201cWe are pleased to have been able to work with Williams &amp; Glyn on ethics in banking and are grateful to the management team for their enthusiasm on this issue,\u201d the Church Commissioners said. It is reported to have a 10% stake in the consortium. There had been hopes that W&amp;G would be a new high-street competitor to the big four \u2013 RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 along with TSB, which was spun out of Lloyds under instructions from the EU because of its taxpayer bailout.

    "webTitle": "30 years after big bang, will Brexit cost City of London its status?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thursday will mark 30 years since the London Stock Exchange swept away centuries of tradition and beckoned in the modern, global City of London. It signalled the end of leisurely gentleman\u2019s hours and liquid lunches, ushering in computer screens and many more American accents in the once closed shop of London\u2019s financial markets. But the vote to leave the EU earlier this year means the reminiscing sparked by the 30th anniversary of the reforms brought in by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government is tinged with anxiety about whether London can retain its status as one of the world\u2019s biggest financial centres. The shape of the UK\u2019s trade deal with the remaining 27 members of the EU in the post-Brexit world is the topic of much debate across the City \u2013 and other financial hubs around the world. The new buzzword is \u201cpassporting\u201d, the means by which members of the EU are able to do business in each other\u2019s countries without impediment. Last week, France\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, told an audience of London-based bankers that Paris was ready to house the bankers affected by the fallout of the Brexit vote. Frankfurt has sent delegations to London to set out its case for relocation, while Dublin and Luxembourg are also regarded as alternative centres to the UK capital. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, warned this weekend that bankers\u2019 \u201chands are quivering over the relocate button\u201d. It is a far cry from 27 October 1986, when after years of negotiations with the government, the LSE switched on computer screens and shut down its dealing room. \u201cOpen outcry\u201d, where traders dealt shares face to face, was scrapped. The big bang also meant the scrapping of fixed commissions on share dealing and of ancient distinctions between stockbrokers, who advised clients, and jobbers, who bought and sold shares on their behalf. Thatcher\u2019s government regarded the previous set-up as anti-competitive and inefficient and wanted the City to adopt new technology to compete as finance went global. \u201cIt was an anachronism that had had its day,\u201d said Nigel Boardman, a partner at the law firm Slaughter and May, who began working at his firm in the 70s and was a partner by the time the big bang arrived. The effect was to make many small City firms obsolete as the most prestigious were snapped up by US investment banks and rivals from Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere. The City boomed as London became a global financial centre, bridging the time zones of the Americas and Asia and allowing foreign banks access to the EU. This year it has even led to an attempt to merge the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Job numbers rose. In early 1986, financial services employed 976,000 people in Britain, government figures show. By 1990 the number had jumped to 1.18 million and it peaked at 1.21 million in 2008. Today, even after the financial crisis and 30 years of automation and cost cuts, there are 1.15 million people employed in finance \u2013 174,000 more than before the big bang. Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture\u2019s global financial services business, said it also democratised share ownership \u2013 and brought in \u00a365bn of tax revenues. This was one of the benefits of the bonus culture that took over the City in the wake of the big bang. \u201cBrexit will change the City in some ways,\u201d said Lumb. \u201cBut I\u2019m more optimistic than pessmistic.\u201d He pointed to factors such as the skilled workforce in London and the tax and legal environment. The lobby group TheCityUK has calculated that \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2013 in which the UK does not have access to the single market of the remaining 27 EU countries \u2013 could put 35,000 jobs at risk. Boardman, though, sees some positives from leaving the EU \u2013 for instance, freeing the City from a tax on financial transactions that is being introduced in 10 European countries or the cap on bonuses that has forced up City salaries. \u201cOn the other hand, if financial passporting is lost that would be adverse \u2026 If you already have offices in the EU it may be you can more easily manage the loss of the passport \u2026 but if you don\u2019t it could be more difficult.\u201d Previous anniversaries of the big bang have also coincided with controversies. In 2011, the 25-year milestone was marked by soul searching about the impact that the implosion of the banking sector had had on the economy and inequality. But, Boardman said, the current controversy about financial services post-Brexit is about more than just London. \u201cThe future of the City is an extremely important thing for the country and I don\u2019t think we should talk about it as the future of the City. It\u2019s the future of the country to a very significant extent because the whole country benefits from the City\u2019s activities.\u201d",

It signalled the end of leisurely gentleman\u2019s hours and liquid lunches, ushering in computer screens and many more American accents in the once closed shop of London\u2019s financial markets.</p> <p>But the vote to leave the EU earlier this year means the reminiscing sparked by the 30th anniversary of the reforms brought in by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government is tinged with anxiety about whether London can retain its status as one of the world\u2019s biggest financial centres.</p> <p>The shape of the UK\u2019s trade deal with the remaining 27 members of the EU in the post-Brexit world is the topic of much debate across the City \u2013 and other financial hubs around the world. The new buzzword is \u201cpassporting\u201d, the means by which members of the EU are able to do business in each other\u2019s countries without impediment.<br></p> <p>Last week, France\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Sylvie Bermann, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/european-banks-warn-off-political-intrusion\">told an audience of London-based bankers that Paris </a>was ready to house the bankers affected by the fallout of the Brexit vote.

The big bang also meant the scrapping of fixed commissions on share dealing and of ancient distinctions between stockbrokers, who advised clients, and jobbers, who bought and sold shares on their behalf. </p> <p>Thatcher\u2019s government regarded the previous set-up as anti-competitive and inefficient and wanted the City to adopt new technology to compete as finance went global.</p> <p> \u201cIt was an anachronism that had had its day,\u201d said Nigel Boardman, a partner at the law firm Slaughter and May, who began working at his firm in the 70s and was a partner by the time the big bang arrived.</p> <p> The effect was to make many small City firms obsolete as the most prestigious were snapped up by US investment banks and rivals from Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere. The City boomed as London became a global financial centre, bridging the time zones of the Americas and Asia and allowing foreign banks access to the EU. This year it has even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/04/lse-shareholders-expected-to-back-deutsche-borse-merger-london-stock-exchange\">led to an attempt to merge the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse</a>.<br></p> <p>Job numbers rose. In early 1986, financial services employed 976,000 people in Britain, government figures show. By 1990 the number had jumped to 1.18 million and it peaked at 1.21 million in 2008.

      "bodyText": "The four months since the Brexit vote have been something of a phoney war. Life for most has trundled on just as before. The shops have been full. Employment has continued to rise. Britain is still the low pay, low productivity country it always was. If someone had left in early June and returned today without access to the news, they would never know there had been a referendum. The release of the growth figures for the third quarter of 2016 on Thursday will reinforce the sense that not much has changed. In August, the Bank of England expected the economy to almost stall but it has had second thoughts in the light of more upbeat data. The consensus in the City is for growth of 0.3-0.4%, down on the second quarter but hardly a disaster. Yet Thursday marks the end of the phoney war. All the signs are that things are going to get a lot more interesting from now on. While the Bank has revised up its forecast of 0.1% growth in both the third and fourth quarters, it doesn\u2019t believe that the economy is out of the woods. It shares the view of the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that stronger growth now will come at the expense of slower growth later. Threadneedle Street\u2019s quarterly inflation report due out next month is unlikely to make pleasant reading. The Bank thinks inflation in 2017 will be higher than it predicted back in August and that output will be lower. As Theresa May reminded the nation in her Conservative party conference speech, the Bank has had monetary policy on an emergency setting for an awfully long time. Interest rates are already at 0.25% \u2013 the lowest they have ever been \u2013 and money creation under the quantitative easing programme has resumed. The Bank thinks the package of measures it announced in August was necessary to see the economy through the post-Brexit turbulence but not everybody agrees. William Hague\u2019s claim last week that central banks have lost the plot and need to start preparing the ground for higher borrowing costs was a clear shot across the Bank\u2019s bows. In truth, the Bank would be delighted if it was in a position to return monetary policy to its pre-financial-crisis setting of interest rates of around 5% and no QE. Threadneedle Street is fully aware that ultra-loose policies are subject to the law of diminishing returns and that the risks increase the longer they are kept in place. But the monetary policy committee has noted that other central banks that have tried to tighten policy have been forced into rapid U-turns, so its decision next month will be whether to maintain the current level of stimulus or do more, with a cut in interest rates to 0.1% up for debate. Three factors suggest the Bank will stick with the status quo: the better-than-expected performance of the economy post Brexit, the recent sharp fall in sterling which is seen as positive for output and hence the equivalent of a loosening of policy, and the need to keep some powder dry for if things get really sticky in 2017. Ideally, the Bank would like Philip Hammond to take on more of the burden for bolstering demand in his autumn statement next month. Mark Carney has publicly said that it would be a good idea for macro-economic policy to be better balanced, with the Treasury taking the pressure off the Bank through higher public spending or lower taxes. Hammond has raised expectations about the autumn statement by talking about a reset of fiscal policy, and has already abandoned George Osborne\u2019s goal of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament. That, though, doesn\u2019t mean he intends to throw caution to the winds. One of Osborne\u2019s aims when he announced the coalition government\u2019s austerity programme in 2010 was to give the Treasury scope to ease policy in the event of shocks such as Brexit. Behind all that stuff about mending roofs while the sun was shining was the idea of repairing the public finances in the good times so that there was money around in the bad times. Unfortunately, Osborne\u2019s approach was a double disaster. Austerity did not lead to the balancing of the government\u2019s books but it did help to create the conditions for Brexit. Deficit reduction was much slower than forecast in the last parliament and targets continue to be missed. In Osborne\u2019s last budget in March 2016, he pencilled in a \u00a320bn fall in borrowing to \u00a355bn in the current financial year, but six months in the deficit is only \u00a32bn lower than in the same period a year ago. In an ideal world, Hammond would use the autumn statement to boost public investment. Britain had the worst record for infrastructure spending of any G7 country in the 1980s and 1990s and is now paying the price. Similarly, only one G7 country devotes a smaller share of GDP to research and development than it did 30 years ago. No prizes for guessing which it is. Yet May has pledged that her government will look out for those who are only just managing. These are the people that are going to be hit by the freezing of tax credits and benefits at a time when inflation is rising. So Hammond is also under pressure to boost current spending. In all likelihood, he will try to do something for those on low incomes while also boosting capital spending. But the chancellor\u2019s warning that there will be no \u201csplurge\u201d in the autumn statement reflects the fact that seven years after the trough of the last recession the budget deficit is still running at about 4% of GDP. The Brexit negotiations (or, more accurately, the lack of Brexit negotiations) further complicate matters. In one sense, the government\u2019s unwillingness to show its hand while at the same time adopting an uncompromising tone is understandable. Negotiations normally start with one side insisting on receiving 100% of what they want and the other side insisting that they will get nothing. After some haggling, an agreement is finally reached. The government has to threaten a hard Brexit in order to get as many concessions as possible. Yet there are some in the government \u2013 Hammond included \u2013 who think recent events show the limitations of this approach. They would say that fears of a hard Brexit that were inspired by speeches at the Conservative party conference have weakened the UK\u2019s negotiating stance by putting the wind up the financial markets. This has prompted a fall in the value of the pound, which will lead to higher inflation and squeezed living standards in 2017. This looks like being a testing year for May and her team.",

      "bodyText": "At times of great stress, bankers tend to reach for the ciggies \u2013 and that\u2019s precisely what the highly embattled Deutsche Bank seems to have done. The German group was revealed as a lead financial adviser on British American Tobacco\u2019s planned $47bn takeover of Reynolds American last week \u2013 its biggest deal of the year and a useful smokescreen just before the bank\u2019s results statement on Thursday. Still, those results will be dominated by one major question \u2013 the financial health or otherwise of the bank \u2013 following the US Justice Department\u2019s request that Deutsche pony up $14bn to settle all the beastly things it did with mortgage-backed securities. That demand caused quite a lot of gasping in Frankfurt, meaning boss John Cryan has been attempting to calm investors\u2019 nerves with claims he expects to settle on a smaller figure. All of which might depend on Deutsche\u2019s ability to charm Americans, which brings us to a second worry. The US makes up around 25% of Deutsche\u2019s revenues, according to Macquarie, and last week Wall Street banks announced results that were surprisingly good across the board. Did the US banks take advantage of their German rival\u2019s woes and poach all its business? Or might Deutsche have also benefited from an industry-wide stimulant that has resulted in a general high? By Thursday we should know. Debenhams discounts When Sergio Bucher was unveiled as the new Debenhams chief exec in May, it\u2019s reasonable to assume he believed he\u2019d signed up to a different job. In that carefree time before the Brexit vote, the UK might have felt like a welcoming place for a Swiss-Spaniard to relocate to, and the referendum has made life even more tricky for the boss of the already embattled department store. Pressure on the pound in the aftermath of the vote has hurt Debenhams\u2019 share price as \u2013 like many clothing retailers \u2013 it often buys in dollars and sells in pounds. Meanwhile, as Bucher prepares for what should be a routine City debut at the group\u2019s results this week, investors have also begun fretting about the health of the retailer\u2019s pension scheme. Morgan Stanley analyst Geoff Ruddell warned last week: \u201cRecent movements in bond yields lead us to believe that the scheme\u2019s liabilities may have increased by more than \u00a3300m over the past 12 months and that, as a result, the company may disclose a net pension deficit of more than \u00a3200m.\u201d That missive came on the day Bucher started work \u2013 and thumped the shares. Welcome to Blighty. Theatre of the absurd at William Hill William Hill chairman Gareth Davis has never publicly said that enjoys the work of Samuel Beckett, but there is a touch of Waiting for Godot about the bookmaker at present. The firm\u2019s management is biding its time in anticipation of something big happening, and following the recent collapse of a pair of mergers, the parallels grow stronger: it was once said of Beckett\u2019s two-act play that \u201cnothing happens \u2013 twice\u201d. The problem with this inactivity is fairly obvious. Its rivals have not been sitting around (Ladbrokes and Coral have merged, as have Betfair and Paddy Power) while the uncertainties over a William Hill deal have spooked three candidates for the vacant chief exec role. The search for a new boss continues this week, but it\u2019s not a total long shot that we\u2019ll be watching a year-long performance of waiting for a CEO. In fact, the bookmaker hasn\u2019t managed to appointed a chief exec it actually wanted to hire since David Harding 16 years ago. When Harding left, Hills spent a year looking for his replacement, despite eventual successor, Ralph Topping, being a company lifer. Topping\u2019s retirement was delayed by a couple of expensive moves to keep him in post, despite his replacement James Henderson joining the firm in 1985. Developing. Slowly.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "How much short-term damage was inflicted by the Brexit vote will be revealed this week when we get an official GDP figure covering July, August and September. Back in the spring and early summer, Britain\u2019s national income was expanding at a healthy annual rate of 2.5%. The latest figures could show that this figure has halved and most forecasters expect next year to be no better. One of the supposed benefits of pulling out of the European Union \u2013 a low pound \u2013 has duly happened and sterling is around 18% lower against the dollar than it was before the referendum. This benefit is mostly reaped by exporters, who overnight find their goods cost less abroad and can therefore sell more of them. In the short term, though, there is a cost that kicks in before the export benefits can be realised, and that is higher import prices. Already petrol costs more than it did in June. And the Marmite war between Tesco and Unilever revealed there are plenty of tweaks to prices in the pipeline. There is a range of forecasts for next year\u2019s inflation rate of between 2% and 3%, up from 1% last month. Higher inflation, stagnant wages and slowing growth usually goes under the name stagflation. It\u2019s not a very friendly term and it\u2019s not supposed to be. It was coined in the 1970s and was supposed to remain tied to that decade, never to be repeated. It\u2019s like going to work with a heavy cold with the added anxiety that it might turn out to be flu. Productivity stays low and output declines. Unemployment, for so long the measure of Britain\u2019s jobs miracle alongside record employment figures, has started to rise. Stagflation could turn the August increase in the jobless total of 24,000 into a six figure total, with all the pain that unemployment brings. A 24,000 rise is the equivalent to a third of the workers in a town like Guildford, or half the number in Selby, North Yorkshire, being made redundant. More than 100,000 extra people on the dole is the same as putting Wolverhampton\u2019s entire workforce out of a job. This is an alarming thought, and not one a government has had to consider since 2011, when unemployment climbed to 2.86 million, or 8.4% of the workforce. It is now 1.66 million and the jobless rate is 4.9%. The Brexit vote has certainly played its part in dampening the enthusiasm of businesses to invest. Other factors have played a part, though, and they could turn a year of grey skies, economically speaking, into one where it rains all the time. The US economy is faltering after a year of sluggish manufacturing and construction output. Like Britain, the consumer has provided the main prop for GDP growth, but increasingly people are hanging on to their cash rather than spending it. Investment decisions are being delayed while firms cope with the high value of the dollar, which is hampering export growth. Around 17% of British exports go to the US, which is why the UK receives a cold blast from across the Atlantic when American businesses catch a chill. The US Federal Reserve appears ready to disregard the fall in American growth \u2013 from 4% in 2015 to 2% this year and possibly to zero in 2017 \u2013 and make a further increase in interest rates. It is waiting until the election is over before making its move, but the warning signs are there. It has all the hallmarks of a disastrous decision that, for the sake of central bank dogma, will push the economy into recession. Britain, despite the best efforts of its own central bank, has already suffered from a downturn in global trade. A crippled US economy can only make that situation worse, adding to the pall cast by the looming exit from the European Union. Plague of bogus self-employment Self-employment is the new outsourcing. At its most benign, the outsourcing of work to freelancers and contractors, facilitated by the internet, offers a chance to fit work around lifestyles and abandon the drudge of commuting. But for many of the 4.8 million self-employed people in the UK, the \u201cgig economy\u201d is little more than exploitation \u2013 and anyone who makes a fuss can wave goodbye to an already very uncertain income. Latest UK labour market figures show that 48% of jobs created from June to August this year were in self-employed roles. How many of these were disguised employees, hired through agencies, or, as allegedly in the case of delivery company Hermes \u2013 although it denies this \u2013 full-time staff, but without the benefits and legal protection that brings? HMRC has launched a specialist unit to investigate companies that opt out of giving workers employment protection by using agencies or calling staff self-employed. Labour MP Frank Field says Theresa May\u2019s government is showing a real willingness to grapple with this problem. But how rigorous will a clampdown be? In January, millions will submit personal tax returns. Those who miss the deadline will be fined. Much more seriously, individuals who lie on their return, concealing income or deliberately understating their position, can be fined up to 200% of the extra tax due, and get a potential criminal record. They could end up behind bars. Companies found to be using bogus self-employment to save on national insurance, pensions and holiday pay should face the same aggressive intervention. On paper, HMRC has the power to pursue businesses for historic and current PAYE deductions and to impose hefty fines. But there appears to have been a reluctance to take on big companies. Until the fines are more meaningful \u2013 say 10 times the amount of tax avoided \u2013 the law more rigorously enforced, and directors potentially hit with a criminal record \u2013 the plague of bogus self-employment will continue. Green is not the only man to blame Not for the first time in 2016, Sir Philip Green has had a bad week. He started it by making a plea to save his knighthood by saying he was \u201cvery, very, very sorry\u201d about the collapse of BHS, that he had made an \u201chonest mistake\u201d in selling the department store chain to Dominic Chappell and that he was still working on a deal to rescue the company\u2019s beleaguered pension scheme. However, MPs still voted to strip Green of his knighthood and he was labelled a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d, among many other things, in a heated debate in the House of Commons. Green deserves to be scrutinised for his stewardship of BHS, but the furore around the billionaire tycoon must not overshadow the other serious issues that have emerged from this scandal, such as the regulation of pension schemes, the role of advisers in mergers and acquisitions, and the behaviour of Chappell and his consortium Retail Acquisitions, which, at best, could be described as incompetent.",

An Adelaide couple found the postcard from the French Polynesian island of Tahiti in their letterbox, postmarked 1966. The Adelaide Advertiser reported that the \u201cslightly faded\u201d postcard was addressed to \u201cRobert Giorgio\u201d from \u201cChris\u201d in 1966. It showed a scene from the Papeete waterfront, including the distinctive Bloc Donald building, which featured on many postcards of the 1950s. Chris said he was \u201cenjoying myself greatly\u201d, despite the \u201cvery humid\u201d weather. The stamp on the postcard cost 13 francs. Wattle Park resident Tim Duffy, who found the postcard beneath a water bill on Monday, believed Giorgio may have been the property\u2019s original owner. Duffy and his wife Claire have both been contacted for comment by Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is clear something went wrong 50 years ago after the postcard was posted in French Polynesia, and we apologise for the inconvenience,\u201d an Australian Post spokesman told the Advertiser. \u201cAustralia Post takes great pride in the timely, safe and efficient delivery of mail and we are confident that the vast majority of mail and parcels arrive on time.\u201d Vintage postcards showing similar scenes are available to buy cheaply on eBay.",
