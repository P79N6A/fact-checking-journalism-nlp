      "bodyText": "Britain's leading manufacturing lobbying group has attacked the government for its lack of a growth strategy and warned the UK economy has \"hit the buffers\". The EEF called on ministers on Monday to come up with a long-term industrial strategy that would provide the same \"relentless and clear-sighted\" approach to expanding the economy that has been devoted to deficit reduction. Terry Scuoler, the EEF's chief executive, said: \"We all know that we need stronger growth built on firm foundations, but the economy and rebalancing have hit the buffers. We will only get back on track if the government demonstrates the same clarity and single-mindedness on growth that it has done on reducing the deficit. \"Business is seeking certainty to invest, but too often it is left with the impression that government is responding to events, rather than leading on growth.\" The EEF urged the creation of a cabinet committee for growth, jointly chaired by the prime minister and deputy prime minister, and for progress to be assessed against a small number of measurable benchmarks managed by the National Audit Office. Publishing The Route to Growth, the EEF identified 10 areas that needed action, including support for business through the tax system, better access to finance, reforms of energy pricing, cutting red tape, investing in modern infrastructure, greater banking competition, a new approach to public procurement, and the development of a well-resourced skills system. The business organisation said recovery and progress towards a rebalancing of the economy towards investment and exports had stalled in 2011. While accepting the economic environment had been affected by the debt crisis in the eurozone, the EEF said Britain's performance had been more sluggish than other developed countries, including some that are part of the single currency. It added that the government's plan for growth lacked the clarity and consistency of its programme of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce public borrowing. \"Despite positive measures for growth, the programme has lacked visibility. In contrast to the fiscal mandate, it fell short of communicating an unambiguous message on the type of growth our economy needed to rebalance. Nor did it offer a clear plan to address the barriers in the business environment \u2013 from access to finance and tax, to regulation and skills shortages \u2013 that stand in the way of the private sector delivering it. \"Furthermore, government actions on growth are not wrapped in credible accountability structures. Progress reports on departmental websites contrast with the rigour applied to the fiscal mandate, with the external review of the Office for Budget Responsibility.\" The report said that while there would be times when the government should aim to support individual technologies, a modern industrial strategy should focus on measures to help the widest number of companies grow by investing and exporting. The EEF said ministers should have four ambitions: more companies bringing products and services to market; a lower cost of doing business; more globally focused companies expanding in the UK; and a more productive and flexible labour market. Scuoler said: \"Clearly we need measures to get growing now and priorities should include encouraging business investment, increasing access to finance, reducing energy prices and rebuilding infrastructure. But these need to be part of an overall industrial strategy for growth and rebalancing our economy and not a series of unco-ordinated initiatives.\"",

    "webTitle": "Primary Greek tax evaders are the professional classes",

      "bodyText": "There is one good reason for Greece to stay in the euro: to combat corruption. It is a sad fact that the country is riddled with it and needs outside pressure and support to sort things out. Athens is not the only place in Europe wrestling with corruption, but we'll come to that later. Even if Greece and its prime minister, Antonis Samaras, could overcome the huge loss of pride and reap some of the economic benefits of quitting the single currency, they would still be left with a corrupt economy, much of which strengthens the power of unions and trade associations. City economists tend to ignore the problem when they assess the pros and cons of euro membership. They have arrived at the collective opinion that leaving the eurozone is the best, if not the only, option for Athens. Central to the argument is that an independent drachma would immediately be devalued, making Greek exports more competitive and at a stroke wiping out many, if not all, of the country's debts. There is also a political dimension that is centre stage at the moment, following proposals for closer union and control from Brussels and, in Greece's case, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Yet these economists ignore the challenges that beset a nation where very few people pay their taxes, where public-sector jobs are secured through family ties and where contracts for work, public or private, are rarely signed without someone in a position of power asking for a backhander. Greek banks are at the centre of the problem, as in Italy and Spain, where bankers perpetuate all the worst corrupt practices. Martin Sandbu, chief leader writer on economics at the Financial Times, recently chided the southern Europeans for not jumping at the chance to join a European banking union. He argued that the loss of control over a crucial pillar of the economy to a higher EU authority was worth it when set against the chance to end the insidious and corrupt relationship between bankers, politicians and the professional classes, which had so far proved impossible to break. It may seem conspiratorial to argue that corruption is at the heart of the Greek malaise, but it is one of the main reasons Berlin is adamant Athens has had all the help it is going to get, without some evidence the cuts are going through. For German politicians, cuts to sacred state subsidies and increases in tax revenues are a crude indicator that corruption is being tackled, however tentatively. Supporting the view that Greece is beyond helping itself, an in-depth study of how Greek banks, politicians and professional workers behave was published last week by two economists from the Booth school of business at the University of Chicago and a Greek academic based at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Interestingly, their report, Tax Evasion Across Industries: Soft Credit Evidence From Greece, which documents the hidden, non-taxed economy, blames the current malaise not on dodgy taxi drivers or moonlighting refuse collectors, but on the professional classes. They found that \u20ac28bn (\u00a322.4bn) of tax was evaded in 2009 by self-employed people alone. As GDP that year was \u20ac235bn and the total tax base was just \u20ac98bn, it is clear that this was a significant sum. At a tax rate of 40%, it amounted to almost half the country's budget deficit in 2008, and 31% in 2009. The chief offenders are professionals in medicine, engineering, education, accounting, financial services and law. Among the self-employed documented in the report are accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers. The authors, Adair Morse and Margarita Tsoutsoura from the Booth school of business and Nikolaos Artavanis from Virginia Tech, were given unprecedented access to the records of one of the top 10 Greek banks. They found that, when professionals approached the bank for a loan or mortgage, their tax returns showed their debts almost exceeded their incomes ( debt payments ate up 82% of their incomes). For the beleaguered tax authority, this meant their income was too low to qualify for income tax. On average, they found the true income of self-employed people to be 1.92 times their reported income. Under generally accepted loan criteria, home ownership figure than the UK (80% versus 68%). customers would need to show that their debts, after their mortgage payments were taken into consideration, were less than 30% of their income. Of course, several countries lost control of banking regulation in the runup to the financial crash, including the UK, Ireland and Spain. But it is noticeable that the two countries that have so far done the least about the corrupt relationship between banks and their customers \u2013 Greece and Spain \u2013 are the two countries in the worst trouble. Unlike Ireland, which has exposed a wealth of corrupt practices, Spain continues to hide the extent of its bad loans, especially to property developers who are friends of the bank chiefs who sanctioned their loans. To emphasise the global scale of the problem, the authors point out that World Bank studies show that 52% of corporations worldwide hide some of their income from the tax authorities, and 36% of European companies do so. Corruption is everywhere as companies and individuals seek to preserve their status, incomes and standard of living. Brussels, while enforcing strict rules on Athens, has struggled to contain the rampant corruption that infects its own business and farming subsidies. With that in mind, it may seem a bit rich to lecture the Greeks, but an appreciation of paradox has never been the eurocracy's strong point. The Greeks have begun to crack down on tax evasion. Only this weekend, raids on 11 people found tens of millions of euros' worth of undeclared property and assets in New York, London and various offshore tax havens. The Greek finance ministry's financial crimes unit conducted the raids, and says it has many other groups in its sights. However, broader attempts to crack down on the professions were blocked last year by the Greek parliament. MPs voted against a bill mandating tax audits on people who had incomes below a minimum threshold. The bill targeted 11 professions, including vets, architects, engineers, economists, doctors, lawyers and accountants. The authors found, almost as an aside to their central examination of tax evasion, that the occupations represented in parliament \"are very much those that evade tax, even beyond lawyers\". They said: \"Half of non-lawyer parliamentarians are in the top three tax-evading industries, and nearly a super-majority in the top four evading industries.\"",

      "body": "<p>There is one good reason for Greece to stay in the euro: to combat corruption. It is a sad fact that the country is riddled with it and needs outside pressure and support to sort things out. Athens is not the only place in Europe wrestling with corruption, but we'll come to that later.</p> <p>Even if Greece and its prime minister, Antonis Samaras, could overcome the huge loss of pride and reap some of the economic benefits of quitting the single currency, they would still be left with a corrupt economy, much of which strengthens the power of unions and trade associations.</p> <p>City economists tend to ignore the problem when they assess the pros and cons of euro membership. They have arrived at the collective opinion that leaving the eurozone is the best, if not the only, option for Athens. Central to the argument is that an independent drachma would immediately be devalued, making Greek exports more competitive and at a stroke wiping out many, if not all, of the country's debts.</p> <p>There is also a political dimension that is centre stage at the moment, following proposals for closer union and control from Brussels and, in Greece's case, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p> <p>Yet these economists ignore the challenges that beset a nation where very few people pay their taxes, where public-sector jobs are secured through family ties and where contracts for work, public or private, are rarely signed without someone in a position of power asking for a backhander.</p> <p>Greek banks are at the centre of the problem, as in Italy and Spain, where bankers perpetuate all the worst corrupt&#xa0;practices.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fe52b940-d59c-11e1-af40-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">Martin Sandbu</a>, chief leader writer on economics at the Financial Times, recently chided the southern Europeans for not jumping at the chance to join a European banking union. He argued that the loss of control over a crucial pillar of the economy to a higher EU authority was worth it when set against the chance to end the insidious and corrupt relationship between bankers, politicians and the professional classes, which had so far proved impossible to break.</p> <p>It may seem conspiratorial to argue that corruption is at the heart of the Greek malaise, but it is one of the main reasons Berlin is adamant Athens has had all the help it is going to get, without some evidence the cuts are going through. For German politicians, cuts to sacred state subsidies and increases in tax revenues are a crude indicator that corruption is being tackled, however tentatively.</p> <p>Supporting the view that Greece is beyond helping itself, an <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/09/04/1145251/greek-tax-evasion-mapped-and-crunched/\" title=\"\">in-depth study</a> of how Greek banks, politicians and professional workers behave was published last week by two economists from the Booth school of business at the University of Chicago and a Greek academic based at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</p> <p>Interestingly, their report, Tax Evasion Across Industries: Soft Credit Evidence From Greece, which documents the hidden, non-taxed economy, blames the current malaise not on dodgy taxi drivers or moonlighting refuse collectors, but on the professional classes.</p> <p>They found that \u20ac28bn (\u00a322.4bn) of tax was evaded in 2009 by self-employed people alone.</p> <p>As GDP that year was \u20ac235bn and the total tax base was just \u20ac98bn, it is clear that this was a significant sum. At a tax rate of 40%, it amounted to almost half the country's budget deficit in 2008, and 31% in 2009.</p> <p>The chief offenders are professionals in medicine, engineering, education, accounting, financial services and law. Among the self-employed documented in the report are accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers.</p> <p>The authors, Adair Morse and Margarita Tsoutsoura from the Booth school of business and Nikolaos Artavanis from Virginia Tech, were given unprecedented access to the records of one of the top 10 Greek banks. They found that, when professionals approached the bank for a loan or mortgage, their tax returns showed their debts almost exceeded their incomes ( debt payments ate up 82% of their incomes). For the beleaguered tax authority, this meant their income was too low to qualify for income tax.</p> <p>On average, they found the true income of self-employed people to be 1.92 times their reported income. Under generally accepted loan criteria, home ownership figure than the UK (80% versus 68%).</p> <p>customers would need to show that their debts, after their mortgage payments were taken into consideration, were less than 30% of their income.</p> <p>Of course, several countries lost control of banking regulation in the runup to the financial crash, including the UK, Ireland and Spain. But it is noticeable that the two countries that have so far done the least about the corrupt relationship between banks and their customers \u2013 Greece and Spain \u2013 are the two countries in the worst trouble.</p> <p>Unlike Ireland, which has exposed a wealth of corrupt practices, Spain continues to hide the extent of its bad loans, especially to property developers who are friends of the bank chiefs who sanctioned their loans.</p> <p>To emphasise the global scale of the problem, the authors point out that World Bank studies show that 52% of corporations worldwide hide some of their income from the tax authorities, and 36% of European companies do so.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell has been accused of \"stock-car racing recklessness\" after apparently undertaking only the most limited testing of a key piece of equipment aimed at preventing a Gulf of Mexico-style blowout during its controversial drilling in the Arctic. Documents obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request suggest field-testing of a containment dome took place over two hours on 25 and 26 June. The dome, known as a \"capping stack\", would be dropped over any stricken wellhead. Two officials from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSSE) \u2013 an arm of the US interior department \u2013 were present with Shell officials at the tests in Puget Sound, Washington, but there was no independent verification of the tests. Shell reportedly started work yesterday on the $4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) drilling programme in the Chukchi Sea, 70 miles off Alaska's north-west coast. It does not yet have permission to drill into oil reserves. Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer), a US group that helps federal and state employees raise the alarm on environmental protection issues, said it was shocked by the single page of notes from the government agency after it filed a federal lawsuit against the BSSE asking for all documents relating to the capping tests. This \"slim production\" belied the agency's [BSSE] claim in press statements that it had conducted comprehensive testing to meet \"rigorous new standards\", added Peer. \"The first test merely showed that Shell could dangle its cap in 200ft of water without dropping it,\" said Kathryn Douglass, a Peer staff lawyer. \"The second test showed the capping system could hold up under laboratory conditions for up to 15 minutes without crumbling. Neither result should give the American public much comfort.\" Shell did not contest the assumptions made by Peer about the testing but said the containment cap was only one of various pieces of equipment assembled over a long period of time to deal with any emergency. \"Approval of our Chukchi Sea oil spill response plan [Orsp] \u2026 validates the huge amount of time, technology, and resources we have dedicated to assembling an Arctic oil spill response fleet second to none in the world,\" said a Shell spokesman. \"It reinforces that Shell's approach to Arctic exploration is aligned with the high standards the department of interior expects from an offshore leader. Specifically, Shell's Orsp includes the assembly of a 24/7 onsite, nearshore and onshore Arctic-class oil spill response fleet, collaboration with the US Coast Guard to test roles and responsibilities and newly engineered Arctic capping and containment systems.\" Environmental campaigners Greenpeace said the limited testing of the crucial sub-sea cap displayed a \"total disregard\" for even the most basic safety standards. \"Such recklessness wouldn't look out of place in a stock-car race,\" said Ben Ayliffe, senior Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace. \"The only option now is for the US government to call a halt to Shell's plans to open up the frozen north because the company is so clearly unable to operate safely in the planet's most extreme environment. \"Whatever Shell is able to do in the narrow window between now and when the sea ice returns, it won't erase the clear evidence we've seen in the past two months that there's no such thing as safe drilling in the Arctic.\" The company was granted permission to starting digging with its drill ship in the Chukchi Sea but only into the layer of ocean bottom located above oil reserves. Shell can dig 20-by-40ft mud-line cellars, which will eventually hold and protect a well's blowout preventer 40ft below the seabed. The US interior secretary, Ken Salazar, said he had made his decision after an exhaustive review of Shell drilling rigs and safety equipment, including a capping stack. \"Any approved activities will be held to highest safety, environmental protection and emergency response standards,\" he said. Shell hopes to drill exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in this year's open-water season, rapidly drawing to a close. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012.
