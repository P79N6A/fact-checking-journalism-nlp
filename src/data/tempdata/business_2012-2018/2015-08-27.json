      "bodyText": "It would be reckless to claim that this bout of volatility was suddenly over, especially when we have Societe Generale insisting we\u2019re in a bear market. So lets just stick to the fact that the financial sector is looking a little less alarming tonight, and come back tomorrow and see if it holds up. The key points: Wall Street has posted its biggest-two day gain since 2009. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both jumped again, helped by speculation that US interest rates will not be raised in September, and decent economic data Europe also recovered. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 now almost flat for the week America\u2019s economy expanded faster than previously thought in the second quarter of the 2015. Annualised growth of 3.9% beat expectations, helping to send the oil price surging Our earlier summary explains how a recovery in China sparked the rebound. Goodnight! GW The oil price has rocketed by 10% this evening, its biggest rally in six years. A barrel of Brent crude oil jumped by $4.49 per barrel to $47.63, a huge move. US crude oil jumped $4.18 per barrel to $42.78. The upgrade to US GDP in April-June, to an annualised rate of 3.7%, has bolstered optimism over global growth prospects. Three nights ago, fear was sweeping the markets that China\u2019s Black Monday was trigging a global panic. Tonight, though, the stock markets of Japan, Europe and the US have pulled back most of their losses, as this nifty chart shows: Tonight\u2019s surge on Wall Street mirrors the way that Shanghai stock market rallied in late trading, just 13 hours ago. Insiders say that Beijing intervened to push shares up, to avoid a crash ahead of a big parade next week, to mark the end of the second world war. David Woo of Bank of America Merrill Lynch says this has boost confidence in the markets. Investors believe the Chinese authorities will keep taking action to avoid another market rout overshadowing the event, he tells Bloomberg. Woo also explained how automatic trading systems are playing a massive role in the recent turmoil. Another remarkable day\u2019s trading is over, with the US stock market sharply higher. That late rally saw the Dow Jones industrial average end the day up 369 points, or 2.27%, at 16,655. The S&amp;P had gained around 47 points, or 2.4%, to 1,987. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq was 2.43% higher at the close. That means the Dow and S&amp;P have both posted their biggest two-day jumps since 2009, says Bloomberg. Optimism that China\u2019s market rout may be easing, and a solid upgrade for US GDP, helped to drive share up. It\u2019s been a volatile day though - at one stage, the Dow had dropped back quite sharply, before going on a late surge in the last hour. Hello again. The rally is holding, as Wall Street heads into the close of trading..... Wall Street continues to rally, recovering more of this week\u2019s losses after today\u2019s growth figures helped shore up confidence. Stocks (not socks as I wrote earlier, drat it) are hitting their highest levels of the day, pushing the Dow Jones index up 377 points, or 2.3%. So I\u2019m going to take a break now, but will pop back later to catch the close of the New York stock exchange.... Greece\u2019s first female prime minister, top supreme court judge Vassiliki Thanou, has just been sworn in. Thanou will lead a caretaker government until elections are held, probably in September. Her administration will be sworn in on Friday. Europe can ride out the Chinese turmoil, says European commissioner Pierre Moscovici tonight. Reuters has the details: \u201cI am not worried, especially as monetary authorities in China and elsewhere have reacted or said they would,\u201d Moscovici told France\u2019s iTELE. \u201cMy feeling today ... is that European economies are able to weather what is happening on the Chinese market. The fundamentals of the recovery in Europe and in France are solid enough.\u201d [end]. The fundamentals aren\u2019t *that* strong, though. France\u2019s economy stagnated during the last quarter, for starters.... Although stocks have rallied today, they\u2019re doomed to fall sharply in the coming weeks, claims one City analyst with a reputation for pessimism. Albert Edwards of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale warned clients today that we are already experiencing a \u2018bear market\u2019. He believes investors are deluded to think that the west won\u2019t be hit by problems in emerging markets, or that central bankers can \u201celiminate the business cycle\u201d through more stimulus measures. Edwards is known as a \u201cpermabear\u201d in City circles for his gloomy view; arguably it would be more newsworthy if he were optimistic. But anyway, here\u2019s his take: One of the many lessons from equity investing during Japan\u2019s Lost Decade is that in a secular bear market hope is a killer. In a secular bear market hope should only be flirted with briefly during cyclical upturns, but it must be ruthlessly rejected as the cycle turns. In a secular bear market being wedded to hope destroys portfolios as the bear slashes to ribbons the hard-fought gains of the previous bull market. Gains that have taken years to accumulate are gone in months. One key measure we monitor informs us conclusively: we are now in a bear market. And here\u2019s that measure: This is the biggest rally on the FTSE 100 in almost four years, beating Tuesday\u2019s record. By my reckoning, today\u2019s market rally has boosted the value of the FTSE 100 by around \u00a355bn (that\u2019s not official, though) Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown, the financial services firm, says it shows the important of not selling when markets crash. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the best ever days for the UK stock market, neatly illustrating why it\u2019s a bad idea to sell out in a market rout. Black Monday was a truly dreadful day for stock investors, but it\u2019s been followed by big bounce, with the Footsie now back where it ended last week. Markets tend to over-react to both good and bad news, so sharp falls are often followed by strong rallies. Markets have today been buoyed by a rally in Chinese shares, a rise in commodity prices and a substantial upward revision of economic growth in the US. It would be foolhardy to suggest we\u2019re out of the woods yet though, and share prices are likely to remain volatile for some time. When markets are behaving erratically, investors should sit on their hands, and stick their fingers in their ears too if they can. Sounds tricky..... Today is now Triffic Thursday, apparently: I trust we\u2019ll keep tomorrow clean, chaps? Family audience, remember.... Crisis, what crisis? Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index had clawed back almost all its losses from earlier this week, as world stock markets rebound today. The blue-chip index surged by 212 points by the close of trading, up 3.5% to 6192. That\u2019s only 14 points shy of the close last Friday night. Investors have been swooping for bargains, driving mining stocks such as Antofagasta, BHP Billiton and Anglo American up by 9% each today. The rally appears to have three drivers: The US economy is growing faster than expected, thanks to today\u2019s GDP revisions The rout in China\u2019s stock market ended today, after Beijing authorities intervened in the market Investors believe the US Federal Reserve will take a more dovish approach to interest rate hikes, given recent market turbulence. But can it last? Investors will surely be watching Wall Street nervously tonight, and then checking Asia out on the phones when they wake up tomorrow. As Tony Cross of Trustnet explains, serious bouts of volatility rarely end quickly; especially as Monday is a bank holiday..... With the long weekend in the UK, volumes could well thin out tomorrow afternoon, exaggerating any moves in the market \u2013 we\u2019re over 400 points up from the week\u2019s lows so some short term profits could be taken. European stock markets have all posted very strong gains today. More in a moment... Europe\u2019s stock markets are spiking higher, up 3% to 4%, as the trading session approaches its end.... Wall Street is holding onto its early gains. After an hour\u2019s trading, the Dow is up 206 points, or 1.3%, as calm returns to the markets. But as US business editor Dom Rushe tweets, the calm might not last: Greece is about to get its first female prime minister. Vassiliki Thanou, the Supreme Court president, will be sworn in at 8pm local time (6pm BST, 1pm EDT), to head a caretaker government until elections are held next month. As explained earlier, snap elections are imminent as opposition parties failed to form a government, following Alexis Tsipras\u2019s resignation a week ago. Shares are rallying in New York at the start of trading, led by technology stocks. The Dow Jones has gained by 209 points at the open, up 1.3%, adding to yesterday\u2019s 619-point gain. If the Dow maintains that rise (and that\u2019s a BIG if), it would be the best two-day gain since 2009. The Nasdaq has turned positive for the year, too. Traders appear to be welcoming today\u2019s growth data, and the rally in Asia and Europe earlier today. Wall Street trading is underway, so we\u2019re about to find out whether yesterday\u2019s rally still has legs.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, believes Wall Street should cheer these new growth figures: \u201cA healthy upwards revision to US GDP should act as a much needed soothing balm for investors after the turbulence of this week. Yes, the Chinese slowdown is making its mark on the performance of US manufacturing, and the natural resource sector is still reeling from lower commodity prices. However, today\u2019s figures should underline the resilience of the US economy in light of global headwinds. Even amid falling investment spend in mining, investment was a pleasant surprise. Consumer spending remains robust, sentiment is climbing, while the labour market showing sign of rude health. \u201cWhether this economic performance is enough to sway the Fed to raise rates remains to be seen - the recent mayhem in global markets and fears over a slowing global growth will cast a long shadow on the decision.\u201d Economics professor Justin Wolfers urges caution over the growth figures: Encouraging sign - every component of the US economy grew in the last quarter: America\u2019s economy has now grown for the last five quarters -- showing it\u2019s ready for higher borrowing costs? Why has the US growth rate been revised up? The US Commerce department reports that \u2018fixed investment\u2019 by US firms was stronger than first estimated. They also stocked up their inventories by more than expected -- $121.1bn, not $110bn. Exports rose strongly, while imports fell, compared with the first quarter. And consumer spending was revised up to 3.1%, from 2.9% originally. The full report is online here. Important news from the US: America\u2019s economy grew much faster than first estimated in the second quarter of the year. Annualised growth has been revised up to 3.7% for the April-June period (or more than 0.9% on a quarterly basis), beating expectations. That\u2019s a sharp increase on the first estimate of 2.3% annualised growth, and means the US outpaced other advanced nations (Britain grew by 0.7% during Q2). That may put more pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon, despite the turbulence in the global economy. But it also suggests the US is better prepared handle such a hike. More detail and reaction shortly... For an insight into China\u2019s economy, you must read Tom Phillips\u2019 latest dispatch about how conditions have worsened. He travelled to a community 45 minutes\u2019 drive from Tiananmen Square, where conditions are tough, and getting tougher. For example: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst we\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s even worse than 2008,\u201d said Liu Weiqin, who like most of the village\u2019s residents hails from Xinyang in south-eastern Henan province, one of China\u2019s most deprived corners. A quick recap of the main points China\u2019s stock market has rebounded today, jumping more than 5% by the close of trading and sparking a break-out of smiles across trading floors. It appears that the Beijing authorities intervened, in an attempt to stop the rout raining on their World War 2 celebration parade next week. Europe\u2019s stock markets are also rallying, clawing back much of their losses on \u2018Black\u2019 Monday and Wednesday. The FTSE 100 is up 140 points, or 2.35%, now at 6119. A senior ECB policymaker has called for closer union to reinforce the single currency, and slay the \u2018evil genie\u2019 of Grexit. Greece is moving closer to snap elections, after opposition parties failed to form a government following the resignation of prime minister Alexis Tsipras last week. Speaking of Grexit...former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has argued that, bad through the eurozone is today, Greece shouldn\u2019t try to get out. That\u2019s one highlight from an interview with Varoufakis by The Conversation, who asked nine economists to put questions to him. For instance: Mark Taylor, University of Warwick - Would you agree that Greece does not fulfil the criteria for successful membership of a currency union with the rest of Europe? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if they left now rather than simply papering over the cracks and waiting for another Greek economic crisis to occur in a few years\u2019 time? Varoufakis: The eurozone\u2019s design was such that even France and Italy could not thrive within it. Under the current institutional design only currency union east of the Rhine and north of the Alps would be sustainable. Alas, it would constitute a union useless to Germany, as it would fail to protect it from constant revaluation in response to its trade surpluses. Now, if by \u201ccriteria\u201d you meant the Maastricht limits, it is of course clear that Greece did not fulfil them. But then again nor did Italy or Belgium. Conversely, Spain and Ireland did meet the criteria and, indeed, by 2007 the Madrid and Dublin governments were registering deficit, debt and inflation numbers that, according to the official criteria, were better than Germany\u2019s. And yet when the crisis hit, Spain and Ireland sunk into the mire. In short, the eurozone was badly designed for everyone. Not just for Greece. So should we cut our losses and get out? To answer properly we need to grasp the difference between saying that Greece, and other countries, should not have entered the eurozone, and saying now that we should now exit. Put technically, we have a case of hysteresis: once a nation has taken the path into the eurozone, that path disappeared after the euro\u2019s creation and any attempt to reverse along that, now non-existent, path could lead to a great fall off a tall cliff. Varoufakis also denied bluffing during the months of negotiations, and revealed he was once accused of \u2018lecturing\u2019 the eurogroup.... Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, an executive board member of European Central Bank, has taken a stinging swipe at those who allowed Greece to almost crash out of the eurozone this summer. In a speech to ambassadors in Paris, C\u0153ur\u00e9 demanded that eurozone leaders achieve closer unity, to avoid the single currency splintering. In what looks rather like an attack on Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, C\u0153ur\u00e9 said the euro was \u201can irreversible project, not simply a fixed exchange rate system\u201d. This statement is all the more necessary as the recent negotiations concerning Greece have let the evil genie of a country exiting the euro area (even temporarily) out of the bottle. The exit of a member country would inevitably lead economic actors to wonder who would be next, with all the potential destabilising effects that such speculation could entail. The genie will not be put back in its bottle once and for all until it is clear that such a risk will not rear its head again. We need to use the confidence in the single currency to build institutions that will reinforce the cohesion of our economic and political union. Readers may recall that, last month, Sch\u00e4uble proposed allowing Greece to temporarily exit the eurozone, allowing debt restructuring. C\u0153ur\u00e9\u2019s speech is well worth a read; his conclusion urges today\u2019s politicians to match the achievements of their predecessors: There is nothing inevitable about the status quo, but, to go beyond it, we need to rediscover the spirit of Robert Schuman. In 1950, this French Foreign Minister had the political courage to propose to Germany that the two countries pool their economic resources and share sovereignty within a common institution. This gave birth to European integration. Let\u2019s not forget that shared ambition is a powerful driving force. Herbert Blankenhorn, then Adenauer\u2019s diplomatic advisor, recorded in his diary the Chancellor\u2019s words of 24 May 1950 and the optimism inspired in him by Schuman\u2019s plan: \u201cWenn Furcht beseitigt werde, werde Europa wie ein genesender Kranker seine Kr\u00e4fte wiederfinden\u201d [\u201cOnce fear has been overcome, Europe, like a convalescing patient, will find its strength again\u201d]. Luxury jeweller Tiffany has just given Wall Street a reminder not to get too optimistic. Tiffany is cutting its earning forecast for the year, after posting the second straight quarter of lower sales. It has been hit by the strong dollar, which has deterred tourists from visiting the US and also dented the value of overseas sales. Despite capital controls and bank closures, Greeks managed to withdraw almost \u20ac1.5bn from the banking sector during the wild weeks of July. New data shows that deposits hit a new 12-year low last month, to \u20ac120.8bn from \u20ac122.2bn in June. If China\u2019s market wobble does ease, investors can go back to worrying about Greece. The next Greek election will move a step closer today, when the left-wing Popular Unity party hands back the \u2018mandate\u2019 to form a government. That means president Prokopis Pavlopoulos will then gather all party leaders to see if a coalition government can be formed (highly unlikely), or move on to the next stage -- a caretaker government and an election date. That election may leave Greece as unstable as ever. Last night, outgoing prime minister Alexis Tsipras ruled out forming a coalition with any of the centrist opposition parties: center-right New Democracy, the socialist Pasok party or the small centrist To Potami party. AP reports: \u201cI think that all three parties essentially express the old political system,\u201d he said in an interview with private Alpha TV Wednesday evening. Not that Tsipras is guaranteed to win power again. His Syriza party has been hit by defections, since the leftist wing split off to form Popular Unity. China\u2019s army of small investors were all smiles today, as the Shanghai index rallied by over 5% by the close of trading today: After three days of wild swings, London\u2019s stock market is a calmer place this morning. Every share on the FTSE 100 is up, meaning the blue-chip index has recovered most of the losses earlier this week. Mining shares are doing well, along with chipmaker ARM and Standard Chartered, the bank. They\u2019re all particularly exposed to China\u2019s economy. Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets says the City is shaking off Black Monday, and going bargain-hunting: \u201cEquity markets are positive this morning, as a perceived recovery continues following Monday\u2019s flash crash. Encouraging news from the US Fed finally giving markets something other than \u2018buy it \u2018cos it\u2019s cheap\u2019 to bite on while China continues to engage in some wild volatility. Still, the developed world appears to be getting on with things. China\u2019s government intervened to boost the stock market today, says Bloomberg: China wants the market to stabilize ahead of a Sept. 3 military parade celebrating the World War II victory over Japan, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move wasn\u2019t publicly announced. The government bought blue-chip stocks, according to one of the people. This would explain that late rally in Shanghai, in which the index jumped over 5%. It also suggests Beijing will keep propping up the market, if needed, until the WW2 commemoration is over. Germany\u2019s stock market has now recovered all the losses made earlier this week. The DAX is now up almost 3% today, outpacing the rest of Europe. German companies are benefitting from the weaker euro. It has dropped below $1.13 after the European Central Bank hinted it could ease monetary policy, should inflation remain too low. There\u2019s a suspicion that the Chinese authorities intervened today, to push the Shanghai market higher after it had a late wobble. Zhang Gang, a strategist at Central China Securities in Shanghai, says: \u201cHeavyweight stocks like banks and insurance companies helped pull up the index, and it\u2019s possibly China Securities Finance entering the market again to shore up stocks.\u201d China Securities Finance are part of the \u2018National Team\u2019 of state-directed investors. Financial markets remain \u201cmessy, but also somewhat less volatile\u201d today, says Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. China is obviously a worry; the other issue remains the timing of the first US interest rate hike. Right now, the Federal Reserve seems unlikely to act in September, which is helping to push shares higher. Kit writes: Markets are a mixture of nervousness (about Fed policy, PBOC policy and the economy) and dovish Fed expectations. Positioning for the Fed to be more dovish than you think is likely (or even possible) has not been a bad trading strategy for the last decade or so, and partly explains why market pricing of Fed moves is for them to act later and go slower than most economists believe they will. Here\u2019s a reminder of why we shouldn\u2019t get carried away: Some cutting-edge technical analysis of the Chinese stock market\u2019s rally: As FastFT points out, we don\u2019t really know, yet, why the Chinese stock market jumped today. Have China\u2019s mom-and-pop investors rediscovered faith in Beijing\u2019s leaders, or has Beijing itself just directed its state-owned enterprises, or its margin-lending arm, to buy more shares? Impossible to say, for now.... Many Chinese stocks had to be suspended today because they jumped 10%, the maximum allowed in one session. It was another volatile day, though, with the index flirting with another loss before that late surge: Today\u2019s rally in China was partly driven by reports that Beijing is taking new steps to prop up the market: China\u2019s stock market has just posted its biggest one-day jump since July 9th, ending five days of heavy losses. A late surge drove the Shanghai stock market up by around 5.4% by the close of trading. After several panicky days, calm returned to the markets today. Here\u2019s Reuters take: Sentiment was aided by comments from New York Fed President William Dudley on Wednesday who said the prospect of a September rate hike \u201cseems less compelling\u201d than it was only weeks ago. \u201cFrom today, I\u2019m no longer pessimistic,\u201d Jiang Chao, a strategist at Haitong Securities, who correctly predicted China\u2019s stellar bull run which ended in mid-June, wrote on Thursday. It\u2019s only one day, of course, and it only makes a small dent in the rout that began two months ago: And it doesn\u2019t mean China has suddenly solved its big economic challenges - including a slowing economy, rising bad debts, capital outflows. But still, a reassuring sign. European stock markets are surging at the open. The FTSE 100 index jumped by around 150 points at the start of trading, a gain of over 2%. The relief rally that began on New York last night, when the Dow jumped almost 4%, is pushing other European markets up over 2% too. Traders are relieved that the Federal Reserve is now unlikely to raise interest rates next month, which means the era of ultra-cheap money will last longer. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: Yesterday\u2019s more dovish comments by NY Fed President Dudley, who had previously been one of the FOMC members pushing for an rate increase but now views the case as \u201cless compelling\u201d, appear to have reassured investors that the Fed is unlikely to add further to current market volatility. China\u2019s stock market is surging higher in late trading, rather than suffering its now-traditional late sell-off. A flood of buy orders is pushing Shanghai\u2019s index up by 5%, having been down just 30 minutes ago... Japan\u2019s stock market has closed, up more than 1%, as traders in Tokyo rediscovered their appetite for riskier assets. The Nikkei gained 196 points to 18,574, after last night\u2019s rally on Wall Street calmed fears. We can\u2019t blame China for this, but it appears Britain\u2019s housing boom is cooling off. Nationwide, the building society, reports that annual growth slowed to 3.2% in August, the weakest since mid 2013. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, says: \u201cThis month\u2019s data provides further evidence that annual house price growth may be stabilising close to the pace of earnings growth, which has historically been around 4%.\u201d Even so, you\u2019ll still need almost two hundred grand to secure the average property (in London, the average is now over \u00a3500k....) Good morning from London. After Wednesday\u2019s wobble, City traders are expecting a turnaround today. Shares are tipped to push higher across Europe, following yesterday\u2019s surge on Wall Street which ended six days of losses. Today\u2019s recovery in Asia may also calm the nerves, after several wild days. Although China hasn\u2019t closed yet, so there\u2019s still time for late drama in Shanghai.... IG are predicting triple-digit gains on most of the European indices, which would reverse yesterday\u2019s selloff. I\u2019m handing over to Graeme Wearden in London now so a quick summary of where we are. Markets are closing in Japan, Australia and Seoul where they\u2019ve had a pretty good day. The Shanghai Composite has flirted with negativity but is now up 0.82%. European and US futures point to early gains One reason for the market turbulence in China could be the recent exodus of skilled regulators, Reuters reports. It says many experienced Chinese market professionals brought back to China from overseas after the GFC have quit in recent months after becoming disillusioned with owrking for the state-party machine, leaving serious skill gaps. Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda has played down the impact of the China turmoil, saying that Japanese exports are competitive and could withstand a weakening of the yuan. Mixed Australian business investment figures have raised questions about the country\u2019s Q2 growth number next week. The Australian economy is as good a proxy for China as any in the world. After the Fed\u2019s Bill Dudley hinted on Wednesday that there would be no rate rise in September, rune readers are shifting attention to the Fed\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole starting tonight. The business investment figures for Australia published earlier today have prompted Goldman Sachs and UBS to say that their Q2 GDP predictions might be wrong on the downside. Chris Weston of IG asking if the figure could even be negative... On China, Angus Nicholson makes the point that many others have made that China might have avoided this week\u2019s shenanigans if they\u2019d taken some action over the weekend instead of leaving it to Tuesday night. The stock market seems to be responding positively to these [stimulus] moves. One wonders if the record losses seen globally on Monday could have been avoided had the RRR cuts come over the weekend as some called for. It looks like the Fed\u2019s annual symposium of economists and central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week will be closely watched by the markets for smoke signals as to where policy might be heading. Angus Nicholson at IG in Melbourne writes: Attention will be keenly focussed on the speeches at the Jackson Hole symposium, which begins tonight. However, I think the market will largely be looking towards December as the most likely date if a [Fed] rate hike happens this year. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets in London agrees: European and US markets look set to open higher with futures pointing to a 0.3% rise in London and the Dow up 0.13% The Chinese markets are about to resume after their lunch break but they\u2019ve had a decent day so far. The Shanghai Composite rose as much 3% in early trade but ended the morning up 1.55% at 2,972 points. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 2.28% at 21,560. And that strange thing sentiment might have turned a bit. \u201cFrom today, I\u2019m no longer pessimistic,\u201d Jiang Chao, a strategist at Haitong Securities. He reckons China\u2019s central bank will cut interest rates further. Another interesting take from Reuters and some of the factors behind the China turmoil. It is reporting that China\u2019s policy makers were surprised at the adverse world reaction to its moves to devalue the yuan two weeks ago, quoting an unnamed economist at the cabinet\u2019s think-tank. Any plans that might have existed to weaken the currency by up 10% (it\u2019s so far off about 4%) have faded, Reuters says, because of anxiety about how such a move could fuel further capital outflows (see the Guardian\u2019s Phillip Inman on this subject). Government economists and policy advisers say the PBoC will now try to stop the yuan weakening much past 6.5 per dollar, which is 4.5% below its pre-devaluation levels. On Thursday morning, the yuan traded as low as 6.4162 per dollar. The economist says: The global reaction was bigger than expected. The global economy is very fragile. Competitive currency devaluations could in turn affect China\u2019s own economy - undermine its exports and investment. [We] chose the timing as the economy weakened and the stock market plunged, sending out a wrong signal to foreign countries that you want to spur the economy through devaluation and leading to competitive devaluations. This put us on the defensive; it looks like China is the trigger. The Aussie dollar is having a tough afternoon and heading back towards lows of US70.70 touched overnight. It\u2019s buying US71.18c at the moment or 2.18 of your British pounds. Good time for holidays Down Under, I\u2019d say. Thailand exports down 3.6% year-on-year and imports down 12.7% Interesting piece on Reuters about how some of the problems could be down to the loss of key regulatory personnel. After the GFC, it says, Beijing poached top Chinese talent from overseas banks to come home and overhaul the country\u2019s financial system. But by June this year, they\u2019d become disillusioned and headed back to the private sector: The best and brightest returnees, known in China as \u201csea turtles\u201d, had already left for the private sector, disillusioned and disappointed. A former official at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, one of a group of 20 high-profile returnees, recalled the CSRC\u2019s appeal to make \u201csacrifices for the motherland\u201d. \u201cWe moved our families back to China and gave up high-paying jobs, because we wanted to contribute,\u201d he said. He said the group was sent for special training at Jinggangshan, a former revolutionary base used by Mao Zedong during the Chinese civil war. Their idealism soon turned to cynicism. Their pay was a fraction of what they could earn in the private sector, and the CSRC didn\u2019t seem to value them. Several years passed, and none of us got promoted,\u201d said the official. \u201cSome of us didn\u2019t even obtain a concrete position.\u201d \u201cJust at the time they needed people with both domestic and international experience, those most internationally experienced people were forced out,\u201d said Liu Li-Gang, China economist at ANZ. Reuters notes that the CSRC did not reply to requests for comment. Fairly steady on the markets still. Tokyo is well-placed at lunch having put on 1.89% without loss, while in Australia the ASX is batting through the break at +1.28%. In China, the Shanghai Comp has played a riskier knock but is up 1.55% for the day so far despite nearly falling into the trap earlier in the session. Elsewhere: Hang Seng 2.47% Kospi up 1.04% More great writing from the Guardian on the China business, this time from our resident Australian economics commentator Greg Jericho. His take is that the plunge in Chinese markets isn\u2019t that bad per se \u2013 it\u2019s more what it says about demand for Australian exports that is the problem. Deconstructing Joe Hockey\u2019s analysis of the Chinese economy this week that the fundamental were improving \u2013 a triumph of the \u201cshe\u2019ll be right\u201d school of philosophy \u2013 Greg writes that Beijing wouldn\u2019t have cut rates four times this year if they weren\u2019t worried: Of course the Chinese government is only doing such things because it is worried that the \u201cfundamentals\u201d are not actually \u201cgradually improving\u201d. Quite a good one-sentence analysis from Shigemitsu Tsuruta, senior strategist at SMBC Friend Securities in Tokyo, on Reuters referring to speculation that the Fed will not raise rates in September: The market has started to price in this prospect while the current level provides a good short-term rebound opportunity. OK, trading is looking quite serene today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far: Asian markets are all on the up and up. The Nikkei is up nearly 2%, the ASX200 is up 1,43%, the Hang Seng 2.47%, the Kospi 1.25% and even the Shanghai Composite is going along well in positive territory, up 1.47%. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.8%, pulling away from a three-year low hit earlier in the week. The yuan has weakened to a four-year low BOJ governor says China slowdown won\u2019t affect Japan too badly Australian business investment fell in the second quarter but looks like it will grow for the second part of the year Commodity prices are stabilising a little And we have an excellent piece from Tom Phillips on the wider economic picture for China\u2019s poor migrant workers Tom\u2019s excellent piece also includes some fascinating insights from China expert Fraser Howie, author of Red Capitalism, who talks about what the struggles of working people tell us about the country\u2019s governing class: Much of the party\u2019s legitimacy comes from the economy and from the Faustian bargain of limited political freedoms and social freedoms against economic prosperity. Any time there is a slowing economy the government is concerned about it for exactly those reasons \u2013 the people lose their jobs, there will not be the wage growth, people will not be able to enjoy the benefits of prosperity. The fear has to be \u2026 that party stability is on the line if the economy doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Intra-party battles are already going on thick and fast. The Chinese Communist party is more worried than almost any outside observer about the stability of the party. Foreigners always say: \u2018Oh, yes, it will be fine\u2019. But I think the Chinese communists are far better aware of how they could be toppled or how their party could collapse from the inside relatively quickly. Tom Phillips, our correspondent in Beijing, has filed a terrific piece on how poor migrant workers are feeling the effects of the economic slowdown in China. He met Liu, a scrap metal dealer whose business on the hardscrabble outskirts of Beijing has dried up, forcing her to return to her home village in south-east China with her two young children. Abandoning Beijing was her family\u2019s only option, she said. It\u2019s natural. We came here for work. We lost 200,000 yuan. We can\u2019t afford to live here any more. Maybe one day we\u2019ll return - but I don\u2019t know when. Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, has been speaking in New York about the China situation (still not sure there\u2019s a consensus on crisis). He said China\u2019s economy is likely to slow further although he predicted growth in its GDP will remain at 6-7% this year and next, Reuters reports: Already exports to China have been affected, but I do not think that Japan exports in coming years will be (very) negatively affected ... partly because China will maintain growth and Japanese capital goods are... quite competitive. Kuroda said China\u2019s monetary easing was an appropriate step to mitigate any impact on its economy, adding that some market players have become \u201ctoo pessimistic\u201d on the Chinese economy given its growth is \u201cstill quite robust\u201d. On US monetary policy, Kuroda said he expected the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sometime this year, which would be a strong positive signal for the global economy. Those poor investment numbers took a bit of bite out of the ASX200 \u2013 it fell to around 5240 \u2013 but it\u2019s back up again now because the stats are actually more promising than the headline number suggests. While capex fell in the second quarter to the end of June, businesses are planning to invest more than previously thought in the rest of the year to the tune of about 10% more. Business investment fell 4% in the June quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. The figures, which cover investment in capital goods and include such things as buildings and equipment, was worse than market forecasts, Australian Associated Press reports. Businesses expect to invest $114.8bn this financial year, which is 23.4% lower than the corresponding estimate made at the same time last year. The final estimate for business investment in 2014/15 is $150.58bn \u2013 4.7% lower than investment in 2013/14. Poor figures for a government banking on selling a growth story. China\u2019s stock markets may have risen today but the yuan has weakened on hints from the US about the Fed delaying a rate hike. The People\u2019s Bank of China set the reference rate for the yuan at 6.4085 per dollar prior to market open, its lowest level since 2011 and firmer than the previous day\u2019s closing market quote of 6.4105. Great work by the graphics team in London to produce this interactive on how a China meltdown could affect different countries. Hang Seng in Hong Kong is also up with a rise of 2.43%. Looking good for Shanghai. Just waiting for the first prices to come through from China but the Australian market is purring away nicely, up 1.5%. IG Market analyst Angus Nicholson reckon whatever happens in China won\u2019t have too much impact today: The Chinese stock market is having less of an influence on the Aussie stocks at the moment. The Chinese economy is still a concern for the world economy at the moment but we\u2019re seeing the Shanghai Composite bottom a bit, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see as much influence today when the Chinese stock market opens. The plunge in commodities prices this year \u2013 especially oil \u2013 has been astonishing. Despite a rise on Thursday because of an unexpected fall in inventory last week, US crude was still under $40 a barrel at $39.19. Brent, the global oil benchmark, gained 64 cents to $43.78 a barrel. Seriously though, does anyone remember peak oil? I guess it could still turn around sharply again with a wider Middle East conflict or some such black swan event, but the idea that economies might be broken by sky-high oil prices has been replaced by the one that says certain countries could be broken by low prices. Check out how Russia and even Saudi Arabia are struggling with the falling price. What he really means is, will China\u2019s chart go more like Thunderbirds 3 or Thunderbirds 4, the one that went underwater? We\u2019ll find out when trading starts at 11.30am Sydney time, ie in about 22 minutes. But with Wall Street back on song and the Asia pacific markets up again today, what can possibly can wrong? Well, investors are still not convinced about what\u2019s going to happen in China where the weak stock market is seen as being important more because it suggests all is not well with the wider economy, rather than as the root of any systemic problem. Reuters says a \u201cfresh slide in China\u2019s equities [on Thursday] and worries that China may allow a further depreciation of the yuan risked hampering a recovery in other riskier assets in Asia and beyond\u201d. It quotes Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets: Rather than getting ahead of the game with a well thought out plan for stabilising the economy, the PBOC appears to be reluctantly easing policy any time there\u2019s a drop in share prices. The net effect is that markets clamour for more stimulus while at the same time losing faith it will actually work. It was too late for European bourses though which had struggled on the back of another lacklustre response from the Chinese markets to yet more stimulus \u2013 rate cuts and a loosening of reserve requirements \u2013 from the People\u2019s Bank of China on Tuesday. The FTSE was down 102 points to 5,979 on Wednesday. It has now fallen for 11 of the last 12 days (on Tuesday it jumped by 188 points), and is currently 15% off its record high. Germany\u2019s DAX and Spain\u2019s IBEX both lost 1.3%, and the French CAC dropped 1.4%. The key plus-point for the American market seemed to be comments from New York Fed president Bill Dudley who said on Wednesday that a September interest rate rise was now \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been just a few weeks ago. The decision to begin the normalisation process at the September FOMC [federal open market committee] meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago He was also keen to play down any systemic risk from the China turbulence. The stock market has to move a lot \u2013 and stay there \u2013 to have implications for the US economy. What we\u2019re seeing is not a US problem. This is very different from the financial crisis.\u201d And with the prospect of more cheap money sloshing around the system for a bit longer than everyone had begin to expect, traders went away happy and the market surged. The ASX200 in Australia is up smartly again this morning after a good day on Wednesday saw it recoup a lot of the losses from earlier in the week, rising 35.5 points, or 0.69%, at 5,172.8 points. This is this morning\u2019s chart, where it resembles roughly half of Thunderbirds 3. Welcome to the Asia leg of the markets live blog. We\u2019ve all had time to pause and reflect in the time zone but now things are under way again and the Australian and Japanese markets are up strongly following a huge 619-point surge on Wall Street on Wednesday. For full details of how it played out yesterday, here\u2019s the blog. More of that in a moment \u2013 especially some interesting comments from a Federal Reserve rates setter \u2013 but here are the main scores on the doors this morning. Nikkei +1.4% ASX200 +1.3% Kospi +0.56% The yen is also down on the dollar while the Aussie dollar is currently buying US71.24c.",

Wouldn\u2019t it be better if they left now rather than simply papering over the cracks and waiting for another Greek economic crisis to occur in a few years\u2019 time?</em></p> <p><strong>Varoufakis:</strong> The eurozone\u2019s design was such that even France and Italy could not thrive within it. Under the current institutional design only currency union east of the Rhine and north of the Alps would be sustainable. Alas, it would constitute a union useless to Germany, as it would fail to protect it from constant revaluation in response to its trade surpluses.</p> <p>Now, if by \u201ccriteria\u201d you meant <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/economic_governance/sgp/index_en.htm\">the Maastricht limits</a>, it is of course clear that Greece did not fulfil them. But then again nor did Italy or Belgium. Conversely, Spain and Ireland did meet the criteria and, indeed, by 2007 the Madrid and Dublin governments were registering deficit, debt and inflation numbers that, according to the official criteria, were better than Germany\u2019s. And yet when the crisis hit, Spain and Ireland sunk into the mire. In short, the eurozone was badly designed for everyone. Not just for Greece.</p> <p>So should we cut our losses and get out? To answer properly we need to grasp the difference between saying that Greece, and other countries, should not have entered the eurozone, and saying now that we should now exit. Put technically, we have a case of hysteresis: once a nation has taken the path into the eurozone, that path disappeared after the euro\u2019s creation and any attempt to reverse along that, now non-existent, path could lead to a great fall off a tall cliff.</p> </blockquote> <p>Varoufakis also denied bluffing during the months of negotiations, and revealed he was once accused of \u2018lecturing\u2019 the eurogroup.... </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ConversationUK/statuses/636865567933222914\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis\">@yanisvaroufakis</a> explains what happened during the Troika negotiations.&#10;&#10;Read in full here: <a href=\"http://t.co/OnXqljGdU3\">http://t.co/OnXqljGdU3</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/clZcZeOwKt\">pic.twitter.com/clZcZeOwKt</a></p>&mdash; The Conversation (@ConversationUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConversationUK/status/636865567933222914\">August 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55def9c6e4b0778f0c23e79c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-27T12:03:42.768Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB's C\u0153ur\u00e9: Evil genie of euro exit must be slain</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5c4f33eb71b2c92ae2de91a6061ee7a7fd846b23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c4f33eb71b2c92ae2de91a6061ee7a7fd846b23/0_0_3500_2515/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Euro logo is pictured in front of the former headquarter of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany, on July 20, 2015 as Greece has begun making a 4.2 billion euro ($4.6 billion) payment due to the ECB as well as outstanding sums due to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) according to a ministerial source.

The genie will not be put back in its bottle once and for all until it is clear that such a risk will not rear its head again.</p> <p>We need to use the confidence in the single currency to build institutions that will reinforce the cohesion of our economic and political union.</p> </blockquote> <p>Readers may recall that, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jul/16/greek-debt-crisis-ecb-and-eurogroup-consider-next-steps-after-yes-vote-live#block-55a75650e4b0f63008f14049\">last month</a>, Sch\u00e4uble proposed allowing Greece to temporarily exit the eurozone, allowing debt restructuring.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2015/html/sp150827.en.html\">C\u0153ur\u00e9\u2019s speech</a> is well worth a read; his conclusion urges today\u2019s politicians to match the achievements of their predecessors:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is nothing inevitable about the status quo, but, to go beyond it, we need to rediscover the spirit of Robert Schuman. In 1950, this French Foreign Minister had the political courage to propose to Germany that the two countries pool their economic resources and share sovereignty within a common institution. This gave birth to European integration.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that shared ambition is a powerful driving force. Herbert Blankenhorn, then Adenauer\u2019s diplomatic advisor, recorded in his diary the Chancellor\u2019s words of 24 May 1950 and the optimism inspired in him by Schuman\u2019s plan: \u201cWenn Furcht beseitigt werde, werde Europa wie ein genesender Kranker seine Kr\u00e4fte wiederfinden\u201d [\u201cOnce fear has been overcome, Europe, like a convalescing patient, will find its strength again\u201d].</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OpenEurope/statuses/636865089396674560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Important speech by ECB&#39;s Coeur\u00e9 on future of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurozone?src=hash\">#Eurozone</a>.

      "bodyText": "Most of the world\u2019s stock markets had recovered from days of losses on Thursday, shaking off concerns about the health of the Chinese economy. All of the main major US markets closed up more than 2% to round off a day of gains around most of the world as investors faith was restored by better-than-expected US gross domestic product (GDP) data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 369 points (2.27%) to 16,655 points, which following on from a 619-point increase on Wednesday made it the biggest two-day rise since December 2008. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both closed up 2.4% to 1,987.7 and 4,812.7, respectively. The resurgent markets helped lift the oil price, which had suffered big losses in recent weeks, by more than 10% \u2013 the biggest one-day gain since 2008. US oil rose by $3.96 (10.3%) to $42.56 a barrel. US markets were lifted by figures showing a 3.7% increase in second quarter GDP 2015 up from the Commerce Department\u2019s initial estimate of 2.3% growth. Economists had forecast a 3.3% rate. \u201cConsumer are spending, businesses are investing, the housing market is recovering, state and local governments are boosting outlays, and the federal government is no longer a drag on growth,\u201d said Stu Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial. \u201cTrade will remain a weak spot with slow global growth and the strong dollar, but solid domestic fundamentals will be more than enough to overcome this.\u201d The GDP numbers come ahead of a crucial meeting of the Federal Reserve in September when the governors may vote for the first increase in interest rates since the recession. The wild gyrations triggered by China\u2019s apparent slowdown had led many to speculate that the Fed may hold off raising rates in September. On Wednesday, Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve and a member of the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, said a September interest rate rise was \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been a few weeks ago. Dudley also sought to reassure investors that a recent global stock market rout did not reflect a problem with the US economy. The indication that a rate rise would be delayed helped to calm investors unnerved by the prospect of an imminent tightening in credit costs in the world\u2019s largest economy. The prospect of a rate increase had also alarmed global stock markets because it could draw investment funds out of emerging markets and back to the US. Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG in New York, said the GDP figures are likely to have a big impact on policymakers. \u201cFed officials are likely to view the economy as having a bit more \u2018oomph\u2019 than originally thought heading into Q3,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. \u201cWhether they want for more info or not aside, the economy clearly snapped back to a healthy degree from Q1\u2019s weakness.\u201d Markets in most of the rest of the world also closed higher on Thursday. The FTSE 100 in London clawed back almost all its losses this week after it closed 3.5% higher. Germany\u2019s Dax closed 3.2% higher at 10,315 and France\u2019s Cac was up 3.5%. Stocks were also up across Asia after a week of turmoil on the international markets. China posted its biggest one-day jump since 9 July after six days of heavy losses. In Japan, the Nikkei closed 1.08% higher, while South Korea\u2019s Kopsi rose 0.54%. However, there were warnings that the rally could prove to be a \u201cdead cat bounce\u201d as the core concerns over the health of China\u2019s economy remain. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: \u201cVolatility like this doesn\u2019t tend to disappear fast and with volumes set to thin out ahead of the long weekend, there\u2019s certainly the prospect of seeing more big moves in the near term.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Philip Clarke to be interviewed by fraud office over Tesco accounting scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke is set to be questioned by the Serious Fraud Office as it nears the conclusion of an investigation into a multi-million-pound accounting scandal at the retailer. Clarke, who left Tesco in August last year after overseeing a dive in sales and profits, will be interviewed under caution by the SFO, meaning that any testimony he gives can be used in evidence. Tesco\u2019s former commercial director, Kevin Grace, has also been called in, according to Bloomberg which first reported the story. The SFO kicked off a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014 after the company admitted that it had overstated profits by \u00a3263m because it had incorrectly booked payments from suppliers, for reasons such as marketing costs or reaching sales target. Some Tesco suppliers and other directors including Carl Rogberg, the former UK finance director, Laurie McIlwee, the former group finance director, are also believed to have had contact with the SFO earlier this year. The issue is also being investigated by the grocery market watchdog \u2013 the Groceries Code Adjudicator \u2013 and the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council. The profit black hole emerged just weeks after the arrival of new chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in to turn around falling sales and profits at Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. After a whistleblower alerted Lewis, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August last year. They found similar practices had been in place in prior reporting periods. In April this year, Tesco said it had found another \u00a360m more in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations. Tesco declined to comment on Thursday but has previously said that it would fully co-operate with the SFO. Earlier this year, that led to speculation that the supermarket could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution. SFO director, David Green, has said he expects the investigation into Tesco will be resolved by the end of this year. Under new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d (DPA), which requires high court approval. It includes fines and other undertakings, if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. In May, Ben Morgan, the SFO\u2019s joint head of bribery and corruption, revealed that the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations. A DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company. Clarke joined Tesco as a schoolboy shelf-stacker in 1974. His father also worked for the business. He took over from long-term Tesco boss, Terry Leahy, in 2011 and spent more than \u00a31bn revamping the chain\u2019s UK stores and product ranges. Yet he failed to spot rising competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl early enough or to stem the tide of shopper defections to rivals. The announcement of his departure last summer came as a surprise for Clarke, who was preparing to celebrate his 40th year at the company with a party in central London. Clarke said it was an \u201cemotional\u201d time but that he had \u201cnothing to regret\u201d during his three-year reign. Clarke was paid \u00a31.2m for loss of office. Tesco tried and failed to withhold that payment, and another to McIlwee, while it carried out an investigation into the accounting scandal. It has said would seek to recover the money if either was found to have been guilty of gross misconduct. \u201cWe have explicitly reserved the company\u2019s rights to pursue recovery of these payments,\u201d the retailer said in its annual report published in May. Tesco continues to endure a difficult period. Worries about poor trading and difficulties with planned sales of its South Korean and Clubcard business have driven the company\u2019s shares down more than 12% in the past month alone. The retailer slumped to a record annual loss of \u00a36.4bn when it announced it had axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs, as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group\u2019s banking division. A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores earlier this month.",

Some Tesco suppliers and other directors including Carl Rogberg, the former UK finance director, Laurie McIlwee, the former group finance director, are also believed to have had contact with the SFO earlier this year.</p> <p>The issue is also being investigated by the grocery market watchdog \u2013 the Groceries Code Adjudicator \u2013 and the accountancy watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council.</p> <p>The profit black hole emerged just weeks after the arrival of new chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in to turn around falling sales and profits at Britain\u2019s biggest retailer.<br></p> <p>After a whistleblower alerted Lewis, a team of forensic accountants from Deloitte established that Tesco had artificially inflated an estimate of first-half profits given to the City in August last year. They found similar practices had been in place in prior reporting periods. In April this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\">Tesco said it had found another \u00a360m more in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations</a>.</p> <p>Tesco declined to comment on Thursday but has previously said that it would fully co-operate with the SFO. Earlier this year, that led to speculation that the supermarket <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/29/tesco-profits-scandal-accountancy-watchdog-suppliers-\">could be one of the first companies in the UK to strike a new type of deal with the SFO which would enable it to avoid a criminal prosecution</a>. SFO director, David Green, has said he expects the investigation into Tesco will be resolved by the end of this year.</p> <p>Under new powers introduced last year, the SFO can offer a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d (DPA), which requires high court approval. It includes fines and other undertakings, if that is considered to be in the public interest and a company cooperates. <br></p> <p>In May, Ben Morgan, the SFO\u2019s joint head of bribery and corruption, revealed that the watchdog had handed out its first invitation letters for companies to enter into DPA negotiations. A DPA deal does not protect individuals who might face criminal charges with the help of evidence provided by the company.</p> <p>Clarke joined Tesco as a schoolboy shelf-stacker in 1974. His father also worked for the business. He took over from long-term Tesco boss, Terry Leahy, in 2011 and spent more than \u00a31bn revamping the chain\u2019s UK stores and product ranges. Yet he failed to spot rising competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl early enough or to stem the tide of shopper defections to rivals. <br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/21/tesco-ousts-philip-clarke-after-profit-warning\">The announcement of his departure last summer came as a surprise for Clarke</a>, who was preparing to celebrate his 40th year at the company with a party in central London. Clarke said it was an \u201cemotional\u201d time but that he had \u201cnothing to regret\u201d during his three-year reign. </p> <p>Clarke was paid \u00a31.2m for loss of office. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> tried and failed to withhold that payment, and another to McIlwee, while it carried out an investigation into the accounting scandal. It has said would seek to recover the money if either was found to have been guilty of gross misconduct. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/21/tesco-power-claw-back-senior-executives-bonuses\">\u201cWe have explicitly reserved the company\u2019s rights to pursue recovery of these payments,\u201d </a>the retailer said in its annual report published in May.</p> <p>Tesco continues to endure a difficult period. Worries about poor trading and difficulties with planned sales of its South Korean and Clubcard business have driven the company\u2019s shares down more than 12% in the past month alone.</p> <p>The retailer slumped to a record annual loss of \u00a36.4bn when it announced it had axed nearly 5,000 head office and UK store management jobs, as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group\u2019s banking division. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/tesco-names-43-stores-to-close\">A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores earlier this month</a>.</p>",

The London index rose by 212 points to 6,192 \u2013 only 14 points shy of its closing level on Friday. The FTSE tracked a rally in New York led by the Dow Jones industrial average which was 305 points or 1.9% higher as the FTSE closed, ending a six-day sell-off sparked by global concerns about the health of the Chinese economy. Germany\u2019s Dax closed 3.2% higher at 10,315. Stocks were also up across Asia after a week of turmoil on the international markets. China posted its biggest one-day jump since 9 July after six days of heavy losses. In Japan, the Nikkei closed 1.08% higher, while South Korea\u2019s Kopsi rose 0.54%. The rally on Wall Street brought some relief to the markets after a tumultuous few days ended with a sharp rebound in China \u2013 where the blue-chip CSI 300 index jumped 6%, to 3,205.64, and the Shanghai Composite Index 5.4%, to 3,083.59 points. The US surge came as bargain hunters piled into the market after an influential Federal Reserve policymaker said it was unlikely that interest rates would rise next month, as had been widely expected. The Dow has recovered most of the losses it incurred on Monday and Tuesday.

The indication that a rate rise would be delayed helped to calm investors unnerved by the prospect of an imminent tightening in credit costs in the world\u2019s largest economy. The prospect of a rate increase had also alarmed global stock markets because it could draw investment funds out of emerging markets and back to the US. In China, Jiang Chao, a strategist at Haitong Securities, predicted that China\u2019s central bank would cut interest rates further, which would make stocks attractive again, given the sharp drop in valuations during the recent crash. \u201cFrom today, I\u2019m no longer pessimistic,\u201d he said. In London there were warnings that with worries remaining over China\u2019s economy, the rally could prove to be a \u201cdead cat bounce\u201d.

Let\u2019s just consider the context. During August there was a big sell-off in shares amid concerns that the Chinese economy was in trouble. The declines, however, followed a long bull market in which prices were supported by the quantitative easing programmes pursued by central banks rather than by underlying economic strength. A true believer in free markets would have seen the recent sell-off as both inevitable and healthy. But financial markets are by no means free. They are, on the contrary, one of the last bastions of socialism left on earth. Everything possible is done to boost asset prices and when overstimulation leads to bubbles bursting it is all hands to the pump to prevent them from falling too far. So, in the last couple of days we have seen the chief economist of the European Central Bank musing openly about the possibility of additional QE. We have had the president of the New York Federal Reserve dropping the biggest possible hint that an interest rate rise will be delayed. And we have had the authorities in Beijing buying up shares on the Shanghai stock market. And guess what? It has worked. Shares have been going up around the world because investors have been given guarantees that they will be protected from the consequences of their own folly. Despite the upward revision to US growth figures, all that Wall Street needs to do to prevent a Fed rate rise is to have another flash crash between now and mid-September. The Fed will then back off. If things get really bad, it will need to consider a fourth dose of QE. Yes, really. George Saravelos, of Deutsche Bank, says there is a reason western central banks, starting with the ECB and the Bank of Japan, might need to again resort to the electronic printing presses: China\u2019s use of its foreign exchange reserves to defend the external value of the yuan. Effectively, China has been selling a chunk of its holdings of foreign bonds, such as US Treasuries. QE involves buying bonds, so what the People\u2019s Bank of China has been doing is QE in reverse or, as Saravelos puts it, quantitative tightening or QT. Ostensibly, QT has always been part of the plan. When central banks embarked on their asset-buying programmes, the intention was that they would be sold back to the markets when things had returned to normal. The problem is that things have never returned to normal and, judging by recent events, never will. Zero interest rates were supposed to be temporary. They are now the norm. QE was an unconventional measure for use in an emergency only. It is here to stay, albeit subject to the law of diminishing returns. Clearly then, you can buck the market. Corrections can be delayed and halted, even reversed, by determined policy action. But, as the history of bubbles from Dutch tulips to subprime mortgages has shown, only for a while.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy picked up pace in the second quarter and beat economists\u2019 estimates as businesses ramped up investment, helping fuel a second-day bounce-back for Wall Street\u2019s battered financial markets. Gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, expanded at a 3.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter of 2015, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, up from the initial estimate of 2.3% growth. Economists had forecast a 3.3% rate. \u201cConsumer are spending, businesses are investing, the housing market is recovering, state and local governments are boosting outlays, and the federal government is no longer a drag on growth,\u201d said Stu Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial. \u201cTrade will remain a weak spot with slow global growth and the strong dollar, but solid domestic fundamentals will be more than enough to overcome this.\u201d The news helped lift US stock markets, which are shaking off days of losses triggered by fears of a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second largest economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 196 points (1.2%) to 16,482 by 10am. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were also up between 1.2% and 1.3%. It comes after the Dow stormed up more than 600 points on Wednesday, making up ground after days of losses triggered by fears about the health of the Chinese economy. The GDP numbers also come ahead of a crucial meeting of the Federal Reserve in September when the governors may vote for the first increase in interest rates since the recession. The wild gyrations triggered by China\u2019s apparent slowdown had led many to speculate that the Fed may hold off raising rates in September. On Wednesday, Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve and a member of the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, said a September interest rate rise was \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been a few weeks ago. \u201cI really do hope we can raise interest rates this year,\u201d he added. Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG in New York, said the GDP figures were likely to have an outsized impact on stock market on Thursday. \u201cThis is the second estimate of second quarter GDP which normally has less impact on the market.

      "bodyText": "Total, one of the biggest energy firms operating in the North Sea, has sold off $900m (\u00a3585m) of UK gas interests to cut costs, amid the continuing collapse of oil prices. The French group is disposing of its interests in two pipelines \u2013 one which delivers gas from 20 North Sea fields \u2013 and its ownership of the St Fergus gas terminal in Scotland. The sale brings the value of disposals by Total to more than \u00a31bn in the last two months. It follows an announcement by Maersk Oil yesterday that the company plans to shut the Janice field in the North Sea and cut 200 jobs. The price of North Sea Brent crude was up more than 6% at almost $45.90 a barrel on Thursday, but was still trading well below half the value it had 12 months ago. The slump has been caused by huge volumes of oil from countries such as the US and Iraq at a time when demand has dropped owing to an economic slowdown in key consuming nations, such as China. The North Sea is particularly vulnerable to cutbacks because it is a relatively high cost, \u201cmature\u201d hydrocarbon province where few operators expect to make significant discoveries any more. Total made clear it wanted to raise funds. \u201cThe sale of these midstream transportation assets is another example of Total\u2019s strategy of active portfolio management, and the strong potential to unlock value from a range of infrastructure assets,\u201d said Patrick de la Chevardi\u00e8re, its chief financial officer. The disposal has been made to the relatively small company North Sea Midstream Partners, which was formed three years ago and is backed by the US-based private equity firm ArcLight Capital. The move by Total follows another massive sale in July, the \u00a3565m transfer of a stake in a gas field off the Shetland Islands to SSE, one of Britain\u2019s big six domestic energy suppliers and more could follow. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, chief executive of Total, said in February his company could dispose up to $5bn of assets this year but not all of this would be in the North Sea. Total was keen to say on Thursday that it remained committed to Britain. It would shortly start up the deepwater field Laggan-Tormore, off the west of Shetland. \u201cBy the end of 2015 Total is expected to become the largest producing oil and gas company in the UK and will remain a major player in the North Sea offshore industry for many years to come,\u201d the company said. Critics fear the retreat of the big oil companies such as Total, Shell and BP, spells the ultimate demise of North Sea production. But the company that bought the Total assets denied this and said companies of its scale and interest could find opportunities larger firms might not. \u201cWe see midstream infrastructure as crucial to the longevity of the North Sea and firmly believe that the independent ownership of such infrastructure can help maximise the ultimate economic recovery of [UK] oil and gas reserves,\u201d said Andy Heppel, chief executive of North Sea Midstream Partners.",

The 5% reduction in gas prices, which was announced in July but came into effect on Thursday, led to criticism that Britain\u2019s biggest energy supplier is not doing enough for customers and that the cuts should have gone further. The move will result in 6.9 million British Gas customers seeing their bills go down. However, the price comparison website uSwitch accused British Gas of \u201cshort-changing\u201d its customers and said the price cuts should have been far bigger given the continued low cost of wholesale energy. \u201cBritish Gas is the biggest energy supplier so they should really be market leading, setting the trend for the others to follow suit,\u201d Ann Robinson, uSwitch\u2019s consumer policy director, said. \u201cAlthough the price cut is welcome, I wanted [British Gas] to do far more and almost shame the other companies into taking action. But instead we get a price cut that is far smaller than it should be. It short-changes their customers and lets the other suppliers off the hook. \u201cI want all of the suppliers to give customers a decent price cut to reflect what has happened to wholesale prices. We have seen these prices falling; they are at a really low level. And we are not talking about months \u2013 it has been well over a year now. \u201cThe reason suppliers give for not cutting prices more is that they buy their stock in advance, and thus was purchased at a pricier level, but that excuse no longer holds water. Now is the time for big suppliers to treat customers fairly.\u201d In response, a British Gas spokesperson said the company always cut prices as much as it could. \u201cWe\u2019re cutting our gas prices by 5% for almost 7 million customers, taking \u00a335 off the average annual bill. This is the second time we have cut prices in six months \u2013 that\u2019s a total saving of more than \u00a372 over the next year. \u201cWe always cut our prices by as much as we can, as soon as we can, when we see a reduction in our own costs, and we were keen to do this ahead of next winter. There are many moving parts to the bill, some have gone up, others have come down but in the round we felt able to cut gas prices by 5%.\u201d So far this year, E.ON has brought down prices by 3.5%, ScottishPower by 4.8%, npower by 5.1% and SSE by 4.1%.",

    "webTitle": "China free trade agreement: Andrew Robb open to constructive talks with Labor", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The trade minister, Andrew Robb, has opened the door to \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with Labor in a bid to salvage the China-Australia free trade agreement, which has been at the centre of a fierce political battle and a forthright campaign by unions. Robb\u2019s offer provides a potential avenue for resolving political disagreement over the contents of the agreement, as Labor weighs up the option of blocking the enabling legislation if the government refuses to increase \u201csafeguards\u201d for Australian jobs. But the scope for a breakthrough is narrow because the government appears determined not to revisit the text of the agreement. Labor\u2019s trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, urged the government to follow the lead of the former prime minister John Howard, who was prepared to sit down with the Labor party in 2004 to discuss additional safeguards for the contentious free trade agreement with the US. Guardian Australia asked Robb whether he was prepared to sit down with Wong to discuss options for getting the enabling legislation through parliament. In response, Robb said he was \u201cmore than happy to constructively engage with Senator Wong\u201d. It is understood Robb and Wong have already had talks. While there might be some room to move on the yet-to-be-released enabling legislation, the government does not want to budge on the text of the agreement, setting up a high-stakes political standoff. Enabling legislation makes any changes to Australian laws that are needed to bring into effect a free trade agreement. Not all aspects of the China deal require legal changes, but a failure to pass the enabling legislation would sink the agreement. In the case of the US free trade agreement, the then Labor leader Mark Latham made his support for the deal conditional on amendments to protect the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Howard suggested the changes were unnecessary and raised concern that they might be inconsistent with the spirit of agreement but \u201cdecided that the commonsense thing to do is to support the amendments\u201d. Robb, who has travelled to Beijing and Shanghai this week to assure his Chinese counterparts about the government\u2019s commitment to the deal, said the legal text of the treaty had been signed off \u201cand it will not be reopened\u201d. If the talks between Robb and Wong fail to produce a compromise, Labor would face a big choice about whether to seek to block the enabling legislation in the Senate. Labor\u2019s leadership faces significant pressure from its industrial base \u2013 with unions running advertising campaigns against the foreign-worker provisions \u2013 and from caucus members who are uneasy about the contents of the deal. The government would also be making a big call if it refused to budge because it would risk having to negotiate with the disparate group of crossbench senators to salvage the deal, a difficult proposition on such a significant trade agreement. A spokeswoman for Wong declined to say whether Labor was prepared to vote against the relevant bills if the party\u2019s requests were not met, but indicated it would \u201cconsider the enabling legislation when it is presented to the parliament later this year\u201d. \u201cLabor welcomes Mr Robb\u2019s belated acknowledgement of concerns about the China free trade agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a demonstration of good faith Mr Robb should cease name-calling anyone who questions his deal and abandon his plan to spend $25m of taxpayers\u2019 money promoting it.\u201d The prospect of talks comes amid an intense political tussle over aspects of the deal relating to foreign workers. Coalition MPs have reported that the union campaigns and automated phone calls are starting to resonate with voters. Tony Abbott ramped up his rhetoric last week, accusing Labor of being \u201chaunted by the ghost of the white Australia policy\u201d. The prime minister further accused the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, of being \u201csilent in the face of racism\u201d by not disowning the CFMEU\u2019s \u201ccampaign of xenophobic lies\u201d against the China deal. In one CFMEU advertisement, a family discusses the free trade agreement. \u201cTony Abbott stuffed it up,\u201d the father says. \u201cHe\u2019s letting Chinese companies bring in their own workers \u2026 they don\u2019t even have to advertise the jobs \u2026 sorry but you won\u2019t even get a look-in, son.\u201d Labor and the unions have suggested the agreement does not protect labour market testing \u2013 that is, a requirement that companies look for local workers before seeking workers from overseas. They have pointed to the process for Chinese-backed companies to bring overseas workers to Australia for projects worth at least $150m, noting the memorandum of understanding says \u201cthere will be no requirement for labour market testing\u201d to enter into an investment facilitation arrangement (IFA). The government contends the criticism is disingenuous because the same document refers to labour market testing by the direct employers after the overarching IFA has been approved. The government says employers will not be permitted to bring in overseas skilled workers unless there is clear evidence of a genuine labour market need, as determined by the immigration department. Labor and the unions have also pointed to chapter 10 of the free trade agreement relating to temporary entry for business visitors, managers, specialists, and people who install and service machinery and equipment. The document says \u201cneither party shall \u2026 require labour market testing, economic needs testing or other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry\u201d. Unions have also slammed Robb\u2019s commitment to \u201cstreamline\u201d skills assessment processes for Chinese applicants for 457 visas. In a letter the minister said Australia would \u201cremove the requirement for mandatory skills assessment\u201d for electricians, joiners, carpenters and several other occupations. Robb has defended the move, saying people would still have to show they were \u201cverified with organisations that our own trade skills organisations acknowledge\u201d. Two parliamentary committees are conducting inquiries into the free trade agreement.",

The document says \u201cneither party shall \u2026 require labour market testing, economic needs testing or other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry\u201d.</p> <p>Unions have also slammed <a href=\"http://dfat.gov.au/trade/agreements/chafta/official-documents/Documents/chafta-side-letter-on-skills-assessment-and-licensing.pdf\">Robb\u2019s commitment to \u201cstreamline\u201d skills assessment processes</a> for Chinese applicants for 457 visas. In a letter the minister said Australia would \u201cremove the requirement for mandatory skills assessment\u201d for electricians, joiners, carpenters and several other occupations.</p> <p>Robb has defended the move, saying people would still have to show they were \u201cverified with organisations that our own trade skills organisations acknowledge\u201d.</p> <p>Two parliamentary committees are conducting inquiries into the free trade agreement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week the Chinese stock market has plunged more than 17% in three days. While its value still remains higher than it was a year ago, the fall in value is a reflection that China\u2019s economy is undergoing a tough transition, with lower economic growth. For Australia, the plunging Chinese stock market will have little direct impact, but the slumping economy will. In July I wrote of the falling Chinese stock market and the attempts by the Chinese government to arrest the decline. As generally happens with such things, the day after writing of the gloom, the main China stock market in Shanghai recorded a 4.5% jump, and was followed the day after by another 2.4% rise. Indeed, by 23 July the Shanghai Composite index had risen 11% from the 3,709 points it was on the day I wrote of the gloom to 4,123. It would be nice if the end of the story was: commentator gets his face covered in egg, everyone breathes a sigh of relief, goes back to waiting for commentator to once again get egg on his face. Alas, since 23 July the Shanghai index has fallen 29% and now sits (as of close on Wednesday) at 2,927. The near 23% fall in the index over the past seven days is the biggest weekly fall since 1996, and dwarfs the 12.8% weekly fall that occurred in July. And as often happens, the rest of the world\u2019s stock exchanges followed. The London stock exchange fell 7.4% in two days before slightly recovering, the Dow Jones index in New York fell 9.7% on four days, before recovering 4% today. Here in Australia, the All Ordinaries index fell 4% on Monday before recovering 2.6% on Tuesday and a further 0.6% on Wednesday. In July, the Chinese authorities tried to stem the bleeding by halting trading on half of the stocks, preventing short-selling (whereby traders buy options on stocks in the future at a lower price than they currently are selling for \u2013 in effect betting their price will fall), and also getting the state-owned wealth fund to start buying shares. This time round the sense is not so much that the market needs to be assisted, as it is the Chinese economy that needs help. Reflecting the concerns of investors around the world that China\u2019s economy is slowing by more than anticipated, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) on Tuesday cut the benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.6%: This was the fourth cut in the past year. The PBoC also lowered the required reserve ratio (RRR) for banks to 18%. This followed a lowering of the RRR in April. The relaxing of the RRR essentially allows Chinese banks to lend more and together with the lowering of the interest rates Beijing hopes to stimulate the economy. It did little to calm investor\u2019s nerves. On Wednesday the Shanghai composite index went on a wild ride. At one point it was down as much as 3.2% before rising 4.2% on the back of intervention by state-owned banks, before finishing the day down 1.3%. Of course we need a bit of context before we get too carried away with our panic. The fall being experienced in China over the past three months is sharper, but not as severe as that which occurred during the GFC. From October 2007 to Jun 2008, the Shanghai index lost 54% of its value: But the difference back in 2007 was that the Chinese economy grew by 14%, and even in 2008 with the GFC it still grew by 9.6%. Currently the IMF expects China\u2019s GDP to grow by 6.8% this year and just 6.3% in 2016. Certainly there is the sense that what is happening in the Chinese stock exchange is a \u201ccorrection\u201d \u2013 which is a fancy and hopefully not too scary way of saying that the market was massively overvalued. Despite the recent large fall, the Shanghai index remains 32% above where it was 12 months ago. But that massive growth occurred during a period when Chinese growth was being downgraded. It was growth that didn\u2019t match at all what was happening in the Chinese economy. In mid-to-late 2014, Chinese real estate prices slumped. They have begun to recover somewhat, but the recovery is pretty spotty. The latest figures released yesterday show the prices of newly constructed commercial residential buildings declined in 29 of the 70 major cities and increased in 31: Such news had Joe Hockey yesterday morning trying to suggest things were OK. He told ABC Breakfast \u201cthe fundamentals in China are gradually improving ... for example, the Chinese property market is showing signs of recovery\u201d. He also suggested the moves by the PBoC to cut interest rates and relax the RRR was \u201canother positive step to help the Chinese economy\u201d. Of course the Chinese government is only doing such things because it is worried that the \u201cfundamentals\u201d are not actually \u201cgradually improving\u201d. One other way to get some context for the fall in the Chinese stock market is to compare its performance over the past six-and-a-half years with that of the US and Australian stock markets. Since February 2009, which was when the stock market around the world bottomed out during the GFC, the Dow Jones index in America has risen 121% (prior to the recent fall it was up 150%). The Australian stock exchange\u2019s All Ordinaries index, by contrast, is just up 56% in that period. But when we look at the Shanghai index, the boom of the past 12 months becomes very clear: In June last year, the Shanghai Composite index was virtually the same as it was in February 2009. Within a year it would rise 122%. Now it sits at just 40% above where is was at the bottom of the GFC \u2013 a performance even worse than Australia\u2019s market. Clearly, unless something magical in China\u2019s economy had happened in the past 12 months, there was no solid reason for such a boom. Unlike in 2007 when the Chinese stock market boomed (and then bust with the GFC), economic growth was strong. This latest boom came via margin lending from investors seeking returns that were no longer coming elsewhere \u2013 especially the real estate market. It had unsustainable written all over it because there was no real economic reason for such an optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy. The IMF\u2019s latest report on China is headlined: \u201cChina\u2019s transition to slower but better growth\u201d. \u201cBetter\u201d is a rather nice positive spin, but any time you hear talk of \u201cslower growth\u201d you would not assume to see that nation\u2019s stock market going wild. Of course there is not always a link between economic performance and the stock market. The Dow Jones index might be massively outperforming Australia\u2019s stock market, but since the start of 2009, Australia\u2019s economy has easily outperformed that of the USA: But as for China, the outlook, regardless of the performance of the stock market, is for lower growth than we have been used to (and have taken advantage of). The minister for trade, Andrew Robb tried to put some very optimistic spin on the falling Chinese stock market by suggesting Chinese investors may look to Australia as a safe haven. Robb said he expects the falling stock market \u201cwill accelerate the level of investment inquiries coming into Australia across all sorts of areas of activity\u201d. But this is unlikely and certainly not something being anticipated on the foreign exchange market. The value of the Australian dollar has fallen over 7% on the past two months, to a six-year low of $US0.718. That doesn\u2019t happen when investors are clamouring to get into the Australian market. The reality is China\u2019s stock market has fallen because growth in the overall Chinese economy is falling and a stock market and an economy can only stay disparate for so long. The impact of the Chinese stock market on Australia will not be great \u2013 aside from impacts on our stock market \u2013 but the slowing Chinese economy, and the demand for goods and services from Australia will continue to drag on our own economic growth.",
