      "bodyText": "Earmarking more than \u00a340bn for a new railway would be controversial even in boom times. But it really takes some selling when public services are being cut and real incomes are falling. Building HS2 will cost every adult in the UK the equivalent of \u00a31,000 on current estimates: a tidy sum when a pay rise is a distant memory. Inevitably, then, HS2 is a hot political potato and will remain so up to the next election and beyond. The hybrid bill being presented to parliament on Monday authorises the line but by no means guarantees that it will go ahead. David Cameron has made vague threats of pulling the plug if the cost continues to escalate. A likelier risk is that Labour decides it can find a better use for the money, as it may well. Ed Balls has made it clear that he will not write a blank cheque for HS2 \u2013 a stance that angers Labour-run councils in the Midlands and the north, who see a new high-speed line as the fast track to economic regeneration. Balls should resist the pressure. The shadow chancellor's credo is that taking economic decisions for political reasons is asking for trouble. If the economics are rock-solid, the politics will come right. If the economics suck then the politics will eventually suck too. The economics of HS2 suck. Traditionally, public money is allocated using cost-benefit analysis. Whitehall estimates the costs of a project and tries to put a monetary value on the benefits. On this basis, HS2 doesn't wash its face. The cost is high and the benefits, in many cases, are spurious. Supporters of HS2 say that cost-benefit analysis is too narrow a way of looking at the project because it does not capture the need to build more capacity on the rail network. HS2 will help cope with the threat of overcrowding. But so too would alternative solutions, including upgrading existing lines. Economists use a concept called \"opportunity cost\" in these circumstances. This takes into account alternative uses of the \u00a340bn-plus cost of HS2 to see whether it could be better spent. Let's take as an example a project known as GB Freight Route, put forward by the Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins. This idea suggests building a new dedicated freight route with a European loading gauge (the size for railway wagons and loads to ensure safe passage through tunnels) on lines either under-used or shut down after the Beeching report. Hopkins's plan has much going for it. Firstly, by using the gauge found on the continent it would make Britain part of a growing European freight network in which trains can carry lorry-sized trailers. Freight would be taken off the roads, easing congestion and cutting pollution. Capacity would be freed up on existing railways. Secondly, the GB Freight Route would require only 14 miles of new track to be built, and of these nine miles would be in a tunnel and five across rural land. There would be much less of an impact on homes and communities than from HS2. Thirdly, the proposal is to take the dedicated freight line to parts of Britain not touched by HS2, such as Scotland and the north-east. Fourthly, it would be much cheaper than HS2 even if the cost estimate of \u00a36bn proves to be as optimistic as the early projections for the high-speed line. Finally, there seems to be some interest from supermarkets and haulage companies, which means that some of the cost could be shouldered by the private sector. It may be that after considering all the alternatives, HS2 remains the best option. But that means giving rival ideas a fair hearing. In the case of HS2, that does not appear to have been the case. Supporters of HS2 say it is the only game in town. They fear the Treasury will only pay for a high-profile prestige project and that the alternative is not a host of smaller schemes that might offer better value for money but that the \u00a340bn stays with the exchequer. Yes, it's said, HS2 will cost a lot of money. Yes, the project doesn't score well using conventional cost-benefit analysis. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore economic vibrancy to parts of the country that badly need it. There is a need for the UK economy to be less dominated by London but HS2, in its current form at least, looks like an expensive way of making regional imbalances worse not better. Paul Krugman, one of those who pioneered New Economic Geography, has shown that better transport links between rich and poor regions tend to exacerbate regional disparities. The reason is that big, efficient businesses in the capital have easier and cheaper access to markets elsewhere in the country and drive out local competition. A study by the Centre for Cities notes that South Korea built a high-speed line from Seoul to Busan with the aim of rebalancing economy that, like the UK, is highly centralised. This has not been achieved. The case of Lille in Nnorthern France provides a bit more encouragement for supporters of HS2. According to the Centre for Cities report, the arrival of high-speed rail in 1993 played a \"significant role in facilitating a structural transformation in a declining industrial city and its hinterland\". There is a rider, however. Lille's revival was not caused by high-speed rail alone. It was combined with \"extensive regeneration investment and improvements to local networks, which were supposed to spread the benefits of high-speed rail across the region.\" One or two secondary centres in northern France did benefit but areas away from the line continued to experience below-average jobs growth. So, the likely upshot of HS2 is that London will benefit most, the big regional hubs such as Birmingham and Leeds will get some benefit, but cities bypassed by the line will lose out. It's worth noting, also, that the money saved from scrapping HS2 would find its way into the economy one way or another: handing each adult a cheque for \u00a31,000 would almost certainly provide a bigger boost to economic activity in, say, Rochdale than a new high-speed railway that ends in Manchester. Centre for Cities notes that the gains from HS2 would increase if the new line could be integrated into local networks, if the HS2 stations were planned for city centres not the edge of town, if fares were kept cheap so services were attractive to attracted consumers (something that has not happened with HS1 in Kent where commuters would rather have a slow journey into work than pay expensive ticket prices) and if the new line was part of a co-ordinated regeneration strategy. This is all true but it does not look remotely possible. HS2 is a gravy train for the construction sector, lawyers, transport consultants, bureaucrats and the rich people who will be able to afford it. It will be the misery line for just about everybody else.",

      "bodyText": "Funding Circle has lent almost all the \u00a320m provided by the government in March to small businesses and is in talks to secure a bigger injection. The online peer-to-peer lender has lent \u00a315.3m to 1,438 businesses on the government's behalf and has re-lent \u00a32.3m of repayments, taking the total to \u00a317.6m. James Meekings, one of Funding Circle's founders, said he expected to go through the rest of that funding by January. The lender has applied to the state-backed British Business Bank and hopes to get a bigger investment when the current money runs out. Meekings said: \"We have lent out the money quickly and we are eager to get some more. We have lent money to a wide range of companies and we are very confident we are going to be able to continue to do that next year as well and we are in discussions about how that will work.\" Vince Cable, the business secretary, ordered that \u00a355m of government money should be lent through Funding Circle and other social lenders to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) starved of lending by the banks.

      "standfirst": "The former Co-op Bank chairman has left a wide range of organisations facing inquiries about their role in his rise and fall", 
      "body": "<p>The Paul Flowers scandal has given many of Britain's top institutions reason to feel queasy. The former Co-op Bank chairman spent 30 years building contacts in the worlds of politics, business, the church and charities. Now his alleged wrongdoing is coming back to haunt those caught up in his network. They all have questions to answer:</p> <h2><strong>Co-operative Group</strong></h2> <p>Flowers became chairman of the Co-op Bank in 2010. He was chairman when it was nearly destroyed this year by a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances caused by bad debts after its takeover of Britannia building society. The group, founded by idealistic workers in Rochdale in 1844, now appears ill-equipped to control senior bosses.</p> <h2><strong>Labour</strong></h2> <p>Flowers is a longtime party member and had established links with the leadership. He attended party functions, met Ed Miliband and was also on his business advisory group. The Co-op group donated \u00a350,000 to the office of shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Flowers told the Treasury select committee that Balls supported the Britannia merger but Balls has said he has never met Flowers formally. Labour suspended Flowers when the drugs allegations emerged.</p> <h2><strong>Conservatives</strong></h2> <p>Chancellor George Osborne supported the Co-op's aborted bid for 631 Lloyds branches and is said to have lobbied Brussels to relax capital rules on the bank. Former City minister Mark Hoban held some 30 meetings to help push the deal through.</p> <h2><strong>City regulator</strong><br></h2> <p>The now defunct Financial Services Authority waved Flowers through as Co-op Bank chairman, but only on the condition that he had two more financially literate deputies alongside him. Flowers' appointment raises questions about how he was approved when the FSA was supposedly clamping down on who was \"fit and proper\" to run a bank.</p> <p>It had already had to deal with the wreckage at three banks \u2013 Northern Rock, HBos and RBS \u2013 chaired by people with no banking expertise. The FSA wrote to the Co-op in December 2011 voicing concerns about its finances but allowed talks with Lloyds to continue in to 2013.</p> <h2><strong>Methodist church </strong><br></h2> <p>Flowers became a Methodist minister in 1976. The Rev Gareth Powell, assistant secretary of the Methodist Conference, told the BBC people in the church had commented on Flowers' behaviour in the past and the affair \"raises questions of the church as to how trustworthy it is\". The church suspended Flowers when his alleged drug consumption was revealed and the Methodist Church Purposes charity has suspended him.</p> <h2><strong>Charities</strong></h2> <p>Flowers quit as chairman of the trustees of the Lifeline Project drugs charity in 2004 after lodging up to \u00a370,000 of suspicious expense claims. Lifeline informed the Charity Commission about its concerns, but he was allowed to join other charities because the commission said it received no evidence he acted in bad faith. Flowers stepped down as a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust last week. He was not entitled to expenses at the sexual health and HIV charity, but revelations of Flowers' use of rent boys do not sit well with its emphasis on sexual wellbeing.</p> <h2><strong>Bradford city council</strong><br></h2> <p>Flowers was a Bradford councillor for nine years. He quit two years ago citing the pressures of being Co-op Bank chairman. The Labour-controlled council revealed last week that Flowers left after \"inappropriate\" \u2013 but not illegal \u2013 adult content was found on his computer.</p> <p>Amid opposition calls for an inquiry into the incident, current Bradford Labour leader David Green has said there are \"legitimate questions\" to be answered.</p> <h2><strong>Inquiries now under way</strong></h2> <p>\u25a0 The Co-op commissioned the Kelly review of its financial woes in July and it is due to report in May 2014.</p> <p>\u25a0 After the Flowers allegations emerged, the Co-op announced a separate \"root and branch\" probe of its governance.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Treasury has ordered an independent inquiry into the Co-op Bank dating back at least to 2008.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, which took over the FSA's powers this year, are each considering separate inquiries into the bank's affairs.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Treasury select committee is looking into Lloyds's botched attempt to sell a batch of branches, which collapsed when the Co-op pulled out.</p> <p>\u25a0 The police are investigating Flowers in connection with the supply of drugs and have bailed the 63-year-old.</p> <p>\u25a0 The Financial Reporting Council accounting watchdog is examining the Co-op's financial reports and could mount a formal probe.</p>",

Labour Flowers is a longtime party member and had established links with the leadership. He attended party functions, met Ed Miliband and was also on his business advisory group. The Co-op group donated \u00a350,000 to the office of shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Flowers told the Treasury select committee that Balls supported the Britannia merger but Balls has said he has never met Flowers formally. Labour suspended Flowers when the drugs allegations emerged. Conservatives Chancellor George Osborne supported the Co-op's aborted bid for 631 Lloyds branches and is said to have lobbied Brussels to relax capital rules on the bank. Former City minister Mark Hoban held some 30 meetings to help push the deal through. City regulator The now defunct Financial Services Authority waved Flowers through as Co-op Bank chairman, but only on the condition that he had two more financially literate deputies alongside him. Flowers' appointment raises questions about how he was approved when the FSA was supposedly clamping down on who was \"fit and proper\" to run a bank. It had already had to deal with the wreckage at three banks \u2013 Northern Rock, HBos and RBS \u2013 chaired by people with no banking expertise. The FSA wrote to the Co-op in December 2011 voicing concerns about its finances but allowed talks with Lloyds to continue in to 2013. Methodist church Flowers became a Methodist minister in 1976. The Rev Gareth Powell, assistant secretary of the Methodist Conference, told the BBC people in the church had commented on Flowers' behaviour in the past and the affair \"raises questions of the church as to how trustworthy it is\". The church suspended Flowers when his alleged drug consumption was revealed and the Methodist Church Purposes charity has suspended him. Charities Flowers quit as chairman of the trustees of the Lifeline Project drugs charity in 2004 after lodging up to \u00a370,000 of suspicious expense claims. Lifeline informed the Charity Commission about its concerns, but he was allowed to join other charities because the commission said it received no evidence he acted in bad faith. Flowers stepped down as a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust last week. He was not entitled to expenses at the sexual health and HIV charity, but revelations of Flowers' use of rent boys do not sit well with its emphasis on sexual wellbeing. Bradford city council Flowers was a Bradford councillor for nine years. He quit two years ago citing the pressures of being Co-op Bank chairman. The Labour-controlled council revealed last week that Flowers left after \"inappropriate\" \u2013 but not illegal \u2013 adult content was found on his computer. Amid opposition calls for an inquiry into the incident, current Bradford Labour leader David Green has said there are \"legitimate questions\" to be answered. Inquiries now under way \u25a0 The Co-op commissioned the Kelly review of its financial woes in July and it is due to report in May 2014. \u25a0 After the Flowers allegations emerged, the Co-op announced a separate \"root and branch\" probe of its governance. \u25a0 The Treasury has ordered an independent inquiry into the Co-op Bank dating back at least to 2008. \u25a0 The Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, which took over the FSA's powers this year, are each considering separate inquiries into the bank's affairs. \u25a0 The Treasury select committee is looking into Lloyds's botched attempt to sell a batch of branches, which collapsed when the Co-op pulled out. \u25a0 The police are investigating Flowers in connection with the supply of drugs and have bailed the 63-year-old. \u25a0 The Financial Reporting Council accounting watchdog is examining the Co-op's financial reports and could mount a formal probe.",

    "webTitle": "Unthinkable? Five radical ways to stop the economic slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic are once again being forced to think the unthinkable. More than five years into the global financial crisis, and with a sustained recovery still elusive, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are both contemplating the drastic step of imposing a negative deposit rate on banks' reserves. The fact that policymakers are even considering forcing banks to lend by effectively charging them for parking money at the central bank is an indication of how desperate the economic backdrop has become. Their motives for considering a negative deposit rate are different. The Fed believes it would moderate the impact of \"tapering\", as its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme is wound down; while at the ECB, it is seen more as a way of trying to ensure that credit finds its way to businesses. But in both the US and Europe, there is growing concern about a new buzz-phrase: \"secular stagnation\". With growth recovering relatively slowly and inflation low in both the eurozone and the US, one alarming theory, advanced by former White House adviser Larry Summers in a recent speech, is that developed economies today are only able to achieve reasonable levels of growth by inflating monstrous bubbles, like those seen in the runup to the 2008 crisis (and, some at least would argue, the housing bubble now beginning to inflate in the UK). For whatever reason \u2013 overcapacity, demographic challenges, downtrodden workers unable to bargain themselves a pay rise \u2013 firms remain reluctant to invest, and households to spend, even with interest rates at close to zero. But for the key base rate \u2013 which governs the price of borrowing across the economy \u2013 zero is as low as it goes. If Summers turns out to be right, policymakers may find themselves considering ever more unthinkable options to try and coax their moribund economies back to life over the coming years. Here are a few options: 1 QE WITH KNOBS ON Quantitative easing has been practised on a large scale in the US and UK, though it remains all but unthinkable in the eurozone, where Germany is firmly opposed. \"The ECB would have real problems putting that into effect, because the Germans would walk out,\" says Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting. Some economists argue that eventually, there will have to be another large-scale dose, with newly generated cash this time being invested instead of being used to buy up government bonds, or, as in the US, mortgage-backed securities. Ann Pettifor, director of the thinktank Policy Research in Macroeconomics (Prime), says she would like to see central banks directly financing infrastructure schemes or green projects such as insulating homes \u2013 perhaps in the process creating bonds to enable the public to take a stake, too, providing an alternative and more productive home for their savings than the boom-bust property market. \"It's about fiscal and monetary policy working together,\" she says. 2 HELICOPTER MONEY As well as the rather appealing option of dropping bales of cash to be spent by anyone picking them up, this phrase can also refer to central banks printing money to go into government coffers, but with no expectation of getting it back. Otherwise known as \"overt monetary finance\", is taboo to orthodox economists, because of the perceived risk of hyperinflation. Even appearing to moot it in his final Mansion House speech in 2012 may well have cost Lord Adair Turner the governorship of the Bank of England. The newly minted money goes to bankroll government deficits, allowing treasuries to chuck austerity out of the window and go for growth. 3 BOOSTING BUSINESS When the US economist Adam Posen was on the Bank's monetary policy committee, he called for it to \"do more\", including backing a new institution that he nicknamed \"Bennie\" (the British Enterprise Investment Entity), to bundle up and sell small business loans so that they could be taken off the books of banks and funnelled to investors, helping to unblock the financial system. Duncan Weldon, senior policy officer at the TUC, says the current Funding for Lending Scheme, which relies on the banks to pass cheap funding from the Bank of England on to borrowers, has had a \"scattergun\" effect, with much of the impact being seen in increased unsecured lending to consumers rather than business loans. Posen also called for a taxpayer-backed small business bank, to offer loans to firms turned down by mainstream lenders. 4 DEBT WRITE-OFFS Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, the US economists whose findings on the risks of high levels of government debt are hotly contested, have suggested in a new paper that developed countries may eventually have to resort to the measures used by their emerging-market counterparts to escape their own debt crises in recent years. That includes debt restructuring: forcing creditors to accept that they won't get back every penny they've lent. Pettifor says: \"That's what bankruptcy law is for. You've got to say: you're not solvent, let's start again\". 5 FINANCIAL REPRESSION This is in a sense a less overt method of debt restructuring \u2013 and another approach Reinhart and Rogoff suggested might eventually become necessary in rich economies. By measures such as keeping interest rates rock bottom, and obliging banks and pension funds to hold large chunks of (low-yielding) government bonds, policymakers make it cheaper for the government to continue borrowing \u2013 at the expense of hard-done-by savers. Hardly unthinkable: it's a pattern already recognisable in both the US and the UK.",

The investigation has also found that company executives lobbied politicians and police chiefs to ramp up the police presence and that the company provided resources and intelligence to the police. The research has also shed light on the political and financial pressures that the company was facing at the time.</p> <p>Rehad Desai, spokesman for the <a href=\"http://marikana.info\" title=\"\">Marikana Support Campaign</a>, said: \"It all starts adding up to a very poisonous picture which undermines the very fabric of South African democracy. If true, this is an outrageous collusion that adds up to a huge injustice.\"</p> <p>Lonmin grew out of mining firm Lonrho, the company that owned the <em>Observer</em> from 1981-93. In 1999, Lonrho was renamed Lonmin. Earlier this month the company announced its end-of-year results, recording a profit and increased production for 2013.</p> <p>The company came to international attention last year when the week-long strike came to its bloody climax. There is no suggestion that either the police or Lonmin officials intended for shots to be fired that day. However, evidence now shows that on 14 August, just two days before the massacre, there was a joint agreement between the company's management and police that the strike should be broken in a decisive manner.</p> <p>The details of this meeting have only just surfaced. A transcript submitted to the commission shows provincial police chief Zukiswa Mbombo in discussions with three Lonmin employees, including head of security Graham Sinclair and executive vice president for human capital Barnard&#xa0;Mokwena.</p> <p>In the meeting, the group discuss the political and industry pressures influencing the situation. The group also discuss a similar strike that had happened at another South African-based mine, Impala Platinum, six months earlier. There the strike resulted in the company giving in to workers' demands for a wage increase, and the establishment of a new union at the mine, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).</p> <p>Lonmin's chief executive at the time, Ian Farmer, attended a presentation by Impala in which they discussed what had happened. Farmer told the <em>Observer</em> that Impala's agreement to a wage increase \"rippled through the rest of the industry and \"created an expectation\".</p> <p>In the meeting on 14 August, Mbombo notes that Lonmin should learn lessons from Impala, and take care to not look sympathetic to the AMCU rather than the established union, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) \u2013 which was an ally of the African National Congress.</p> <p>The group also recall that political points were scored at the Impala strike by outspoken politician Julius Malema, who was pushing for nationalisation of the mines. The transcript records Mbombo noting that what they do at the Lonmin mine \"has a serious political connotation that we need to take into account \u2026 we need to act such that we kill this thing\". Lonmin's Mokwena agrees: \"Immediately, yes.\"</p> <p>At the meeting a plan is formulated that Lonmin will issue an ultimatum to the miners to return to work or be fired, and if that does not work the police will move in to break up the&#xa0;strike.</p> <p>If they do not surrender their weapons, \"then it is blood\", says Mbombo. She adds: \"Emotions are very&#xa0;high \u2026 I do not want a situation where 20 people will be dead. This is not what we are here for: what we are here for is to maintain peace and make sure there is peace between us, the people and the company.\"</p> <p>Mokwena agrees and tells her: \"The two plans go together\".</p> <p>Later, Mokwena compliments the police chief on the force's resources, saying: \"I must tell you, the ones that impress me [are] these snipers.\"</p> <p>Mbombo then assures Lonmin's head of security, Sinclair, that she can provide him with a water cannon.</p> <p>There had already been a number of violent incidents at the mine in which strikers, police and security personnel had been killed. On the morning of 16 August, ambulances were put on standby by Lonmin and attempts were made by the police to order mortuary&#xa0;vans.</p> <p>The police waited until the miners had amassed at the rocky hillside that had become their base before rolling out razor wire and opening fire. Evidence shows the water cannons were used just seven seconds before live ammunition was fired.</p> <p>The meeting on 14 August arose after a concerted effort by Lonmin to get the police interaction that they wanted.</p> <p>Acts of intimidation and violence had been bubbling up even before an official strike was called and emails, telephone calls and a letter between top Lonmin executives show the company lobbying politicians and police chiefs to increase police pressure. Three days before the massacre, Albert Jamieson, the chief commercial officer of Lonmin, wrote to the minister for mineral resources, Susan Shabangu, and asked her to act more decisively and to \"bring the full might of the state to bear on the&#xa0;situation\".</p> <p>In the letter, Jamieson also reminds the minister of the importance of Lonmin to the South African economy, and the pressures on the mining industry, writing: \"I have spoken to the CEOs of Implats and Anglo [two other platinum mines] and we are all concerned about the prognosis for [platinum] miners in the [North West] province and the consequences for the industry, province and the country if the various organs of the states are unable to bring these repeat situations under control.\"</p> <p>The mining sector is important to the South African economy. In 2012 it brought in $21bn, or 5.5% of GDP and 38% of all South African exports.</p> <p>The day before the massacre, Cyril Ramaphosa, an ANC stalwart and at the time a non-executive director of Lonmin, called Shabangu. In an email he told his Lonmin colleagues what he said. \"I called her and told her that silence and inaction about what is happening at Lonmin was bad for her and the government.\"</p> <p>The message got through. Ramaphosa later noted that Shabangu \"is going into cabinet and will brief the president as well and get the minister of police Nathi Mthethwa to act in a more pointed way\". In a statement to the commission of inquiry dated 30 May 2013, Ramaphosa said his engagement with government officials served to inform them of the gravity of the situation in Marikana.</p> <p>\"Lonmin management took the view that this was not simply an industrial dispute and that Lonmin needs the [police] to restore and maintain law and order and prevent further loss of life,\" he said. \"Lonmin was anxious that government be informed of the seriousness of the situation.\"</p> <p>Ramaphosa has since left Lonmin and become deputy president of the ANC. Political analyst Adam Habib points to the importance of his role in the affair. \"Cyril Ramaphosa's emails don't demonstrate he's responsible for the massacre but they do suggest Lonmin had used his office to get access to ministers and security officials in a way that would not otherwise have been possible,\" he said.</p> <p>Between the sending of Jamieson's letter on 13 August and the follow-up emails and lobbying two days later, the number of police on the Marikana site more than tripled.</p> <p>Reports of violence and intimidation had been coming in to Lonmin security in the weeks before the massacre. In the week leading up to it, two police officers and two security guards were killed. Six miners were also killed, four of them shot by the police.</p> <p>In public statements, Lonmin announced it had handed control and responsibility over to the police. On the day of the massacre, the chairman of Lonmin sent out a statement saying: \"The South African Police Service have been in charge of public order and safety on the ground\".</p> <p>However, Lonmin had more than 500 contracted security officials working for them. Police officer Charl Annandale told the Farlam commission \u2013 the inquiry set up to investigate the massacre \u2013 that during the strike, the police \"relied on their [Lonmin] feedback \u2026 they had literally hundreds of security officers spread over their site that gave us valuable feedback\".</p> <p>In earlier days, informants among the striking miners had fed back information to Sinclair, the company's head of security, according to security officers' written statements to the commission.</p> <p>Lonmin supplied CCTV, helicopters, jail cells and ambulances to the police operation. Lonmin staff also had access to police radios and logged information received on them. A photograph from the police command centre at the mine centre shows a plan for 16 August detailing the deployment of Lonmin security agents. The plan also notes the staff's arsenal, which includes 9mm pistols, LM5 assault rifles and shotguns.</p> <p>The Farlam commission has heard from several parties arguing that they called on Lonmin to negotiate with their employees, including the head of the South African police, Riah Phiyega, and the bishop of Pretoria, Johannes&#xa0;Seoka.</p> <p>However, the situation was complicated. Infighting between rival unions has proved a serious issue in the mining sector, and growing disillusionment with the NUM led to one of Lonmin's mineshafts, Karee, being left ununionised from mid-2011. It was in this vacuum that, in the month before the massacre, the company had negotiated directly with striking miners at Karee and agreed to an increase in allowances.</p> <p>An internal memorandum from Lonmin officials shows that in July the company knew it was paying its rock drill operators less than other companies. The decision then to engage with workers directly, rather than through the unions, was approved by the executive committee.</p> <p>Farmer, Lonmin's former chief executive, explained the effort to avoid any trouble, calling it \"an attempt to pour oil on troubled water\", but conceded it might have sent mixed messages to the&#xa0;workers.</p> <p>When, in August, the miners attempted to talk directly to management again, the company's attitude had changed, with executives stating they would only negotiate through the official channels: the then-discredited NUM.</p> <p>Five days before the massacre, the workers marched, armed only with placards and a few sticks, to the NUM offices. Statements from NUM leaders allege that Lonmin security warned the union leaders there that the miners intended them harm. NUM officials opened fire on the unarmed miners, wounding two and effectively breaking off relations for good.</p> <p>Some attempts were made by Lonmin to open communications with the leader of the AMCU, Joseph Mathunjwa. The night before the massacre, he was sent by Lonmin and the police to talk to the miners and was told by the miners to return the next day to continue talks. However, the following morning, Lonmin cut off all contact through Mathunjwa.</p> <p>As well as the political and industry-wide pressures, Lonmin was facing significant financial pressure in the months before the massacre. Mid-year financial reports, produced a month before the incident, show that Lonmin's&#xa0;first-half profits had decreased nearly 90% compared to the same period the year before. Production and platinum prices were down, while the company's net debt had increased by 20% since the year before.</p> <p>To compound the pressures, Lonmin's bank loan covenants were due to be tested in September. Passing that review relied on the company hitting certain profit margins.</p> <p>\"Revenue at the time was not generating the sufficient margin for us to be generating the cash needed, there was a risk that covenants could be breached. Of course when we had the strike for that protracted period of time, that pushed it over the tipping point,\" Farmer.</p> <p>When asked if the financial pressures could have affected the way the strike was dealt with, the former chief executive said: \"In any situation the financial considerations for the company are first and foremost, it's always a balancing act. Get everyone back and working as quick as possible: not only for financial reasons but also you need peace and harmony in the workforce.\"</p> <p>When 3,000 Lonmin workers downed tools and went on strike it effectively brought the entire plant to a standstill, and the bank covenants were eventually breached.</p> <p>Although he was ill at the time and therefore not present while the strike was going on, Farmer defends the actions of his former colleagues. \"It would be normal for the police to call on the company and ask them to explain as a company what they think is happening \u2026 but they would not have sat there and agreed a plan of action for the day with them, because we don't have that expertise. We're a mining company, we're not riot-control specialists,\" he said.</p> <p>However, Andile Mngxitama, spokesman for Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters party, claimed: \"The relationship between Lonmin and the [ANC] determined every action that happened in the buildup to the massacre. It confirms an unhealthy relationship between the mining companies and the state.\"</p> <p>Lonmin declined to comment on the allegations, stating that it has undertaken not to comment publicly on issues under investigation before it has given evidence and representations to the Farlam commission.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \"The company believes that this is vital to ensure the integrity of the inquiry, and to avoid pre-empting its processes or subsequent findings.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Read more on the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, at tbij.com</em></a></p>",

Evidence shows the water cannons were used just seven seconds before live ammunition was fired. The meeting on 14 August arose after a concerted effort by Lonmin to get the police interaction that they wanted. Acts of intimidation and violence had been bubbling up even before an official strike was called and emails, telephone calls and a letter between top Lonmin executives show the company lobbying politicians and police chiefs to increase police pressure. Three days before the massacre, Albert Jamieson, the chief commercial officer of Lonmin, wrote to the minister for mineral resources, Susan Shabangu, and asked her to act more decisively and to \"bring the full might of the state to bear on the situation\". In the letter, Jamieson also reminds the minister of the importance of Lonmin to the South African economy, and the pressures on the mining industry, writing: \"I have spoken to the CEOs of Implats and Anglo [two other platinum mines] and we are all concerned about the prognosis for [platinum] miners in the [North West] province and the consequences for the industry, province and the country if the various organs of the states are unable to bring these repeat situations under control.\" The mining sector is important to the South African economy. In 2012 it brought in $21bn, or 5.5% of GDP and 38% of all South African exports. The day before the massacre, Cyril Ramaphosa, an ANC stalwart and at the time a non-executive director of Lonmin, called Shabangu. In an email he told his Lonmin colleagues what he said. \"I called her and told her that silence and inaction about what is happening at Lonmin was bad for her and the government.\" The message got through. Ramaphosa later noted that Shabangu \"is going into cabinet and will brief the president as well and get the minister of police Nathi Mthethwa to act in a more pointed way\". In a statement to the commission of inquiry dated 30 May 2013, Ramaphosa said his engagement with government officials served to inform them of the gravity of the situation in Marikana. \"Lonmin management took the view that this was not simply an industrial dispute and that Lonmin needs the [police] to restore and maintain law and order and prevent further loss of life,\" he said. \"Lonmin was anxious that government be informed of the seriousness of the situation.\" Ramaphosa has since left Lonmin and become deputy president of the ANC. Political analyst Adam Habib points to the importance of his role in the affair. \"Cyril Ramaphosa's emails don't demonstrate he's responsible for the massacre but they do suggest Lonmin had used his office to get access to ministers and security officials in a way that would not otherwise have been possible,\" he said. Between the sending of Jamieson's letter on 13 August and the follow-up emails and lobbying two days later, the number of police on the Marikana site more than tripled. Reports of violence and intimidation had been coming in to Lonmin security in the weeks before the massacre. In the week leading up to it, two police officers and two security guards were killed. Six miners were also killed, four of them shot by the police. In public statements, Lonmin announced it had handed control and responsibility over to the police. On the day of the massacre, the chairman of Lonmin sent out a statement saying: \"The South African Police Service have been in charge of public order and safety on the ground\". However, Lonmin had more than 500 contracted security officials working for them. Police officer Charl Annandale told the Farlam commission \u2013 the inquiry set up to investigate the massacre \u2013 that during the strike, the police \"relied on their [Lonmin] feedback \u2026 they had literally hundreds of security officers spread over their site that gave us valuable feedback\". In earlier days, informants among the striking miners had fed back information to Sinclair, the company's head of security, according to security officers' written statements to the commission. Lonmin supplied CCTV, helicopters, jail cells and ambulances to the police operation. Lonmin staff also had access to police radios and logged information received on them. A photograph from the police command centre at the mine centre shows a plan for 16 August detailing the deployment of Lonmin security agents. The plan also notes the staff's arsenal, which includes 9mm pistols, LM5 assault rifles and shotguns. The Farlam commission has heard from several parties arguing that they called on Lonmin to negotiate with their employees, including the head of the South African police, Riah Phiyega, and the bishop of Pretoria, Johannes Seoka. However, the situation was complicated. Infighting between rival unions has proved a serious issue in the mining sector, and growing disillusionment with the NUM led to one of Lonmin's mineshafts, Karee, being left ununionised from mid-2011. It was in this vacuum that, in the month before the massacre, the company had negotiated directly with striking miners at Karee and agreed to an increase in allowances. An internal memorandum from Lonmin officials shows that in July the company knew it was paying its rock drill operators less than other companies. The decision then to engage with workers directly, rather than through the unions, was approved by the executive committee. Farmer, Lonmin's former chief executive, explained the effort to avoid any trouble, calling it \"an attempt to pour oil on troubled water\", but conceded it might have sent mixed messages to the workers. When, in August, the miners attempted to talk directly to management again, the company's attitude had changed, with executives stating they would only negotiate through the official channels: the then-discredited NUM. Five days before the massacre, the workers marched, armed only with placards and a few sticks, to the NUM offices. Statements from NUM leaders allege that Lonmin security warned the union leaders there that the miners intended them harm. NUM officials opened fire on the unarmed miners, wounding two and effectively breaking off relations for good. Some attempts were made by Lonmin to open communications with the leader of the AMCU, Joseph Mathunjwa. The night before the massacre, he was sent by Lonmin and the police to talk to the miners and was told by the miners to return the next day to continue talks. However, the following morning, Lonmin cut off all contact through Mathunjwa. As well as the political and industry-wide pressures, Lonmin was facing significant financial pressure in the months before the massacre. Mid-year financial reports, produced a month before the incident, show that Lonmin's first-half profits had decreased nearly 90% compared to the same period the year before. Production and platinum prices were down, while the company's net debt had increased by 20% since the year before. To compound the pressures, Lonmin's bank loan covenants were due to be tested in September. Passing that review relied on the company hitting certain profit margins. \"Revenue at the time was not generating the sufficient margin for us to be generating the cash needed, there was a risk that covenants could be breached. Of course when we had the strike for that protracted period of time, that pushed it over the tipping point,\" Farmer. When asked if the financial pressures could have affected the way the strike was dealt with, the former chief executive said: \"In any situation the financial considerations for the company are first and foremost, it's always a balancing act. Get everyone back and working as quick as possible: not only for financial reasons but also you need peace and harmony in the workforce.\" When 3,000 Lonmin workers downed tools and went on strike it effectively brought the entire plant to a standstill, and the bank covenants were eventually breached. Although he was ill at the time and therefore not present while the strike was going on, Farmer defends the actions of his former colleagues. \"It would be normal for the police to call on the company and ask them to explain as a company what they think is happening \u2026 but they would not have sat there and agreed a plan of action for the day with them, because we don't have that expertise. We're a mining company, we're not riot-control specialists,\" he said. However, Andile Mngxitama, spokesman for Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters party, claimed: \"The relationship between Lonmin and the [ANC] determined every action that happened in the buildup to the massacre. It confirms an unhealthy relationship between the mining companies and the state.\" Lonmin declined to comment on the allegations, stating that it has undertaken not to comment publicly on issues under investigation before it has given evidence and representations to the Farlam commission. A spokesperson said: \"The company believes that this is vital to ensure the integrity of the inquiry, and to avoid pre-empting its processes or subsequent findings.\" Read more on the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, at tbij.com",
