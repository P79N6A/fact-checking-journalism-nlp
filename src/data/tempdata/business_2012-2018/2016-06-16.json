      "bodyText": "A powerful parliamentary group has called for the National Grid to be stripped of its powers for balancing the energy system in Britain due to a potential conflict of interest. The House of Commons energy and climate change committee is urging the government to transfer control for ensuring all methods are used to keep the lights on to a newly created independent system operator (ISO). The committee report, Low Carbon Network Infrastructure, says the system needs a shake up just days after the Energy Institute complained that continual changes in energy policy were frightening away investment. \u201cThe government should set out its intentions regarding an ISO as soon as possible, and consult on a detailed, staged plan for their implementation, so as to avoid injecting uncertainty into the energy sector,\u201d recommends the report. Angus MacNeil MP, thecommittee chair, said: \u201cNational Grid\u2019s technical expertise in operating the national energy system must be weighed against its potential conflicts of interest. The independent system operator model has worked in the USA. It is time for it to be brought to these shores.\u201d The National Grid, a privately owned company listed on the stock market, owns the main national pipes and pylons in England and Wales but also has stakes in two interconnector power links with the continent with plans to build many more. EDF Energy has been among those companies that have questioned whether the National Grid is conflicted. A spokesperson for the Department of Energysaid: \u201cThere is a strong case for greater independence for the system operator to promote more competition in our electricity system. \u201cWe are working alongside National Grid and Ofgem to see how we can ensure our electricity system is as secure, flexible and independent as possible, whilst operating in the best interest of consumers.\u201d Labour said it supported the report\u2019s findings. \u201cWith the tech-driven transformation of the energy market that is well under way, together with legitimate concerns about conflicts of interest for National Grid, these proposals should be given serious consideration,\u201d said shadow energy minister Alan Whitehead. There is no recommendation in the select committee report about whether any new ISO should be privately owned, non-profit or state sector. Critics have argued that the National Grid is unlikely to fully support demand reduction or other ways of reducing power usage in Britain because it has a commercial interest in seeing more use of its infrastructure. The committee specifically recommends much more electricity storage and demand reduction is deployed at scale as soon as possible and warns these moves are being hampered by out of date regulations. \u201cInnovative solutions like storage and DSR [demand side response] to 21st-century energy problems have been held back by legislative and regulatory inertia,\u201d said MacNeil, who represents the Scottish National party. He accepted the government was already committed to addressing some of these issues but said the committee would hold it to account. \u201c[The energy department] must also learn lessons from these policy lags so as to be better prepared for ongoing changes,\u201d he said. The committee found that small-scale generators faced long and uncertain queues to connect to the National Grid and recommended a review of connection costs. MacNeil said: \u201cThe UK needs clean, renewable power, but it won\u2019t be built if it is too costly or difficult for generators to connect to the electricity grid. Distribution networks have been overwhelmed at times by the challenge of integrating small-scale renewables.\u201d The National Grid fought back against the report\u2019s findings, saying the recent report by Andrew Adonis, from the National Infrastructure Commission, found no sign that the grid had up till now had negatively affected consumers. \u201cOur priority as a system operator will always be balancing the system minute-by-minute and getting the best value for billpayers, which is what the current system provides,\u201d said a National Grid spokesperson. \u201cThe costs and risks of introducing further change to market structures must be proportional to any benefit. There is little evidence that an independent system operator model would provide any benefits that would justify the cost to households, potential disruption to much of the energy sector, and the risks to security of supply such uncertainty could create.\u201d Jonathan Marshall, an energy analyst at the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, believes the committee report has raised important questions. He said: \u201cThe committee is right to suggest that we have a 20th-century grid that isn\u2019t fit for the 21st century. With the national infrastructure commission, EnergyUK and others also calling for a move to a flexible grid, it\u2019s clear that the system desperately needs upgrading. \u201cThe UK electricity grid is currently stuck in a mould that favours old fashioned, centralised power stations that do not allow new technologies to compete fairly. Without swift and efficient upgrades, the system will continue to favour ageing and increasingly unreliable power stations.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce unveils first driverless car complete with silk 'throne'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has unveiled its first driverless vehicle, a concept car that promises to help its owner announce their importance to the world. The Vision Next 100 is an autonomous vehicle aimed at \u201cthe most discerning and powerful patrons in the world\u201d. It has no steering wheel and a silk \u201cthrone\u201d from which its occupants can watch the world go by. Rolls-Royce said the zero-emission model, codenamed 103EX, showed the company \u201crejects the notion of anonymous, utilitarian and bland future modes of mobility\u201d. In a statement that was short on technical specifications but packed with florid description, Rolls-Royce promised an interior made only of \u201cthe most precious and contemporary elegance\u201d. The owner will be \u201cencircled by the most modern handcrafted fine-line Macassar wood panelling\u201d as they gaze at a \u201cgenerous\u201d high-definition television screen. Their comfort will be ensured not by an ordinary car seat, but by a \u201cbeautifully textured, ivory-coloured luxurious throne upon which our passengers are conveyed, and from which they command\u201d. Their feet will be cushioned by \u201cthe finest one-off deep-pile ivory wool carpet\u201d, while anyone worried about leg room will be satisfied thanks to extra space afforded by \u201cthe removal of the chauffeur\u201d. Instead of a driver, passengers can give orders to a virtual assistant named Eleanor \u2013 after the actor Eleanor Thornton, who is rumoured to have inspired the car\u2019s Spirit of Ecstasy bonnet ornament. Eleanor will act as a concierge \u201cimbued with her own artificial intelligence\u201d and capable of reminding the owner not to miss meetings and even bringing the car around to the front of their house at the start of a journey. Rolls-Royce, owned by BMW, said the car proved that \u201ccertain truths are constant over time\u201d, such as the notion that \u201cthe powerful have always understood the symbols through which they express their standing\u201d. \u201cThe very size of the Rolls-Royce Vision Next 100 announces the importance of its precious cargo,\u201d the carmaker explained, pointing to its vast dimensions \u2013 5.9 metres long and 1.6 metres high. The glass roof is a \u201ccanopy over the occupants that provides privacy while allowing them to contemplate the majesty of the stars in the firmament above as they glide through the night\u201d. The space usually reserved for the Rolls\u2019 12-cylinder engine will give way to a luggage compartment that opens automatically on arrival to present two personalised Grand Tourer cases. And if the grandeur of the journey inside a vehicle that gives \u201cthe impression of a futuristic catamaran\u201d was not enough, the car has something special in store on arrival at the passengers\u2019 destination. \u201cAs the Rolls-Royce Vision Next 100 gracefully comes to a halt, something magnificent occurs,\u201d the company said. The glass roof rises to allow the occupant to stand, while a step emerges from below the running board and a red light is projected, \u201ccarpet-like\u201d to announce their arrival. \u201cThus, as in Botticelli\u2019s \u2018Birth of Venus\u2019, our guest is framed and ready to step gracefully into the limelight and greet their audience \u2026 This is automotive haute couture,\u201d the company added. Amid the fanfare accompanying its unveiling, Rolls-Royce did not say how the vehicle, due to hit the streets in the 2040s, would be powered or how it would cope with speed bumps. And despite the grand language, the concept car met with a mixed response, with technology website Slash Gear describing the vehicle as \u201csublimely crazy\u201d. Other car fans were even less sympathetic. A number of companies are working on driverless cars, including Google. Its two-seater looks like a cross between a Smart Car and a Nissan Micra, has no steering wheel, accelerator or brakes, and just two physical controls: \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cgo\u201d. Nissan, Toyota, Audi and the ride-hailing service Uber are among those also working on a self-driving technology. Volvo intends to test them on London roads next year. The Vision Next 100 \u2013 the brainchild of Giles Taylor, Rolls-Royce\u2019s director of design \u2013 was unveiled at the Roundhouse arts venue in north London on Thursday. \u201cIt is an expression of our intrinsic understanding of the possibilities for a true luxury brand and the desires of its customers,\u201d Taylor said.",

Staveley has brought a claim against the bank for her firm PCP Capital Partners for fees she argues she should have received for being involved in the crucial financings in 2008 that helped Barclays raise \u00a37bn. According to Barclays, PCP is claiming damages from a fundraising which took place in October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. Staveley\u2019s firm was an adviser to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who put more than \u00a33bn into the financing. In the defence documents filed in the high court, Barclays said PCP was claiming it was going to be a prospective investor and should have received fees for taking part in the fundraising. \u201cThe claim is fundamentally misconceived. Barclays\u2019 understanding at all material times was that PCP \u2026 was acting on behalf of Sheikh Mansour, not on its own behalf. In any event the representations were not made as alleged, and PCP \u2026 is unable to establish that it suffered any loss as a result of the alleged representations,\u201d Barclays said. The bank also denied it made \u201crepresentations which were false\u201d in relation to possible fees. The fundraisings Barclays embarked upon during the financial crisis have proved controversial. There were two fundraisings \u2013 one in June and in one in October, and PCP\u2019s case is in relation to the second one. They took place when many other banks were raising capital and, by October, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland had been bailed out by taxpayers. In 2013, Barclays admitted that it was contesting a move by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to impose a \u00a350m fine for behaving \u201crecklessly\u201d during the fundraising. The FCA had concluded that more details should have been disclosed about the fees due to Qatar Holdings, which also backed the fundraising, which amounted to \u00a3322m over five years. The Serious Fraud Office is investigating and the FCA\u2019s case on hold. In the documents rebutting the claim by Staveley, Barclays said it had agreed to pay Qatar Holdings fees of \u00a3280m in October 2008 and that it always expected to receive valuable services in return. Barclays states that Staveley owed the bank \u00a3800,000 and significant sums to other creditors at the time of the fundraising and was part of an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) \u2013 an agreement with creditors that is a step away from bankruptcy. In 2008, it was reported this IVA related to a troubled internet venture which had fallen into difficulties a number of years before that. Representatives for Staveley could not immediately be reached. In February, her spokesman confirmed the existence of the claim but declined to put a figure on the total being sought by the financier and her firm.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney\u2019s irritation with Bernard Jenkin is understandable. The governor of the Bank of England has been scrupulous \u2013 painfully so, at times \u2013 to stick to what he is allowed to talk about in the run-up to the referendum. He has confined himself to assessing the impact on monetary and financial stability, which Threadneedle Street is charged with promoting. It would be bizarre if the Bank had nothing to say about the referendum since nobody (surely) would pretend that Brexit would definitely have zero impact on the economy or financial markets, at least in the next couple of years, which is the horizon that most concerns the Bank when setting interest rates. The most contentious part of the Bank\u2019s assessment has been its statement that leaving the EU is the greatest risk to financial stability in the UK and could threaten a recession. To the ears of Brexiters, that will sound alarmist or dramatic \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t. The value of sterling is moving with every opinion poll and a possible sudden, sharp movement in the currency \u2013 even it reverses when investors realise Armageddon hasn\u2019t arrived \u2013 means Threadneedle Street has to make preparations. It would not be doing its job otherwise. Those preparations involve arranging funding operations to ensure banks have cash to cope with any short-term turmoil, even if the fears turn out to be overdone. The Bank can hardly keep those operations quiet, or decline to explain its thinking. In other words, it can\u2019t pretend the referendum isn\u2019t happening. Indeed, Andrew Tyrie \u2013 whose Treasury select committee prodded for referendum-related weaknesses in Carney\u2019s defences \u2013 conceded that a \u201cvow of omert\u00e0\u201d would have resulted in a \u201cbumpy hearing\u201d. Against that backdrop, the timing of the warning from Jenkin, the Vote Leave MP, that Carney should be \u201ccareful what he says\u201d was especially absurd. First, the governor has been careful. Second, Thursday\u2019s minutes of the latest meeting of monetary policy committee expressed the views of the entire nine-member panel. Nor were the eye-catching lines from the minutes especially contentious if one read them as they were intended. Brexit is \u201cpossibly\u201d the biggest risk to global markets? Well, yes, possibly it is. We won\u2019t know unless it happens but the suggestion is reasonable and the nervousness in financial markets is obvious. Even the US Federal Reserve is talking about it. It would be odd if our own central bank had to wear a gag. Spotlight turns on Goldman Sachs in BHS debacle On one point Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell are in agreement: Goldman Sachs was the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d to the disastrous deal in which the Topshop billionaire sold BHS for \u00a31 to the thrice bankrupt former motor racing driver. It is only Goldman Sachs that is shy about saying it held the keys. Here is Anthony Gutman, head of UK investment banking, explaining his involvement to MPs a few weeks ago: it was unpaid and \u201cour role was \u2026 limited to providing preliminary observations on the proposals received, nothing more\u201d. And: \u201cThey [Green\u2019s Arcadia group] did not ask us to make judgments or provide recommendations, and nor could we in light of the very limited access we had and the nature of our role.\u201d Now here\u2019s Green\u2019s response when asked if he would have sold to Chappell if he had not passed Goldman\u2019s \u201csniff\u201d test: \u201cWe 1 million per cent would not have done business with him. If they [Goldman] had said, \u201cdon\u2019t deal with this guy,\u201d that would have been the end of it \u2013 otherwise, there is no point in having somebody \u2013 but that is not the advice that we got.\u201d Green, then, is clear that he was receiving advice from Goldman, whereas the bank thinks it was merely providing \u201cobservations\u201d. This isn\u2019t a matter of verbal niceties. The central player in the drama, Green, is saying Chappell was a credible buyer because Goldman said so, or at least because the bank raised no serious objections. Indeed, Green laid it on thickly at Wednesday\u2019s session before MPs, to the point of reading out Gutman\u2019s congratulatory email to Chappell (\u201cyou deserve it and stuck to your word throughout\u201d) when the deal was done. \u201cThat is hardly someone telling us not to deal with the guy, is it?\u201d said Green \u2013 reasonably, on the face of it. In the circumstances, it was astonishing that Michael Sherwood, co-head of Goldman in London, initially resisted MPs\u2019 invitation to appear in person. The committees, rightly, are insisting that he, Gutman and fellow Goldmanite Michael Casey appear on 28 June. Sherwood is an old chum of Green\u2019s from the attempt to bid for Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004. If he thinks Green has taken outrageous liberties in attaching Goldman\u2019s name to Chappell\u2019s credibility, he should say so. He might tell us if Goldman told Green that if he wanted Chappell vetted thoroughly, he should hire a paid financial adviser with full access to information. Top folk at Goldman tend not to be naive fools. While sniffing around Chappell, they could surely smell the risk to the bank\u2019s reputation.",

One of the first witnesses being called to support the Libyan Investment Authority\u2019s $1.2bn (\u00a3850m) claim against the Wall Street bank, alleges that Youssef Kabbaj had to flee Libya for Malta after a \u201chighly charged\u201d meeting at the fund in April 2008. In his witness statement, Abdulfatah Enaami, who was at the LIA until the end of June 2012, said Kabbaj and a colleague left the country after a meeting when losses on the nine disputed trades at the centre of the trade were discovered. Kabbaj and his closeness to the Libyans is one of the themes being explored by the fund as it attempts to recoup its losses from nine trades it conducted with Goldman Sachs between January and April 2008. Goldman is defending the lawsuit, being heard before Mrs Justice Rose, arguing that it is a case of buyers\u2019 remorse and that Kabbaj was not able to influence decisions by the LIA. Enaami\u2019s witness statement said \u201cYoussef was very afraid for his life\u201d and that cut short a dinner because Kabbaj told him a \u201cforeign intelligence agency\u201d had been called to take him to Malta. At the time of the trades turning sour, \u201cit was beginning to occur to me that Goldman Sachs may have taken advantage of the LIA, but we did not fully recognise this yet, probably because we didn\u2019t want to believe it and certainly not that our friend Youssef was at the heart of it\u201d. Under questioning by Goldman\u2019s QC, Robert Miles, Enaami said he had been paid $100,000 in July 2006 for writing reports on the economy by Walid Giahmi, who is being accused by the LIA of paying bribes in a separate case. Enaami is the second witness called by he LIA. The statement of the first, Ali Jalal Baruni, recalled that in one meeting he had felt inundated by presentations from Goldman Sachs bankers. \u201cI felt almost under attack as different Goldman Sachs teams and products were presented to me, one after the other and almost relentlessly, without me being given the opportunity to ask questions or reflect on them,\u201d said Baruni, who said he resigned from a consultancy position at the LIA in September 2008 after the LIA invested in a Goldman fund.

      "bodyText": "In another volatile day, leading shares fell back as concerns about the effect of a Brexit vote grew, along with nervousness after the US Federal Reserve expressed caution about the global economy. But markets came off their lows, helped by a recovery on Wall Street and despite continuing weakness in the oil price, with Brent crude down more than 3%. At one point the FTSE 100 hit its lowest point since mid-February but it ended only marginally down at 5950. But analysts at Morgan Stanley warned the leading index could fall as low as 5,000 if the UK voted to leave the EU. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 0.27% or 16.32 points to 5950.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.59% to 9550.47 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.45% at 4153.01 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.98% to 16,351.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.62% at 8199.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 3.31% to 556.48 despite news that the next tranche of bailout money was set to be given the go-ahead On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is barely changed, up 9 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has cancelled his planned speech on fintech at the Mansion House tonight following the terrible attack on MP Jo Cox. The Bank said: In the light of the dreadful attack today on Jo Cox MP the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, will no longer be delivering the planned speech at Mansion House. The Governor will be attending the event and will now deliver a short speech reflecting on today\u2019s events. Over in Greece, the country is likely to get the formal go-ahead for a \u20ac7.5bn loan tranche on Friday, after it met all the requirements demanded by creditors. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Greece had met all the prior actions necessary, while the country\u2019s finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said the first review of Greece\u2019s bailout programme was now essentially completed. On Friday the European Stability Mechanism is set to ratify the payment. Tsakalotos said, as reported by the Athens-Macedonian news agency: I appreciate that for many Greeks things are still very difficult, since we passed a lot of difficult measures. I feel a need to say that the next year must not just be the year when we exit the crisis through growth, but a time when we place emphasis on the qualitative aspects of this growth. The market worries about the UK leaving the EU may be overdone, says Julian Jessop at Capital Economics: Nervousness about Brexit has obviously been having an increasing impact on sentiment in global markets. This is perhaps seen most clearly in the strong performance of safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the price of gold, which have been tracking the latest referendum odds closely. However, this may not last much longer \u2013 for three main reasons. First, to some extent the nervousness in the markets simply reflects the fact that no-one yet knows the result of the referendum on the 23rd, which is too close to call... Second, even if the vote is for Brexit, the UK would probably remain a member of the EU for several years. The result of the referendum would only be advisory. While UK politicians cannot ignore the views of the electorate completely, most favour Remain and could drag the process out or try to find a relationship which replicates EU membership in all but name... Third, the rhetoric of global policy-makers is likely to change dramatically. Currently those favouring Remain have an incentive to talk up the risks of Brexit in an attempt to influence the electorate. But once the votes have been cast, we would expect them to seek to reassure businesses and investors instead. Admittedly, a UK vote for Brexit (or even a narrow majority for Remain) might embolden EU-sceptics elsewhere in Europe. Other governments may not be able to resist pressure for their own referendums. Brexit could conceivably be the first step towards the break-up of the EU, or the exit of one or more countries from the euro... The upshot is that the initial market turmoil created by a Brexit vote may be both smaller and shorter-lived than many fear. Indeed, even sterling may not react in the way that many expect. It is likely that worries about the impact on the UK economy would initially cause the pound to weaken \u2013 perhaps to as low as $1.20. Meanwhile Capital Economics has been rehearsing the various outcomes of the referendum in more detail: But the pound has recovered from lows after England won the Euro 2016 match against Wales. Coincidence? Or was it that brokers were watching the match and weren\u2019t around to halt the slide? And this: Sterling is under pressure, shares are falling, oil and base metals are down, but gold continues to be a haven for investors. Gold has jumped from $1292 an ounce to $1311, a near two year high, on worries about Brexit, as well as the US Federal Reserve\u2019s caution about the global economy. A survey of companies finds 35% of them think that the UK leaving the EU would be harmful, writes Katie Allen: A third of businesses in the UK think Brexit would be bad for the economy, according to a poll that also shows company bosses in London and Scotland are most worried about a vote to leave the EU in next week\u2019s referendum. The survey of 3,394 business owners and finance directors found those in the Midlands, east of England and northern England were the most optimistic about Brexit being helpful to the economy. The survey, by Charterhouse Research consultancy, found 35% of respondents thought Brexit would be harmful, 25% thought it would be good for the economy and 39% did not think it would make any difference. The full story is here: Despite the poll lead for the Leave campaign, some spread betting clients appear to take the opposite view, according to Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell: Interestingly for all the Brexit-fear currently plaguing the markets, Spreadex has seen a consistent trend of clients opting to put their money behind the Remainers. In both size and frequency of bet choosing to stay in the EU has come out on top, that support by and large continuing throughout the last fortnight despite the deluge of polls having Vote Leave pulling ahead. Of course this is no guarantee that Britain will still be in the EU come Friday 24 June. However, in the run up to the general election last year Spreadex\u2019s clients consistently backed a Conservative majority even as the polls predicted the tightest race in decades, so it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a similar outcome this time around. Britain leaving the EU would not have a direct effect on the Russian economy, said the country\u2019s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, repeating comments she made a week or so ago. In an interview with CNBC (transcript here ) ahead of her appearance at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, she said foreign investors\u2019 perception of the Russian economy has improved. And after last week\u2019s rate cut she said the central bank might reduce its key rate further. In line with other global markets, US shares have come under pressure on fears of Brexit and the Federal Reserve\u2019s caution about the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 130 points or 0.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.38% lower and Nasdaq down 0.5%. The US opening fall has seen the declines in other markets accelerate, with the FTSE 100 now down 62 points or 1%. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac has lost 0.95%. Meanwhile there have been some mixed economic numbers from the US. Consumer price inflation rose 0.2%% in May, down on the April figure of 0.4%. Analysts had expected a rise of 0.3%. Core inflation was unchanged at +0.2% Weekly jobless claims jumped to 277,000, compared to expectations of a 267,000 increase, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve business conditions index came in at 4.7 compared to expectations of a flat performance. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spread Co, said: The dollar fell in the immediate aftermath of the releases while stock index futures also declined. Referendum or no referendum, there\u2019s a growing feeling that the Fed has lost the plot when it comes to monetary policy. The US central bank switches from dovish to hawkish and back again with worrying regularity and has thrown the notion of \u201cdata dependence\u201d out of the window. It is becoming obvious to an increasing number of investors that the Fed cannot bring itself to raise rates, yet is taking all measures to attempt to hide this fact from the market. It\u2019s in a corner where hiking raises the prospect of a violent stock market sell-off, whereas a failure to tighten monetary policy suggests deep-rooted economic problems. The continuing uncertainty over a possible Brexit, with polls continuing to show the Leave campaign on the front foot, has sent London\u2019s leading shares to their lowest level since the middle of February. The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9% at 5911, a low not seen since February 17. As well as Brexit, the cautious comments from the US Federal Reserve about the global economy are also having an impact. Mining shares are among the main fallers, with copper prices down more than 2% and oil 1.5% lower. However precious metal specialists such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo are on the rise, as investors seek out gold and silver as havens for their cash. Banks are also under pressure on fears they would be hard hit by a Brexit decision. On the foreign exchange markets the pound is down around a cent at $1.41, a near two month low. Still on interest rates, economist Sam Alderson at the Centre for Economics and Business Research said: In the absence of a vote to leave later this month, interest rates look unlikely to change for some time to come. Given a generally softening domestic economy and relatively gradual recovery in inflation, we wouldn\u2019t expect the MPC to raise rates until the middle of 2017 at the earliest. However, the currency impact of a leave vote is likely to have a notable impact on the outlook for inflation. This in turn will clearly affect the Bank\u2019s monetary policy stance in the months that follow. UK interest rates would be cut close to zero in the event of a vote to leave the EU, says RBC Europe\u2019s senior UK economist Sam Hill: The minutes continue to be non-committal on the direction of a change in monetary policy following a Leave vote even though the Committee acknowledge it could \u201cmaterially alter the outlook\u201d. Although the MPC only go as far as saying the direction of any move in policy \u201cwill depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects\u201d we are of the view that Bank Rate would be cut \u201ctowards zero\u201d in the event of Brexit. Any short-term spike in inflation following a decline in the exchange rate we would expect to give way to downward pressure on inflation in the medium term \u2013 which is the MPC\u2019s policy-relevant horizon \u2013 as weak demand is likely to weigh on output. The one change [in the minutes] which was discernable was an increased emphasis on the international implications. Firstly on referendum uncertainty (\u201cThe outcome of the referendum continued to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly global financial markets.\u201d) and secondly on the event of a Brexit outcome (\u201cThrough financial market and confidence channels, there were also risks of adverse spillovers to the global economy.\u201d). There was also reference to a further fall in sterling \u201cperhaps sharply\u201d in a Leave scenario but in the grand scheme of things these minutes don\u2019t add much to what the MPC has already said on the EU referendum. The outlook for policy in the Remain scenario \u2013 effectively the scenario on which the May Inflation Report was conditioned \u2013 isn\u2019t likely to be presented with greater clarity until August at the earliest. However, at this stage news since May \u201chad done relatively little to change the MPC\u2019s assessment of the economic outlook\u201d. The Committee has been clear that data are difficult to interpret due to potential referendum effects. The same will be true until such time as it is thought any such effects have unwound after a Remain vote. We concluded last week... that any Remain rebound in economic activity may be underwhelming. So, whilst in that scenario our central case is for a 25 basis point Bank Rate hike in February 2017, the skew of risks is now clearly to a more dovish profile rather than a tightening in 2016. Here\u2019s our report on the Bank of England comments: The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning that a vote to leave the EU in next week\u2019s referendum risks knocking economic growth, pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy. Against the backdrop of jittery financial markets, the Bank also revealed its top policymakers had been briefed by staff on contingency planning for the referendum as it readies measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week. Announcing its decision to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%, the Bank said the referendum on 23 June was the biggest immediate risk to UK financial markets, and perhaps those overseas, and that the current uncertainty was already denting spending. The pound has weakened in the run-up to the vote as opinion polls have pointed to a lead for the leave vote and the Bank warned in minutes to its latest rate-setting meeting that it would fall further in the event of Brexit. \u201cThe outcome of the referendum continued to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly global financial markets,\u201d said the minutes. In addition: \u201cOn the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling\u2019s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.\u201d The full story is here: But alternatively, a remain vote could mean a rate rise, some believe: Some economists believe the Bank of England would slash interest rates to fresh record lows if the UK votes to leave the EU next week. James Knightley of ING predicts an emergency rate cut on Friday if the Leave campaign wins: He writes: In the case of Brexit, there is a high probability that inflation rises sharply as a result of currency weakness, but we think that the BoE will look through this, as they did in 2011. Instead we think the focus will be on the growth risks and financial market turbulence, which would dampen domestic inflation pressures over the medium term. Consequently, we would expect a 25bp rate cut on June 24th. Andrew McPhillips, chief economist at Yorkshire Building Society, also expects a cut: \u201cIt is likely that if the UK votes to leave the EU, the MPC will cut base rate in an attempt to stabilise the economy. Though this could lead to an increase in inflation due to the depreciation of Sterling, the Bank is likely to be willing to trade that off against trying to maintain economic growth and avoid the risk of increasing unemployment. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, a Remain campaigner, has welcomed the Bank of England\u2019s warning: \u201cThis is yet more independent evidence that our economy could plummet if we leave Europe. We cannot afford to let people like Norman Lamont crash the economy for a second time. This is not a political parlour game - people\u2019s jobs, homes and businesses are at risk.\u201d [Lord Lamont, a Leave supporter, was chancellor on Black Wednesday when Britain crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism] The pound has fallen since the Bank of England minutes hit the wires. It has lost one cent against the US dollar to hover around $1.41, near to a two-month low. Traders are also reacting to yet another poll showing Leave ahead. Survation reports that 45% of voters support Leave, with 42% backing Remain (and the rest undecided). The Bank of England\u2019s policymakers heard plenty of evidence that the UK economy has weakened due to next week\u2019s referendum vote. The minute of the MPC meeting state that: In the corporate sector, this included a sharp decline in the value of commercial real estate transactions and M&amp;A, and reports of delayed business investment. Evidence from the Bank\u2019s Agents had suggested increased delays in corporate decision making, which was corroborated by a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers. Survey information from Markit/CIPS and the BCC showed that for a material proportion of responding firms the referendum was having a detrimental effect on business activity, sometimes significantly so. They also point to signs that demand for new cars and houses has fallen recently. However.... the Bank also points out that other surveys have shown consumer demand is solid (such as this morning\u2019s strong retail sales). The full Bank of England minutes are here. You can read a summary of the Bank of England\u2019s minutes yourselves, here. The Bank of England appears to have hardened its Brexit warnings, despite pressure from the Leave campaign to cool things down. The Bank of England has also issued a fresh warning that the pound will tumble in the event of a Brexit vote. The minutes state that: \u201cOn the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling\u2019s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.\u201d The Bank also revealed its top policymakers had been briefed by staff on contingency planning for the referendum as it readies measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week. The Bank of England has warned that next week\u2019s EU referendum is already hurting the UK economy. It says there are signs that major spending decisions are being delayed, such as car and house purchases, as consumers and businesses wait to see if the UK votes to leave the European Union. In the minutes of this month\u2019s monetary policy meeting, just released, they say: The outcome of the referendum continues to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly also global financial markets. While consumer spending has been solid, there is growing evidence that uncertainty about the referendum is leading to delays to major economic decisions that are costly to reverse, including commercial and residential real estate transactions, car purchases, and business investment BoE policymakers were unanimous in leaving borrowing costs on hold, and also leaving the quantitative easing programme unchanged. Breaking: The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at their record low of 0.5%, continuing a run dating back to March 2009. And here come the minutes of the meeting..... 10 minutes to go..... Bad news from Greece -- the unemployment rate has jumped to 24.9% in the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s a rise from 24.4% in October-December. Indonesia just surprised the markets by unexpectedly cutting interest rates! Most economists surveyed by Reuters had expected the BoI to hold, butt instead it has eased monetary policy to in a bid to stir growth. Consumer goods giant Unilever has become the latest UK company to encourage staff to vote Remain next week. It has sent a letter to all 100,000 staff, signed by CEO Paul Polman and his three predecessors, saying the firm would be \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d by Brexit, adding: \u201cWe therefore hope that in the interests of Unilever, the UK,Europe, and indeed the wider global economy, the UK will choose to Remain and thereby continue to play a central role in Unilever\u2019s long-term growth and prosperity.\u201d So not actually a demand that staff reject Brexit, but a clear nudge..... The Bank of England have now published governor Mark Carney\u2019s letter to Leave campaigner Bernard Jenkin MP. It\u2019s a tinglingly robust slapdown to Jenkin\u2019s criticism that the BoE shouldn\u2019t make \u201cpublic comments\u201d about the referendum. Carney begins by saying: I am responding to your letter to dispel immediately the numerous and substantial misconceptions it contained. And he then explains that the Bank of England has respected its independence, and stuck firmly to its remit when it has talked about Brexit dangers. It\u2019s online here. The US Federal Reserve must take some blame for today\u2019s selloff. Last night, the Fed cited weakening economic growth as one reason for leaving interest rates on hold. And that has dampened the mood in the City, says Chris Beauchamp of City firm IG: There has been little to comfort investors over the past 24 hours, which is why yesterday\u2019s gains have withered on the vine. The Fed meeting was perhaps their best hope, but even here Janet Yellen was not able to offer much in the way of good news. After two hours of trading, every European stock market has lost ground. Worries about the global economy, and central bankers\u2019 ability to stimulate growth, are hitting shares -- along with Brexit concerns. Avtar Sandu, senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures in Singapore, told Reuters: The market is going to be soft until next week. The fear is that if the British actually decide to leave the EU there may be some sort of contagion. Investors are also alarmed by the big moves in Japan overnight, with shares sliding and the yen soaring. Boom! UK retail sales jumped by 0.9% last month, beating forecasts of a 0.2% rise. A surge in clothing sales led the recovery, according to the Office for National Statistics. Sales were 6.0% higher than a year ago, the biggest jump since September 2015. Clothing sales jumped by 4.3% during the month, the biggest rise in two years. Brits may have splashed out on new summer outfits as the sun made a rare (if brief) appearance through the clouds. This doesn\u2019t suggest shoppers are hunkering back in fear that Britain is about to leave the EU. Unless.... The European Central Bank has warned that Britain\u2019s referendum as a threat to the eurozone economy. In its monthly economic outlook, released this morning, the ECB says: Downside risks continue to relate to developments in the global economy, to the upcoming British referendum on EU membership and to other geopolitical risks. The ECB is also worried about the global economy, cautioning that: ....the outlook for emerging market economies remains more uncertain as growth in China decelerates and commodity-exporting countries adjust to lower commodity prices. The pound is weakening this morning, but it\u2019s not a full-blown rout. Sterling is down around half a cent against the US dollar at $1.415, and a similar amount against the euro at \u20ac1.256. That\u2019s a fairly muted reaction to this new IPSOS MORI poll putting Leave ahead. It\u2019s being published in the Evening Standard today, which says: It is the first time since David Cameron pledged the referendum in January 2013 that Vote Leave have come out ahead in the respected monthly Ipsos MORI telephone survey, which is exclusive to the Evening Standard. Immigration has overtaken the economy as the most important issue to how the public will vote, which is a significant boost to Boris Johnson and the Leave campaign. Just in.... a new opinion poll, putting giving the Leave campaign in the lead by 53% to 47%. That\u2019s a significant turnaround compared with last month: All this criticism from the Leave campaign probably won\u2019t prevent the Bank of England from citing Brexit fears in the official minutes of this week\u2019s MPC meeting. It would be odd, frankly, if they ignored it, given the recent volatility. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx reckons it could spark a deeper selloff. The FTSE could well see its losses intensify as the day goes on with the Bank of England set to stoke those Brexit-fearing fires later this morning with a firmer warning against leaving the EU (the central bank is also expected to unsurprisingly keep interest rates on hold). Mark Carney faced a lot of criticism last time he expressed an opinion on the referendum, so expect an apoplectic reaction from Vote Leave (and perhaps another fall from the pound) as Thursday continues. Crumbs, the Bank of England is really under fire from the Brexit camp. Bernard Jenkin MP, a director of the Vote Leave campaign, has written to governor Mark Carney warning him not to breach the pre-referendum \u201cpurdah\u201d rules by talking about the referendum. Clearly Carney\u2019s warning that Brexit was the biggest domestic risk to the UK economy, and could trigger a recession, has riled Leave campaigners. But Carney has hit back, telling Jenkin that the Bank has simply been following its statutory duty to the UK people. \u201cAll of the public comments that I, or other Bank officials, have made regarding issues related to the referendum have been limited to factors that affect the Bank\u2019s statutory responsibilities and have been entirely consistent with our remits.\u201d And he finished with a zinger: More here. Prime minister David Cameron has leapt to the Bank of England\u2019s defence, after a volley of criticism from senior grandees. Former chancellors Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson and ex-Tory leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Howard accused the BoE, and the Treasury, of peddling \u201cphoney forecasts\u201d about the dangers of Brexit. The quartet declared: \u201cThere has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis. \u201cThey have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain.\u201d Cameron (whose Remain campaign has relied on dire economic warnings), has hit back: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: Brexit fears continue to intensify a week out from the referendum, with the Federal Reserve again citing it as a headwind last night. The markets struggling to shrug off risk aversion sending bond prices higher and yields ever lower or more negative. And he fears the FTSE 100 could continue to slide, perhaps losing another 400 points to 5,500: European stock markets have opened in the red, hit by the familiar cocktail of economic worries and Brexit angst. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped by 50 points, or 0.85%, to 5916. That erases yesterday\u2019s recovery, and is the lowest point since 24 February. It means the index has lost around \u00a3100bn of value in the last week alone. Mining stocks and banks are among the biggest fallers in the City. The French, German, Spanish and Italian markets have all dropped by over 1%, with traders fretting about how their economies will suffer if Britain leaves the EU. The Tokyo stock market has tumbled by 3% today, after the Bank of Japan left its stimulus programme on hold ahead of the Brexit referendum. Hopes that the BoJ might announce fresh stimulus measures were dashed. Instead, policymakers voted to continue expanding the monetary base at an annual rate of about 80 billion yen. That hit stocks, but also triggered a rush of money into the yen. Japan\u2019s currency smashed through the \u00a5104 mark against the US dollar for the first time since August 2014, trading as strongly as \u00a5103.98 to $1. That will alarm top brass in Tokyo, who would rather see a rather weaker currency (to push up inflation away from around zero) The BoJ also singled out next week\u2019s EU referendum as a key geopolitical threat to the Japanese economy, along with the \u201cEuropean debt problem\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s Bank of England day. At noon, the Monetary Policy Committee will release its latest decision on interest rates, and say whether is is taking any fresh steps to stimulate the economy. No changes are expected. But instead, the MPC is likely to release a fresh warning about the risks posed by next week\u2019s EU referendum. The minutes of this month\u2019s meeting could also highlight the harm already caused by Brexit uncertainty. The financial markets are already in a nervous mood today, after the US Federal Reserve slashed its forecasts for interest rate hikes \u2013 and pinned some of the blame on the UK\u2019s referendum vote. Also coming up today: 9am: The European Central Bank publishes its latest economic bulletin 9.30am: UK retail sales figures for May 12: Bank of England decision, and minutes released Eurozone finance ministers are holding a Eurogroup meeting this afternoon. BoE governor Mark Carney will be speaking at the Mansion House tonight, but not until 9pm. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

This is perhaps seen most clearly in the strong performance of safe havens such as the Japanese yen and the price of gold, which have been tracking the latest referendum odds closely. However, this may not last much longer \u2013 for three main reasons. </p> <p>First, to some extent the nervousness in the markets simply reflects the fact that no-one yet knows the result of the referendum on the 23rd, which is too close to call... </p> <p>Second, even if the vote is for Brexit, the UK would probably remain a member of the EU for several years. The result of the referendum would only be advisory. While UK politicians cannot ignore the views of the electorate completely, most favour Remain and could drag the process out or try to find a relationship which replicates EU membership in all but name... </p> <p>Third, the rhetoric of global policy-makers is likely to change dramatically. Currently those favouring Remain have an incentive to talk up the risks of Brexit in an attempt to influence the electorate. But once the votes have been cast, we would expect them to seek to reassure businesses and investors instead.</p> <p> Admittedly, a UK vote for Brexit (or even a narrow majority for Remain) might embolden EU-sceptics elsewhere in Europe. Other governments may not be able to resist pressure for their own referendums. Brexit could conceivably be the first step towards the break-up of the EU, or the exit of one or more countries from the euro... </p> <p>The upshot is that the initial market turmoil created by a Brexit vote may be both smaller and shorter-lived than many fear. Indeed, even sterling may not react in the way that many expect. It is likely that worries about the impact on the UK economy would initially cause the pound to weaken \u2013 perhaps to as low as $1.20.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Capital Economics has been rehearsing the various outcomes of the referendum in more detail:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconUK/status/743464367669317632\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Regardless of which way <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUref?src=hash\">#EUref</a> vote goes, whether it is won by big or small margin will have implications.

It\u2019s in a corner where hiking raises the prospect of a violent stock market sell-off, whereas a failure to tighten monetary policy suggests deep-rooted economic problems.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-16T12:56:06.139Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57629c6ee4b02d7fb43eb2df\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-16T12:47:37.001Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FTSE 100 falls to lowest level since mid-February</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The continuing uncertainty over a possible Brexit, with polls continuing to show the Leave campaign on the front foot, has sent London\u2019s leading shares to their lowest level since the middle of February.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is currently down 0.9% at 5911, a low not seen since February 17.

Although the MPC only go as far as saying the direction of any move in policy \u201cwill depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects\u201d we are of the view that Bank Rate would be cut \u201ctowards zero\u201d in the event of Brexit.

However, at this stage news since May \u201chad done relatively little to change the MPC\u2019s assessment of the economic outlook\u201d. The Committee has been clear that data are difficult to interpret due to potential referendum effects. The same will be true until such time as it is thought any such effects have unwound after a Remain vote. We concluded last week... that any Remain rebound in economic activity may be underwhelming.</p> <p>So, whilst in that scenario our central case is for a 25 basis point Bank Rate hike in February 2017, the skew of risks is now clearly to a more dovish profile rather than a tightening in 2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5762964ee4b04ceead9890bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katieallen\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-16T12:08:03.457Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our report on the Bank of England comments:</p> <blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> has issued a fresh warning that a vote to leave the EU in next week\u2019s referendum risks knocking economic growth, pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of jittery financial markets, the Bank also revealed its top policymakers had been briefed by staff on contingency planning for the referendum as it readies measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/006.aspx\">Announcing its decision to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%</a>, the Bank said the referendum on 23 June was the biggest immediate risk to UK financial markets, and perhaps those overseas, and that the current uncertainty was already denting spending.

      "bodyText": "Retail sales jumped more than expected in May as shoppers shrugged off Brexit fears and splashed out on summer clothing. The volume of sales increased by 0.9% over the prior month, easily beating expectations of a more modest 0.2% rise and boosting hopes that the wider economy is not slowing. The figures suggested that the possibility of a British vote to leave the EU on 23 June is not discouraging consumers from spending. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cSurging retail sales show that consumers aren\u2019t paying much heed to warnings that the economy could nosedive if the UK opted for Brexit next week.\u201d A strong month in May pushed the annual rate of growth in retail sales to 6%, the strongest in eight months according to the Office for National Statistics data. Again, it was far sharper than the 3.9% annual rise predicted by economists, partly because numbers for April were also revised up. Last month shoppers were encouraged by spells of good weather, pushing clothing sales up 4.3% over the month as consumers refreshed their wardrobes with summery items. It was the biggest monthly rise in more than two years. Clothing sales were weaker in April when unseasonably cold weather discouraged shoppers from buying summer clothes. The retail sales data was the latest evidence that the UK economy was in decent shape in May, boosting hopes that a feared slowdown in the second quarter will not come to pass. The economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter, and economists had feared that a combination of uncertainty over Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, as well as global growth concerns, would trigger a significant UK slowdown between April and June. Alan Clark, an economist at Scotiabank, said: \u201cRetail sales, combined with the stronger than expected industrial production data earlier in the month are suggesting that second quarter gross domestic product could be very respectable \u2013 maybe no slowdown at all compared with the first quarter. That is contrary to previous worries that we would see near-zero GDP.\u201d Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said economic growth in the second quarter could outpace the first three months of the year. The latest ONS figures showed retail sales growth was being supported by sharp price cuts, as retailers offer hefty discounts to attract shoppers amid intense competition in the sector. Retail prices were 2.8% lower in May than a year earlier. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said consumer spending was likely to be the main driver of economic growth in the coming months. \u201cLooking ahead, assuming a vote to remain in the EU, retail spending should keep up a strong pace. And a vote to leave shouldn\u2019t hit spending too much. After all, consumer confidence is still at a historically high level and real pay growth remains supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cAccordingly, with net trade unlikely to provide much support to GDP growth \u2013 as exporters probably won\u2019t see the full benefit of the recent fall in sterling for some time yet \u2013 consumer spending will continue to drive the recovery.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Zara showed British high street rivals a clean pair of heels last year as its rang up strong sales and profits growth in its UK stores. Sales at the UK subsidiary of the Spanish firm Inditex rose 8% to \u00a3535m in the year to 31 January. It made a pre-tax profit of \u00a358.3m, up from \u00a349.2m in 2015. The growth of Zara in the UK has had an impact on homegrown chains such as Marks &amp; Spencer, many of which are struggling to keep pace with a surge in online sales. While high street rivals complain about the weather affecting their performance, Zara, which manufactures and designs its own clothing, is better able to react as it can turn catwalk trends into clothes in its stores within days. Last year M&amp;S appointed Queralt Ferrer, a former Inditex executive, as its first director of design for womenswear, lingerie and beauty as new chief executive Steve Rowe attempts to revive flagging sales. Zara was founded by Amancio Ortega, who opened the first store in the Galician city of La Coru\u00f1a in 1975. Today Ortega is the world\u2019s second richest man, with a fortune of $72.3bn, according to Forbes. Inditex is the world\u2019s biggest clothing retailer with more than 7,000 stores in 91 countries. On Wednesday, the group, which operates eight brands including Massimo Dutti, Bershka and Oysho, reported a 6% increase in quarterly profits to \u20ac554m. On the back of its success in the last financial year, Zara UK paid its parent dividends totalling \u00a347m, up from \u00a343m in 2015. The UK chain is run by I\u00f1igo de Llano, who took over as managing director in 2015, having previously run its Australian stores. Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman believes the group has \u201cthe best business model of any retailer and the competitive distance between Inditex and peers is only increasing. \u201cInditex has created a virtuous cycle from design to manufacture to store to customer that prioritises full price sales, giving it a margin advantage compared to peers and a more loyal and frequent customer base,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the near to medium term, many store based retailers will see margins under pressure as e-commerce grows and will be forced to reduce space and close stores. In contrast, Inditex has shown an impressive responsiveness to the changing world of e-commerce \u2026 building what we consider to be one of the most integrated store and online strategies in the sector.\u201d",

The UK chain is run by I\u00f1igo de Llano, who took over as managing director in 2015, having previously run its Australian stores. </p> <p>Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman believes the group has \u201cthe best business model of any retailer and the competitive distance between Inditex and peers is only increasing. </p> <p>\u201cInditex has created a virtuous cycle from design to manufacture to store to customer that prioritises full price sales, giving it a margin advantage compared to peers and a more loyal and frequent customer base,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOver the near to medium term, many store based retailers will see margins under pressure as e-commerce grows and will be forced to reduce space and close stores. In contrast, Inditex has shown an impressive responsiveness to the changing world of e-commerce \u2026 building what we consider to be one of the most integrated store and online strategies in the sector.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is using crowdfunding to back the installation of solar panels on its stores. The retailer is partnering with Energy4All, a not-for-profit group that helps community groups set up energy co-ops, with the aim of raising \u00a31.23m to put panels on nine large stores including Torbay in Devon, Truro in Cornwall and Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. A new entity, M&amp;S Energy Society, is inviting investments of between \u00a3100 and \u00a3100,000 to install and own 891kWh-worth of panels for 20 years from which the retailer will buy energy. The group is offering a target interest rate of 5% each year for those who invest. Lydia Hopton, Plan A project manager at M&amp;S, said: \u201cThis project is a great opportunity for customers to invest in green energy and help the environment, while also supporting local community groups. We\u2019re really excited that M&amp;S will be the first retailer to launch a scheme of this kind.\u201d Profits from M&amp;S Energy Society will be distributed through a community benefit fund to help support local energy-related projects, such as improving insulation on community buildings or helping local residents cut fuel consumption. Members of the scheme will be able to vote on the charities and initiatives which benefit. The scheme is the first corporate tie-up for Energy4All, which has backed 20 renewable energy co-ops around the UK, most of which are based around wind power. A spokeswoman for the group said it hoped its tie-up with M&amp;S would be the first of many corporate joint ventures, but a 65% cut in government incentives in January had now made this unlikely. She said the group had been able to pre-register the M&amp;S stores in January so that they would benefit from the previous more generous tariff but that would not be possible in future. \u201cWe did want this to be the blueprint for more but the changes in tariff have put a dampener on that,\u201d said the spokeswoman. The Energy Society scheme is part of M&amp;S\u2019s plan to source 50% of electricity used in its UK buildings from small-scale renewables by 2020. M&amp;S installed the UK\u2019s largest single array of rooftop solar panels on its distribution centre in Castle Donington in 2014. A number of other retailers have also invested heavily in renewable energy. Sainsbury\u2019s is one of the largest rooftop solar operators in Europe. The supermarket installed more than 170,000 panels above stores and distribution centres as part of a plan to go off-grid eventually. Kingfisher, the owner of B&amp;Q and Screwfix, is putting solar panels on its distribution centres and some stores as part of a \u00a350m investment to cut its reliance on the National Grid. Last year, Ikea, the world\u2019s biggest furniture retailer, pledged to spend \u20ac1bn (\u00a3700m) on renewables as part of its plan to generate all the energy required by its shops and factories from clean sources by 2020.",

    "webTitle": "British Steel pension scheme members urged to back benefits changes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The trustees of the British Steel pension scheme have asked its 130,000 members to accept scaled-back retirement benefits to avoid having to use the pensions lifeboat. The trustees have been looking for a way to stop the scheme being folded into the pension protection fund (PPF), which would result in benefits being hacked back. They have now issued their formal response to a government consultation about a modified pension deal that would cut benefits but bypass the need for the PPF. The trustees proposed a series of modifications to the scheme that they said would make it self-sufficient, including a proposal that future increases in payments would be limited to the minimum required by law. Members were also advised to accept a change in the way increases to deferred benefits were calculated, using the CPI measure as opposed to the higher RPI. The trustees said it would have the power to reinstate pension increases \u201cif and when it is financially safe to do so\u201d. They also said no surplus that built up in the scheme, which runs at a \u00a3700m deficit, would be paid to any \u201csponsor or employer\u201d under any circumstances. The cost of funding the scheme has been a sticking point in efforts to save jobs in the industry by finding a buyer for Tata Steel\u2019s assets after it announced plans to pull out of the UK. The trustees\u2019 proposals are designed to save the scheme from the PPF in the event that a buyer cannot be found or will not take on the pension liabilities. Allan Johnston, the chair of the trustees, said: \u201cAlthough the PPF is an important safeguard for pension schemes generally, we believe that better outcomes can be achieved for our members by staying out of it. If our proposals are implemented the vast majority of members will be better off than going into the PPF,\u201d he said. The trustees said the scheme should be kept out of the PPF for at least 10 years and could avoid it indefinitely if its proposals to reduce pension increases were accepted. If the scheme falls into the PPF, 58,000 members would face benefit reductions of 10% or more, while the remaining members would see future increases scaled back. Johnston said trustees hoped to avoid this with its less drastic proposal, which would require the government to change the law to exempt the scheme from legislation that protects the pension payments. \u201cWe have asked the government to remove a legislative obstacle to achieving this outcome,\u201d he said. Tom McPhail, the head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changes \u201cmay well be the right thing to do for the employees of British Steel and for their pensions. They may also allow the business to achieve a sustainable future as a going concern\u201d. He cautioned, however, that a change in the law to allow the proposals could backfire if struggling firms such as BHS also then look for ways to wriggle out of their pension obligations. \u201cFor the government it will be hard to ringfence this decision and to avoid this case being invoked in the future by other businesses in a similar position,\u201d he said. \u201cIn light of issues being raised in the context of the BHS pension scheme, there is a strong argument for a considered review of the pension scheme funding, of trustee responsibilities and of trade-offs between guarantees and costs in final salary pension schemes.\u201d The government\u2019s consultation on solutions for the British Steel pension scheme closes on 23 June.",

They also said no surplus that built up in the scheme, which runs at a \u00a3700m deficit, would be paid to any \u201csponsor or employer\u201d under any circumstances.</p> <p>The cost of funding the scheme has been a sticking point in efforts to save jobs in the industry by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36157385\">finding a buyer for Tata Steel\u2019s assets</a> after it announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot\">pull out of the UK</a>.</p> <p>The trustees\u2019 proposals are designed to save the scheme from the PPF in the event that a buyer cannot be found or will not take on the pension liabilities.</p> <p>Allan Johnston, the chair of the trustees, said: \u201cAlthough the PPF is an important safeguard for pension schemes generally, we believe that better outcomes can be achieved for our members by staying out of it. If our proposals are implemented the vast majority of members will be better off than going into the PPF,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The trustees said the scheme should be kept out of the PPF for at least 10 years and could avoid it indefinitely if its proposals to reduce pension increases were accepted.</p> <p>If the scheme falls into the PPF, 58,000 members would face benefit reductions of 10% or more, while the remaining members would see future increases scaled back.<br></p> <p>Johnston said trustees hoped to avoid this with its less drastic proposal, which would require the government to change the law to exempt the scheme from legislation that protects the pension payments. \u201cWe have asked the government to remove a legislative obstacle to achieving this outcome,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tom McPhail, the head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changes \u201cmay well be the right thing to do for the employees of British Steel and for their pensions. They may also allow the business to achieve a sustainable future as a going concern\u201d.</p> <p>He cautioned, however, that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/tata-steel-warning-that-pensions-restructure-could-set-risky-precedent\">change in the law to allow the proposals could backfire</a> if struggling firms such as BHS also then look for ways to wriggle out of their pension obligations.</p> <p>\u201cFor the government it will be hard to ringfence this decision and to avoid this case being invoked in the future by other businesses in a similar position,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of issues being raised in the context of the BHS pension scheme, there is a strong argument for a considered review of the pension scheme funding, of trustee responsibilities and of trade-offs between guarantees and costs in final salary pension schemes.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s consultation on solutions for the British Steel pension scheme closes on 23 June.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Cox and Simon Winfield run businesses in the Black Country. Both export to the EU and beyond. Both worry about UK skills shortages and both want more help for manufacturers. But there is one thing they don\u2019t agree on: how to vote in the EU referendum. Cox believes Britain needs to shake off the constraints of EU membership to flourish. Winfield reckons staying in the EU is vital to his business and to Britain\u2019s prospects. We got them together to talk red tape, immigration and what Brexit would mean for business. Trade For Winfield, the EU\u2019s open market is a big reason to vote remain on 23 June. He runs MacLellan Rubber, a 145-year-old business in Wednesfield supplying products such as seals and rubber matting to other manufacturers. A third of its \u00a32.8m in annual sales comes from exports. \u201cOne of things I dread going back to, and I have been doing this 35 years, is all the paperwork that you had to fill in to export some goods. Whereas now, I raise an invoice, stick it on a vehicle and off it goes,\u201d says the 52-year-old. Cox disagrees that the EU makes trade easier. If anything, the size of the 28-member bloc has hampered progress on trade deals with other countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a political football match with all 28 teams on the pitch at the same time,\u201d says the 48-year-old. \u201cThe EU has gradually changed from being a trade enhancer, to a trade obstacle.\u201d His company, Cox &amp; Plant, makes 70% of its \u00a37m annual turnover from exports. From a factory in Lye, it sells production line machinery to food manufacturers around the world. Cox says more companies should look beyond Europe for business. As board director for exports on the Black Country local enterprise partnership (LEP) he wants to see more trade with Asia, but he feels progress is slow. Regulation When it comes to EU rules, one man\u2019s red tape is another man\u2019s level playing field, it would seem. Winfield says his rubber company, which employs 15 people, has faced fierce price wars in the UK. The EU helps stem the cost-over-quality trend, he says. \u201cThe EU provides legislation and guidance and controls to say if you are putting a material, polymer or a plastic into this application, it needs to meet this standard and that therefore creates an opportunity for us to sell a quality product with all the service aspects that come with it.\u201d But Cox, who employs 25 people, does not agree that the EU guarantees a level playing field because corners are being cut in some states. \u201cAs Brits we tend to do the right thing. We are polite, we are courteous, we adopt all the rules but not all the 28 states do.\u201d Immigration Both Cox and Winfield said immigration is a key concern for Black Country voters. Both believe their region will vote to leave the EU and that turnout will be high. People are worried about the costs of immigration and of EU membership, says Winfield. \u201cIt\u2019s pounds in their pocket that they feel they are losing because of immigration \u2013 although they have got no specific examples.\u201d But he feels differently. \u201cThe vast majority of immigrants, I believe, bring something to the UK economy and lord knows we are short of a lot of skills.\u201d Winfield and Cox, who have taken on apprentices, agree that Britain should do more to address skills shortages. In the Black Country 16% of working age adults have no qualifications, well above the national rate of 10%, according to the LEP. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we upskilling those people? Rather than deeming them as failing,\u201d says Cox. Using immigration as a \u201csticking plaster\u201d is not just bad for the UK economy, he says, but for other EU countries too. \u201cI know from being in Poland, when a lot of the Poles first came over in 2004 it left their hospitals short \u2026 We have got to look at the consequences, what do we do to these poorer countries? So Poland has a shocking lack of teachers, doctors, nurses. Is that good for us as the world\u2019s fifth nation to rape and pillage other countries?\u201d EU economy Cox is worried that EU membership ties the UK to a shaky economy. It is not just the UK being held back by staying in the club, he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a broken model and it\u2019s getting bigger. It\u2019s almost like the Titanic: we are heading towards an iceberg and we are bringing more countries in and it\u2019s getting more diverse and I just feel it\u2019s out of control.\u201d Winfield does not see that as a reason to leave. He retorts: \u201cSo to take that analogy, we are getting off on our life boat now and we are in our big ocean and we are looking for a safe port and we are looking for safe harbour. By that definition our economic life is in somebody else\u2019s hands.\u201d But Cox also fears more immediate risks for the EU economy, in particular from Italy\u2019s troubled banks. \u201cLet\u2019s just say Italy is the new Grexit and Italy literally goes wallop and everybody goes \u2018it\u2019s like Britain in \u201908 and it needs massive refinancing\u2019. I just wonder how many people who voted to stay in would be bitter.\u201d But the UK would be affected by an Italian crisis regardless of EU membership, says Winfield. \u201cWe are not isolated from these things and we can never be. Banks are international, money flows everywhere.\u201d Investment Winfield is worried a Brexit vote will hit investment because trickier trading terms will deter foreign firms. He fears that to compensate, politicians could allow labour laws to be eroded. \u201cProgressively, we will become less attractive. That\u2019s how we then move into more relaxed labour laws, a more relaxed approach to hiring and firing, a more relaxed approach to minimum wage levels,\u201d he says. Cox believes money saved from leaving the EU could make up for lost investment. \u201cWe are talking about \u00a3350m a week, \u00a320bn a year. That \u00a320bn should be spent within the British economy,\u201d he says, referring to figures used by leave campaigners based on the gross sum contributed to the EU last year. The day after How will Cox and Winfield feel on 24 June if the referendum has not gone their way? \u201cIf I wake up and we are still in, we will have missed the chance for a new dawn. It will be a missed opportunity and more of the same,\u201d says Cox. If the vote is to leave, Winfield worries the UK will be viewed as a petulant child. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be perceived as more dollies out of the pram,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think to the argument, we can still trade, you have essentially turned around and said to 500 million people: \u2018We want to trade with you but we don\u2019t really like you\u2019. That\u2019s not the Britain that I know.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning that a vote to leave the EU in next week\u2019s referendum risks knocking economic growth, pushing the pound sharply lower and sending shockwaves through the global economy. Against the backdrop of jittery financial markets, the Bank also revealed its top policymakers had been briefed by staff on contingency planning for the referendum as it readies measures to prevent markets seizing up in the event of a leave vote next week. Announcing its decision to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5%, the Bank said the referendum on 23 June was the biggest immediate risk to UK financial markets, and perhaps those overseas, and that the current uncertainty was already denting spending. The pound has weakened in the run-up to the vote as opinion polls have pointed to a lead for the leave vote and the Bank warned in minutes to its latest rate-setting meeting that it would fall further in the event of Brexit. \u201cThe outcome of the referendum continued to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly global financial markets,\u201d said the minutes. In addition: \u201cOn the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling\u2019s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.\u201d The minutes also noted recent comments on potential Brexit risks to global financial markets made by the US central bank as it left interest rates there on hold this week. The record of the Bank\u2019s final rate-setting meeting before the referendum showed all nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep interest rates at 0.5%. That was as expected by financial markets and economists, given the impending vote. The minutes said the MPC had been briefed on contingency planning for the referendum, including on the \u201cmore intensive supervision by the Prudential Regulation Authority of major financial institutions to ensure they had sufficient liquidity\u201d. The Bank said in the minutes that it was \u201cwell placed to address liquidity needs and support the functioning of financial markets\u201d. In the minutes, policymakers noted a pick-up in uncertainty ahead of the vote, which could knock economic growth. \u201cThe main focus of the committee\u2019s policy discussion this month concerned the difficulty in identifying the underlying momentum in the domestic economy, amidst the influence on activity of uncertainty related to the EU referendum,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cMeasures of uncertainty had increased further over the past month, with the UK a clear outlier internationally. And there had been growing evidence that uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum was leading to delays to major economic decisions that were costly or difficult to reverse.\u201d There had been a \u201csharp decline\u201d in the value of commercial real estate transactions and in merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity and reports of delayed business investment, the Bank said, echoing some private sector reports of spending decisions being deferred. The Bank also noted some possible influence on consumer spending. \u201cRegarding households, both car purchases and residential housing activity had declined, although it was difficult to isolate the extent to which these effects related to the referendum or a more general underlying slowing,\u201d the minutes said. But the Bank added retail sales had been stronger than expected in April and that confidence indicators, as a whole, \u201cremained healthy\u201d. Interest rates have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% for more than seven years. Expectations of when rates might start to rise back to more normal levels have been shifted back amid signs the economy may have slowed recently. Some policymakers and economists have even discussed the prospect of interest rates being cut further. In the near-term much will depend on the referendum and market reaction to the outcome. Last month, Bank governor Mark Carney warned that Brexit could tip the UK into recession. He also said a vote to leave the EU could knock the pound sharply lower, stoke inflation and raise unemployment, leaving the Bank with a difficult balancing act as it decides whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates to counter opposing forces. The minutes on Thursday repeated the Bank\u2019s prediction that in the event of Brexit it would face a likely tradeoff between stabilising inflation on the one hand and output and employment on the other. Carney has been criticised by leave campaigners for what they see as inappropriately political comments from the independent central bank. Earlier on Thursday, Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont, Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith wrote a Telegraph article accusing the Treasury and the Bank of England of a \u201cwoeful failure\u201d to offer a fair analysis of what might happen in the event of Brexit. But David Cameron defended the Bank, saying the leave campaign\u2019s criticism of the independent Bank was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cWe should listen to experts when they warn us of the dangers to our economy of leaving the European Union,\u201d the prime minister added. Separately, it emerged that Bernard Jenkin MP, a director of the Vote Leave campaign, had written to Carney warning him not to breach the pre-referendum \u201cpurdah\u201d rules by talking about the referendum. But Carney hit back, telling Jenkin that the Bank had simply been following its statutory duty to the UK people, according to the BBC, which saw the letters.",

The pound has weakened in the run-up to the vote as opinion polls have pointed to a lead for the leave vote and the Bank warned in minutes to its latest rate-setting meeting that it would fall further in the event of Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cThe outcome of the referendum continued to be the largest immediate risk facing UK financial markets, and possibly global financial markets,\u201d said the minutes. In addition: \u201cOn the evidence of the recent behaviour of the foreign exchange market, it appears increasingly likely that, were the UK to vote to leave the EU, sterling\u2019s exchange rate would fall further, perhaps sharply.\u201d</p> <p>The minutes also noted recent comments on potential Brexit risks to global financial markets made by the US central bank as it left interest rates there on hold this week. The record of the Bank\u2019s final rate-setting meeting before the referendum showed all nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep interest rates at 0.5%. That was as expected by financial markets and economists, given the impending vote.</p> <p>The minutes said the MPC had been briefed on contingency planning for the referendum, including on the \u201cmore intensive supervision by the Prudential Regulation Authority of major financial institutions to ensure they had sufficient liquidity\u201d.</p> <p>The Bank said in the minutes that it was \u201cwell placed to address liquidity needs and support the functioning of financial markets\u201d. In the minutes, policymakers noted a pick-up in uncertainty ahead of the vote, which could knock economic growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe main focus of the committee\u2019s policy discussion this month concerned the difficulty in identifying the underlying momentum in the domestic economy, amidst the influence on activity of uncertainty related to the EU referendum,\u201d the minutes said.</p> <p>\u201cMeasures of uncertainty had increased further over the past month, with the UK a clear outlier internationally. And there had been growing evidence that uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum was leading to delays to major economic decisions that were costly or difficult to reverse.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jun/16/markets-fall-bank-of-england-interest-rates-business-live\">Bank of England warns Brexit uncertainty is hurting the economy \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There had been a \u201csharp decline\u201d in the value of commercial real estate transactions and in merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity and reports of delayed business investment, the Bank said, echoing some private sector reports of spending decisions being deferred. The Bank also noted some possible influence on consumer spending.</p> <p>\u201cRegarding households, both car purchases and residential housing activity had declined, although it was difficult to isolate the extent to which these effects related to the referendum or a more general underlying slowing,\u201d the minutes said. But the Bank added retail sales had been stronger than expected in April and that confidence indicators, as a whole, \u201cremained healthy\u201d.</p> <p>Interest rates have been on hold at a record low of 0.5% for more than seven years. Expectations of when rates might start to rise back to more normal levels have been shifted back amid signs the economy may have slowed recently.

      "bodyText": "Profits at the British handbag maker Mulberry have recovered after it cut prices and spruced up its ranges to win back customers. Mulberry\u2019s efforts to become a more affordable luxury brand appear to be paying off, following a disastrous move upmarket in recent years. It now intends to open more factories in the UK as revenues rise. Profits before tax rose to \u00a36.2m in the year to 31 March, from \u00a31.9m the previous year. Retail sales climbed 8% to \u00a3118.7m while wholesale revenues dipped slightly to \u00a337.2m from \u00a338.8m. Like-for-like sales were up 8% last year but growth has slowed in the 11 weeks to 11 June, to 4%. Many luxury retailers are struggling, such as Burberry, Giorgio Armani and Hugo Boss, as demand has suffered as a result of the economic slowdown in China. Mulberry said the first collection from its new creative director, Johnny Coca, who was recruited from C\u00e9line, at London fashion week in February had been well received by the press and the company\u2019s partners. It started arriving in shops in April and the whole collection will be in stores by August. The Somerset-based firm said 70% of its handbags were priced between \u00a3500 and \u00a3995, compared with less than half in 2014. They include the bestselling Bayswater and the Lily, named after model Lily Cole. Mulberry has brought the style and pricing of shoes and ready-to-wear collections into line with bags. The firm has pushed through production efficiencies at its factories in Chilcompton and Bridgwater, which produce half of its handbags. As they are close to capacity, there are plans to open a third factory in Britain. \u201cThe brand\u2019s British DNA is emphasised as a point of distinction,\u201d Mulberry said. The company opened a new flagship store in Paris last year, replacing a smaller one, and closed three stores in the US. It plans to open fewer stores in coming years to focus on improving shops and its digital business. Digital sales rose 19% to \u00a321.4m last year, boosted by a website upgrade and improved delivery. They now account for 14% of group sales, compared with 12% in 2015 and 10% in 2014. About half of this comes from mobile phones and tablets. Nivindya Sharma, senior analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: \u201cThere is much more potential for growth especially as Mulberry plans to extend its digital offer into key international markets through local language websites and local fulfilment over the next few years.\u201d She said with Coca\u2019s efforts to modernise the brand while respecting its heritage, Mulberry was on its way to regaining its trademark \u201cclassic but cool\u201d credentials. \u201cMulberry has made significant progress during the last financial year with solid growth achieved in revenues and profit,\u201d said Thierry Andretta, the chief executive. \u201cOur UK manufacturing base has remained a core strength and point of distinction. We have built a strong foundation for future growth as a result of the investment made in product design and development as well as our omni-channel infrastructure.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of the day\u2019s big gainers is clothing retailer N Brown, the owner of Simply Be, Jacamo and Fifty Plus. Its shares have jumped 8% to 232p, making it the biggest rise in the FTSE 250, after it reported a 1.6% fall in first quarter revenues, much better than analysts had been expecting after its full year caution and two profit warnings last year. The company unveiled a better than forecast 6% rise in online revenues, and said it had seen an increase in new credit customers, pushing finacial services revenue up 3.4%. The company said in April that poor weather had hit demand for spring and summer clothing, which Brexit fears had led to subdued consumer spending. Now chief executive Angela Spindler said: Overall trading in the quarter has been in line with our expectations and our guidance for the full year remains unchanged... Our systems transformation programme.. remains on track in all respects. Looking forward, our new systems will give us a strong platform to capitalise on the significant growth opportunities ahead. Analysts were, for the most part, positive. James Collins at Stifel said: Management cautioned at the time of full year results that the start of the year \u201chad been subdued, with sales lower year on year\u201d, citing a tough industry backdrop and the lag effect of a change in marketing phasing. Hence first quarter product like for likes of -1.6% should be no surprise to the market and is in fact slightly higher than consensus expectations. Alongside this, financial services revenues continue to show healthy growth. We expect no change to consensus forecasts and, having reacted harshly to downgrades earlier in the year, we think today\u2019s statement should provide some reassurance. We retain a hold recommendation. Jefferies was also upbeat, correctly saying: Brown\u2019s first quarter trading deserves a strong share price reaction, in our view. This was a challenging trading period, but we think product revenues rebounded into positive growth over the last 6 weeks. At 8.4 times PE and 6.6% dividend yield, the shares appear braced for material disappointment and so have good reason to bounce. The lasting takeaway here, we think, is that through the transformation programme, Brown is gaining flexibility to trade through tough markets. Citi\u2019s Assad Malic said: N Brown has reported a better than expected first quarter update, suggesting an improving run rate in product revenues towards the end of the quarter given the volatile clothing market. But at Peel Hunt, analyst John Stevenson cut his target price from 275p to 230p: N Brown has reported first quarter sales performance in line with expectations. Product sales have been on an improving trend over the quarter, reflecting the more favourable weather conditions, which have lifted apparel sales across the market. The attrition from the traditional brands continues to offset growth in the power brands. Our main concerns rest on gross margins and the risk of further investment in the second half. N Brown shares have fallen by around 30% over 2016 and look optically cheap with a single digit PE and around 7% dividend yield. While there is more limited downside, we continue to retain concerns over forecast delivery, particularly with respect to gross margin. Guidance points to improved margin momentum and profit growth in the second half. The company has taken on greater currency cover since the last update, but unlike most retailers, N Brown is still not full covered. Aside from currency volatility, we are concerned on the impact this may have on underlying margins for autumn/winter before the season has started (ie the assumed rate for the buying team may be very different from the actual).",

We expect no change to consensus forecasts and, having reacted harshly to downgrades earlier in the year, we think today\u2019s statement should provide some reassurance. We retain a hold recommendation. </p> </blockquote> <p>Jefferies was also upbeat, correctly saying:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brown\u2019s first quarter trading deserves a strong share price reaction, in our view. This was a challenging trading period, but we think product revenues rebounded into positive growth over the last 6 weeks. At 8.4 times PE and 6.6% dividend yield, the shares appear braced for material disappointment and so have good reason to bounce. The lasting takeaway here, we think, is that through the transformation programme, Brown is gaining flexibility to trade through tough markets.</p> </blockquote> <p>Citi\u2019s Assad Malic said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>N Brown has reported a better than expected first quarter update, suggesting an improving run rate in product revenues towards the end of the quarter given the volatile clothing market.</p> </blockquote> <p>But at Peel Hunt, analyst John Stevenson cut his target price from 275p to 230p:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>N Brown has reported first quarter sales performance in line with expectations. Product sales have been on an improving trend over the quarter, reflecting the more favourable weather conditions, which have lifted apparel sales across the market. The attrition from the traditional brands continues to offset growth in the power brands. Our main concerns rest on gross margins and the risk of further investment in the second half.</p> <p>N Brown shares have fallen by around 30% over 2016 and look optically cheap with a single digit PE and around 7% dividend yield. While there is more limited downside, we continue to retain concerns over forecast delivery, particularly with respect to gross margin. Guidance points to improved margin momentum and profit growth in the second half. The company has taken on greater currency cover since the last update, but unlike most retailers, N Brown is still not full covered. Aside from currency volatility, we are concerned on the impact this may have on underlying margins for autumn/winter before the season has started (ie the assumed rate for the buying team may be very different from the actual). </p> </blockquote>",

With investors seeking havens for their cash, gold and silver are in demand, which has helped push up precious metal miners. Randgold Resources has risen 255p to \u00a368.65, while Fresnillo is up 45p at \u00a312.57. Berkeley Group, which has been undermined like other housebuilders by Brexit concerns and also fell back on Wednesday after its latest update, has climbed 47p to \u00a330.01 despite Credit Suisse issuing an underperform rating. The bank said: Whilst we believe Berkeley remains a very well managed business, we do not believe the business is immune to the weakening conditions that are being experienced in the inner London new build housing market. But Credit Suisse did raise its 2017 earnings per share forecasts by 2% and lifted its target price from \u00a323.72 to \u00a326.48. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 38.48 points to 5928.32, even though UK retail sales came in better than expected. Investors are unsettled, not only by the number of polls showing the Leave campaign ahead in the EU referendum, but also by the yen soaring as the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy unchanged and the Fed becoming more cautious on the global economy. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With a rather negative Federal Reserve holding off on a June rate-hike, and stating that it expects a \u2018slower path\u2019 for any future rise, the markets had little reason for cheer this Thursday, the European markets returning to the red after yesterday\u2019s dead cat bounce... The usual Brexit fears are to blame for the resumption of the index\u2019s decline, with Brent Crude\u2019s dive below $48.50 per barrel failing to help matters either... The FTSE could well see its losses intensify as the day goes on with the Bank of England set to stoke those Brexit-fearing fires later this morning with a firmer warning against leaving the EU (the central bank is also expected to unsurprisingly keep interest rates on hold). Mark Carney faced a lot of criticism last time he expressed an opinion on the referendum, so expect an apoplectic reaction from Vote Leave (and perhaps another fall from the pound) as Thursday continues. Understandably the Eurozone shared the same fate as its UK cousin this morning, the DAX and CAC dropping by 1.2% and 0.9% respectively. It appears that the Eurozone indices and the FTSE are trading in lock-step at the moment, any region-specific nuance lost in the face of the looming referendum.

      "bodyText": "Poundland, which faces a possible takeover bid from the South African conglomerate Steinhoff, has reported a sharp fall in profits, following the \u00a355m acquisition of its loss-making rival 99p Stores. The UK discount retailer said pretax profits crashed nearly 84% to \u00a35.9m in the year to 27 March. Like-for-like sales dropped 3.9%, following a 2.4% rise in 2015. The retailer cut its full-year dividend to 3.65p a share, from 4.5p in 2015. Poundland blamed the long regulatory process for the declining performance of 99p Stores before the acquisition. The competition regulator approved the deal in September after a six-month investigation. During that time 99p Stores lost its credit insurance, which meant it was cut off by many suppliers. To stem losses at the new shops, Poundland rushed through a store refurbishment programme in four months, converting 235 new stores to Poundland by the end of April. The conversion programme is now complete; a further 17 shops are to be closed or sold. Steinhoff has amassed a near-23% stake in Poundland and said on Wednesday it was considering a possible offer. It is on the prowl again after failing to buy Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos, and French electrical goods group Darty in the last few months. Steinhoff, chaired by the retail mogul Christo Wiese, already owns furniture chains Harveys and Bensons for Beds in the UK, as well as stakes in fashion chain New Look and grocer Iceland. Jim McCarthy, Poundland\u2019s chief executive, will hand over to Kevin O\u2019Byrne in two weeks. He said the retail environment remained challenging, but expressed confidence that Poundland would return to growth. Poundland has scaled back new store openings, after opening a net 60 last year, to focus on improving its 896-store business. The retailer\u2019s underlying profits \u2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation \u2013 fell 4.1% to \u00a356.9m last year. Total sales, including new stores, rose 9.7% on a constant currency basis to \u00a31.2bn. Darren Shapland, the chairman, said: \u201cThis has been a challenging but transformative year for Poundland and the acquisition of 99p Stores has further strengthened our position as Europe\u2019s biggest single-price discounter.\u201d McCarthy said the company had grown from 146 stores to about 900 during the 10 years he was at the helm. Sales rose by \u00a31bn during that time, and Poundland floated on the stock exchange in March 2014.",

      "bodyText": "GDP is the go-to measure of the economy. But while handy, GDP has numerous problems \u2013 many of which are quite apparent right at the moment. Australia\u2019s economy is growing at above-trend levels and yet there is little sense of any great economic strength present in people\u2019s lives or even in the government\u2019s budget. In some ways Australia is rather GDP-centric. Unlike in the US, for example, we use two negative quarters of GDP growth (seasonally adjusted) as the indicator of a recession. It\u2019s a pretty silly way to judge such things, but because of it, there is always a lot of attention on how GDP has grown every three months. I am certainly not one to throw stones in this regard \u2013 I cover GDP growth as much as anyone \u2013 but when looking at the final number it\u2019s always worth noting what is going on. Caring only about the final GDP growth figure without considering the moving parts that brought about that number is like buying a car without bothering to lift up the hood and check the engine. One problem with GDP is that \u2013 as was noted in an excellent article in the Economist earlier this year \u2013 it doesn\u2019t count a lot of work and production in the economy (such as unpaid labour) and what it does count is often hard to measure. Even if we use a per-capita figure to take account of population increases we can still arrive at a growth figure that doesn\u2019t seem to gel with our day-to-day experience. And the less a figure reflects what the people in that economy experience, the less valuable it becomes \u2013 especially when trying to engender confidence. One problem is that GDP \u2013 even per capita \u2013 is a measure of output which doesn\u2019t say a heck of a lot about people\u2019s incomes, and certainly nothing about inequality. We don\u2019t get a share of GDP per capita in our bank accounts (if you did, in the past 12 months you would have $68,523). So rather than just measure output, the ABS also tries to measure \u201cnational economic wellbeing\u201d using \u201creal net national disposable income\u201d. In effect, this tries to look at how economic growth translates into income. And right now there is a historic disparity between output and income: In the past 12 months GDP per capita grew by 1.8%, while real net national disposable income per capita fell by 2.4%. Only three times in the past 40 years has income growth been so far below GDP growth \u2013 in December last year and in two quarters during the global financial crisis. It helps explain why GDP doesn\u2019t seem like a true reflection of the economy people are actually experiencing. GDP is made up of consumption, government expenditure, investment and exports minus imports (net exports). Consumption, government expenditure and investment combined is called \u201cdomestic final demand\u201d, and here again we are seeing a large disparity between it and GDP growth: Since the end of 2012, domestic final demand has been growing by less than 2% \u2013 a level not usually observed outside of a recession. So why aren\u2019t we in a recession? Because of exports and imports. As I noted at the time, GDP growth in the March quarter was effectively all due to net exports. But it is worth remembering that \u201cnet exports\u201d is the sum of our exports minus our imports. If we import less, that actually leads to a better GDP figure because less money is going out of the country. But when the volume of imports falls, that often means the domestic economy is actually weak \u2013 that was certainly the case during the financial crisis: In June 2009, \u201cnet-export\u201d growth kept Australia from having two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, but 70% of that growth was due to a fall in imports. Essentially, because the economy looked like it was going to hell, businesses massively scaled back their orders for imported goods and capital equipment. As a result, GDP improved and we didn\u2019t go into a \u201ctechnical\u201d recession. At the moment imports are pretty flat, and exports are doing well \u2013 so it\u2019s a good kind of net-export growth. But not all exports are equal, and in this case the export growth is not all good news. At the moment our major export prices have been falling, so we\u2019re seeing the volume of exports increasing (which helps real GDP growth), but the actual money we\u2019re getting for those exports is falling (which hurts income growth): The other problem with mining exports is that not only are they not delivering an income boost, they are effectively the results of production from a decade ago \u2013 so the jobs that led to the boom in exports have come and are already gone. Gone as well are the profits and the resultant company tax. Company profits from the start of 2002 to the start of 2009 grew on average by 12.5% each year; since 2012 they have fallen on average by 2.5%. So this is the part of the mining boom that doesn\u2019t see a boom in government revenue. And yet, because of the volume of exports, the mining industry remains the most important industry for GDP growth: In the past four years it has easily been the biggest contributor to GDP growth, and yet in the same period it has shed 40,000 jobs (about 15% of its workforce). The second most important industry over the past four years for GDP growth has been the financial and insurance industry \u2013 an industry that employs less than 4% of all workers. And here again the contribution of the industry demonstrates the disconnect of GDP with people\u2019s experience of the economy. A major part of the \u201coutput\u201d of the finance sector that counts towards GDP is arrived at via a calculation that involves imputing the gap between the interest charged on loans and the interest banks pay on deposits. Not surprisingly, as the debt held by Australians has grown, so too has the \u201cimportance\u201d of the financial sector to GDP growth. As The Australia Institute\u2019s Jim Stanford notes, it is \u201chard to believe Australians are being enriched by that component of GDP growth \u2013 quite the opposite, in fact\u201d. With GDP growth being powered by exports, via the mining industry, and the financial sector on the back of indebtedness, it\u2019s little wonder that it seems out of whack when we hear that Australia\u2019s economy is growing faster than most of the developed world. We shouldn\u2019t discount GDP as a measure of economic output, but right now it is very good at measuring things that don\u2019t reflect the economics of most people\u2019s lives.",

      "body": "<p>GDP is the go-to measure of the economy. But while handy, GDP has numerous problems \u2013 many of which are quite apparent right at the moment. Australia\u2019s economy is growing at above-trend levels and yet there is little sense of any great economic strength present in people\u2019s lives or even in the government\u2019s budget.</p> <p>In some ways Australia is rather GDP-centric. Unlike in the US, for example, we use two negative quarters of GDP growth (seasonally adjusted) as the indicator of a recession. It\u2019s a pretty silly way to judge such things, but because of it, there is always a lot of attention on how GDP has grown every three months.</p> <p>I am certainly not one to throw stones in this regard \u2013 I cover GDP growth as much as anyone \u2013 but when looking at the final number it\u2019s always worth noting what is going on. Caring only about the final GDP growth figure without considering the moving parts that brought about that number is like buying a car without bothering to lift up the hood and check the engine.</p> <p>One problem with GDP is that \u2013 as was noted in an excellent article in t<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21697845-gross-domestic-product-gdp-increasingly-poor-measure-prosperity-it-not-even\">he Economist earlier this year</a> \u2013 it doesn\u2019t count a lot of work and production in the economy (such as unpaid labour) and what it does count is often hard to measure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/02/the-global-economic-growth-funk\">Has the global economic growth malaise become the 'new normal'?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if we use a per-capita figure to take account of population increases we can still arrive at a growth figure that doesn\u2019t seem to gel with our day-to-day experience.</p> <p>And the less a figure reflects what the people in that economy experience, the less valuable it becomes \u2013 especially when trying to engender confidence.</p> <p>One problem is that GDP \u2013 even per capita \u2013 is a measure of output which doesn\u2019t say a heck of a lot about people\u2019s incomes, and certainly nothing about inequality. We don\u2019t get a share of GDP per capita in our bank accounts (if you did, in the past 12 months you would have $68,523).</p> <p>So rather than just measure output, the ABS also tries to measure \u201cnational economic wellbeing\u201d using \u201creal net national disposable income\u201d. In effect, this tries to look at how economic growth translates into income.</p> <p>And right now there is a historic disparity between output and income:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of GDP and national disposable income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ml4RP/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the past 12 months GDP per capita grew by 1.8%, while real net national disposable income per capita fell by 2.4%. </p> <p>Only three times in the past 40 years has income growth been so far below GDP growth \u2013 in December last year and in two quarters during the global financial crisis.</p> <p>It helps explain why GDP doesn\u2019t seem like a true reflection of the economy people are actually experiencing.</p> <p>GDP is made up of consumption, government expenditure, investment and exports minus imports (net exports).</p> <p>Consumption, government expenditure and investment combined is called \u201cdomestic final demand\u201d, and here again we are seeing a large disparity between it and GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of GDP and demand\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oBR2F/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since the end of 2012, domestic final demand has been growing by less than 2% \u2013 a level not usually observed outside of a recession.</p> <p>So why aren\u2019t we in a recession? </p> <p>Because of exports and imports.</p> <p>As I noted at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/02/strong-growth-surprises-markets-and-workers-seeing-their-wages-shrink\">the time</a>, GDP growth in the March quarter was effectively all due to net exports. But it is worth remembering that \u201cnet exports\u201d is the sum of our exports minus our imports.</p> <p>If we import less, that actually leads to a better GDP figure because less money is going out of the country. But when the volume of imports falls, that often means the domestic economy is actually weak \u2013 that was certainly the case during the financial crisis:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of exports and imports (volume)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UNQAe/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In June 2009, \u201cnet-export\u201d growth kept Australia from having two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, but 70% of that growth was due to a fall in imports.</p> <p>Essentially, because the economy looked like it was going to hell, businesses massively scaled back their orders for imported goods and capital equipment. As a result, GDP improved and we didn\u2019t go into a \u201ctechnical\u201d recession.</p> <p>At the moment imports are pretty flat, and exports are doing well \u2013 so it\u2019s a good kind of net-export growth. But not all exports are equal, and in this case the export growth is not all good news. </p> <p>At the moment our major export prices have been falling, so we\u2019re seeing the volume of exports increasing (which helps real GDP growth), but the actual money we\u2019re getting for those exports is falling (which hurts income growth):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual growth of exports\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/T5YXH/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The other problem with mining exports is that not only are they not delivering an income boost, they are effectively the results of production from a decade ago \u2013 so the jobs that led to the boom in exports have come and are already gone. </p> <p>Gone as well are the profits and the resultant company tax. Company profits from the start of 2002 to the start of 2009 grew on average by 12.5% each year; since 2012 they have fallen on average by 2.5%. So this is the part of the mining boom that doesn\u2019t see a boom in government revenue. </p> <p>And yet, because of the volume of exports, the mining industry remains the most important industry for GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions to GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DpVGP/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the past four years it has easily been the biggest contributor to GDP growth, and yet in the same period it has shed 40,000 jobs (about 15% of its workforce).</p> <p>The second most important industry over the past four years for GDP growth has been the financial and insurance industry \u2013 an industry that employs less than 4% of all workers. </p> <p>And here again the contribution of the industry demonstrates the disconnect of GDP with people\u2019s experience of the economy.</p> <p>A major part of the \u201coutput\u201d of the finance sector that counts towards GDP is arrived at via a calculation that involves imputing the gap between the interest charged on loans and the interest banks pay on deposits. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, as the debt held by Australians has grown, so too has the \u201cimportance\u201d of the financial sector to GDP growth.
