      "bodyText": "Tory MPs are calling for Sir Victor Blank and Sir James Crosby to be stripped of their knighthoods for their roles in the merger of Lloyds and HBOS at the height of the financial crisis. As Downing Street confirmed that the rules would be relaxed to allow peers to be expelled from the House of Lords, senior Tories said the former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin should be the first of many bankers to be stripped of their knighthoods. Goodwin was deprived of his on Tuesday after a report into the near collapse of RBS by the Financial Services Authority criticised him for excessive risk-taking. Michael Fallon, the deputy chairman of the Conservative party, who is close to George Osborne, raised the prospect of a similar move against executives in Lloyds-HBOS after the FSA completes a report into the takeover. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether other bankers should be stripped of their honours, Fallon said: \"There is going to a report now from the FSA into the HBOS-Lloyds disintegration. So who knows what will follow from that?\" Blank was chairman of Lloyds TSB when it merged with HBOS in 2009.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A leading architect of the austerity programme in Greece \u2013 one of the harshest ever seen in Europe \u2013 has admitted that its emphasis on fiscal consolidation has failed to work, and said economic recovery will only come if the crisis-hit country changes tack and focuses on structural reforms. Poul Thomsen, a senior International Monetary Fund official who oversees the organisation's mission in Greece, also insists that, contrary to popular belief, Athens has achieved a lot since the eruption of the debt crisis in December 2009. \"We will have to slow down a little as far as fiscal adjustment is concerned and move faster \u2013 much faster \u2013 with the reforms needed to modernise the economy,\" he told the Greek daily Kathimerini, adding that the policy shift would be \"reflected\" in the conditions foreign lenders attached to a new rescue programme for Athens. In an extraordinary departure from the script the IMF has followed to date, the Danish official, who is also in charge of the IMF programme in place in Portugal, acknowledged there was a \"limit\" to what society could endure. \"While Greece certainly will have to continue to reduce its fiscal deficits, we want to ensure \u2013 considering that social tolerance and political support have their limitations \u2013 that we strike the right balance between fiscal consolidation and reforms,\" he said. As such, the IMF had cautioned against \"an excessive pace\" of fiscal reduction. Dispelling suggestions that negotiations were fraught between the Greek government and the EU, ECB and IMF \u2013 the \"troika\" of creditors \u2013 Thomsen said talks over a new aid package would be \"completed very soon; it is a matter of days\". Athens's first financial lifeline \u2013 a \u20ac110bn bailout granted in May 2010 \u2013 relied heavily on belt-tightening measures that included hefty tax rises and across-the-board wage and pension cuts. Although the policies helped bring down Greece's primary deficit from \u20ac24.7bn in 2009 to just over \u20ac5bn in 2011, they have proved to be explosive, prompting unprecedented social unrest and a recession of a size not seen since the second world war. The Greek economy is projected to contract by over 5% this year; GDP has fallen almost 16% over the past three years. The new bailout programme will concentrate more on spending cuts, with the finance ministry announcing that \u20ac4.4bn will be saved by reining in expenditure on welfare and defence. Loss-making state utilities will also be shut. But on Wednesday, experts said the policy switch would only work if more rescue funds were pumped into the programme, which currently stands at \u20ac130bn. A deal to restructure Greece's \u20ac350bn debt \u2013 due to be announced by the end of the week \u2013 would also be vital, they said. Greek officials have repeatedly blamed the worse-than-expected recession on missed fiscal targets, arguing that further wage cuts, demanded in the name of boosting competitiveness, would serve only to exacerbate the downturn. Yet while foreign lenders have often levelled criticism at Greece for failing to implement long-overdue economic and structural reforms, Thomsen conceded that the time had come to show more \"sensitivity\". \"I share the frustration of many Greek officials that much of the criticism from abroad overlooks the fact that Greece has done a lot, at a great cost to the population. While much still needs to be done, Greece has already come quite a long way. Failing to recognise this will not help mobilise support for the programme. \"In this regard, I think that officials \u2013 myself included \u2013 need perhaps to be more sensitive to ensuring that we send a balanced signal when we say that the programme is off-track,\" Thomsen said.",

Warning that Britain was on course for a double-dip recession this winter, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said: \"The case for a significant short-term fiscal stimulus to boost the economy is stronger than it was a year ago.\" At the time of the 2011 budget, the IFS was against any let-up in George Osborne's deficit reduction plan, but on Wednesday the thinktank's director, Paul Johnson, said he was now \"sitting firmly on the fence\". Johnson said there was still a need to repair the fiscal damage caused to the economy by the deep recession of 2008-09, but that he would not be critical if the chancellor announced a package of tax cuts or increased spending worth \u00a310bn on budget day, 21 March. The IFS director added, however, that \u00a310bn of fiscal easing would only be a small boost to the economy, while a more aggressive loosening \u2013 worth \u00a315bn or more \u2013 would run the risk of unsettling the financial markets. A Treasury spokesman said: \"The IFS say that tackling the deficit is necessary; that without the government's deficit plan borrowing would be much higher; and that any fiscal stimulus big enough to make a difference would undermine investor confidence and so risk higher interest rates.\" Osborne believes that it is the Bank of England that should be responsible for boosting economic activity in the short term, and that the credibility of the Treasury's deficit-reduction programme allows the Bank's monetary policy committee to keep the interest rate, which is currently 0.5%, lower than it would otherwise have to be. But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The independent IFS is right to say that the case for short-term action on jobs and growth, for example through the temporary tax cuts Labour has been calling for, is now stronger \u2013 and will get stronger still if the eurozone crisis deepens. \"But rather than waiting for things to get even worse, George Osborne should take urgent action in next month's budget. Years of slow growth and high unemployment are not just bad for families and for the deficit, but also risk permanent damage to our economy. \"We agree with the IFS that the best form of stimulus would be a temporary cut in VAT, a cut in national insurance contributions for employers and additional infrastructure spending, which are three of the five elements in Labour's plan for jobs and growth.\" In its annual \"green budget\", which analyses the state of the economy and the public finances, the IFS said lower-than-forecast Whitehall spending would mean that the chancellor would need to borrow \u00a3124bn this year, \u00a33bn less than he estimated in the autumn statement in November 2011. By 2016-17, borrowing will be \u00a39bn lower, providing the chancellor with more fiscal flexibility at the time of the 2015 election. The IFS warned, however, that work on repairing the \u00a3114bn \"black hole\" in the government's finances had only just begun. It said that 75% of the austerity programme was still to come, including 88% of the benefit cuts and 94% of the reductions in departmental spending. \"The sheer scale of the cuts is daunting and almost without historical or international precedent\", the IFS said. Oxford Economics, which produces forecasts for the green budget, said the economy would grow by just 0.3% in 2012, lower than the official estimate of 0.7% made by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. It added that risks were heavily skewed to the downside, and predicted that a breakup of the eurozone involving five countries would send the UK spiralling back into a deep recession that would see output fall in both 2012 and 2013. The IFS said it doubted whether the chancellor would implement a \"significant net giveaway\" in the budget next month unless the economy was in much worse shape than it had been at the time of last November's autumn statement. It added that Osborne could recycle the \u00a33bn under-spending by Whitehall departments during 2011-12 into higher infrastructure investment in 2012-13. \"This would represent a modest fiscal loosening that could be easily explained to the markets and therefore would be relatively risk-free,\" the IFS said.",

    "webTitle": "The IFS economic forecast: one silver lining, five heavy black clouds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A broken-backed economy with devastated public finances and a long, hard slog ahead. That's a brief summary of what the Institute for Fiscal Studies was saying in its \"green budget\", which sketches out the options for the chancellor in this year's budget and beyond. Before looking at the bad news \u2013 of which there is plenty \u2013 it's worth mentioning the one or two snippets of good news. George Osborne has exercised such control over his cabinet spending colleagues that they are on course to spend \u00a33bn less this year than the chancellor had allowed for. By 2016-17, borrowing will be \u00a39bn lower than the projections made by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility last November. At the election, due to be held in 2015, Osborne may have a bit more wiggle-room for some vote-winning sweeteners. The rest of the IFS report, though, is not for the faint-hearted. Concern number one relates to the enormous cost of the recession of 2008-09, which has cost \u00a3200bn in output lost for ever. Concern number two is that a second period of retrenchment is now under way, with the co-authors of the IFS report, Oxford Economics, predicting a double-dip recession in early 2012 and growth of just 0.3% for the year as a whole. An economy that suffered as big a collapse as that in the UK would normally bounce back quickly and strongly. The dependence of the UK on debt-driven growth in the financial and housing sectors has been brutally exposed, as has the impact of high inflation in an era when wages have been depressed. Concern number three is that the public finances are in a terrible mess. The IFS calculates that since the financial crisis and recession began, a \u00a3114bn black hole has opened up, and because of the slowdown in the economy this is \u00a323bn bigger than estimated at the time of the 2011 March budget. By 2016-17, borrowing will be \u00a324bn \u2013 not much different from Alistair Darling's forecast in his last budget, despite the austerity measures introduced by the coalition. Faced with weakening activity, Osborne has been running to stand still. Concern number four is that the planned squeeze is unprecedented. The IFS delved into the record books to see whether there was anything comparable in the UK's history. There wasn't. They then looked at the records kept by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris to see if this sort of austerity had been tried anywhere else. With the possible exception of a three-year period of retrenchment in Ireland in the late 1980s, there hadn't. The IFS, in the light of that, wonders whether Osborne's plans are deliverable, particularly since the real pain is yet to begin on the spending side. While 73% of the tax increases have already come into force, only a third of the cuts in investment spending, 12% of the benefit reductions and 6% of the planned fall in non-investment public spending have taken effect. Concern number five is that things could turn out to be even worse than this. The baseline IFS/Oxford Economics forecasts are based on the assumption that the eurozone sorts out its problems. In the event of a break-up involving the five most vulnerable countries \u2013 Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy \u2013 the UK would be plunged back into a second deep recession within five years. John Walker of Oxford Economics described that prospect as \"challenging\". He added: \"By that we mean 'absolutely awful'.\" How will Osborne react to this? The IFS suggest that he should say publicly what he will do if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly, and that is sage advice. Keeping to the current plans with the economy crash-diving into recession would be economic suicide. On the immediate budget decision, the IFS was more equivocal. On the one hand it said the case for a fiscal boost was much stronger than a year ago.

      "body": "<p>A broken-backed economy with devastated public finances and a long, hard slog ahead. That's a brief summary of what the Institute for Fiscal Studies was saying in its \"green budget\", which sketches out the options for the chancellor in this year's budget and beyond.</p> <p>Before looking at the bad news \u2013 of which there is plenty \u2013 it's worth mentioning the one or two snippets of good news. George Osborne has exercised such control over his cabinet spending colleagues that they are on course to spend \u00a33bn less this year than the chancellor had allowed for. By 2016-17, borrowing will be \u00a39bn lower than the projections made by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility last November. At the election, due to be held in 2015, Osborne may have a bit more wiggle-room for some vote-winning sweeteners.</p> <p>The rest of the IFS report, though, is not for the faint-hearted. Concern number one relates to the enormous cost of the recession of 2008-09, which has cost \u00a3200bn in output lost for ever. Concern number two is that a second period of retrenchment is now under way, with the co-authors of the IFS report, Oxford Economics, predicting a double-dip recession in early 2012 and growth of just 0.3% for the year as a whole.</p> <p>An economy that suffered as big a collapse as that in the UK would normally bounce back quickly and strongly. The dependence of the UK on debt-driven growth in the financial and housing sectors has been brutally exposed, as has the impact of high inflation in an era when wages have been depressed.</p> <p>Concern number three is that the public finances are in a terrible mess. The IFS calculates that since the financial crisis and recession began, a \u00a3114bn black hole has opened up, and because of the slowdown in the economy this is \u00a323bn bigger than estimated at the time of the 2011 March budget. By 2016-17, borrowing will be \u00a324bn \u2013 not much different from Alistair Darling's forecast in his last budget, despite the austerity measures introduced by the coalition. Faced with weakening activity, Osborne has been running to stand still.</p> <p>Concern number four is that the planned squeeze is unprecedented. The IFS delved into the record books to see whether there was anything comparable in the UK's history. There wasn't. They then looked at the records kept by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris to see if this sort of austerity had been tried anywhere else. With the possible exception of a three-year period of retrenchment in Ireland in the late 1980s, there hadn't. The IFS, in the light of that, wonders whether Osborne's plans are deliverable, particularly since the real pain is yet to begin on the spending side. While 73% of the tax increases have already come into force, only a third of the cuts in investment spending, 12% of the benefit reductions and 6% of the planned fall in non-investment public spending have taken effect.</p> <p>Concern number five is that things could turn out to be even worse than this. The baseline IFS/Oxford Economics forecasts are based on the assumption that the eurozone sorts out its problems. In the event of a break-up involving the five most vulnerable countries \u2013 Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy \u2013 the UK would be plunged back into a second deep recession within five years. John Walker of Oxford Economics described that prospect as \"challenging\". He added: \"By that we mean 'absolutely awful'.\"</p> <p>How will Osborne react to this? The IFS suggest that he should say publicly what he will do if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly, and that is sage advice. Keeping to the current plans with the economy crash-diving into recession would be economic suicide. On the immediate budget decision, the IFS was more equivocal. On the one hand it said the case for a fiscal boost was much stronger than a year ago. On the other, it noted that the government has to sell the thick end of \u00a3750bn of gilts over the next five years, so it needs to keep the financial markets sweet.</p> <p>Osborne's inclination is for the Bank of England to use quantitative easing to underpin growth and would find a U-turn in next month's budget uncomfortable. But he has already been forced to downgrade his expectations in each budget and autumn statement since the election, and if the outlook continues to worsen he will eventually have no choice.</p>",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing rebound suggests recession could be averted", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government hopes that the latest UK economic downturn will prove to be a blip have been boosted by news that Britain's manufacturers enjoyed a strong start to 2012, as their output grew at the fastest pace in almost a year. Contrasting with a manufacturing slump that dragged down overall growth last quarter, the closely watched purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey for January was more upbeat than expected and was taken by some economists as evidence recession can still be averted. The report suggested activity at Britain's factories had recovered in January to the strongest since last May and orders were rising. But their eurozone counterparts did not fare so well as they continued to battle fierce austerity measures and weakened confidence. A similar survey for the single currency area suggested manufacturers there continued to see activity and orders slowing. In the UK, the headline activity reading rose to 52.1 in January from 49.7 in December on the Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing PMI. That was well above the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion and stronger than a forecast for 50.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. The news that orders also rose for the first time in seven months brings some respite for the government after official data last week revealed the economy shrank 0.2% in the final months of 2011. Economists said the early signs from industry in 2012 suggested growth could rebound somewhat, avoiding recession, which is technically two consecutive quarters of contraction. \"Manufacturing was a key area of weakness which caused the UK economy to contract in the final quarter, so this surprising rebound in January means a return to recession is by no means a certainty,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit. The survey also showed output expanded at the fastest pace since last March, new orders rose following a period of contraction and employment numbers stabilised as large firms laid off staff but smaller manufacturers hired new workers. Cost pressures on manufacturers continued to ease, as average input prices fell for the third straight month. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas commented: \"We believe that the UK will avoid recession and post some positive, if moderate, growth in the first quarter... It's clearly early days, but the outlook for the economy has distinctly improved over the last few months.\" As UK manufacturers are urged by politicians and lobby groups to look beyond traditional trading partners in the troubled eurozone, there were modest signs of demand further afield picking up. Manufacturers reported improved orders from clients in Brazil, China, the Middle East and the US. But with manufacturing making up just 10.2% of the UK economy, analysts said a report on the dominant services sector due on Friday would be more telling for the overall UK outlook. There were also concerns that headwinds from the eurozone show little sign of easing. PMI surveys from the eurozone on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity there declined for a sixth straight month in January. In Germany, business improved in the sector, but that was not enough to offset contraction elsewhere in the region. Output rose but new order levels continued to decline and Markit's eurozone manufacturing PMI remained well within contraction territory at 48.8, up from December's 46.9. UK-based economists said that the strains in the eurozone, and signs inflation is easing, left the door open for the Bank of England to pump more money into the economy when it announces its latest policy moves next week. Such an extension of the Bank's quantitative easing (QE) programme is widely expected but policymakers could choose to raise it by a little less than previously expected following the upbeat manufacturing report. \"The consensus is split between an additional \u00a350bn or a \u00a375bn instalment of QE,\" said Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank. \"This survey, in conjunction with the firming survey data in the eurozone, suggests that the lower of the two is more likely and there could even be speculation that the Bank might sit on its hands.\"",

      "body": "<h2>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The purchasing managers survey indicates that life got better for UK manufacturers at the start of 2012 after a pretty dismal end to 2011. Not only does the survey show output rising at the fastest rate for 10 months but also orders grew for the first time in seven months. This suggests that there is a very decent chance that the manufacturing sector will return to growth in the first quarter of 2012 after contributing significantly to overall GDP contraction of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, whether or not the UK can avoid further contraction in the first quarter will depend mainly on what happens to services output and consumer spending.</p> <p>Manufacturers still face very challenging domestic and international conditions, so it remains to be seen whether they can build on their improved start to 2012.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there was some good news on the inflation front, with input prices falling for a third month running and output prices rises at the slowest rate for 27 months. This supports belief that consumer price inflation is headed down substantially further over the coming months and facilitates further Bank of England quantitative easing in February.</p> <h2>James Knightley, senior economist at ING</h2> <p>The UK manufacturing PMI has come in strong, offering some encouragement that the likely recession may not be as deep as some analysts fear. The headline index has rebounded to 52.2 in January from 49.7 in December, leaving the index at its highest level since April last year. Importantly, new orders rose to their highest level since March last year, which bodes well for production data in the next couple of months. The report also states that there has been an increase in the willingness of businesses to spend, thereby potentially offering hope for investment and hiring. Nonetheless, with consumer spending still accounting for nearly two thirds of UK GDP, we still predict a negative quarter of growth in the first quarter of 2012, which would confirm a technical recession.</p> <h2>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>January's UK CIPS report on manufacturing adds to evidence that the industrial recovery got back on track at the start of 2012. The rise in the overall PMI from 49.7 to 52.1 \u2013 its highest level in eight months \u2013 was driven by a sharp increase in the survey's output balance from 50.2 to 55.8. On the basis of past form, the output balance is now consistent with quarterly growth in manufacturing output of close to 1%. Accordingly, the CIPS survey supports the upbeat message painted by last week's CBI industrial trends survey, which pointed to a similar rate of growth. Nonetheless, there are signs that this quite rapid growth will not be sustained. For a start, stocks of finished goods reportedly rose for the first time in April 2008. In addition, the new export orders balance fell back from 53.4 to 51.0, suggesting that overall growth is now largely dependent on domestic demand. But with consumer and investment spending likely to struggle this year, we doubt that this will provide a sustainable foundation for growth in the year ahead.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>We have some very good news from the UK manufacturing PMI for January. The headline index 'soared' to 52.1, up from 49.7 in December. That was the highest index since April 2011 and well above the market expectation.</p> <p>In the detail, the output index rose to a 10-month high, as new orders rose from both domestic and foreign buyers.

This number supports our view. It's clearly early days, but the outlook for the economy has distinctly improved over the last few months. While we don't expect that to be sufficient for the MPC to question the wisdom of more QE in February, if it continues it will draw into focus the possibility that a further extension beyond that will start to look less likely.</p> <h2>Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation</h2> <p>The one positive for manufacturing from last week's GDP data was that output expanded modestly in December, with growth appearing to have continued into the new year indicating modest expansion in the sector. Whilst this is not a return to the strong growth seen earlier in the recovery it is a rebuttal to fears that manufacturing is sliding backwards with the mood in the sector being one of cautious optimism.</p> <h2>Michael Saunders, economist at Citi</h2> <p>The rise in this index, if confirmed in other readings in coming weeks and months, hints that the UK may escape a renewed recession, having already had a decline in GDP in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, in our view it would be premature to conclude that the economy is out of the woods.</p> <p>It must be stressed that even if the economy does not shrink further, the current recession/recovery cycle is already worse than those of the 1930s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s and indeed is the UK's worst of the last 100 years, excluding the first and second world wars.</p> <p>Moreover, the economy continues to face powerful headwinds, with UK private debts still very high, marked weakness in the euro area and many years of public spending cuts ahead in the UK. Sizeable further job losses remain likely in both the private and public sectors. The case for further monetary stimulus in the UK does not rest on whether the economy goes into renewed recession or not, but is driven by the prospect of (a) sluggish growth (at best) after the deep downturn that already has occurred; and (b) a sharp drop in inflation.</p> <h2>Blerina Uruci, economist at Barclays Capital </h2> <p>The improvement in the new orders measure was mainly a result of increased domestic demand, while the export orders sub-index fell to 50.9 (from 53.4).
