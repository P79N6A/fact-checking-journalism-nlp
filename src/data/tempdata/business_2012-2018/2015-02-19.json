Around 2.6 million are thought to meet the criteria, which includes being a member for three years and meeting a threshold of expenditure. This is described as a one-member-one-vote system, which replaces the current system of members\u2019 views being heard through approximately100 elected delegates. The May annual meeting \u2013 just days after the general election \u2013 is also the moment when members will vote on the long-standing contributions to the Co-operative party, whose 31 MPs sit alongside those from Labour in Westminster. The wording of the motion on which members will vote has not yet been published but follows a survey conducted by the previous boss, Euan Sutherland, which asked: \u201cTo what extent do you think it is appropriate or inappropriate for big businesses to donate money to political parties?\u201d The Co-op party is launching a campaign to win support for the ongoing donations which amount to \u00a3625,000, approximately 75% of its funding. Karin Christiansen, general secretary of the Co-op party, intends to spell out the successes of the party \u2013 which has been linked to Labour since the 1920s \u2013 in setting policy and changing laws. The campaign \u2013 Keep it Co-op \u2013 is asking members of the supermarket and funeral home business to back a statement saying they support the idea of the Co-op movement being about changing society for the better. \u201cThe Co-op movement is getting incredible value out of the relationship,\u201d said Christiansen. \u201cThe Co-op party, though, needs to explain itself more clearly and demonstrate how it can help co-operative businesses.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s about the value of keeping a political voice.\u201d Among the policies that the Co-op party said it has influenced over the years are consumer protection, winning financial support for credit unions, cracking down on payday lenders and founding 800 co-operative schools. \u201cThis is partly about being able to talk to people. We\u2019ve not really had the ability to do that. This is about the purpose of the movement,\u201d said Christiansen. Leighton did not give a view on the current link to the Co-op party. He is preparing to step down as chief executive of the Pandora jewellery brand next month and received a \u00a33.4m payoff after moving from chairman to chief executive in July 2013.",

    "webTitle": "Germany rejects Greece request for loan extension", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany and Greece are on a collision course ahead of crucial bailout talks on Friday after Berlin knocked back a Greek compromise proposal and insisted the country stick to its existing austerity plan. Setting the scene for a make-or-break meeting in Brussels , the eurozone\u2019s largest economy dismissed as \u201cnot substantive\u201d a proposal from Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis,which appeared to have all but capitulated to creditors\u2019 demands. The rebuff from Berlin came just hours after Greece filed a formal request to its eurozone partners to extend its loan agreement, in the hope of averting a cash crisis. A Greek government spokesman insisted that the eurogroup had only two options: either to accept or reject the Greek request. \u201cIt will then be clear who wants to find a solution and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d The European commission welcomed the Greek proposal \u2013 widely seen as a climbdown on some of Greece\u2019s key demands \u2013 as a positive sign that could pave the way for compromise. But in a sign of divisions within the EU, Germany said the Greek plan failed to meet eurozone ministers\u2019 demands that Greece stick to its bailout programme \u2013 a set of conditions laid out on Monday at an acrimonious meeting in Brussels that failed to end the deadlock. Greece needs unanimous backing from the other 18 eurozone finance ministers to secure a deal. \u201cThe letter from Athens is not a proposal that leads to a substantial solution,\u201d finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said. \u201cIn truth it goes in the direction of a bridge financing, without fulfilling the demands of the programme. The letter does not meet the criteria agreed by the Eurogroup on Monday.\u201d Germany\u2019s rejection heightened the uncertainty around Friday\u2019s meeting, which will be the eurozone\u2019s third attempt in 10 days to resolve a standoff that has sent jitters across the continent at the prospect of a messy Greek exit from the single currency. One source said: \u201cI am sort of asking, what the fuck, are they [ministers] really going to come again and have no agreement.\u201d The source said everyone hoped for an agreement, but added: \u201cThere has not been much support [for the plan], it seems Greece will find it difficult.\u201d Others expect a compromise will be found at the last minute. \u201cProbably the Greeks will move but there is going to be more negotiation needed to find an agreement,\u201d said another source. The Greek government, which is under fire from radical ultra-leftists for making the loan application, described the latest proposal as a way to deal with the country\u2019s \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d and kickstart the economy. But the request was widely viewed as a climbdown by the Greek government. In an effort to break the impasse in advance of Friday\u2019s meeting of euro group finance ministers \u2013 their third this week \u2013 the Greek prime minister AlexisTsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the crisis for almost an hour late Thursday evening. Officials in Athens described the talks - interpreted by official translators and not conducted in English - as \u201cconstructive,\u201d saying both had conveyed the desire to find a solution. Merkel, they added, had assumed a more conciliatory stance than her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble. The German chancellorhas repeatedly said she wants Greece to remain in the single currency. Earlier, Tsipras spoke with the French and Italian leaders. The French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was also quoted in the Greek media as saying he was willing to support Athens. In a letter to Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the eurozone finance ministers\u2019 group, obtained by Reuters, Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, conceded that the Greek authorities would \u201crefrain from unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets, economic recovery and financial stability\u201d. Crucially, he said Greece would remain under the supervision of the European commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2013 the unpopular troika that the Syriza-led government had insisted it would throw off. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the Greek plan represented \u201creasonable progress\u201d in meeting the demands of the Eurogroup; while the head of the European Trade Union Confederation accused Germany of \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by rejecting the Greek compromise. \u201cGermany is demanding unconditional surrender from a proud people that has elected a new Government on a crystal clear platform of easing austerity,\u201d said ETUC\u2019s general secretary, Bernadette S\u00e9gol. Aides to the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted that the loan request respected the popular will of the Greek people. Calling it an \u201cinterim agreement,\u201d insiders said the request was significant for raising the issue of debt restructuring and including a pledge from the new government to keep to a balanced budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you get left-leaning governments making those sort of commitments,\u201d said one Greek official. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly sought to strike a very fine balance between tackling the humanitarian disaster and promising to be a government that will not only tackle corruption and tax evasion, the malfunctions of Greek society, but take on all the vested interests that plague political and business life.\u201d In Berlin, the request from Greece for an extension of its loan agreement \u2013 known as the \u201cmaster financial assistance facility agreement\u201d \u2013 is seen very differently. \u201cThe Greeks have simply tried to pass the buck back to the middle,\u201d Matthias Kullas from the Centre for European Politics in Freiburg said. He stressed the German reaction was not a rejection over reaching a compromise with Greece, but did mean that expectations of an agreement on Friday when finance ministers from the eurogroup meet again, were now \u201cslim\u201d. \u201cIf an agreement is reached, it will be at the last minute,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interest of both sides to stick to their guns. The earlier one of them diverts from his course, the weaker his position becomes and the more elbow room he leaves for the other.\u201d Raoul Ruparel, the head of economic research at Open Europe, said the Greek government had little chance of getting the rest of the eurozone to back its plans on labour market reforms, pensions and privatisations. In a briefing paper published before Greece\u2019s latest request was rejected by Germany, he said the eurozone could give way on another one of Greece\u2019s key demands, to allow the government to run a smaller budget surplus, so freeing up money for social spending. \u201cThe Greek election represented a tipping point, meaning that the rest of the eurozone will have to consider some tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote. A spokesperson for the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the letter was a positive sign that could pave the way for a reasonable compromise. Hopes of ending Greece\u2019s standoff with the eurozone pushed Greece\u2019s stock market up by nearly 3% on Thursday. The mood of investors was also boosted by the decision of the European Central Bank to allow Greece a further \u20ac3.3bn in emergency liquidity, bringing the total ECB help to Greek banks to \u20ac68.3bn.",

The letter does not meet the criteria agreed by the Eurogroup on Monday.\u201d</p> <p>Germany\u2019s rejection heightened the uncertainty around Friday\u2019s meeting, which will be the eurozone\u2019s third attempt in 10 days to resolve a standoff that has sent jitters across the continent at the prospect of a messy Greek exit from the single currency.</p> <p>One source said: \u201cI am sort of asking, what the fuck, are they [ministers] really going to come again and have no agreement.\u201d<br></p> <p> The source said everyone hoped for an agreement, but added: \u201cThere has not been much support [for the plan], it seems Greece will find it difficult.\u201d </p> <p>Others expect a compromise will be found at the last minute. \u201cProbably the Greeks will move but there is going to be more negotiation needed to find an agreement,\u201d said another source.</p> <p>The Greek government, which is under fire from radical ultra-leftists for making the loan application, described the latest proposal as a way to deal with the country\u2019s \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d and kickstart the economy. <br></p> <p>But the request was widely viewed as a climbdown by the Greek government.</p> <p>In an effort to break the impasse in advance of Friday\u2019s meeting of euro group finance ministers \u2013 their third this week \u2013 the Greek prime minister AlexisTsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the crisis for almost an hour late Thursday evening.</p> <p>Officials in Athens described the talks - interpreted by official translators and not conducted in English - as \u201cconstructive,\u201d saying both had conveyed the desire to find a solution.</p> <p>Merkel, they added, had assumed a more conciliatory stance than her finance minister Wolfgang Schauble. The German chancellorhas repeatedly said she wants Greece to remain in the single currency.</p> <p>Earlier, Tsipras spoke with the French and Italian leaders. The French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was also quoted in the Greek media as saying he was willing to support Athens. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/19/eurozone-greece-request-idUSL5N0VT2S720150219\">letter to Jeroen Dijsselbloem</a>, president of the eurozone finance ministers\u2019 group, obtained by Reuters, Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, conceded that the Greek authorities would \u201crefrain from unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets, economic recovery and financial stability\u201d.</p> <p>Crucially, he said Greece would remain under the supervision of the European commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2013 the unpopular troika that the Syriza-led government had insisted it would throw off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2015/feb/19/greece-to-seek-bailout-extension-after-33bn-lifeline\">Greece seeks six-month bailout extension - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the Greek plan represented \u201creasonable progress\u201d in meeting the demands of the Eurogroup; while the head of the European Trade Union Confederation accused Germany of \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by rejecting the Greek compromise.</p> <p> \u201cGermany is demanding unconditional surrender from a proud people that has elected a new Government on a crystal clear platform of easing austerity,\u201d said ETUC\u2019s general secretary, Bernadette S\u00e9gol.</p> <p> Aides to the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted that the loan request respected the popular will of the Greek people.</p> <p>Calling it an \u201cinterim agreement,\u201d insiders said the request was significant for raising the issue of debt restructuring and including a pledge from the new government to keep to a balanced budget.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you get left-leaning governments making those sort of commitments,\u201d said one Greek official. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve clearly sought to strike a very fine balance between tackling the humanitarian disaster and promising to be a government that will not only tackle corruption and tax evasion, the malfunctions of Greek society, but take on all the vested interests that plague political and business life.\u201d</p> <p>In Berlin, the request from Greece for an extension of its loan agreement \u2013 known as the \u201cmaster financial assistance facility agreement\u201d \u2013 is seen very differently.</p> <p> \u201cThe Greeks have simply tried to pass the buck back to the middle,\u201d Matthias Kullas from the Centre for European Politics in Freiburg said.<br></p> <p>He stressed the German reaction was not a rejection over reaching a compromise with Greece, but did mean that expectations of an agreement on Friday when finance ministers from the eurogroup meet again, were now \u201cslim\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf an agreement is reached, it will be at the last minute,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interest of both sides to stick to their guns. The earlier one of them diverts from his course, the weaker his position becomes and the more elbow room he leaves for the other.\u201d</p> <p> Raoul Ruparel, the head of economic research at Open Europe, said the Greek government had little chance of getting the rest of the eurozone to back its plans on labour market reforms, pensions and privatisations.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/what-deal-could-be-struck-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone/\">briefing paper</a> published before Greece\u2019s latest request was rejected by Germany, he said the eurozone could give way on another one of Greece\u2019s key demands, to allow the government to run a smaller budget surplus, so freeing up money for social spending. \u201cThe Greek election represented a tipping point, meaning that the rest of the eurozone will have to consider some tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p> A spokesperson for the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the letter was a positive sign that could pave the way for a reasonable compromise. </p> <p>Hopes of ending Greece\u2019s standoff with the eurozone pushed Greece\u2019s stock market up by nearly 3% on Thursday. The mood of investors was also boosted by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/18/greece-lifeline-ecb-agrees-extra-emergency-funds\"> the decision of the European Central Bank to allow Greece a further \u20ac3.3bn in emergency liquidity</a>, bringing the total ECB help to Greek banks to \u20ac68.3bn.</p>",

This year\u2019s expansion plans are in sharp contrast to Asda\u2019s major rival Tesco, which is shutting stores and selling off development sites. Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have also reined in expansion. Asda plans to open six large superstores, 11 supermarkets and 36 petrol station outlets in the year ahead as well as adding more than 150 new locations where shoppers can pick up groceries ordered online. \u201cWhether they are 50,000 sq ft or 10,000 sq ft, the majority of customers still want to come and do their shop in a store,\u201d said Andy Clarke, Asda\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe have fewer large stores and an opportunity to open more supermarkets than some of our competitors.\u201d He said Asda was particularly keen on opening stores in the south of England and London. The supermarket is also reworking its logo, introducing a sunshine element and the slogan \u201cSave money. Live better\u201d \u2013 which is used by its parent company, Walmart. The new company slogan replaces Asda\u2019s \u201csaving you money every day\u201d line which has been in place for six years. In a tough market that Clarke said was going through \u201cone of its most challenging and changeable periods in history\u201d, Asda said total sales rose 0.5% for the year to 4 January after it opened 17 new stores. Profits rose by about the same amount. But underlying sales, which exclude new store openings, fell by 1% \u2013 the first annual decline since 2008. The figures were dragged down by a difficult final three months of the year when sales at established stores fell 2.6%. Asda blamed heavy use of discount vouchers for a significant step-down in performance from the 1.6% fall it recorded in the previous quarter. The key Christmas period put Asda ahead of Morrisons, where sales fell by 3.1% in the six weeks to 4 January, but behind Tesco \u2013 where sales fell 0.3% over almost exactly the same period \u2013 and Sainsbury\u2019s, where sales fell 1.7% in the three months to 3 January. \u201cI am pleased with a solid performance in an incredibly difficult market,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cThe pace of change accelerated in 2014 and will continue in 2015 which will be a very challenging year.\u201d Clarke said the step-down in performance was a result of Asda\u2019s refusal to follow its rivals by sending out thousands of discount vouchers and reflected \u201ca competitive market where retailers took a decision to drive unprofitable sales\u201d. He said this year, and potentially next, would continue to be very tough for grocery retailers. But Clarke said he would not be diverted by \u201ckneejerk short-term decisions\u201d and \u201cgimmicks\u201d. Analysts said Asda\u2019s performance was disappointing and it was losing market share, as Tesco and Morrisons appeared to be undergoing a revival. \u201cWith both of its key competitors regrouping, Asda may find the going quite challenging in the year ahead,\u201d said Clive Black of Shore Capital. Asda cut prices by \u00a3300m last year and plans to invest at least \u00a3700m in more cuts over the next four years. The supermarket claims it is now at least 8% cheaper than its \u201cbig four\u201d rivals and has halved the price gap with discounters to 10% over the last two years.",

After months of negotiations, a consortium led by Axa Real Estate has clinched a \u00a3300m deal to buy the site near Liverpool Street station in the Square Mile. The building became known as \u201cthe Stump\u201d when construction stopped abruptly three years ago. Until now called the Pinnacle, the building will be renamed 22 Bishopsgate. Its design has undergone radical changes to save money. The office tower will be 60 storeys rather than the originally planned 64, and the expensive curved-glass panels at the top are to be scrapped. It will however be the tallest building in the financial district at 262m, overtopping the nearby Heron Tower at 231 metres tall (758ft). Construction on the Pinnacle began in 2008 but stalled in 2012 when funding dried up, leaving a seven-storey shell. Developer Lipton Rogers has been brought in to remove the stump and build a new tower, taking over the reins from Australian contractor Brookfield Multiplex. The new design means a fresh planning application will have to be submitted. If planning issues remain, it could take a further 18 months to gain consent, ensuring the tower would not be finished until 2018. Around \u00a3400m has already been spent on the Pinnacle, meaning the total spend could reach \u00a31bn. The French firm Axa\u2019s property arm, along with Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings, a Middle Eastern and a North American investor, have bought the site from a consortium of Middle Eastern investors. The group \u2013 Arab Investments, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund Sedco and Kuwaiti fund Wafra \u2013 will retain an interest in the top floors of the building. The Axa consortium has appointed PLP Architecture, a firm set up by Lee Polisano, Karen Cook and other architects who left US architects Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, where they worked on the Pinnacle\u2019s original design. PLP has also designed part of Land Securities\u2019 \u00a32.2bn project to transform the area north of London\u2019s Victoria station. A rival consortium, which lost out to the Axa team, stuck closer to the original design and would not have needed new planning permission, which would have hastened construction. A number of other towers have been built in the City in recent years, including the building nicknamed the Cheesegrater on Leadenhall Street and the Walkie Talkie on Fenchurch Street, and the Shard across the river \u2013 western Europe\u2019s tallest building. Brookfield has embarked on another office scheme in the City, a two-tower building at 100 Bishopsgate close to the stalled Pinnacle site. Axa Real Estate has been involved in several other large-scale projects in the capital. It built 60 Holborn Viaduct and let it out to Amazon. It is also developing Google\u2019s new \u00a3650m UK headquarters behind Kings Cross station, which is due to start construction later this year.",

Other major European markets - apart from the FTSE 100 - are up slightly (by less than 1%) on hopes that a Greek deal can still be struck. The FTSE is down slightly by 0.1% at 6,888.62. Thank you for reading the blog today and for all your comments. Please join us again tomorrow when we will be bringing you coverage of the crucial eurogroup meeting of finance ministers in Brussels. AM Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent, brings us more on Germany\u2019s rejection of Greek proposals: Schauble continues to insist that Greece sticks to the bailout conditions agreed with previous governments under which financial support will be given only in exchange for substantial structural reforms. The finance ministry\u2019s position risks deepening splits within Europe over how to deal with Greece as an end of February deadline nears at which the previous bailout agreement with its creditors and the European Central Bank runs out, leaving Greece facing bankruptcy. In contrast to Berlin, the EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker welcomed the Greek application, saying in his opinion it could pave the way for a \u201csensible compromise in the interest of financial stability in the Eurozone as a whole\u201d. But experts said Greece was merely playing for time, and that its application had indeed contained no new commitments. \u201cThe Greeks have simply tried to pass the buck back to the middle,\u201d Matthias Kullas from the Centre for European Politics in Freiburg told The Guardian. He stressed the German reaction was not a rejection over reaching a compromise with Greece, but did mean that expectations of an agreement on Friday when finance ministers from the eurogroup meet again, were now \u201cslim\u201d. \u201cIf an agreement is reached, it will be at the last minute,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interest of both sides to stick to their guns. The earlier one of them diverts from his course, the weaker his position becomes and the more elbow room he leaves for the other.\u201d Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s says a Greek exit from the euro would have limited direct contagion frisks for other sovereigns. S&amp;P credit analyst Moritz Kraemer: All things considered, we believe that a Grexit would not lead to a degree of direct contagion that would drive other sovereigns out of the euro, not least because the eurozone rescue architecture is more robust than during the last Grexit scare in 2012. We believe that the financial burden of a Grexit on the remaining 18 eurozone sovereigns would be moderate and absorbed over decades, and we therefore do not expect that a Grexit, by itself, would have significant rating implications for these sovereign. S&amp;P says there are a number of reasons why the situation is less risky than it would have been in 2012. Reasons include: The eurozone now has the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which can financially support eurozone sovereigns under market pressure following a hypothetical Grexit. Greece\u2019s links with financial markets have been sufficiently reduced to make such a direct contagion less likely. The disparity between Greek sovereign bond yields and those of other eurozone sovereigns also suggests that investors consider that redenomination risk of other eurozone sovereigns is currently low. Whereas Greek sovereign debt yields have risen in recent months along with uncertainty about Greece\u2019s relationship with its lenders, bond yields of other so-called \u201cperiphery\u201d sovereigns (Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain) have fallen to all-time lows. Reuters says the message from Greece is that eurogroup finance ministers have two options tomorrow - accept the deal it has put on the table or reject it. 19-Feb-2015 14:29 - GREEK GOVT SAYS EUROGROUP TOMORROW HAS ONLY TWO OPTIONS, TO EITHER ACCEPT OR REJECT OFFER MADE BY GREECE TODAY 19-Feb-2015 14:30 - GREEK GOVT SAYS EUROGROUP\u2019S DECISION WILL SHOW WHO WANTS A SOLUTION AND WHO DOES NOT Helena Smith brings us this update from Athens: Eery silence from Greek officials on Germany\u2019s rejection of Athens\u2019 proposal. Insiders expressed surprise that officials had \u201chad the time\u201d to properly contemplate the request but refused to be drawn further. When the response comes it will come from the top, they said. Meanwhile, however, comments by former French president Valery Giscard d\u2019Estaing re Greece leaving the euro zone have caused some commotion. The former president, who worked hard to promote Greece\u2019s entry to the European Union described Athens\u2019 admission to the single currency in 2001 as \u201cevidently a mistake\u201d this morning and advocated that the debt-stricken now make a \u201cfriendly exit.\u201d One Greek official told me the former president\u2019s intervention was \u201cless than helpful at such a sensitive time. Old leaders should learn to shut up, he said. A reader has kindly pointed out an important typo in my 12.53 post on the euro. It should have read (and now does): Germany\u2019s tough stance on Greece (rejecting its bailout extension plan) has sent the euro lower, down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.13595. Apologies for the confusion. \u201cThe white flag has been raised over Athens\u201d according to Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor. He continues: Greece has bowed to the intense pressure of its eurozone partners and will stick to austerity. After defiantly saying for the past three weeks that it will end the country\u2019s fiscal waterboarding, the Syriza-led government is suing for peace. That, bluntly, is the only way to interpret news that Greece has formally asked for a six-month extension to its bailout agreement. There is no longer the pretence that the bailout is to be replaced by a loan agreement with no strings attached. The hated troika of the European Central Bank, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund will be monitoring Greece\u2019s economy for the next six months, something that has been anathema to Syriza until now. The Greek government has some demands of its own. It wants to negotiate a new growth deal for the four years until 2019. It is asking for debt relief under the terms of the bailout agreement signed in November 2012. And it wants to be able to take steps to deal with the humanitarian crisis caused by the 25% collapse in the size of the economy over the past five years. Read the full blog here. Developments in Greece have rather overshadowed the publication of the European Central Bank\u2019s first set of minutes (which can be found here). Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says there are few surprises in the report from the meeting held on 22 January, at which the ECB agreed a \u20ac1.1tn programme of quantitative easing. For one, the decision was not unanimous. McKeown comments: The first ever timely publication of ECB minutes confirms that support for the new QE programme was not unanimous and highlights the Bank\u2019s reluctance to take on more risk related to peripheral governments\u2019 debts. [The account] supports President Draghi\u2019s explanation last month that while all members backed the idea of QE, some were not ready to implement it now. Members\u2019 votes are not published. But we know from information leaked previously that executive board Member Sabine Lautenschlaeger and the heads of the German, Dutch and Austrian central banks were all opposed at this stage. The minutes also highlight discomfort with any policy that might appear to be bailing out indebted governments or that would put the ECB\u2019s balance sheet at greater risk. We already had a good idea of this \u2013 the Bank explained last month that QE would be done largely at the risk of national central banks. But the account states that the decision was made \u201cin view of concerns about moral hazard\u201d. Meanwhile, the decision to cap asset holdings at 33% of any individual government\u2019s outstanding bonds was taken partly to \u201cmitigate the risk of the ECB becoming a dominant creditor of euro area governments\u201d. Together with the Bank\u2019s decision yesterday to allow only a meagre increase in emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks, this makes clear that the ECB will not be riding to Greece\u2019s rescue. Germany\u2019s rejection of Greece\u2019s proposals is a reminder of how volatile and changeable the situation is. Kathleen Brooks, research director at forex.com: The Greek crisis remains fluid, and the situation continues to change on a daily basis. Yesterday, the outlook was bleak until the ECB stepped in a boosted its emergency lending assistance to Greek banks. Today, the situation improved further on the back of news that the eurgroup will meet on Friday , which is a sign that Greece may have shifted its negotiating position to a more eurogroup-friendly stance. However, excitement is being contained after Germany said it would reject the deal proposed by Greece in its current form. The Eurogroup meeting on Friday, the third in a week, comes after Greece requested a 6-month bailout extension. The good news is that, if approved, Greece will be able to pay back the EUR 21 billion of principal debt repayments that come due between now and August. The bad news, is that even if this extension is approved, we will be back in the same position in 6-months\u2019 time and Greece\u2019s long-term debt problems remain unsolved. In the longer term, the apparent U-turn by the Greek government seems at odds with Syriza\u2019s election pledge. This could put pressure on the new government to continue to demand a new bailout agreement without austerity conditions when the next round of Greek bailout negotiations come round sometime in the summer. Don\u2019t expect the Greek crisis to go away just because of any \u201cpositive\u201d developments in the next few days. Greek assets have been knocked off their highs on the back of the German comments that it rejects Greece\u2019s proposal, however 10-year yields remain below 10%. If the rest of the EU agrees with Greece\u2019s proposal, then surely Germany will have to acquiesce? If they do then expect European risk assets to stage a rally, if not, then we could see a sharp increase in risk aversion. Germany\u2019s tough stance on Greece (rejecting its bailout extension plan) has sent the euro lower, down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.13595. Greek shares are still up but to a lesser extent than earlier in the trading session. The ATG is up 0.8% at 854.17. Germany has thrown a major spanner in the works, rejecting the proposals put forward by Greece. Martin Jaeger, a spokesman for the German finance ministry, said in a statement: The letter from Athens is not a proposal that leads to a substantial solution. In truth it goes in the direction of a bridge financing, without fulfilling the demands of the programme. The letter does not meet the criteria agreed by the eurogroup on Monday. The European Commission has welcomed the bailout extension request from Greece, claiming it could pave the way for compromise and stability in the eurozone. A spokesman for Jean-Claude Juncker, EC President, said: President Juncker sees this letter as a positive sign which, in his assessment, could pave the way for a reasonable compromise in the interest of the financial stability in the euro as a whole. The detailed assessment of the letter and the response is now up to the eurogroup. Guardian reporter Jennifer Rankin is in Brussels and bringing us updates on a potential deal for Greece. She says eurozone officials are meeting in the Belgian capital today to assess the Greek proposals and lay the groundwork for the emergency meeting of eurogroup finance ministers tomorrow. Read Jennifer\u2019s full report here. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has written to the president of the eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, to put the bailout extension request into context. Dear President of the eurogroup, Over the last five years, the people of Greece have exerted remarkable efforts in economic adjustment. The new government is committed to a broader and deeper reform process aimed at durably improving growth and employment prospects, achieving debt sustainability and financial stability, enhancing social fairness and mitigating the significant social cost of the ongoing crisis. The Greek authorities recognise that the procedures agreed by the previous governments were interrupted by the recent presidential and general elections and that, as a result, several of the technical arrangements have been invalidated. The Greek authorities honour Greece\u2019s financial obligations to all its creditors as well as state our intention to cooperate with our partners in order to avert technical impediments in the context of the Master Facility Agreement which we recognise as binding vis-a-vis its financial and procedural content. In this context, the Greek authorities are now applying for the extension of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement for a period of six months from its termination during which period we shall proceed jointly, and making best use of given flexibility in the current arrangement, toward its successful conclusion and review on the basis of the proposals of, on the one hand, the Greek government and, on the other, the institutions. The purpose of the requested six-month extension of the Agreement\u2019s duration is: (a) To agree the mutually acceptable financial and administrative terms the implementation of which, in collaboration with the institutions, will stabilise Greece\u2019s fiscal position, attain appropriate primary fiscal surpluses, guarantee debt stability and assist in the attainment of fiscal targets for 2015 that take into account the present economic situation. (b) To ensure, working closely with our European and international partners, that any new measures be fully funded while refraining from unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets, economic recovery and financial stability. (c) To allow the European Central Bank to re-introduce the waiver in accordance with its procedures and regulations. (d) To extend the availability of the EFSF bonds held by the HFSF for the duration of the Agreement. (e) To commence work between the technical teams on a possible new Contract for Recovery and Growth that the Greek authorities envisage between Greece, Europe and the International Monetary Fund which could follow the current Agreement. (f) To agree on supervision under the EU and ECB framework and, in the same spirit, with the International Monetary Fund for the duration of the extended Agreement. (g) To discuss means of enacting the November 2012 Eurogroup decision regarding possible further debt measures and assistance for implementation after the completion of the extended Agreement and as part of the follow-up Contract. With the above in mind, the Greek government expresses its determination to cooperate closely with the European Union\u2019s institutions and with the International Monetary Fund in order: (a) to attain fiscal and financial stability and (b) to enable the Greek government to introduce the substantive, far-reaching reforms that are needed to restore the living standards of millions of Greek citizens through sustainable economic growth, gainful employment and social cohesion. Sincerely, Yanis Varoufakis Minister of Finance Hellenic Republic Greek investors are feeling increasingly optimistic that a deal can be struck between the government in Athens and the rest of the eurozone. The main ATG index is now up 2.9% at 871.86. The Greek banks are among the main beneficiaries, partly because of the ECB\u2019s agreement to hand them a \u20ac3.3bn liquidity extension. If Greece has capitulated, officials are putting on a brave face according to Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens. Government officials close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras are sounding a triumphant note. Helena brings us this report: The request for a sixth-month extension of the financial assistance programme propping up the country\u2019s economy is \u201cin total accordance\u201d with the leftist-led government\u2019s electoral mandate, prime ministerial aides insist. \u201cIt respects the popular will, promotes the dignity of [our] society and at the same time is acceptable to our partners,\u201d officials were quoted as saying in the financial daily, Naftemporiki, adding that it would provide a \u201cprotective umbrella to Greece\u2019s financial system\u201d while allowing its austerity-whipped society to breathe. Calling the request an \u201cinterim agreement,\u201d well-placed insiders said the request was significant in two important domains: it raised the issue of debt restructuring and included a pledge from the new government to keep to a balanced budget. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you get left-leaning governments making those sort of commitments,\u201d one told me. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly sought to strike a very fine balance between tackling the humanitarian disaster and promising to be a government that will not only tackle corruption and tax evasion, the malfunctions of Greek society, but take on all the invested interests that plague political and business life.\u201d Economists at German bank Berenberg believe there is a 65% chance that Greece will stay in the euro, but... That leaves a 35% risk of Greek default and euro exit: In practice, this could happen in two ways: (1) the double populist coalition rejects the Eurozone offer and starts printing money; (2) Mr Tsipras calls a referendum which concludes in a vote for exit, despite 80% of Greeks currently wanting to stay. In the first few months after the exit decision, Greece would have to survive a collapse of its financial system amid widespread default. Economic uncertainty and capital controls would trigger severe output contraction. In the longer run, Greece\u2019s future outside the eurozone would depend on its policy choices. A Venezuela/Argentina scenario of years of populist leadership eroding economic foundations looks most likely. Retaining or quickly regaining EU membership would be crucial for Greece. Long-term consequences for the Eurozone would be mixed: On the one hand, Grexit could set a dangerous precedent. It could lead to higher risk premiums and, thus, borrowing costs in parts of the periphery. On the other hand, it would give bite to Europe\u2019s rules. It would raise the incentives for good macro policies to safeguard euro membership and would deflate populists. Commentators on Twitter say the Greek request appears to amount to a climbdown.

It will be up to them to consider whether to accept or reject the Greek proposals. It is official! Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurogroup\u2019s President, has confirmed receipt of Greece\u2019s request for a six-month bailout extension. A note of caution: the Guardian\u2019s reporter Jennifer Rankin is in Brussels and says there is no official confirmation from either side that the Greek bailout extension request is in. So far all we have to go on is a Reuters snap. More soon. Greek investors are happy. The main ATG index is up 1% at 855.85. The bailout extension request, combined with the ECB\u2019s decision to extend an additional \u20ac3.3bn of funding to Greek banks, is driving confidence in Athens this morning. A Greek government official told Reuters the bailout extension has been requested. Specifically, Athens has requested an extension to the so-called \u201cmaster financial assistance facility agreement\u201d with the eurozone. However, Greece is proposing to change some of the terms of the original agreement. We will bring you more detail and reaction as it comes. BREAKING: It\u2019s happening. Greece has formally submitted a request to extend its bailout programme for six months. Away from Greece, the European Central Bank will publish minutes of its latest policy meeting for the first time today. The first set of minutes should be interesting, relating to the ECB\u2019s crucial January meeting when it finally pushed the button on a \u20ac1.1tn programme of quantitative easing. The minutes are scheduled to be published at 1.30pm CET (12.30pm UK time) and we will be following the story. Europe\u2019s major markets have opened slightly lower as investors pause to take in developments (or lack thereof) in Greece. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 6,867.03 France\u2019s CAC 40: -0.1% at 4,792.26 Germany\u2019s DAX 30: -0.3% at 10,932.25 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.1 at 10,784.5 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% 21,555.09 The European Central Bank would be happier if Greece introduced capital controls according to a German newspaper. It would allow the country to stem the amount of money flowing out of its banks and out of the country. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a conservative paper, quotes an unnamed ECB source: The ECB governing council and the ECB banking supervisor would be more comfortable if there were capital controls to prevent the banks bleeding money. The rate at which deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks has accelerated in recent days as the new government has so-far failed to reach an agreement with fellow member of the eurozone over a bailout extension. Under the current agreement, the bailout expires on 28 February. Good morning. It is another crucial day for the future of Greece. Athens is expected to submit its proposal for an extension to its loan agreement today, a day before eurozone finance ministers make a decision on whether to accept the terms. What is unclear is precisely what terms Greece will seek, and what - if any - compromises the eurozone might be willing to make. In an important development for Greece, the European Central Bank last night approved a \u20ac3.3bn extension of liquidity for the country\u2019s banks. It took the total funding on offer to \u20ac68.3bn. Greek banks are close to using up the \u20ac65bn emergency liquidity funds the ECB had already granted them. Read our full story here.",

McKeown comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first ever timely publication of ECB minutes confirms that support for the new QE programme was not unanimous and highlights the Bank\u2019s reluctance to take on more risk related to peripheral governments\u2019 debts. <br></p> <p>[The account] supports President Draghi\u2019s explanation last month that while all members backed the idea of QE, some were not ready to implement it now. Members\u2019 votes are not published. </p> <p>But we know from information leaked previously that executive board Member Sabine Lautenschlaeger and the heads of the German, Dutch and Austrian central banks were all opposed at this stage.</p> <p>The minutes also highlight discomfort with any policy that might appear to be bailing out indebted governments or that would put the ECB\u2019s balance sheet at greater risk. We already had a good idea of this \u2013 the Bank explained last month that QE would be done largely at the risk of national central banks.

Yesterday, the outlook was bleak until the ECB stepped in a boosted its emergency lending assistance to Greek banks. Today, the situation improved further on the back of news that the eurgroup will meet on Friday , which is a sign that Greece may have shifted its negotiating position to a more eurogroup-friendly stance. However, excitement is being contained after Germany said it would reject the deal proposed by Greece in its current form. </p> <p>The Eurogroup meeting on Friday, the third in a week, comes after Greece requested a 6-month bailout extension. The good news is that, if approved, Greece will be able to pay back the EUR 21 billion of principal debt repayments that come due between now and August. The bad news, is that even if this extension is approved, we will be back in the same position in 6-months\u2019 time and Greece\u2019s long-term debt problems remain unsolved. </p> <p>In the longer term, the apparent U-turn by the Greek government seems at odds with Syriza\u2019s election pledge. This could put pressure on the new government to continue to demand a new bailout agreement without austerity conditions when the next round of Greek bailout negotiations come round sometime in the summer. Don\u2019t expect the Greek crisis to go away just because of any \u201cpositive\u201d developments in the next few days.</p> <p>Greek assets have been knocked off their highs on the back of the German comments that it rejects Greece\u2019s proposal, however 10-year yields remain below 10%. If the rest of the EU agrees with Greece\u2019s proposal, then surely Germany will have to acquiesce? If they do then expect European risk assets to stage a rally, if not, then we could see a sharp increase in risk aversion. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54e5db8fe4b0bf4351a24743\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-19T12:53:33.034Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Germany\u2019s tough stance on Greece (rejecting its bailout extension plan) has sent the euro lower, down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.13595.</strong></p> <p>Greek shares are still up but to a lesser extent than earlier in the trading session.

The new government is committed to a broader and deeper reform process aimed at durably improving growth and employment prospects, achieving debt sustainability and financial stability, enhancing social fairness and mitigating the significant social cost of the ongoing crisis.</p> <p>The Greek authorities recognise that the procedures agreed by the previous governments were interrupted by the recent presidential and general elections and that, as a result, several of the technical arrangements have been invalidated. The Greek authorities honour Greece\u2019s financial obligations to all its creditors as well as state our intention to cooperate with our partners in order to avert technical impediments in the context of the Master Facility Agreement which we recognise as binding vis-a-vis its financial and procedural content.</p> <p>In this context, the Greek authorities are now applying for the extension of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement for a period of six months from its termination during which period we shall proceed jointly, and making best use of given flexibility in the current arrangement, toward its successful conclusion and review on the basis of the proposals of, on the one hand, the Greek government and, on the other, the institutions.</p> <p>The purpose of the requested six-month extension of the Agreement\u2019s duration is:</p> <p>(a) To agree the mutually acceptable financial and administrative terms the implementation of which, in collaboration with the institutions, will stabilise Greece\u2019s fiscal position, attain appropriate primary fiscal surpluses, guarantee debt stability and assist in the attainment of fiscal targets for 2015 that take into account the present economic situation.</p> <p>(b) To ensure, working closely with our European and international partners, that any new measures be fully funded while refraining from unilateral action that would undermine the fiscal targets, economic recovery and financial stability.</p> <p>(c) To allow the European Central Bank to re-introduce the waiver in accordance with its procedures and regulations.</p> <p>(d) To extend the availability of the EFSF bonds held by the HFSF for the duration of the Agreement.</p> <p>(e) To commence work between the technical teams on a possible new Contract for Recovery and Growth that the Greek authorities envisage between Greece, Europe and the International Monetary Fund which could follow the current Agreement.</p> <p>(f) To agree on supervision under the EU and ECB framework and, in the same spirit, with the International Monetary Fund for the duration of the extended Agreement.</p> <p>(g) To discuss means of enacting the November 2012 Eurogroup decision regarding possible further debt measures and assistance for implementation after the completion of the extended Agreement and as part of the follow-up Contract.</p> <p>With the above in mind, the Greek government expresses its determination to cooperate closely with the European Union\u2019s institutions and with the International Monetary Fund in order: (a) to attain fiscal and financial stability and (b) to enable the Greek government to introduce the substantive, far-reaching reforms that are needed to restore the living standards of millions of Greek citizens through sustainable economic growth, gainful employment and social cohesion.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Yanis Varoufakis</p> <p>Minister of Finance</p> <p>Hellenic Republic</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54e5c752e4b085ef2c6517e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-02-19T11:37:21.170Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greek investors are feeling increasingly optimistic that a deal can be struck between the government in Athens and the rest of the eurozone.</strong></p> <p>The main ATG index is now up 2.9% at 871.86.

Economic uncertainty and capital controls would trigger severe output contraction.</p> <p> In the longer run, Greece\u2019s future outside the eurozone<strong> </strong>would<strong> </strong>depend on its policy choices. A Venezuela/Argentina scenario of years of populist leadership eroding economic foundations looks most likely. Retaining or quickly regaining EU membership would be crucial for Greece.</p> <p>Long-term consequences for the Eurozone would be mixed:<strong> </strong>On the one hand, Grexit could set a dangerous precedent.

      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority has launched a year-long investigation into whether there is enough competition in the investment and corporate banking sector. The regulator said on Thursday there were also \u201cunanswered questions\u201d about possible conflicts of interest and whether clients were getting value for money. The bundling of services by investment banks could make it difficult for new entrants to come into the market or for smaller players to challenge larger institutions, the FCA said. Its director of strategy and competition, Christopher Woolard, added: \u201cWe have chosen this particular area because the benefits of effective competition in the market could be significant. The UK is a global hub for investment banking, and this sector plays a crucial role in our economy, helping companies raise capital for investment, expansion and funding ongoing operations. \u201cWhat was clear from the discussions we had with stakeholders and firms was that there are unanswered questions about potential conflicts of interest and value for money in this market.\u201d The FCA inquiry adds to government pressure for more competition in banking. Personal accounts and small business banking is already the subject to a full investigation by Britain\u2019s main antitrust watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The FCA said concerns had been raised with the body about transparency in the sector and the effect of bundling different services. \u201cInvestment banking was one of the areas where a number of stakeholders raised concerns or raised questions. At this point, it is too early to say whether these stack up but they certainly seem to us worthy of further investigation,\u201d said Mary Starks, director of competition. The terms of reference for the FCA study are expected in the coming weeks and a final report to be published in a year. Starks said the FCA would be talking to four large investment banks, 14 smaller bodies and a large number of other players that the watchdog regulates as part of the inquiry which will use a range of investigative and analytical techniques. A study into asset management and the surrounding services is also being considered. \u201cIt is a market which is big of itself but is pretty important for the real economy. This is a market that enables businesses to raise finance, to fund investment and growth and expansion so if the market is not working well, the knock-on effects to the real economy are quite important,\u201d she said. From April, the FCA will have new competition powers to take enforcement action against financial firms that breach UK competition law, and refer a market to the CMA for an in-depth investigation. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a surprise and it\u2019s fairly clear it\u2019s a reasonably concentrated market,\u201d said Jonathan Herbst, global head of financial services at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. \u201cClearly people should take the new competition powers seriously. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work for the banks.\u201d",

Personal accounts and small business banking is already the subject to a full investigation by Britain\u2019s main antitrust watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p> <p>The FCA said concerns had been raised with the body about transparency in the sector and the effect of bundling different services. \u201cInvestment banking was one of the areas where a number of stakeholders raised concerns or raised questions. At this point, it is too early to say whether these stack up but they certainly seem to us worthy of further investigation,\u201d said Mary Starks, director of competition.</p> <p>The terms of reference for the FCA study are expected in the coming weeks and a final report to be published in a year. Starks said the FCA would be talking to four large investment banks, 14 smaller bodies and a large number of other players that the watchdog regulates as part of the inquiry which will use a range of investigative and analytical techniques. A study into asset management and the surrounding services is also being considered.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a market which is big of itself but is pretty important for the real economy. This is a market that enables businesses to raise finance, to fund investment and growth and expansion so if the market is not working well, the knock-on effects to the real economy are quite important,\u201d she said.</p> <p>From April, the FCA will have new competition powers to take enforcement action against financial firms that breach UK competition law, and refer a market to the CMA for an in-depth investigation.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a surprise and it\u2019s fairly clear it\u2019s a reasonably concentrated market,\u201d said Jonathan Herbst, global head of financial services at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.</p> <p>\u201cClearly people should take the new competition powers seriously. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work for the banks.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "TTIP under pressure from protesters as Brussels promises extra safeguards", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brussels is promising to include extra safeguards in the transatlantic trade deal under discussion with the US, following protests by trade unions and anti-poverty campaigners. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU\u2019s trade commissioner, said she planned to rework key areas of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement in response to fears the deal could be used by US corporations to win health service contracts and undermine the NHS. In an interview with the Guardian, she said courts that would arbitrate in-camera on corporate disputes needed to give US multinationals only a \u201climited possibility\u201d of winning compensation if governments were to cancel privatisations or award public contracts to in-house bids. More than 97% of respondents to an official EU survey voted against the TTIP deal after Barack Obama, the US president, and the 29 heads of EU governments backed proposals last year. The vote came after a campaign by trade unions and charities warning the deal would allow US private health companies to bid for contracts in Europe and appeal to secret arbitration courts if they lost. US multinationals could also use the courts to challenge government policies that damaged their profits, campaigners said. A dispute in Australia between Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, and the government over a move to plain paper packaging, which has dragged on for three years without resolution, is often cited as an example of an aggressive US multinational using arbitration under a similar trade deal to block reforms. Malmstr\u00f6m warned that limiting the scope of the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) service would be difficult to achieve but she gave a categorical commitment that publicly-funded health services would be explicitly excluded from a TTIP agreement. She said: \u201cWe need to see if there is a possibility to reform them in a modern way. So there is only a limited possibility for targeted cases for investors to have their investments protected.\u201d She said the courts should be more transparent \u201cto protect against abuses and have a \u201cvery strict code of conduct for arbitrators\u201d. Malmstr\u00f6m said: \u201cIs it possible to achieve a state-of-the-art ISDS like this to replace all the 1,400 agreements in the European Union with China and the rest? I don\u2019t know, but we are going to try.\u201d She was unable to say when a revised dispute resolution system would be ready for campaigners to see and would not say whether it would be included in the final draft of the trade deal, expected at the end of the year. She said: \u201cIt is too early to say. We haven\u2019t debated yet whether ISDS should be in the agreement. We haven\u2019t had a council of ministers to discuss it since all the representations.\u201d According to legal advice given to the Unite union it would not be possible for Malmstr\u00f6m to devise a form of words excluding public services from trade disputes. Kyriaki-Korina Raptopoulou, an expert in EU law, warned that without an explicit exclusion, NHS contracts could be disputed in ISDS\u2019s secret courts. She added a warning that TTIP would \u201cpromote the risk of suppressing future healthcare legislation.\u201d Malmstr\u00f6m is under pressure from EU leaders to find a compromise that not only satisfies protesters but can also be a template for future trade deals. She is clearly exasperated at EU leaders who have told her to secure the TTIP while publicly siding with objectors in their home countries. \u201cThe fact is that ministers come to Brussels and they sit around the table and say this is a good thing and we encourage the commission to finalise it by the end of 2015 \u2013 go on hurry up. And they go home to their countries and say \u2018well, I\u2019m not really sure of the benefits\u2019,\u201d she said. A member of the Swedish liberal party, a small grouping in the Stockholm parliament, Malmstr\u00f6m is socially liberal but fiscally conservative. Before taking the trade portfolio last year she was commissioner responsible for security and made waves with a call for greater protections against the trafficking of children. But when talking about the general benefits of a US/EU trade deal, it is her free-market outlook that comes to the fore. She conceded that skilled workers were the main beneficiaries, but said that the trickle-down effect would bring benefits to those with lower skills. Malmstr\u00f6m said: \u201cGenerally export-related jobs tend to be more qualified jobs and so benefit skilled workers, but we hope the whole chain will improve so the whole production line will benefit. Of course there are some countries that will benefit more than others. TTIP is not the only answer but it is part of the answer.\u201d It is this emphasis on the role of the global market for jobs that has persuaded some campaigners to demand that TTIP be thrown out altogether. When the deadline for a draft agreement is the end of this year and a signature from all heads of state, including the outgoing US president, must be inked by next spring, the deal may already be on life-support. What is the TTIP? The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a trade deal aimed at cutting regulatory barriers and tariffs between the US and the EU so that companies in each country can access each other\u2019s markets more easily. How did it start? A working group set up by the leaders at the EU-US summit in 2011 reported two years later recommending a bilateral trade agreement. Negotiations started in 2013 and involved at least 100 participants. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, described the deal as one of his priorities. Who could it affect? A range of industries would be affected by the deal, from pharmaceuticals and clothes to food and finance. Supporters say it could add up to 0.5 percentage points to the American and European economies by freeing up trade. European car exports could double according to commentators, while British lamb and venison could be exported to the US. What do opponents say? Campaigners have raised concerns about food standards, saying the EU has stricter regulations surrounding pesticides and additives. In Britain, questions have arisen over whether parts of the NHS could be run by US health firms. Critics say that the proposed Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) - which would allow businesses to sue governments for actions that hurt future profits - could bypass national laws. What happens next? A reworked deal would have to be ratified by the 28 governments of the EU and Congress in the US. However, the newly elected leftist Syriza government in Greece has already said it will not approve the pact. Shane Hickey",

    "webTitle": "Germany refuses Greece an honourable surrender over austerity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a phrase for what Germany is seeking to do to Greece: a Carthaginian peace. It dates back to the Punic wars when Rome emerged victorious in its long struggle with Carthage but refused to allow its opponent the chance of an honourable surrender. Instead, it enforced a brutal settlement, burning Carthage to the ground and enslaving those inhabitants it did not massacre. A Carthaginian peace is what is being offered to Alexis Tsipras. On Thursday, the Greek prime minister made it clear that he was willing to see the white flag of surrender flutter over Athens. He accepted that he would have to swallow most of the conditions demanded of him by Greece\u2019s eurozone partners but asked for a few concessions to sugar the pill. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, immediately slapped Tsipras down. What Greece was proposing was unacceptable, Schaeuble said. Unless the Germans are bluffing, and there\u2019s nothing to suggest that they are, it leaves Greece with a binary choice: abject surrender or going nuclear. Abject surrender means that Tsipras would have to explain to the Greek people why he was abandoning the policies on which he won the election less than a month ago. Going nuclear would involve capital controls, fresh elections on a \u201cwho governs Greece\u201d basis and possible exit from the single currency. Tsipras occupies both the moral and intellectual high ground going into Friday\u2019s talks in Brussels. In its pitch to the other 18 eurozone members, Greece has formally asked for a six-month extension to its bailout agreement. There is no longer the pretence that the bailout should be replaced by a loan agreement with no strings attached. The hated troika of the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Union and the International Monetary Fund will be monitoring Greece\u2019s economy for the next six months, something that has been anathema until now. The Greek government has modest demands of its own. It wants to negotiate a new growth deal for the four years until 2019. It is asking for debt relief under the terms of the November 2012 bailout agreement, and it wants to be able to take steps to deal with the humanitarian crisis caused by the 25% collapse in the size of the economy over the past five years. None of these demands are unreasonable. Indeed, they are all entirely sensible. As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research has noted, for every euro the Greek government has saved through spending cuts or tax increases, the economy has contracted by \u20ac1.20. Austerity has resulted in Greece\u2019s debt to GDP ratio going up, not down. A change of tack is overdue. But Germany\u2019s response to Greece was simple: stick to the existing programme no matter what the voters want. Tsipras has two big weaknesses. Firstly, Greece is suffering from capital flight and is dependent on emergency support from the ECB for its banks. The ECB has just increased its funding, but not by as much as Greece would have liked. The life support could be cut off at any time. Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, Greece has failed to deploy its most potent weapon \u2013 a threat to leave the euro. For all the talk in Brussels and Berlin that the single currency could withstand a Greek departure, the threat of withdrawal would have put the frighteners on. Would the euro group really want to risk chaos, given the shaky state of the economy? No. Would Angela Merkel want to go down in history as the German chancellor responsible for rolling back more than half a century of European integration? Again, no. So Tsipras should tough it out. He should reject the cosmetic concessions that will be offered and say that the deal on offer is not acceptable to the Greek people. Politically, this does not look much of a risk. If he accepts a Carthaginian peace he is finished.",

It dates back to the Punic wars when Rome emerged victorious in its long struggle with Carthage but refused to allow its opponent the chance of an honourable surrender. Instead, it enforced a brutal settlement, burning Carthage to the ground and enslaving those inhabitants it did not massacre.</p> <p>A Carthaginian peace is what is being offered to Alexis Tsipras. On Thursday, the Greek prime minister made it clear that he was willing to see the white flag of surrender flutter over Athens. He accepted that he would have to swallow most of the conditions demanded of him by Greece\u2019s eurozone partners but asked for a few concessions to sugar the pill.</p> <p>Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, immediately slapped Tsipras down. What Greece was proposing was unacceptable, Schaeuble said. Unless the Germans are bluffing, and there\u2019s nothing to suggest that they are, it leaves Greece with a binary choice: abject surrender or going nuclear.</p> <p>Abject surrender means that Tsipras would have to explain to the Greek people why he was abandoning the policies on which he won the election less than a month ago. Going nuclear would involve capital controls, fresh elections on a \u201cwho governs Greece\u201d basis and possible exit from the single currency.</p> <p>Tsipras occupies both the moral and intellectual high ground going into Friday\u2019s talks in Brussels. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/greece-requests-eurozone-loan-extension\">Germany rejects Greek request for loan extension</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In its pitch to the other 18 eurozone members, Greece has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/19/greece-requests-eurozone-loan-extension\">formally asked for a six-month extension to its bailout agreement</a>.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Centrica has slashed the dividend for its 650,000 small shareholders and plans to cut costs and investment after warm weather and falling oil prices reduced annual profits at the owner of British Gas by more than a third. It is the first time Centrica has cut its dividend since the company was created in 1997, and leaves many individual investors with less income than they had come to expect. Operating profit at British Gas fell 20% to \u00a3823m because of a sharp drop in demand during the warmest year on record. The average customer bill fell by about \u00a3100, and the average profit per customer fell by almost \u00a310 to \u00a342. British Gas lost 368,000 customers last year, ending 2014 with 14.8 million clients. The company reviewed customer numbers at the end of the year and found it had overestimated them by 110,000. The group reduced its final dividend by 30% to 8.4p a share, to save cash and support the company\u2019s credit rating. The cut to the final payout meant the annual dividend was reduced by 21% to 13.5p. Iain Conn, who took over as chief executive at the start of this year, said the dividend cut was needed after the two big credit rating agencies, Moody\u2019s and Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, placed it on a negative outlook. Shares in the group tumbled almost 9% to 257p, the biggest faller on the FTSE. Conn said: [The dividend cut] was quite urgent actually. Some of our credit metrics at the end of last year were really quite far below where our current credit rating is and we weren\u2019t able to balance cash going out with cash coming in. Clearly it is a big blow. It was important to be clear. Centrica has one of the biggest followings of individual investors, with many holding their shares since British Gas was sold off in the \u201ctell Sid\u201d privatisation in 1986. Keith Bowman, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: For investors, and in the current ultra-low interest rate environment, the cut to the dividend payment is a major blow. Conn said he would cut exploration and production capital spending by 40% to \u00a3650m by 2016, and has launched a group-wide review of costs. He is also closing two power stations at Killingholme and Brigg in Lincolnshire. He declined to discuss potential job cuts, but said there would be less work for Centrica\u2019s contractors in the North Sea. He said: \u201cWe are clearly going to reduce activity in the North Sea with these capital cuts and that activity reduction may well have a knock-on effect.\u201d Centrica\u2019s adjusted operating profit fell 35% to \u00a31.75bn for the year ended 31 December. Profits at the group\u2019s energy business, which includes gas exploration and production, plunged by 44% to \u00a3737m as gas prices fell alongside the cost of oil. The company was also forced to write down the value of exploration, production and power assets by \u00a31.4bn. Centrica is the latest UK company to be hit by the sharp fall in the price of oil, to which the gas price is linked, since last summer. BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group have all slashed investment spending in recent weeks. Conn said political uncertainty before May\u2019s general election and a competition inquiry weighed on Centrica\u2019s business last year. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, has promised to cap household energy bills if his party wins the election. In an update on its thinking on Wednesday, the Competition and Markets Authority said the big energy providers were capitalising on the inertia of often vulnerable customers to make extra money. Conn, however, said British Gas had to compete vigorously to hold on to its customers and that its profits were not excessive. We do take very considerable supply risk and volume risk for 80p a week [British Gas\u2019s weekly profit per customer] He added that political interventions such as Miliband\u2019s could reduce investment and employment, and that it would be better if the government stayed out of the industry. Conn said: Butt out is a strong term but I would say that in my experience when governments intervene in markets it can have unintended consequences. It would be my preference to have a predictable regulatory framework rather than governments saying there will be price cuts or whatever.",

      "bodyText": "Australia places higher standards on the food produced by its own farmers than it does on the products it imports, creating a situation rife for \u201cdrugs and bugs\u201d to enter the food supply, an infectious diseases expert says. Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist with the Australian National University, said the recent importation of berries contaminated with hepatitis A highlighted a broader failure to test imported foods for a range of diseases. \u201cIt\u2019s a real public health problem,\u201d Collignon said. \u201cWe put higher standards on our farmers than those who we import food from, even though we are importing from countries who are watering and spraying their plants with contaminated water which is rife with human waste. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t do any testing for these bugs. We seem to take the farmers\u2019 and the food companies\u2019 word for it that the tests have been done at their end.\u201d The Australian government should appoint independent testers to assess a small portion of imported fruit and vegetable products, he said. These products were particularly dangerous, because they were usually not cooked and freezing only helped to preserve bacteria. \u201cWe should sample a small portion of products and if the company fails the test, then next time a larger portion of their product could be tested until they meet the standards we set,\u201d Collignon said. \u201cBut it\u2019s stupid not to test anything and to trust the companies to do it. One decade ago, testing was much more expensive than it is now, but these days you can test for bacteria like E. coli relatively cheaply and the more you test, the cheaper it becomes.\u201d Foods were currently tested for fecal matter, he said, but not for specific pathogens, because those tests were more expensive. Australia also was not testing imported food rigorously enough for antibiotic residue from spraying fruit and vegetables to ward off plant diseases, Collignon said. When ingested, these drugs could build up in the body, leading to antibiotic resistance. \u201cWe should have a stronger strategy that we enforce to prevent imported drugs and bugs,\u201d he said. While the hepatitis A outbreak had affected enough people to trace back to certain brands of berries, Collignon said that wasn\u2019t always the case, and that smaller outbreaks of disease also occurred which could not be traced back to a specific product. The safest way to avoid food contaminated with waste water or antibiotic residue was to buy Australian, Collignon said, where farmers are held to rigorous food safety and handling standards. A Food Standards Australia and New Zealand spokesperson said for packaged foods, like frozen berries, country of origin labelling must be legible and prominent, and be in English, though text size was not prescribed. \u201cBut for unpackaged foods such as fruit and vegetables, country of origin information must be displayed on the food and be at least 9mm in height, or at least 5mm in height if in a refrigerated display cabinet,\u201d the spokesperson said. However, a Choice survey from last year found consumers had difficulty interpreting country of origin labelling. Of 700 respondents, only 12% were able to accurately identify the meaning of \u201cMade in Australia\u201d. If a product is Made in Australia, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the ingredients were grown or sourced in Australia. But on Wednesday, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, rejected a crackdown on food testing and labelling in response to the outbreak, saying it was the responsibility of business \u201cnot to poison their customers\u201d. An antimicrobial resistance expert from the University of Adelaide, Associate Professor Darren Trott, said Australian-grown and produced food was among the safest in the world. But imported food was often cheaper, making it attractive to consumers, he said. \u201cWe owe it to ourselves as a country to eat Australian,\u201d he said. \u201cWe produce high quality, great food and although it costs more, it is safer.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIntergenerational theft\u201d has become a bit of a go-to phrase with members of the government these past few weeks as it tries to convince voters of the need for budget cuts. But the sense that government debt steals from future generations is a simplistic notion that ignores the long-term benefits of government expenditure and instead cares more about selling the political line that debt and deficits are always bad.<br></p> <p>The suggestion that debt is intergenerational theft implies that as government debt needs to be paid back at a later date through taxes, debt taken out now is effectively being paid by future generations who don\u2019t receive any benefits.<br></p> <p>Earlier this week, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the new parliamentary secretary to the treasurer, put a twist on the line <a href=\"http://www.kellyodwyer.com.au/address-to-the-centre-for-independent-studies-16-february-2015/\">by talking</a> about debt in terms of \u201cintergenerational fairness\u201d. </p> <p>She suggested that \u201cthe six budgets delivered by Labor over the period from 2008-09 to 2013-14\u201d were \u201cfrom an intergenerational perspective ... clearly the six most unfair budgets in Australia\u2019s history\u201d \u2013 because the debt will have to be paid by future generations.</p> <p>To support this she noted that \u201cduring that period, Labor delivered $240bn aggregate in deficits, despite inheriting a budget in surplus\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer, of course, as is de rigueur with all conservatives, rather dismissed that little thing known everywhere else except Australia as \u201cthe great recession\u201d.<br></p> <p>She blithely suggested: \u201cYes, they faced the global financial crisis in 2008. But they also had the biggest terms-of-trade tailwind in the nation\u2019s history, benefiting from an enormous commodity boom that was never going to endure.\u201d<br></p> <p>The problem with O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s economic history is she falls into the trap of thinking that increases in commodity prices must mean increases in company profits and thus increases in company taxes.<br></p> <p>You can understand why she thinks this because this is what happened during the Howard government. But O\u2019Dwyer might also remember that while commodity prices did boom after the GFC, so too did the value of our currency \u2013 which hindered the profits of our companies.<br></p> <p>It meant that under the Labor government, company tax fell two years in a row during the GFC, and in only one year of its government did company tax grow by over 10% \u2013 compared with five of the last six years of the Howard government (2007-08 grew by \u201cjust\u201d 8%):<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/jKBUp/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And even now company tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is well below the levels seen in the last three years of the Howard government. </p> <p>O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s whole thesis is contained in her assertion that \u201cat the family level, most parents look to build some wealth to leave to their children and grandchildren so that they have an easier start in life. At the government level, Labor took the opposite approach.\u201d<br></p> <p>Except a government surplus is not national wealth.<br></p> <p>Australia\u2019s economy \u2013 and its wealth \u2013 grew substantially though the Labor government period. Indeed, when you compare our performance against other major economies, we did very well:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/2YYCz/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But was this performance achieved by stealing from future generations? </p> <p>The debate \u2013 like much of the \u201cdebt and deficit\u201d talk that dominates politics \u2013 often gets stuck confusing means and ends. </p> <p>It\u2019s like worrying about whether exercising is good because it will cause you to eat more to ensure you have the energy to exercise. The purpose of exercising is not to eat less, it is to be healthier. Similarly, the purpose of a government\u2019s budget strategy should not be to have a budget in surplus and less debt, but (one would hope) to have a stronger economy.<br></p> <p>And this is where the claims of intergenerational theft and fairness falls down.<br></p> <p>If a government borrowed money purely to give to people who spent it on perishable consumption items at a time when the economy was already at near capacity, it would be a waste. It would just add to inflation, would have little if any lasting economic value and certainly future generations will be paying off that debt despite receiving no benefit. </p> <p>But, as the economist <a href=\"http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/is-debt-burden-on-future-generations.html\">Noah Smith</a> notes, if the debt is used to finance \u201cproductive assets\u201d say \u201cbuilding or repairing infrastructure, researching new ideas [or] improving schools\u201d and if the return on those investments is actually higher than the \u201crate at which the government borrowed\u201d, then future generations actually benefit from the debt we are incurring now.<br></p> <p>The line from the government at the start of the GFC regarding the stimulus was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2012/s3503553.htm\">go hard, go early, go households</a>\u201d. In the 1980s and 1990s recessions, the reason was that the stimulus came too late and was not targeted properly enough to stop damage being inflicted.<br></p> <p>A look at the falls in the percentage of prime-age workers in employment (25-54 years) during the 1990s and early 1980s recession and the GFC shows the difference:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Fqqb8/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Employment during the GFC declined at much the same rate as in the earlier two recessions, but it bottomed out and began to improve much sooner.<br></p> <p>Was this theft on future generations? Well not if the people who kept their jobs were parents whose children were able to maintain their standard living; not if they attend a school which has a new building due to the stimulus, not if their house is one of the million or so which obtained insulation and thus will have lower heating and cooling costs in the future.<br></p> <p>O\u2019Dwyer is right to say that \u201cat the family level, most parents look to build some wealth to leave to their children\u201d. Without the GFC stimulus a heck of a lot more families would have been unable to do that \u2013 is that theft?<br></p> <p>And there is also the opportunity cost of going into debt now.<br></p> <p>Currently the Australian government 10-year bond rate is at record lows \u2013 even lower than during the GFC:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/E9lLX/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is very cheap for the government to borrow money. </p> <p>Let\u2019s say a city desperately needs its rail system upgraded \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/melbourne-metro-rail-tunnel-project-revived-by-daniel-andrews-20150216-13fmxl.html\">maybe a tunnel</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIntergenerational theft\u201d has become a bit of a go-to phrase with members of the government these past few weeks as it tries to convince voters of the need for budget cuts. But the sense that government debt steals from future generations is a simplistic notion that ignores the long-term benefits of government expenditure and instead cares more about selling the political line that debt and deficits are always bad. The suggestion that debt is intergenerational theft implies that as government debt needs to be paid back at a later date through taxes, debt taken out now is effectively being paid by future generations who don\u2019t receive any benefits. Earlier this week, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the new parliamentary secretary to the treasurer, put a twist on the line by talking about debt in terms of \u201cintergenerational fairness\u201d. She suggested that \u201cthe six budgets delivered by Labor over the period from 2008-09 to 2013-14\u201d were \u201cfrom an intergenerational perspective ... clearly the six most unfair budgets in Australia\u2019s history\u201d \u2013 because the debt will have to be paid by future generations. To support this she noted that \u201cduring that period, Labor delivered $240bn aggregate in deficits, despite inheriting a budget in surplus\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer, of course, as is de rigueur with all conservatives, rather dismissed that little thing known everywhere else except Australia as \u201cthe great recession\u201d. She blithely suggested: \u201cYes, they faced the global financial crisis in 2008. But they also had the biggest terms-of-trade tailwind in the nation\u2019s history, benefiting from an enormous commodity boom that was never going to endure.\u201d The problem with O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s economic history is she falls into the trap of thinking that increases in commodity prices must mean increases in company profits and thus increases in company taxes. You can understand why she thinks this because this is what happened during the Howard government. But O\u2019Dwyer might also remember that while commodity prices did boom after the GFC, so too did the value of our currency \u2013 which hindered the profits of our companies. It meant that under the Labor government, company tax fell two years in a row during the GFC, and in only one year of its government did company tax grow by over 10% \u2013 compared with five of the last six years of the Howard government (2007-08 grew by \u201cjust\u201d 8%): And even now company tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is well below the levels seen in the last three years of the Howard government. O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s whole thesis is contained in her assertion that \u201cat the family level, most parents look to build some wealth to leave to their children and grandchildren so that they have an easier start in life. At the government level, Labor took the opposite approach.\u201d Except a government surplus is not national wealth. Australia\u2019s economy \u2013 and its wealth \u2013 grew substantially though the Labor government period. Indeed, when you compare our performance against other major economies, we did very well: But was this performance achieved by stealing from future generations? The debate \u2013 like much of the \u201cdebt and deficit\u201d talk that dominates politics \u2013 often gets stuck confusing means and ends. It\u2019s like worrying about whether exercising is good because it will cause you to eat more to ensure you have the energy to exercise. The purpose of exercising is not to eat less, it is to be healthier. Similarly, the purpose of a government\u2019s budget strategy should not be to have a budget in surplus and less debt, but (one would hope) to have a stronger economy. And this is where the claims of intergenerational theft and fairness falls down. If a government borrowed money purely to give to people who spent it on perishable consumption items at a time when the economy was already at near capacity, it would be a waste. It would just add to inflation, would have little if any lasting economic value and certainly future generations will be paying off that debt despite receiving no benefit. But, as the economist Noah Smith notes, if the debt is used to finance \u201cproductive assets\u201d say \u201cbuilding or repairing infrastructure, researching new ideas [or] improving schools\u201d and if the return on those investments is actually higher than the \u201crate at which the government borrowed\u201d, then future generations actually benefit from the debt we are incurring now. The line from the government at the start of the GFC regarding the stimulus was \u201cgo hard, go early, go households\u201d. In the 1980s and 1990s recessions, the reason was that the stimulus came too late and was not targeted properly enough to stop damage being inflicted. A look at the falls in the percentage of prime-age workers in employment (25-54 years) during the 1990s and early 1980s recession and the GFC shows the difference: Employment during the GFC declined at much the same rate as in the earlier two recessions, but it bottomed out and began to improve much sooner. Was this theft on future generations? Well not if the people who kept their jobs were parents whose children were able to maintain their standard living; not if they attend a school which has a new building due to the stimulus, not if their house is one of the million or so which obtained insulation and thus will have lower heating and cooling costs in the future. O\u2019Dwyer is right to say that \u201cat the family level, most parents look to build some wealth to leave to their children\u201d. Without the GFC stimulus a heck of a lot more families would have been unable to do that \u2013 is that theft? And there is also the opportunity cost of going into debt now. Currently the Australian government 10-year bond rate is at record lows \u2013 even lower than during the GFC: It is very cheap for the government to borrow money. Let\u2019s say a city desperately needs its rail system upgraded \u2013 maybe a tunnel. That infrastructure need won\u2019t go away just because the government decides not to fund it. Instead it just kicks the responsibility along to a future government which will in all likelihood have to pay a higher interest rate on its bonds. And of course any talk of intergenerational theft is hollow if you don\u2019t also mention climate change. Not only will the costs of combating it be higher the longer we wait (and also take us closer to, if not past, the point where any meaningful action can make a difference), but the Abbott government\u2019s actions in rescinding the carbon tax have provided future generations an added sting. The cost of removing the carbon tax but keeping the compensation added around $7.4bn to the budget deficit over the forward estimates. But when, inevitably, we adopt a carbon price in the future there will be an expectation of further compensation \u2013 because the current level of welfare will be considered normal and no longer \u201ccompensation\u201d. A future government will hardly be able to tell the electorate that it will receive no compensation for the impacts of a carbon price because that compensation was provided back in 2012! Thus by keeping the compensation the Abbott government has not only increased the size of the deficit now, it has loaded the budget with a time bomb that will go off should a future government ever put a price on carbon. How\u2019s that for intergenerational fairness? There are reasons to worry about debt, as the RBA\u2019s governor, Glenn Stevens, noted last Friday before the economics committee, if the economy suffers a downturn and our deficit position is already weak, financial markets may not be as willing to take our money as they were during the GFC \u2013 and thus the cost of borrowing may soar. But talking about intergenerational theft or suggesting debt is unfair on future generations requires a pretty simplistic view of the economy that involves worrying more about deficit and surplus than growth and employment.",
