      "bodyText": "For a 100 years the name Longbridge cast its shadow across Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry. Throughout a century when the ability to make motor cars defined an economy\u2019s industrial clout, the plant \u2013 brainchild of one of Britain\u2019s automotive pioneers, Herbert Austin \u2013 was a standard bearer of British-owned volume car production. Ten years ago this week, however, production ground to a halt and more than 6,000 workers at the Birmingham plant and many others in the region lost their jobs. The end came on 8 April, when MG Rover went into administration after failing to secure a rescue partnership with Chinese state-owned carmaker the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC). Today, a new town is emerging from the sprawling 468-acre site as part of a \u00a31bn regeneration programme, one of the biggest in Britain, which could take another decade or more to complete. The UK automotive industry is also motoring. In a single week at the end of March, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Geely, the Chinese owner of the London Taxi Company, announced combined investments of more than \u00a31bn at their UK factories. By the time the Longbridge project is finished, St Modwen, the property company that is redeveloping the site, says it will provide 10,000 jobs (more than 3,500 have already arrived), 2,000 new homes, a town centre (Sainsbury\u2019s has already moved in; M&amp;S is on the way), schools, leisure facilities and almost 2 million square feet of offices, distribution and industrial space, including an innovation centre and technology park. The old engine plant is now a housing development, and work has begun on a retirement village. A park has replaced a press shop and there is even a creche \u2013 a surprising survivor from carmaking days. Unemployment in the area has fallen to around or below pre-Rover-crash levels. But Richard Halstead, Midlands regional director of manufacturers\u2019 group the EEF, says it was more than a question of jobs. The impact was also felt, he says, in ways not captured by the raw unemployment figures: \u201cThere was a big impact on the perception of the sector and on careers in the sector. The perception was that manufacturing was not a place you wanted to develop a career.\u201d In a region where the skills base had already been hit by contractions over previous years, that was a serious blow, and one which is still being felt. As manufacturing recovers from the post-crisis recession, Halstead notes that the three main preoccupations of his members are: \u201cSkills, skills, skills.\u201d Richard Burden, long-serving Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, is another who believes that, damaging as the closure was for the local economy, its impact went deeper: \u201cLongbridge was part of the way people defined themselves. It was part of their identity. What happened went to the core of that: what the plant was, what the community was, what their future was, what their children\u2019s futures would be.\u201d Mike Murray, senior development surveyor at St Modwen, who leads the regeneration programme, is also insistent that Longbridge must be more than bricks, mortar and the latest in global communication links. The aim is to create a community to replace the one that, over the years, had grown up around the car plant: \u201cWhat we are doing is putting the heart back into Longbridge.\u201d It is generally accepted that achieving this ambition has been helped along by a steady development of new homes and jobs. The most visible sign of life is the arrival of the Bournville College and its \u00a366m facility, which brings a daily influx of students. Longbridge\u2019s automotive past has not been entirely swept away. While it was the collapse of a deal with a Chinese backer that sealed Rover\u2019s fate, China did not turn its back on Birmingham. After the closure, part of the plant was bought by Nanjing Automotive \u2013 which in 2007 was essentially taken over by SAIC, the company that had failed to become Rover\u2019s saviour. The group has chosen to place its UK research and development at the Longbridge facility, which now employs more than 400 people on design and engineering work. Motor manufacturing began again in 2008, with a small production line building MG sports cars. Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council, acknowledges that, after the crisis triggered by the closure of Longbridge, he is relieved at the way events are unfolding. Development of the site is an integral part of the council\u2019s overall economic plan, but it goes beyond that: \u201cWhat we have is something that can call itself Longbridge, which is clearly identified, not with a single manufacturing plant\u2026 but with housing, retail, job opportunities, further education and so on. We have a new Longbridge emerging.\u201d The demise of MG Rover and the closure of Longbridge were widely seen as yet another stage in the slow decline of Britain\u2019s automotive industry. Indeed for many it was hard to see how things could get worse. In 2004, the year before Rover closed its doors, Britain produced 1.65m passenger cars. The following year, even without Rover, it made 1.6m. In 2009, in the downturn following the global banking crisis, however, production slumped, with UK car plants turning out just 1m vehicles. Though there were fears that Britain could face further closures, the main carmakers \u2013 Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Vauxhall, Mini and Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 hung on in, though not, in some cases, without painful cuts. Their faith in UK manufacturing capability was rewarded. Demand picked up and production recovered. By last year, according to motor industry body the SMMT, car production had topped 1.528m vehicles in the best year since 2007. Though sales to the European Union, a key market for UK marques, were hard hit, exports to destinations including China, Russia and the US helped boost demand. Britain now exports four out of every five cars it builds. In the first three months of 2012, for example, the UK clocked up a positive balance of payments in cars for the first time since 1976, meaning the country earned more from selling vehicles abroad than it spent on importing them. At the same time, sales in the UK have soared as motorists make the best of low interest rates or opt for personal contract hire plans that allow the user to lease their car for a set period, then trade it in for a newer model. With strong demand at home and exports thriving, there are even suggestions that Britain\u2019s carmakers could raise output levels to 2m within the next few years. In the past two years, more than \u00a37bn has been invested in UK car production facilities, with several new models coming on stream. Last month Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to spend \u00a3600m at its West Midlands site, including \u00a3450m for the manufacture of the Jaguar-XF aluminium-bodied car in Castle Bromwich. In Coventry, the company plans to double the size of its headquarters, adding a centre for research and advanced engineering. The expansion could indirectly create between 7,000 and 11,000 more jobs through the supply chain, and involves the purchase of a 62-acre site. In another boost for Coventry, Geely unveiled plans to create 1,000 jobs at a \u00a3250m plant building low-emission black cabs. Then Honda secured the future of its Swindon factory with a \u00a3200m investment in making a five-door version of its Civic hatchback, one of its most popular European models. Honda had cut jobs and production at Swindon two years ago, but the news has laid to rest fears the plant could be mothballed. Honda\u2019s head of European operations, Toshiaki Mikoshiba, has unveiled four new models for the European market and says that the company has a \u201crenewed optimism and purpose in Europe\u201d. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, declared that it had been \u201ca fantastic week for UK automotive\u201d. There was, he said, no precedent for as much investment in the industry in such a short period. \u201cUK car manufacturing is now more diverse than ever, with a unique combination of volume, premium and specialist brands giving our products truly global appeal.\u201d Back at Longbridge, the last Austin Metro rolled off the production line a long time ago, but the name of British motoring\u2019s founding father lives on in the newly created Austin Park. Here the river Rea, which had been buried in a culvert to make way for industrial development, has been brought back to the surface. Illuminated for a festival of light last October, it runs all the way to Birmingham city centre and has caught the eye of a new generation of town planners, who are wondering whether a cycle route linking the centre to the suburbs might help to transform a very car-centric city. At Longbridge, that transformation is already well under way. Longbridge\u2019s history: Red Robbo, Shanghai and the Phoenix Four Situated between urban Birmingham and the picturesque Lickey hills, Longbridge had always been unashamedly industrial; a pioneering car plant, a wartime munitions maker, a driving force for the local economy and beyond. That has made it a political nightmare for generations of politicians terrified of losing the jobs it represents, either directly or through the tentacles of its supply chain. It was an industrial, as well as a political, battleground, where Longbridge union convenor Derek \u201cRed Robbo\u201d Robinson clashed repeatedly with British Leyland\u2019s acerbic South African boss Sir Michael Edwardes \u2013 whose empire included Longbridge \u2013 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1988 an exasperated Thatcher government eventually sold Rover \u2013 as British Leyland had subsequently become \u2013 to British Aerospace who, just six years later, passed it to Germany\u2019s BMW. Fast-forward another six years and BMW had also had enough. The German carmaker\u2019s owners, the Quandt family, had become increasingly concerned by the losses being clocked up at the \u201cEnglish patient\u201d. Rover had to go. Land Rover was snapped up by Ford \u2013 which had bought Jaguar a decade earlier \u2013 but the bulk of the operation, including Longbridge, was sold to Phoenix Venture Holdings, a consortium of four businessmen: John Towers, John Edwards, Peter Beale and Nick Stephenson. Quickly dubbed the \u201cPhoenix Four\u201d, they promised to maintain volume manufacturing. BMW paid heavily for the Phoenix Four to take the business off its hands, bestowing what amounted to a \u00a3475m \u201cdowry\u201d on the company in exchange for a nominal sum. But if BMW was desperate to unload Longbridge, it was careful to keep the Mini, with production switching from the West Midlands to Cowley in exchange for Rover 75 production . The relief that greeted the Phoenix deal did not last long. The consortium\u2019s plan was that MG Rover Group, as the new carmaker was named, would build 200,000 cars a year at Longbridge \u2013 a target that was to prove elusive. Phoenix was no more successful in finding the international partner Rover needed to secure its long term future than anyone else had been. A string of possible candidates came and went before, in spring 2004, negotiations began with a state-owned Chinese carmaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. Talks dragged on for almost a year as SAIC became increasingly concerned about the long term viability of its would-be partner, as well as the potential redundancy and pension liabilities with which it might be saddled. Without the cash from a joint venture, Rover was running out of road. Last-ditch support from Downing Street and a possible \u00a3110m bridging loan failed to reassure SAIC. By Thursday 7 April 2005, and despite frantic efforts, MG Rover\u2019s board decided to seek advice on the \u201cprobable imminent administration\u201d of the group and the next day officially went into administration, leaving more than 6,000 workers without jobs and Rover\u2019s creditors owed almost \u00a31.3bn. In the wake of the closure, unemployment in the immediate Longbridge area doubled over the next five years. Adjacent Northfield and the wider Birmingham area showed sharp increases in joblessness over the same period. It could have been even worse: many Rover suppliers, alerted by what happened in 2000 when BMW sold out, had used the following five years to reduce their dependence on the plant. The collapse triggered an outburst of anger and recrimination, mainly directed at the Phoenix Four, some of which is still felt today. It took Department of Trade and Industry inspectors four years to untangle what had happened. Unsurprisingly, their report was critical of the Phoenix Four, not least because during their stewardship they had become multimillionaires despite the group\u2019s demise, receiving \u201clarge, and we say unreasonably large, financial rewards totalling tens of millions of pounds\u201d, according to the inspectors. Two years later, all four men were disqualified from being company directors for varying periods. Richard Burden, the Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield then and now, still believes the Phoenix Four owe a debt to the workforce: \u201cWe are still saying to the Phoenix Four they should provide some recognition\u2026 putting their hands in their pockets. It would help people to move on, to have closure on the closure.\u201d",

It could have been even worse: many Rover suppliers, alerted by what happened in 2000 when BMW sold out, had used the following five years to reduce their dependence on the plant.</p> <p>The collapse triggered an outburst of anger and recrimination, mainly directed at the Phoenix Four, some of which is still felt today. It took Department of Trade and Industry inspectors four years to untangle what had happened. Unsurprisingly, their report was critical of the Phoenix Four, not least because during their stewardship they had become multimillionaires despite the group\u2019s demise, receiving \u201clarge, and we say unreasonably large, financial rewards totalling tens of millions of pounds\u201d, according to the inspectors.</p> <p>Two years later, all four men were disqualified from being company directors for varying periods.</p> <p>Richard Burden, the Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield then and now, still believes the Phoenix Four owe a debt to the workforce: \u201cWe are still saying to the Phoenix Four they should provide some recognition\u2026 putting their hands in their pockets. It would help people to move on, to have closure on the closure.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Corporate Britain\u2019s least favourite time of the year is almost here. Each spring, the bosses of the UK\u2019s biggest companies traipse to conference centres to be interrogated, abused and occasionally praised by shareholders at their company\u2019s annual general meetings. Weeks of preparation go into a big AGM \u2013 from rehearsals for the chairman and chief executive to negotiations with big investors to head off potential revolts. There has never been such a range of pressures on companies at AGMs as there are now. During the so-called shareholder spring of 2012, large investors, blamed for not holding boards to account before the financial crisis, rebelled against pay and other governance matters at some of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. Bosses were humiliated and some were forced out. Political pressure has mounted over the outsize pay packages earned by bosses. Business secretary Vince Cable forced companies last year to publish more detail on pay and to put their policies to a binding shareholder vote. Companies also face protests from activists on environmental and social questions such as climate change and the treatment of workers. Disgruntled small shareholders whose dividend has been cut, and the possibility of raids by activist investors, are further headaches. One City investor says: \u201cBG, AstraZeneca, Prudential \u2013 for anybody who is in the headlines there will be a sizeable vote against all sorts of things.\u201d Here are some of the potential flashpoints at this year\u2019s AGM season. HSBC The reputation of Britain\u2019s biggest bank has been battered in the past year, not least by the Guardian\u2019s revelation that HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm enabled tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver and chairman Douglas Flint, who said the Swiss affair was \u201ctotally humbling\u201d, will face tough questions. Shareholder groups may also target Rona Fairhead, who chaired the audit and risk committee, at the AGM on 24 April. They argue Fairhead, who also chairs the BBC Trust, could not have scrutinised the bank\u2019s activities independently because it paid her \u00a3513,000 last year. HSBC has also said it wants to increase Flint\u2019s salary. There are likely to be protests at that and Gulliver\u2019s \u00a37.6m pay package. BG GROUP The oil and gas company was forced to stage a partial climbdown in December over a \u00a325m pay deal it had agreed with new boss Helge Lund. But the matter didn\u2019t end there. The former boss of Norway\u2019s Statoil national oil company could still get the full amount, albeit for more stretching targets, and his annual salary of \u00a31.5m is higher than those of the chief executives at bigger rivals BP and Shell. BG admits investors are still furious about the affair. Now they could vote against BG\u2019s remuneration report and the re-election of chairman Andrew Gould, who also heads the nominations committee. Paul Hewitt of shareholder advisory group Manifest says: \u201cSome of BG\u2019s largest shareholders were given minutes\u2019 rather than days\u2019 or weeks\u2019 notice of their intentions. If I was a significant investor I would be very, very disappointed.\u201d WPP Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, was one of the bosses caught up in the 2012 shareholders\u2019 revolt. Investors voted down his pay package, forcing the world\u2019s biggest advertising company to replace its long-term share scheme. But it has continued to pay out, and Sorrell\u2019s \u00a336m share bonus for 2014 will take his total earnings for the year to more than \u00a345m. Nearly 30% of shareholders refused to endorse Sorrell\u2019s \u00a330m payout under the scheme at last year\u2019s AGM and a further rebellion is expected in June. A fund manager at a big City investor says: \u201cThe people who opposed it last year will oppose it this year.\u201d BP BP has accepted a resolution proposed by environmental campaigners and pension funds, including the Church of England, requiring the oil company to report on whether its business complies with an international agreement to limit global warming to 2C. Royal Dutch Shell has already accepted the resolution, which also bans executive bonuses for climate-harming activities. BP\u2019s board has recommended a yes vote for the resolution. But when it comes to executive pay, BP is less popular. Bob Dudley, its chief executive, was paid $12.7m (\u00a38.5m) last year \u2013 25% more than in 2013. The increase was mainly due to a deferred bonus from 2011, but in 2014 Dudley cut jobs, froze employees\u2019 salaries and missed all his safety targets. Pirc, the shareholder consultancy, recommends investors oppose BP\u2019s remuneration report at the AGM on 16 April. TESCO It is hard to imagine how the time since the last AGM could have gone any worse for Britain\u2019s biggest retailer. Phil Clarke was ejected as chief executive in September after a string of profit warnings. His replacement, Dave Lewis, uncovered a \u00a3263m hole in its profit projections. Tesco faces a series of inquiries over the scandal, including by the Financial Conduct Authority. Lewis decided to close or abandon almost 100 stores and half-year profits fell 92% to \u00a3112m. Lewis and his new team will probably get support at the AGM in June but small shareholders will probably be very vocal over Tesco\u2019s decision to slash its dividend by 75%. The grocer will also be the main target of campaigners trying to get big retailers to pay employees the living wage. SPORTS DIRECT INTERNATIONAL Last year it took threats of a shareholder revolt to force the retailer to back down on a plan for a multimillion-pound bonus plan for its founder, Mike Ashley. Since then the billionaire, who is Sports Direct\u2019s deputy chairman, has lent credence to the belief that there is no check on his power at the company. Last month he insisted he was too busy to appear before MPs to answer questions about zero-hours contracts \u2013 about 80% of the retailer\u2019s staff are on them \u2013 and the closure of a subsidiary in Scotland. The Institute of Directors said last week that Sports Direct\u2019s board was dysfunctional and did not check Ashley\u2019s powers. It urged shareholders to use the AGM to show their dissatisfaction. ALLIANCE TRUST The FTSE 250 investment trust is under attack by Elliott Advisors, an aggressive US investor. Elliott says Alliance\u2019s chief executive, Katherine Garrett-Cox, has been regularly overpaid for poor financial performance. The activist fund is trying to woo at least 50,000 small shareholders to vote for three new directors it has nominated. With Garrett-Cox holding firm, expect fireworks at the AGM on 29 April.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "<p>Witeck advised the retail giant to stand against anti-gay legislation in an age when LGBT rights in corporate America is \u2018a matter of value to everyone\u2019</p>", 
      "body": "<p>When Walmart <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/31/walmart-arkansas-religious-freedom-bill-sends-wrong-message\">sided</a> with gay rights by saying that Arkansas\u2019s religious freedom reformation act sends the \u201cwrong message\u201d, it surprised many. The nation\u2019s largest employer is more commonly associated with low wages and red-state religious values than with LGBT rights.</p> <p>But in working with Bob Witeck, the DC-based head of the gay and lesbian-focused communications group Witeck Communications, Walmart addressed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/31/tim-cook-apple-combat-anti-lgbt-laws-pay-lobbyists-not-lip-service\">charges by critics</a> that it ought to put its money where its mouth is, and lobby to avert <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/02/asa-hutchinson-arkansas-rfra_n_6995826.html\">dangerous anti-gay legislation</a> in its own backyard. </p> <p>Like most consultants, Witeck doesn\u2019t like to say too much about what he and his clients talk about. But in an interview with the Guardian, he offered some insight into how corporations have evolved in this regard. </p> <p>Witeck began focusing on LGBT communications about 22 years ago, when he worked with American Airlines. In 1993, as gay activists flew back to Dallas after attending an HIV/Aids march in DC, an AA flight crew wanted to remove the pillows and blankets the activists used, \u201cas if AIDS was transmitted that casually\u201d.</p> <p>This caused a huge flap, which, he says, \u201cwasn\u2019t just a PR problem, but a problem of all kinds\u201d. In the blowback, he met with AA\u2019s medical director, their legal director and their senior directors to help them better understand HIV and to help them engage their employees to understand what it means to be an LGBT worker in America.</p> <p>In those days, Witeck says, he had to convince corporate America that \u201cnot everyone is Don Draper. Not everyone is a straight, white male executive\u201d. It also meant challenging what \u201cfamily\u201d meant whenever a company invokes that word for marketing purposes. \u201cFamily can be a rightwing codeword,\u201d he says, \u201cor it can be a word that means something to everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Pointing this out two decades ago meant Witeck had to demonstrate \u201cthe risk and reward of any campaign\u201d with LGBT people \u2013 with the risks being quite high. Today, family values are not always considered at odds with LGBT values to the American consumer public; indeed, Witeck says, the rewards are increasingly \u201cbigger than the risk\u201d.</p> <p>When you have Oakland A\u2019s pitcher Sean Doolittle and his girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.outsports.com/2015/3/31/8324469/oakland-pitcher-sean-doolittle-and-girlfriend-buy-ticket-to-fill\">offering to buy out</a> unwanted tickets to a gay-themed baseball promotion night, and wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin giving a <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/stone-cold-steve-austin-gives-a-nsfw-defense-of-gay-m-1566573678\">profanity-laced tirade</a> for gay rights, the issue is no longer \u201csimply about inclusion of LGBT people, but a matter of value to everyone. This is important to sisters, family members, neighbors\u201d of queer people, Witeck says, \u201cand especially to millennials, who are adamant about this\u201d.</p> <p>An early reason corporate America waded tepidly into these fights was because they \u201cwanted top talent\u201d, which often includes gay executives. After Massachussets made same-sex marriage legal more than a decade ago, it was an outlier to be able to have a recognized gay union. It \u201cdidn\u2019t become palpable until the last five years\u201d, Witeck says of corporate America, that they could be losing talent all over the country to queer families who won\u2019t give up their legal protections easily where they have them.</p> <p>Corporate America has, improbably enough, been stepping in as state legislatures roll back rights for LGBT workers in increasingly aggressive ways: the \u201cboldest\u201d move, Witeck notes, was Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff <a href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/04/03/salesforce-ceo-offers-50000-in-relocation-for-employees-uncomfortable-with-indiana-laws-effect-on-gays/\">offering employees $50,000 relocation packages</a> to move from Indiana if they feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>But not all LGBT employees, especially Walmart workers who live in Arkansas, are executives who can pick up and move to a new state. Witeck says that when he first started working with corporations on these issues, he had to help them understand LGBT rights don\u2019t affect only gay versions of Don Draper, but \u201cchambermaids\u201d, people for whom English isn\u2019t their first language, and blue-collar workers. </p> <p>Walmart\u2019s workers, gay and straight, are notoriously known to be among the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.jwj.org/walmarts-food-stamp-scam-explained-in-one-easy-chart\">most economically exploited</a> in the nation. Yet Walmart recently announced it is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml\">modestly raising its wages</a>, though not by nearly as much as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/31/tim-cook-apple-combat-anti-lgbt-laws-pay-lobbyists-not-lip-service\">Fight for $15 </a>would like. Witeck gives Walmart a lot of credit for understanding this \u201cmovement among employees about wages and benefits\u201d. Walmart and McDonald\u2019s are moving, if too slowly, to reflect how voters are acting. \u201cThere was big support for wage increases everywhere, during an otherwise Republican wave,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Witeck\u2019s career has shown that corporate America can change if its customers and employees push hard enough. The first beneficiaries of widespread LGBT rights were married couples and corporate executives in progressive states. The second wave seems to be LGBT workers who happen to live in a state where corporations wield the can of political power a Walmart can flex in Arkansas. Perhaps a third wave \u2013 if Americans can demand that all low-wage workers deserve the same civil rights as the American zeitgeist is currently demanding for some LGBT workers \u2013 can demand Walmart be pushed to pay its workers a civil wage, as it is pushing on Arkansas to provide its workers civil rights.</p>",

The nation\u2019s largest employer is more commonly associated with low wages and red-state religious values than with LGBT rights. But in working with Bob Witeck, the DC-based head of the gay and lesbian-focused communications group Witeck Communications, Walmart addressed charges by critics that it ought to put its money where its mouth is, and lobby to avert dangerous anti-gay legislation in its own backyard. Like most consultants, Witeck doesn\u2019t like to say too much about what he and his clients talk about. But in an interview with the Guardian, he offered some insight into how corporations have evolved in this regard. Witeck began focusing on LGBT communications about 22 years ago, when he worked with American Airlines. In 1993, as gay activists flew back to Dallas after attending an HIV/Aids march in DC, an AA flight crew wanted to remove the pillows and blankets the activists used, \u201cas if AIDS was transmitted that casually\u201d. This caused a huge flap, which, he says, \u201cwasn\u2019t just a PR problem, but a problem of all kinds\u201d. In the blowback, he met with AA\u2019s medical director, their legal director and their senior directors to help them better understand HIV and to help them engage their employees to understand what it means to be an LGBT worker in America. In those days, Witeck says, he had to convince corporate America that \u201cnot everyone is Don Draper. Not everyone is a straight, white male executive\u201d. It also meant challenging what \u201cfamily\u201d meant whenever a company invokes that word for marketing purposes. \u201cFamily can be a rightwing codeword,\u201d he says, \u201cor it can be a word that means something to everyone.\u201d Pointing this out two decades ago meant Witeck had to demonstrate \u201cthe risk and reward of any campaign\u201d with LGBT people \u2013 with the risks being quite high. Today, family values are not always considered at odds with LGBT values to the American consumer public; indeed, Witeck says, the rewards are increasingly \u201cbigger than the risk\u201d. When you have Oakland A\u2019s pitcher Sean Doolittle and his girlfriend offering to buy out unwanted tickets to a gay-themed baseball promotion night, and wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin giving a profanity-laced tirade for gay rights, the issue is no longer \u201csimply about inclusion of LGBT people, but a matter of value to everyone. This is important to sisters, family members, neighbors\u201d of queer people, Witeck says, \u201cand especially to millennials, who are adamant about this\u201d. An early reason corporate America waded tepidly into these fights was because they \u201cwanted top talent\u201d, which often includes gay executives. After Massachussets made same-sex marriage legal more than a decade ago, it was an outlier to be able to have a recognized gay union. It \u201cdidn\u2019t become palpable until the last five years\u201d, Witeck says of corporate America, that they could be losing talent all over the country to queer families who won\u2019t give up their legal protections easily where they have them. Corporate America has, improbably enough, been stepping in as state legislatures roll back rights for LGBT workers in increasingly aggressive ways: the \u201cboldest\u201d move, Witeck notes, was Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff offering employees $50,000 relocation packages to move from Indiana if they feel uncomfortable. But not all LGBT employees, especially Walmart workers who live in Arkansas, are executives who can pick up and move to a new state. Witeck says that when he first started working with corporations on these issues, he had to help them understand LGBT rights don\u2019t affect only gay versions of Don Draper, but \u201cchambermaids\u201d, people for whom English isn\u2019t their first language, and blue-collar workers. Walmart\u2019s workers, gay and straight, are notoriously known to be among the most economically exploited in the nation. Yet Walmart recently announced it is modestly raising its wages, though not by nearly as much as the Fight for $15 would like. Witeck gives Walmart a lot of credit for understanding this \u201cmovement among employees about wages and benefits\u201d. Walmart and McDonald\u2019s are moving, if too slowly, to reflect how voters are acting. \u201cThere was big support for wage increases everywhere, during an otherwise Republican wave,\u201d he says. Witeck\u2019s career has shown that corporate America can change if its customers and employees push hard enough. The first beneficiaries of widespread LGBT rights were married couples and corporate executives in progressive states. The second wave seems to be LGBT workers who happen to live in a state where corporations wield the can of political power a Walmart can flex in Arkansas. Perhaps a third wave \u2013 if Americans can demand that all low-wage workers deserve the same civil rights as the American zeitgeist is currently demanding for some LGBT workers \u2013 can demand Walmart be pushed to pay its workers a civil wage, as it is pushing on Arkansas to provide its workers civil rights.",
