    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2022 Lord Mandelson didn't quite say the last Labour government constructed its economic case for HS2 on the back of a fag packet to chase votes, but you caught his drift. The estimates were \"almost entirely speculative\" but \"the vision was exciting\" and \"we were focusing on the coming electoral battle\", he wrote in the FT this week. Lord Adonis, transport secretary at the time, gave a very different account to this newspaper \u2013 the cost/benefit analysis was \"robust and thorough\", he said. But Mandelson's other revelation deserves to sound the death-knell for the HS2 high-speed railway in its current form: Labour assumed the project would attract private capital. As if. As the current government is discovering with its new nuclear ambitions, private capital's appetite for risk evaporates when the investment bill starts at a few tens of billions and rises with every revision. The cost of building a high-speed railway between London and the north was only ever going to sit firmly with the public purse. That being so, the numbers matter, and the National Audit Office's comprehensive shredding of the Department for Transport's assumptions \u2013 highlighted here at the time \u2013 should be read by every taxpayer. The headline-grabber was the bogus notion that business folk do no work on trains, but the list is long. For example: HS2's models used the same average fares for high speed and conventional rail to forecast passenger demand. The same fares? When the DfT applies realism, it will probably discover that most travellers from Birmingham would not choose to pay twice the price to arrive in London half an hour earlier. The experience of the underused M6 toll road supports that point. But HS2 is needed to free capacity on the west coast mainline, say its supporters. Well, the capacity problem clearly needs to be addressed and, as Adonis said, there aren't any cheap options. But, with HS2's projected costs hitting \u00a342.5bn, it's time for a re-examination of alternatives. The traditional way for political parties to climb down from entrenched positions on big infrastructure projects is to call for an external review, as happened with runway capacity in the south-east. That is what should happen now. It's not the visionary way, but we've had our fill of expensive visions. As the true cost of HS2 is revealed, there may even be votes for the first main political party to call for a rethink. \u2022 As the Co-operative Group commissions an independent postmortem on its banking catastrophe, the questions keep coming. Here's one: why did regulators let the Co-op Bank's talks with Lloyds to buy 632 branches run for so long? It's relevant because it was confirmed this week that the negotiations with Lloyds were always a bit of a farce. Andrew Bailey, head of the Bank of England's prudential regulation authority, told the Treasury select committee that he warned the Co-op Bank towards the end of 2011 that it needed more capital and better IT. Indeed, Bailey, then at the Financial Services Authority, told the Co-op to warn Lloyds that the branch talks could be a waste of time: \"I was very insistent that Lloyds were told \u2026 there was a reasonable probability that [the deal] was not going to happen.\" Lloyds \u2013 or, at least, its chairman, Sir Win Bischoff \u2013 claims it was in the dark until December 2012, three months before the transaction finally collapsed, but that's merely an intriguing sub-plot. The key question is why the regulators, having spotted the Co-op Bank's capital problems in 2011, didn't press the organisation harder to get its house in order. The mutual seems to have been treated with kid gloves. At the regulator's prompting, the Co-op secured sales of its insurance businesses during 2012 but we now know those deals didn't come close to securing enough capital \u2013 that's why there is a \u00a31.5bn hole. Nor would the arrival of Lloyds' overcapitalised branches have solved the problem: Bailey was clear this week that there would still have been a shortfall. Some suspect the regulator was swept up by the political cheerleading for the transaction. That would be a disgrace, and the regulators would deny any such notion. But contrast the treatment of Co-op Bank with the PRA's current approach to Barclays and Nationwide, two stronger and better-managed organisations. They have been told (quite rightly) to get their leverage ratios up to scratch in a hurry. Yet the Co-op was allowed to bumble along for 18 months. Was that because the Co-op Bank, as a relative tiddler, presented no danger to the health of the overall system? That would be vaguely reassuring. Or did the regulator fail to see the true flow of poison from the loans inherited with the 2009 Britannia merger? That explanation would be alarming: we would want to know a lot more about what questions the regulator was asking and what information the Co-op was providing. Andrew Tyrie's Treasury committee should keep pressing. \u2022 Mark Carney may find the \"forward guidance\" lark is harder than it looks. On Thursday, the new governor of Bank of England snapped his fingers, announced that the market's implied view of interest rates was \"not warranted\" and saw a spectacular reaction. Sterling fell, share prices soared and, critically, bond yields came down, which is the element that Carney's crew on the monetary policy committee care about most, since it's far from clear that the UK recovery is strong enough to stand higher borrowing costs. Yesterday some of those breezes reversed as the latest US employment data came in very strong. Investors went back to fretting about how soon the US Federal Reserve will rein in its quantitative easing programme. US 10-year bond yields hit 2.7%, dragging UK yields higher too. At the end of a week of uber-doveish medium-term pronouncements in Europe, the yield on two-year gilts was actually higher than at the start. In the pursuit of \"escape velocity\" for the UK economy, that's not helpful. There's a long way to go, of course, but after one week in the job, it's clear that it is easier for the new governor to talk down the pound than lower gilt yields. One out of two ain't bad, one might say. Carney would surely have hoped for both.",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury could sell off the first chunk of its stake in Lloyds Banking Group as early as August to coincide with the bailed out bank's interim results. The timetable is not yet finalised, but the Treasury is believed to be keen to kickstart the sale as soon as possible to show it is able to start returning the bank, which is 39% owned by the taxpayer, to the private sector. The preparations contrast with Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 81% government-owned and was warned on Friday by Moody's that it faced a possible downgrade. The ratings agency issued the warning because of the review commissioned by the Treasury into whether the bank should be broken up. Lloyds' interim results are due on 1 August, and while a share sale would not be possible before then, a placing of shares could take place shortly afterwards, depending on the bank's share price. George Osborne said in his Mansion House speech last month that big City institutions were most likely to be offered the chance to buy shares first. But the Treasury is also testing the water about a sale of a stake up to 10% to cash-rich sovereign wealth funds. The BBC reported that the Treasury wanted to make sure that any stake going to a sovereign wealth fund was sold at a premium to the current share price of 65p. This will seen as an attempt to appease the City institutions, investing on behalf of pension funds and long-term savers, which have been holding shares in Lloyds throughout the bailout and would not want outside governments to be offered shares at a discount. The pricing of the first sale will be crucial and the Lloyds share price may need to be above 70p to enable a share placing to be priced at a slight discount. One guide could be the discount to market prices at which the Swedish government placed a stake in Nordea Bank last month. Speculation about a sale of Lloyds has been swirling since 1 March, when the Treasury linked part of the bonus of the bank's boss, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, to selling off part of the stake above 61p. It intensified after Osborne told his Mansion House audience that he was \"actively considering options for share sales in Lloyds\". After a placing for institutional investors, he said that a \"retail offering to the general public\" would be considered later. A Treasury spokesman said the chancellor's position had not changed since last month's Mansion House speech, when Osborne had not set out a timetable for any share sale. During evidence to the Treasury select committee last year, Richard Buxton, then the head of UK equities at Schroders, said he would be disappointed if there was a sale to a sovereign wealth fund which was then able to a make a lot of money. He said: \"If you are prepared to be patient you don't have to give the taxpayers' money to a sovereign wealth fund.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One Canadian in a new job helped give the UK market its best week for more than six months, but several thousand Americans joining the workforce took some of the shine off shares. Mark Carney, the ex-boss of Canada's central bank, made a strong impression in his first week as governor of the Bank of England, sending shares soaring and the pound plunging when he indicated on Thursday there would be no rise in interest rates for the foreseeable future. Investors had become increasing nervous about an increase in the cost of borrowing as the economy recovered, but Carney made a point of stamping on that idea. So the FTSE 100 finished the week at 6375.52, a gain of 160 points or 2.6% since Monday morning and its best weekly performance since the first week in January. But the index fell 46.15 points on Friday after better than expected US employment numbers - non-farm payrolls rose by 195,000 compared to expectations of a gain of 165,000 - reinforced the idea the US Federal Reserve would soon end its $85bn a month bond buying programme, removing a key support for stock markets. The fall in sterling, which reached its lowest level for four months, was bad news for anyone planning a foreign holiday but should brings benefits to UK companies with overseas earnings. Analyst Gerard Lane at Shore Capital said the pound was still overvalued: Sterling can (should or needs to, some would say) fall below parity with the euro and $1.30 to arrive at something close to fair value, i.e. some 20% below current levels. Sectors and stocks with UK located costs and overseas revenues would be natural beneficiaries, as would those listed entities with non-UK profits that translate these into sterling earnings and dividends. All in all it was another volatile week for investors. The eurozone crisis reared its head again, with Portugal facing new uncertainty after two ministers resigned from the coalition government, seemingly in protest at the country's austerity measures. Meanwhile Greek politicians were locked in talks with representatives of the Troika of creditors - the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission - to hammer out a deal over cutbacks to meet the country's bailout targets. On top of that came a military coup in Egypt, with violence erupting after protests against the ousting of former president Mohamed Morsi. With renewed worries about a slowdown in China and metal prices hit by a rising dollar, mining shares came under pressure. Glencore Xstrata dropped 17.9p to 256.85p while Antofagasta fell 50.5p to 784.5p and Rio Tinto lost 121.5p to \u00a326.36. Elsewhere Marks &amp; Spencer added 2.9p to 462.7p ahead of next week's trading statement following a buy note from Panmure Gordon and amid vague bid speculation. British Land built up a 7p gain to 591.5p after making a bet on the success of London's new Crossrail system. The east-west rail line is due to open in 2018 and ahead of that, the property group has bought the bulk of an office, shops and hotel complex in Paddington near the Crossrail station. It has paid \u00a3470m to insurance group Aviva to take over the scheme, which it expects to grow in value as the area is redeveloped. RSA Insurance rose 1.5p to 123p after analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove issued an overweight recommendation with a 132p price target: We remain positive on the stock following management's decision to cut the dividend. High returns and growth opportunities in the international business combined with the prospect of a gradual turnaround in UK underwriting continue to underpin valuation. The stock continues to offer an attractive yield of 5% and 11% upside potential to our target price. The main catalysts for the shares are delivering on the underwriting targets, growing the international franchise, and addressing the challenging outlook for the UK motor lines. But Whitbread slipped 89p to \u00a331.067 after UBS cut from buy to neutral although the bank raised its target price from \u00a329 to \u00a331.50. Earlier in the week the leisure group unveiled plans for new compact hotels for its Premier Inn brand. Elsewhere Inmarsat dipped another 4.5p to 665p after falling sharply earlier in the week in the wake of a rocket explosion in Russia. The communication group was not part of the launch, but the Proton rockets used were due to send its next generation of satellites into space by the end of the year, and analysts feared Tuesday's accident could lead to delays. A number of housebuilders reported positive updates during the week, with sales boosted by the government's Help to Buy scheme. They included Persimmon, down 10p to \u00a312.56 on profit taking, Taylor Wimpey, 1p lower at 102.8p, and Redrow, up 7.7p at 245.6p after Jefferies and Deutsche Bank raised their price targets for the company.",

      "body": "<p>One Canadian in a new job helped give the UK market its best week for more than six months, but several thousand Americans joining the workforce took some of the shine off shares.</p> <p>Mark Carney, the ex-boss of Canada's central bank, made a strong impression in his first week as governor of the Bank of England, sending shares soaring and the pound plunging when he indicated on Thursday there would be no rise in interest rates for the foreseeable future. Investors had become increasing nervous about an increase in the cost of borrowing as the economy recovered, but Carney made a point of stamping on that idea.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished the week at 6375.52, a gain of 160 points or 2.6% since Monday morning and its best weekly performance since the first week in January.</p> <p>But the index fell 46.15 points on Friday after better than expected US employment numbers - non-farm payrolls rose by 195,000 compared to expectations of a gain of 165,000 - reinforced the idea the US Federal Reserve would soon end its $85bn a month bond buying programme, removing a key support for stock markets.</p> <p>The fall in sterling, which reached its lowest level for four months, was bad news for anyone planning a foreign holiday but should brings benefits to UK companies with overseas earnings. Analyst Gerard Lane at Shore Capital said the pound was still overvalued:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sterling can (should or needs to, some would say) fall below parity with the euro and $1.30 to arrive at something close to fair value, i.e. some 20% below current levels. Sectors and stocks with UK located costs and overseas revenues would be natural beneficiaries, as would those listed entities with non-UK profits that translate these into sterling earnings and dividends. </p> </blockquote> <p>All in all it was another volatile week for investors. The eurozone crisis reared its head again, with Portugal facing new uncertainty after two ministers resigned from the coalition government, seemingly in protest at the country's austerity measures. Meanwhile Greek politicians were locked in talks with representatives of the Troika of creditors - the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission - to hammer out a deal over cutbacks to meet the country's bailout targets.</p> <p>On top of that came a military coup in Egypt, with violence erupting after protests against the ousting of former president Mohamed Morsi.</p> <p>With renewed worries about a slowdown in China and metal prices hit by a rising dollar, mining shares came under pressure. <strong>Glencore Xstrata</strong> dropped 17.9p to 256.85p while <strong>Antofagasta</strong> fell 50.5p to 784.5p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 121.5p to \u00a326.36.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer </strong> added 2.9p to 462.7p ahead of next week's trading statement following a buy note from Panmure Gordon and amid vague bid speculation.</p> <p><strong>British Land </strong>built up a 7p gain to 591.5p after making a bet on the success of London's new Crossrail system.</p> <p>The east-west rail line is due to open in 2018 and ahead of that, the property group has bought the bulk of an office, shops and hotel complex in Paddington near the Crossrail station. It has paid \u00a3470m to insurance group Aviva to take over the scheme, which it expects to grow in value as the area is redeveloped.</p> <p><strong>RSA Insurance </strong>rose 1.5p to 123p after analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove issued an overweight recommendation with a 132p price target:</p> <blockquote> <p>We remain positive on the stock following management's decision to cut the dividend. High returns and growth opportunities in the international business combined with the prospect of a gradual turnaround in UK underwriting continue to underpin valuation. The stock continues to offer an attractive yield of 5% and 11% upside potential to our target price. The main catalysts for the shares are delivering on the underwriting targets, growing the international franchise, and addressing the challenging outlook for the UK motor lines.</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Whitbread</strong> slipped 89p to \u00a331.067 after UBS cut from buy to neutral although the bank raised its target price from \u00a329 to \u00a331.50. Earlier in the week the leisure group unveiled plans for new compact hotels for its Premier Inn brand.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Inmarsat</strong> dipped another 4.5p to 665p after falling sharply earlier in the week in the wake of a rocket explosion in Russia. The communication group was not part of the launch, but the Proton rockets used were due to send its next generation of satellites into space by the end of the year, and analysts feared Tuesday's accident could lead to delays.</p> <p>A number of housebuilders reported positive updates during the week, with sales boosted by the government's Help to Buy scheme. They included <strong>Persimmon</strong>, down 10p to \u00a312.56 on profit taking, <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong>, 1p lower at 102.8p, and <strong>Redrow</strong>, up 7.7p at 245.6p after Jefferies and Deutsche Bank raised their price targets for the company.</p>",

The resulting 20 basis point leap in 10-year Treasury yields suggests the markets are fast adopting our view that QE3 tapering will begin in September.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tanweer Akram, </strong>vice-president of Fixed Income at ING, agrees:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decent improvement in employment is likely to induce the Fed to begin moderately tapering its asset purchase program by September of this year, even though the unemployment rate is still high and broader measures of slack in the labor market (such as labor force participation rate, employment to population ratio, and U-6 unemployment rate) remains substantial while inflation is undershooting the Fed\u2019s long-term target.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Kelly</strong>, chief global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, argues that the non-farm payroll shows steady progress:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This morning\u2019s jobs report is the latest confirmation that, despite significant fiscal drag, the American economy continues to expand at a steady pace. With today\u2019s data, payroll job growth has averaged a steady 202,000 since the start of the year.</p> <p>Despite the strong payrolls number, other areas of the report showed less progress with the unemployment rate steady at 7.6%, with offsetting solid gains in the labour force and employment. In addition, the average workweek unchanged and only 10,000 jobs added in the highly-cyclical area of temporary workers.</p> <p>Significantly, the average hourly earnings of all private employees rose by 10 cents and are now up 2.2% year over year, the strongest year-over-year gain in almost two years.</p> <p>Overall, while this morning\u2019s report was by no means a block-buster, it does show a U.S. economy that is steadily moving forward. For the equity market, this should translate into moderate earnings growth supporting higher stock prices. However, the bond market, even after recent increases in interest rates is still priced for an economy that is moving backwards.</p> <p>Nothing in today\u2019s report should really change the Fed\u2019s timetable for removing quantitative easing and raising short-term interest rates. However, it is important to recognize that bond yields are still not appropriate given this timetable suggesting a continued rough environment for fixed income.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51d6d459e4b06ec4d6f61799\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-05T14:12:42.162Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Gold price falls 3%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gold is, once again, the principle casualty as analysts anticipate an end to the Fed's QE programme -- it has tumbled 3% to $1,211/ounce.&#xa0;</p> <p>Heck of a fall from the heady days of $1,900 / ounce in September 2011, as goldbugs anticipated rollicking inflation as central banks printed money with reckless abandon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kevindepew/statuses/353149353927516162\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Pretty soon there&#39;ll be guys standing out by Grand Central with &quot;Soup 4 Gold&quot; signs.</p>&mdash; Kevin Depew (@kevindepew) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevindepew/statuses/353149353927516162\">July 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51d6d16ce4b0b843c588ef68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-05T14:00:12.769Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the bond selloff....here's a graph from Tradeweb of the US 10-year Treasury bond's yield (<em>a measure of the interest rate on the bond</em>) over the last two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-56bb74df-d20d-440f-82f2-830116bbaedc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373032417109/7fca372d-42b6-484e-8224-d61fa818f98d-460x400.jpeg\" alt=\"US 10-year Treasury yields\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Tradeweb</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It shows how the yield hit record lows in 2012 as investors piled into safe-haven debt, as the Feberal Reserve kept stimulating the economy with $85bn of bond purchases each month</p> <p>But the prospect of the Fed tapering (ie, slowing) its stimulus programme has been driving Treasury yields higher for weeks.<strong> Today's jobs report is seen as strengthening Ben Bernanke's hand....</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51d6ce95e4b0f169237a46bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-05T13:48:05.463Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street is open, and the Dow Jones industrial average is rising following today's better-than-expected jobs figures.</p> <p>The Dow is up 83 points in early trading, a rise of 0.57%.</p> <p>In the bond market, though, the US Treasuries keep being clobbered as traders anticipate an end to the Federal Reserve's bond-buying programe,</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51d6c265e4b035e5886aa252\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-05T13:27:42.014Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Non-farm: highlights</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A few key points from today's report into the US jobs market.</strong></p> <p>\u2022 There are still 11.8 million people out of work in America, despite 195,000 new jobs being created in June </p> <p>\u2022 The labor force participation rate crept a little higher, to 63.5% from 63.4% in May.

That can radically change the picture.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>What will it mean for US stimulus measures?</strong> Non-Farm Payroll plays a double-role -- firstly, it's a measure of the labour market; secondly, it's a guide to whether the Federal Reserve will cut its bond-buying activities this year, and end QE next summer.</p> <p>A NFP above 165,000 would probably mean the Fed cracks on with its tapering plans. But a weak figure would give it cause to rethink, and perhaps keep stimulating for longer.</p> <h2>Here's what City analysts are saying</h2> <p>Jane Foley of Rabobank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Very strong data should be good for risk appetite. However, the market\u2019s likely reaction is complicated by the interpretation of what the numbers will mean for the Fed\u2019s decision to taper QE.&#xa0;</p> <p>On June 26 the market celebrated the downside revision of US Q1 GDP on the assumption that this would lead to continued QE. This implies that a lacklustre improvement in US June payrolls could conversely fail to offer support to investor sentiment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Societe Generale:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) update on the employment situation in June will be the first of a trio of such reports that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider in advance of its 17-18 September meeting.</p> <p>A reversal of May's labour-force induced rise in the civilian jobless rate, combined with yet another above-consensus payroll print, likely will reinforce expectations of an asset-purchase tapering announcement at that time.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Dales of Capital Economics:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent survey evidence leaves us content with our forecast that US payroll employment (13.30 BST) rose by around 150,000 in June. That would be slightly smaller than May\u2019s 175,000 gain. The 188,000 rise in the ADP measure of private payroll employment in June and the rebound in the employment index of the ISM non-manufacturing survey in the same month bode well for official payrolls. But the employment index of the ISM manufacturing survey fell to a four-year low. If the alternative household measure of employment and the labour force also both rose by around 150,000, then the unemployment rate would have been stable at 7.6%. A pick-up in jobs growth in the coming months would leave the Fed\u2019s QE3 tapering plans on track.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51d6a449e4b035e5886aa246\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-05T11:27:25.903Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Photos: protests in Athens against public sector layoffs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greek municipal workers held a protest march in Athens today, against the Troika's demands for thousands of civil servants to be cut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e402e208-c531-47be-9483-49f3d4d50a54\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373022947520/eb16fba9-dd5c-4819-9730-2ca1c5cf3d6c-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Municipal workers march in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens on July 5, 2013 after Greek officials have apparently proposed that 4.000 municipal police officers be transferred to the Greek Police force.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d4c65003-3a95-4379-9326-bf4f1785fc1f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373023215625/3156e78e-3414-4338-b3b1-5f0fa5d05c41-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Municipal workers  protest in front of the of the Administrative Reform ministry in Athens on July 5, 2013 after Greek officials have apparently proposed that 4.000 municipal police officers be transferred to the Greek Police force.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marching past the Bank of Greece:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6bf52692-d0a2-44e4-8fb3-e3b72f3ffe23\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373023371738/09150389-d27f-43fb-bbf1-0938300178b6-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Municipal police march by the bank of Greece in Athens on July 5, 2013 after Greek officials apparently proposed that 4000  municipal police officers be transferred to the Greek Police force.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">&nbsp;Photograph: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51d6a43fe4b06ec4d6f61784\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-05T10:47:27.545Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Four hours of talks in Greece later....</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-494519b2-86ff-44d1-83b0-095fb6dede66\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373020728756/dc4b4400-a369-49f2-beaf-58f64c3c1b47-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Deputy Director and Mission Chief to Greece Poul Thomsen (C) leaves the Administrative Reform ministry in Athens July 5, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">IMF mission chief to Greece Poul Thomsen leaving the Administrative Reform ministry in Athens this lunchtime after yet another meeting.

As for equities: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 46.15 points or 0.72% at 6375.52 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 2.36% at 7806 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.46% lower at 3753 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended down 1.74% at 15,533 \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 1.67% to 7868 \u2022 But in Athens the market bucked the trend and added 2.32% to 840 And Wall Street, after soaring higher then falling into the red, is currently on the up, adding 97 points or 0.65%. On that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back on Monday morning. Meanwhile if it's Friday night it must be time for a sovereign downgrade, and here it is (and not exactly a surprise): The rating remains at BB. Speaking of Greece, foreign minister Evangelos Venizelos has paid a trip to Cyprus today to show solidarity with another bailed-out country. He just tweeted a picture of himself and the Cypriot PM: Very jolly.... No progress to report in the eurozone, alas, while I was focusing on the US jobs data (see 1.31pm onwards). Greece: negotations with the Troika over the Greek reform programme continue. Finance minister Yannids Stournaras is understood to be holding talks with top IMF-EU-ECB officials now. Greece's administrative reform minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, could then meet tonight, or tomorrow, to continue negotiations over civil service cuts. And with Olli Rehn talking about paying Greece's next aid loans in installments (details), the chances of all \u20ac8bn being signed off by Monday appears remote. Portugal: No progress in patching up its coalition, since the prime minister talked about a 'formula' for success last night (see here). Here's our news story on the US jobless data, by my colleague on Wall Street, Dominic Rushe: US adds 195,000 new jobs in June but unemployment stays at 7.6% Capital Economics says today's jobs data means the Federal Reserve could start slowing its stimulus package in two months: Any doubts (or hopes!) that the Fed wouldn\u2019t follow through on its plan to taper QE3 later this year in response to some of the recent weaker activity data were dealt a major blow by the 195,000 increase in payroll employment in June. The resulting 20 basis point leap in 10-year Treasury yields suggests the markets are fast adopting our view that QE3 tapering will begin in September. Tanweer Akram, vice-president of Fixed Income at ING, agrees: The decent improvement in employment is likely to induce the Fed to begin moderately tapering its asset purchase program by September of this year, even though the unemployment rate is still high and broader measures of slack in the labor market (such as labor force participation rate, employment to population ratio, and U-6 unemployment rate) remains substantial while inflation is undershooting the Fed\u2019s long-term target. David Kelly, chief global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, argues that the non-farm payroll shows steady progress: This morning\u2019s jobs report is the latest confirmation that, despite significant fiscal drag, the American economy continues to expand at a steady pace. With today\u2019s data, payroll job growth has averaged a steady 202,000 since the start of the year. Despite the strong payrolls number, other areas of the report showed less progress with the unemployment rate steady at 7.6%, with offsetting solid gains in the labour force and employment. In addition, the average workweek unchanged and only 10,000 jobs added in the highly-cyclical area of temporary workers. Significantly, the average hourly earnings of all private employees rose by 10 cents and are now up 2.2% year over year, the strongest year-over-year gain in almost two years. Overall, while this morning\u2019s report was by no means a block-buster, it does show a U.S. economy that is steadily moving forward. For the equity market, this should translate into moderate earnings growth supporting higher stock prices. However, the bond market, even after recent increases in interest rates is still priced for an economy that is moving backwards. Nothing in today\u2019s report should really change the Fed\u2019s timetable for removing quantitative easing and raising short-term interest rates. However, it is important to recognize that bond yields are still not appropriate given this timetable suggesting a continued rough environment for fixed income.\u201d Gold is, once again, the principle casualty as analysts anticipate an end to the Fed's QE programme -- it has tumbled 3% to $1,211/ounce. Heck of a fall from the heady days of $1,900 / ounce in September 2011, as goldbugs anticipated rollicking inflation as central banks printed money with reckless abandon. On the bond selloff....here's a graph from Tradeweb of the US 10-year Treasury bond's yield (a measure of the interest rate on the bond) over the last two years. It shows how the yield hit record lows in 2012 as investors piled into safe-haven debt, as the Feberal Reserve kept stimulating the economy with $85bn of bond purchases each month But the prospect of the Fed tapering (ie, slowing) its stimulus programme has been driving Treasury yields higher for weeks. Today's jobs report is seen as strengthening Ben Bernanke's hand.... Wall Street is open, and the Dow Jones industrial average is rising following today's better-than-expected jobs figures. The Dow is up 83 points in early trading, a rise of 0.57%. In the bond market, though, the US Treasuries keep being clobbered as traders anticipate an end to the Federal Reserve's bond-buying programe, A few key points from today's report into the US jobs market. \u2022 There are still 11.8 million people out of work in America, despite 195,000 new jobs being created in June \u2022 The labor force participation rate crept a little higher, to 63.5% from 63.4% in May. That measures the proportion of the population available for work. \u2022 The average number of hours worked rose by 0.2% \u2022 Average hourly pay rose by 0.4% \u2022 Employment rose in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, health care, and financial activities. Gotta love those revisions (see here). Lorcan Roche Kelly, Chief Europe Strategist at Trend Macrolytics, points out that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has now taken three swings at getting April's job reading correct, first lowering its estimate then raising it again: The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year US Treasuries just hit 2.7% -- it's highest rate since August 2 2011. The dollar has been bolstered by the non-farm data -- it has gained one and a half cents against the UK pound, to $1.49. It's also jumped against the yen, to \u00a5101. You can see the June non-farm payroll report yourself here (click) on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. US government debt is falling in value following the news that 195,000 new jobs were created in America in June (see 1.31pm onwards). The yield on a 10-year Treasury bond bond has risen to 2.685%, up from 2.50% last night [yields rise when prices fall]. Wall Street is anticipating that today's employment data means the Federal Reserve will push on with its plans to 'taper' its bond-buying programme (currently $85bn per month) later this year, and stop it by the summer of 2014. The Bureau of Labour Statistics has also revised its jobs data for the previous two months. It now reckons that 195,000 new jobs were created in May, from 175,000. And April's non-farm payroll has been raised to 199,000, from 149,000. America's jobless rate hasn't fallen, though -- it has stuck at 7.6%, rather than falling to 7.5% as expected. That suggests more people have remained in the labour market rather than giving up the search for work. BREAKING: The US non-farm payroll comes in much stronger than expected, with 195,000 new jobs created in June. That's MUCH better than analysts had expected (the concensus was 165,000, as explained here) Details and reaction to follow.... Worth noting that Goldman Sachs predicts that today's non-farm payroll will come in below the consensus of 165,000 new jobs. Its chief economist, Jan Hatzius, wrote: We expect a fairly lacklustre employment report for June, with non-farm payroll growth of 150,000, similar to the average of the past three months. Of course, that prediction was fed into the consensus, so other Wall Street experts are rather more optimistic... Among the swarm of educated, and less educated, guesses for how many new jobs were created in America last month, this one stood out: With around half an hour to go until the eagerly-awaited US jobless data (1.30pm BST/8.30am New York) here's a brisk summary: \u2022 Economists are expecting the Non-Farm Payroll to show that 165,000 new jobs were created across America last month. That excludes the agricultural sector, where hiring can be volatile (thus \"non-farm\", you see). However, estimates vary significantly between analysts (as usual). \u2022 The US unemployment rate is expected to fall to 7.5%, from 7.6% in May. \u2022 Recent mixed economic data make non-farm hard to call. On the optimistic side, the private sector created 188K jobs in June, according to a survey earlier this week. Less cheerily, though, growth in America's service sector slowed in June, \u2022 We also need to watch out for revisions. The Bureau for Labour Statistics often corrects its previous data, adding or subtracting tens of thousands of jobs from earlier months. That can radically change the picture. \u2022 What will it mean for US stimulus measures? Non-Farm Payroll plays a double-role -- firstly, it's a measure of the labour market; secondly, it's a guide to whether the Federal Reserve will cut its bond-buying activities this year, and end QE next summer. A NFP above 165,000 would probably mean the Fed cracks on with its tapering plans. But a weak figure would give it cause to rethink, and perhaps keep stimulating for longer. Here's what City analysts are saying Jane Foley of Rabobank: Very strong data should be good for risk appetite. However, the market\u2019s likely reaction is complicated by the interpretation of what the numbers will mean for the Fed\u2019s decision to taper QE. On June 26 the market celebrated the downside revision of US Q1 GDP on the assumption that this would lead to continued QE. This implies that a lacklustre improvement in US June payrolls could conversely fail to offer support to investor sentiment. Societe Generale: The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) update on the employment situation in June will be the first of a trio of such reports that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider in advance of its 17-18 September meeting. A reversal of May's labour-force induced rise in the civilian jobless rate, combined with yet another above-consensus payroll print, likely will reinforce expectations of an asset-purchase tapering announcement at that time. Paul Dales of Capital Economics: The recent survey evidence leaves us content with our forecast that US payroll employment (13.30 BST) rose by around 150,000 in June. That would be slightly smaller than May\u2019s 175,000 gain. The 188,000 rise in the ADP measure of private payroll employment in June and the rebound in the employment index of the ISM non-manufacturing survey in the same month bode well for official payrolls. But the employment index of the ISM manufacturing survey fell to a four-year low. If the alternative household measure of employment and the labour force also both rose by around 150,000, then the unemployment rate would have been stable at 7.6%. A pick-up in jobs growth in the coming months would leave the Fed\u2019s QE3 tapering plans on track. Greek municipal workers held a protest march in Athens today, against the Troika's demands for thousands of civil servants to be cut. Marching past the Bank of Greece: Talks between the Troika and Greece's administrative reform minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, ended this lunchtime after four hours . There's still there's no breakthrough on whether or not the Greek government has done enough to unlock its next aid payment. Ministry officials, though, remain positive, telling reporters in Athens that the meeting was held in \"a good climate\". More talks are scheduled for this afternoon. As explained at 9.01am, the Greek government is proposing moving thousands of municipal police officers to the main Greek police force, to meet its pledge to cut civil service levels. The troika's response to this idea isn't yet known.... Germany's industrial base suffered a surprise slump in orders in May, suggesting that the eurozone's largest economy is in worse shape than throught. Industrial orders fell by 1.3% in May, month-on-month, following a 2.2% drop in April. And the decline was driven by a fall in demand within Germany. Domestic orders shrank by 2%, compared with a 0.7% fall from abroad. Consumer goods demand was particularly weak (down 3%) - as people cut back. Europe's stock markets are pretty calm this morning, following yesterday's strong rally after Mark Carney and Mario Draghi poured more strong spirits into the punch bowl by promising more loose monetary policy. The Footsie's higher, as City traders wait for the US jobs data this afternoon: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 34 points at 6455, +0.5% \u2022 German DAX: up 4 points at 7998, + 0.06 \u2022 French CAC: down 5 points at 3803, -0.15% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 44 points at 7957, - 0.5% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 29 points at 15777, - 0.2% Chris Beauchamp of IG Index sums it up: European markets took the opportunity to play in the July sunshine yesterday while the Americans were off celebrating Independence Day. Having been under pressure thanks to unexpectedly hawkish US central bankers, traders were delighted that new boy Mark Carney and seasoned veteran Mario Draghi were so obliging yesterday, firing the starting gun on a new lurch higher for major indices. Attention now shifts back to the US, where those returning bleary-eyed after celebrations will have to wake up fast to cope with non-farm payrolls. In London the mining sector is holding back the broader market, as the sector succumbs to a degree of profit-taking in the wake of yesterday\u2019s central bank-inspired rally. Corporate data is thin on the ground again today, so non-farm payrolls will be the focus all morning, with traders opting to sit on their hands and await developments. And the pound continues to weaken against the US dollar - it's now down almost a cent at $1.498. And here's the details of that newsflash, via Reuters: Portugal's president warned on Friday that a negative scenario for the country would be if it failed to return to markets as planned in 2014 due to external events or internal politics. \"The incapacity of returning to the markets in 2014 could even be a result of the troika not being ready to sign off in a positive way on the rescue package,\" President Anibal Cavaco Silva told a conference. Analysts have warned that a political crisis that hit the country this week could upset the smooth progress of Lisbon's adjustment programme under a \u20ac78bn bailout by the European Union and IMF. No word yet on how the negotiations between the Portuguese political leaders is progressing, following the 'formula' for stability apparently hammered out last night (see 8.24am). Newsflash from Portugal: 05-Jul-2013 09:42 - PORTUGAL PRESIDENT SAYS THE NEGATIVE SCENARIO WOULD BE COUNTRY NOT BEING ABLE TO RETURN TO MARKETS No further details yet... He's not been in the job a week, but the new Bank of England governor has already made his mark on sterling. The pound hit a new four-month low this morning, dipping below $1.50 against the US dollar for the first time since the middle of March. This follows the Bank of England's surprise declaration yesterday that City expectations of an interest rate rise in two years were 'not warranted'. That announcement, at Mark Carney's first MPC meeting, has wiped more than two and a half cents off the pound since midday yesterday. As this graph shows, one pound was worth $1.57 in mid-June, and as much as $1.62 at the start of 2013: As Alice Ross, the FT's currency correspondent flags up, the US dollar is gaining against other currencies in the run-up to the release of the latest American unemployment data (1.30pm BST) In Greece, the government is hoping that it's found a way to satisfy the demands of the Troika to cut the size of the civil service. According to the Kathimerini newspaper this morning, the Athens authorities had found a way to meet its pledge to move 12,500 civil servants into a mobility scheme (where they'll be paid less and could be laid off if a new job can't be found). The solution \u2013 transferring around 4,000 municipal police officers into the ranks of the Greek Police (ELAS). The issue of civil service layoffs is the main stumbling block between the Troika and the Greek government. Without progress, Greece will struggle to get its next aid tranche, worth \u20ac8.1bn. Kathimerini explains: Sources told Kathimerini that a breakthrough appeared likely as a proposal for the transfer of municipal police staff into the ranks of ELAS had been accepted in principle by the troika. The initiative would also lead to the release of thousands of police officers from desk jobs and make up for shortfalls in active police units. adding: The two sides are set to agree on the duration of labor mobility being reduced from 12 months to six or nine, the immediate closure or merger of public organizations and the inclusion of civil service job transfers in the mobility scheme. More here. Talks are continuing today, in an effort to get a deal hammered out before eurozone finance ministers meet on Monday.... France's trade gap widened in May, and weak exports of aeroplanes and other manufactured goods is being blamed. The French customs office reported that the trade deficit widened to \u20ac6bn in May, from \u20ac4.5bn in April. While imports were pretty flat (at \u20ac42bn), exports slipped by around 4% or \u20ac1.7bn (to \u20ac36bn) -- driven by lower sales of Airbus planes and other transport kit. Not encouraging for Francois Hollande's government, as it struggles with a recession, record unemployment, and increasingly belligerent ministers. Portugal's borrowing costs are tumbling in early trading, on hopes that the government will avoid collapse. Traders are eagerly buying Portuguese bonds which were being dumped a couple of days ago. This follows Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho's statement last night that he'd found a way to rescue his government (but it's not a done deal yet). The recovery is driving the yield (or interest rate) on Portugal's 10-year bond back below the 7% mark, to levels where borrowing costs are seen as more sustainable. However, the political situation in Portugal still looks rather unstable, given public opposition to its austerity measures. Last night, after meetings with his coalition partner, Passos Coelho declared that: A formula was found to maintain government stability. Political analysts are cautious, after the days of turmoil that raised the risk that Portugal won't manage to escape its bailout this year. Antonio Costa Pinto, political scientist at the University of Lisbon, explained: Even if the coalition doesn\u2019t break, this will certainly leave the government in a fragile state. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Today's European coverage could mainly focus on events in Athens and Lisbon. Portugal may be inching towards resolving the political crisis that rattled the eurozone this week, following negotiations between political leaders yesterday. Last night, prime ministers Pedro Passos Coelho announced that 'a formula' had been found to hold his government together. We still don't know what it is, but analysts suspect that junior coalition leader Paulo Portas, who quit the government on Tuesday, might 'unresign' and take a more influential role in government policy. While in Greece, yet more talks will take place between ministers and the Troika of lenders as the Greek government strives to do enough to unlock its next aid tranche... Today is also dominated by a crucial piece of economic data -- America's non-farm payroll. The benchmark measure of US unemployment has become a key barometer for assessing the state of the world's largest economy. A strong reading will strengthen the chances of the Federal Reserve pushing on with its plans to slow its stimulus progamme this year. But a weak number might just make Ben Bernanke and co rethink.... In the City, traders are still digesting yesterday's promises of low interest rates from the Bank of England and the ECB. We're not expecting a repeat of yesterday's soaring stock markets, though... Non-farm payroll is released at 1.30pm BST, and it looks like a quiet morning in Europe. But something's bound to turn up....",

      "bodyText": "The Treasury's attempt to tax wealthy individuals who hide their assets in Switzerland was declared an embarrassing failure by experts on Friday after the Swiss authorities said it would generate only a small fraction of the expected \u00a33.2bn haul. The Tax Justice Network campaign group said \"giant loopholes\" in the deal struck by the Treasury minister David Gauke and former HMRC chief David Hartnett had undermined the UK's attempt to trawl the Swiss banking system for untaxed funds. According to the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), the deal does not apply to most UK nationals who keep their cash in Swiss banks because they are not domiciled in the UK. The SBA said the UK may get little more than a CHF500m (\u00a3347m) minimum levy agreed with the UK after individual banks found only small sums from UK citizens were caught by the deal. The Swiss declaration is not only embarrassing for the Treasury, it also This knocks a sizeable hole in public finances as the Office for National Statistics controversially included the \u00a33.2bn in May's public accounts. The levy contributed to a narrowing of government borrowing from \u00a315.6bn in May 2012 to \u00a312.7bn. According to the Treasury's red book, which forecasts tax revenues over the next five years, a one-off levy on Swiss assets owned by UK residents, ranging from 21% to 41%, was due to raise \u00a33.2bn in this tax year. A withholding tax on future gains and income of up to 43% was expected to rake in \u00a3610m in 2014-15 and \u00a3920m in the following year. Much of that income must now be in doubt, the Tax Justice Network said. Coming only a year after the government cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, the campaign group said the deal was a huge giveaway to wealthy UK nationals able to hide their assets in tax havens. \"The Swiss withholding tax model is now dead. Dave Hartnett, David Gauke and the government that sanctioned this deal must now hang their heads in shame,\" it said. A spokesman for the SBA, which lobbies on behalf of all the major Swiss banks, said the deal was proceeding and it was too early to predict how much money would be declared to the Swiss and UK tax authorities, though it was already clear fewer untaxed assets than expected had come to light. \"This is mainly due to the fact that many clients have resident non-domiciled status. These clients are not liable to taxation in the UK and thus do not fall under the agreement,\" it said. The SBA said numerous UK clients had chosen to make voluntary disclosures to the tax authorities, which the association said was not surprising given Switzerland's announced adoption of a global standard for the automatic exchange of information. It is not clear how much the Treasury has received directly from UK citizens who opted to make a voluntary disclosure of their tax position, but tax experts said it was unlikely to make a material difference to the shortfall. But a Treasury spokeswoman said there was no reason to revise the estimated revenue from the deal. She said: \"As the SBA has said, more people have chosen to disclose their tax affairs to HMRC than expected so the yield from this route is likely to be higher than anticipated.\"",

      "bodyText": "The German engineering group Siemens is pulling out of the race to build carriages for the London Crossrail project in a boost to two rival bids that hope to construct the \u00a31bn order in the UK. The company had been favourite to win the rolling-stock contract and its withdrawal is a major boost to Bombardier and Hitachi, who are expected to build the trains in Britain if they win. Siemens had already pledged to build the trains in Germany. Winning the Crossrail contract is seen as make or break for Bombardier, which runs the UK's last train-making factory in Derby, employing 1,600 people. Bombardier cut 1,000 jobs in 2011 after it was denied a \u00a31.4bn Thameslink contract by a rival bid from Siemens \u2013 a deal that was confirmed last week. Unions and local MPs have been urging ministers not to repeat this decision to safeguard jobs at the Derby factory. Japan's Hitachi is building a plant in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, to manufacture the next generation of intercity trains. Siemens's Thameslink victory played a part in its decision to pull out of the Crossrail competition, according to the company. \"Crossrail is a very large project and since first undertaking our initial assessment of capacity and deliverability, Siemens has won multiple additional orders,\" a company statement said. \"To pursue another project of this scale could impact our ability to deliver our current customer commitments.\" The German company insisted the Crossrail decision was not a result of political pressure and said it had no complaints about the bid process, which had been \"fair and diligent\". Siemens will have 2,800 carriages running on British railways once its new model Desiro City trains come into service for Thameslink in early 2016, compared to 1,500 carriages across 10 train companies today. Earlier this year Siemens announced delays to the delivery of a \u20ac700m (\u00a3602m) order for Eurostar. The majority of the 10 high-speed trains will be delivered in 2015, several months later than originally planned. The 73-mile Crossrail link will join Heathrow airport to Canary Wharf and is due for completion in 2018. A final decision on who will provide the 600 carriages is expected in mid-2014.",
