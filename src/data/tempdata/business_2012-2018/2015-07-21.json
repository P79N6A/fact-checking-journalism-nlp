The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s report is to undergo more \u201cMaxwellisation\u201d, the process by which those criticised in the report are allowed to respond. Hold on, you might say, wasn\u2019t Maxwellisation last year\u2019s excuse for delay in publication? It was \u2013 but Maxwellisation seems to be a game with no clear ending. A second wave of interviews is now required to \u201cre-Maxwellise\u201d those people where the level of criticism has increased. Could re-re-Maxwellisation be on the cards? Ominously, on Tuesday a letter from Andrew Bailey and Sir Brian Pomeroy, the duo now charge of publication of the report, hinted that it might be. After the next set of interviews, \u201cwe will also need to consider any further representations we receive in response to this\u201d. Throw in other legal niceties and no \u201cprecise timing\u201d on publication can be provided. Bailey and Pomeroy don\u2019t even take a stab at an imprecise timing. This is ridiculous. Taxpayers contributed \u00a320bn to the bailout of HBOS and we want to know who was to blame. Some HBOS employees invested in the shares lost their life savings. Equally, shareholders in the old Lloyds TSB would like to know if their directors were strong-armed by the Labour government into buying a dud. By all means let everybody have their say, but Maxwellisation was never supposed to be a means by which powerful people could argue over every last detail of a regulator\u2019s report. When (if?) this farce eventually ends, the government should legislate to ensure there is no repeat. At the current rate of progress, the next banking crash will have happened before the last one has been properly explained. Ringfencing and belly-aching Thank goodness for that. As far as George Osborne is aware, Treasury officials are not lobbying the Bank of England to soften the ringfencing regime for banks. The legislation, requiring a fence to be put around the UK retail divisions, has been passed and it\u2019s now up to regulators \u2013 meaning the Prudential Regulation Authority at the Bank \u2013 to implement the rules.

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, who was pressed in this column yesterday to secure a firm statement that the government remains committed to ringfencing in its original form, seemed satisfied by the answer. Good. Now, please, can senior executives Barclays and HSBC stop whining? They don\u2019t like ringfencing but the time for belly-aching is over.

Yes, the share price has continued to fall since then, to less than half last year\u2019s flotation price. And, yes, the short-sellers are enjoying their sport at AO. But Roberts, if he is serious about changing the way Europe buys its fridges, should keep his eyes on long-term prospects.

Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, revealed on Tuesday that the draft report on events that took place at least seven years ago ran to 500 pages. The investigation has received 1,425 representations from more than 35 individuals and their lawyers over the report, which is being compiled by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, Bailey was unable to say when the report would be published as the investigators now had to give individuals in the report a second chance to look at its findings. The process is known as \u201cMaxwellisation\u201d. \u201cWe have now \u2026 completed the first wave of Maxwellisation to the extent legally required of all those criticised in the report. This process resulted in a high volume of representations (1,425) from more than 35 different individuals and their legal representatives,\u201d Bailey said in the letter, which was also signed by Sir Brian Pomeroy, senior independent director at the FCA. After taking into account their representations and following further scrutiny by a steering committee set up to oversee the report, further consultation was needed, they said. Even once this was completed \u2013 a process which has yet to begin \u2013 consent will then be required from the individuals involved. \u201cAs a result, we are required to re-Maxwellise anybody in relation to whom, as a result of changes made to the report, we consider the level of criticism to have increased. We intend to commence this re-Maxwellisation process in the coming weeks. We will also need to consider any further representations we receive in response to this,\u201d said Bailey and Pomeroy. The letter was published before the public meeting of the FCA on Wednesday, when the delays to the HBOS report are expected to be discussed. The public meeting is taking place at a time of heightened scrutiny of the FCA after its boss, Martin Wheatley, quit last week after learning that the chancellor, George Osborne, did not intend to renew his five-year contract. Tyrie said the Treasury select committee would be seeking views on the repeated delays to the report. \u201cIt is now almost seven years since the collapse of HBOS. \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers\u2019 money was required to bail it out. The Treasury committee has been instrumental in ensuring that the public will receive the full explanation it deserves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been waiting a long time.

      "bodyText": "New Yorkers, and those visiting them, may have to cross a picket line if they are flying in or out of John F Kennedy or LaGuardia airports after Wednesday night. New York\u2019s local SEIU 32BJ office announced its intention to take industrial action at a press conference on Tuesday. The airlines affected will be Delta, British Airways and United. The strike comes after months of protests by security officers, baggage handlers and wheelchair attendants working for the airlines\u2019 subcontractor Aviation Safeguards. In addition to demanding a living wage of $15 an hour, the workers have demanded better benefits, affordable healthcare, the right to unionize and respect. \u201cI am a security officer at JFK working for Aviation Safeguards,\u201d Donna Carey announced as she took the stage in the auditorium at the local SEIU 32BJ office on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt is my hope that we all come together and stand for what is right and what is just \u2026 Tomorrow night at 10pm, we will strike.\u201d Aviation Safeguards has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Speaking to the Guardian in February, Craig P Coy, the CEO of Command Security the parent company of Aviation Safegaurds, pointed out that the company provides healthcare, benefits and pays $10.10 an hour. The contractors, however, insist that $10.10 is not a livable wage and that the healthcare offered through the company is unaffordable on such low pay. Last week, the two airports were informed of the upcoming strike and on Monday the workers held a vote in which they decided that the strike will officially begin on Wednesday night. It is unclear yet whether passengers will be affected. The subcontractors that are to participate in the strike include baggage handlers and wheelchair attendants who often work alongside the employees doing similar tasks. With subcontractors on strike, the airline employees might have to take on more work. Whether the strike will lead to delays is as yet unclear. Among the workers present for the official announcement was Chanes Cooper, who works as a wheelchair attendant for Aviations Safeguard. Despite working 40 hours a week, Cooper still cannot afford an apartment and lives in a shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we have to be here,\u201d said Melissa Mark-Viverito, the speaker of the New York city council. \u201cWe are standing with you. In New York and in our airport, the time is now to tackle the worst-in-the-nation inequality crisis by raising wages for low-wage workers.\u201d According to her, a majority of New Yorkers support raising the pay of low-wage workers, who are not just teenagers but men and women who are trying to support their families. Low-wage workers and members of the National Action Network, including the Rev Al Sharpton, are expected to come out to show their support of the striking workers. \u201cOther countries are laughing at us,\u201d said Jorel Ware, a McDonald\u2019s worker. Wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with both \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cFight for $15\u201d, Ware pointed out that many US workers do not get healthcare through their job and are paid minimum wage, which is not a livable wage. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle on a daily basis. People ask me why I have no kids. My paycheck is the reason why. It\u2019s like I am stagnant in my life.\u201d He continued: \u201cEverybody should have a living wage. All you companies if you aren\u2019t paying $15 an hour, it\u2019s not a living wage. Period. You need to take a look in the mirror and make the changes. And of course, if they don\u2019t, we will make the changes for them.\u201d In addition to Mark-Viverito, a handful of city officials spoke in support of the striking workers. Councilman David Greenfield said he was embarrassed that workers like Isabel Marte, who sat next to him, are paid as little as $10 an hour. \u201cI was sitting next to Isabel and I was asking her about her job.

It\u2019s not just a shame on the airports. It\u2019s a shame on all New Yorkers,\u201d Greenfield continued. \u201cWhat kind of message are we sending to those folks [who land at JFK or LaGuardia]: \u2018Welcome to America where you get paid minimum wage!\u2019 It\u2019s embarrassing quite frankly.\u201d Marte, wearing a white T-shirt with an Aviation Safeguards logo on the sleeves, nodded her head.",

Official figures showed public sector net borrowing \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s preferred measure of the deficit \u2013 stood at \u00a39.4bn in June, down \u00a3800m on the same month in 2014. Despite a smaller cut in borrowing last month than the City had been predicting, analysts said Osborne was on course to hit his deficit target of \u00a369.5bn for the entire 2015-16 financial year. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the June total was \u00a3700m above market expectations, with strong tax receipts offset by rising spending by Whitehall. Local government spending was \u00a31bn lower than a year earlier. The OBR said tax receipts in the first three months of 2015-16 were up 5.7% on last year, a better performance than was forecast in Osborne\u2019s summer budget. It said income tax and national insurance contributions from the business services, financial and construction sectors had been strong, but added that the impact of weaker oil prices on corporation tax receipts from the North Sea would show up next month, while fines imposed on the City had boosted revenues by \u00a3500m in April and May. Government borrowing peaked at more than \u00a3155bn in the wake of the deep recession of 2008-09 and progress on reducing the deficit has been slower than the chancellor anticipated when he arrived at the Treasury five years ago. In 2014-15, borrowing stood at \u00a388bn, \u00a350bn more than was forecast in 2010. A Treasury spokeswoman said: \u201cThe figures show that our deficit reduction plan is working, with cumulative borrowing over \u00a36bn lower than at this point last year. We have more than halved the deficit, but with debt over 80% of GDP the job is not done.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cThe chancellor keeps shifting the goal posts on government borrowing, but over this financial year he is expected to borrow three-and-a-half times more than expected to bail out his failed economic plan \u2013 that\u2019s \u00a370bn instead of \u00a320bn.\u201d Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWe do not think that June\u2019s borrowing figures should ring any alarm bells yet. Nonetheless, they provide a timely reminder that the fiscal consolidation has a long way to go before the public finances are back to a sustainable position.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have closed lower today, after momentum ebbed out of the recent relief rally on signs of a resolution to the Greek debt crisis. Attention will return to the Greek parliament on Wednesday where MPs are voting on new legislation demanded by the country\u2019s creditors. In the UK, Wednesday brings the minutes from the latest Bank of England meeting, which will be scoured for further clues on when policymakers might start voting to hike borrowing costs after more than six years of no change. We\u2019ll be tracking all that and more in tomorrow\u2019s business live blog. Before we close for today, here is a quick summary of the main developments: UK public sector borrowing fell again in June as an improving economic backdrop started to show through in tax takings. The deficit fell less than expected but economists say it\u2019s too early in the financial year to panic. George Osborne\u2019s Treasury says the national debt, at more than 80% of GDP is still too high, and it has launched its expected spending review, asking government departments to find more savings. Osborne has been telling MPs on parliament\u2019s Treasury committee not to fret about any taxpayer money being at stake in eurozone bailouts while also discussing his recent summer budget (covered in our politics live blog). The big corporate story of the day is that Toshiba\u2019s chief executive and president, Hisao Tanaka, and his predecessor, Norio Sasaki, have quit over a $1.2bn accounting scandal. If accounting scandals are your thing, here is a list of some other big ones from Enron to Tesco. There are reports that UK bank Barclays may have been approached about signing a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) relating to the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s (SFO) probe into its fundraising during the 2008 financial crisis. The Greek government wants to get through Wednesday\u2019s crucial votes and quickly get onto bailout negotiations with its lenders, tying them up by 20 August. Slovakia has kept up the tough talk on Greece, with its prime minister Robert Fico saying his country will be among the first to ask Greece to leave the eurozone if it fails to adhere to agreed conditions of further austerity. There are fresh signs of the political turmoil spilling in Greece\u2019s real economy. A UK jobs site reports a spike in traffic from Greek jobseekers while figures on flight bookings to Greece show a sharp drop on a year ago. The Athens Chamber of Commerce is warning a wave of companies could be forced out of business within weeks because of restrictions on foreign transfers. On financial markets, European stock markets have edged lower, the gold price stabilised after slumping to a five-year low on Monday amid a \u201cbear raid\u201d and oil has also steadied. Shares on Wall Street are lower as investors await the latest update from Apple and news on its Watch sales. Thanks, as ever, for reading and all the comments. News is emerging this afternoon that UK bank Barclays may have been approached about signing a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) relating to the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s (SFO) probe into its fundraising during the 2008 financial crisis. Reuters cites sources confirming a deal has been offered while Sky News reports the SFO wrote to Barclays serveral weeks ago with the proposal. But at the same time, Reuters also reports that Barclays is saying it has not received such an offer. Reuters quotes the bank as saying: \u201cWe are not in a position to comment on an ongoing legal matter, save to clarify that there has been no offer made of a DPA.\u201d While we seek to find out who has really received or responded to what, a bit of background to this: As we reported back in the summer of 2012, the Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into payments made after Barclays tapped Middle Eastern investors for emergency funds in 2008. The inquiry \u2013 relating to the disclosure of fees paid to the sovereign investor Qatar Holding \u2013 came shortly after the bank had lost its chief executive Bob Diamond and chairman Marcus Agius after being fined \u00a3290m by US and UK regulators for its role in the Libor fixing scandal. As Reuters reports, conditions attached to a DPA could include the payment of a fine or compensation, co-operation in the prosecution of individuals, implementation of new compliance programmes and the appointment of a monitor. In return, the SFO would agree to defer a criminal prosecution over a set period. As Greece gears up for tomorrow\u2019s vote in parliament on two new laws, analysts are asking how the political landscape might change over coming months. Deutsche Bank strategist and regular Greece observer George Saravelos has just put out a new report asking \u201cIs the crisis over?\u201d \u2018Not yet\u2019 appears to be his answer. Saravelos argues that the sustainability of last week\u2019s euro leaders\u2019 agreement and the avoidance of Greek euro exit will require the eventual emergence of a broader \u201cpolitical centre\u201d in Greece. He writes: Irrespective of the near-term outcomes ... the inherent contradiction of programme implementation by a government from within which the bulk of opposition originates will have to be resolved. It is unlikely that uncertainty around the stability of the Greek economy and banking system recedes until this is the case. Resolution could be led by Greek PM and current party president [Alexis] Tsipras moving SYRIZA in a more moderate direction followed by an early general election later this year after ESM [European stability mechanism] negotiations have concluded. This would increase the odds of a government with greater commitment to implementation, irrespective of the electoral outcome. It would however risk a major splintering of the party or Tsipras\u2019 own loss of authority in the process. An alternative is that the party retains its own internal contradictions, but that a government of national unity with broader-based participation is formed irrespectively. However, it remains unclear if this could materialize without an early general election, which the opposition may eventually request. Either way, implementation risks are likely to remain strong until greater political change materialises, likely driven by the strong internal contradictions within the current ruling party, but ultimately settled by the Greek PM\u2019s own political initiatives. Over in the US today, investor focus is on updates from big technology companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo. When Apple reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell, all eyes will be on its watch sales. But, as my Guardian US colleague Sam Thielman reports, there may not be much to see. He writes: Analysts have called for caution ahead of Apple\u2019s earnings call today, during which the company is expected to give its first official indication of Apple Watch sales figures since they went on sale in April. However, Apple will probably leave the exact revenue for the product in the \u201cother\u201d category and few are expecting detailed figures for an Apple product that has got off to a mixed start. \u201cEven if Apple comes out on the low end, everybody else wants to have those numbers,\u201d said Ramon Llamas, who analyzes the phones and wearables market for market research firm IDC. \u201cEveryone want to have those numbers even if they\u2019re low, because everyone wants to crack that 1m unit barrier.\u201d Apple is believed to have topped that number in its first day of pre-sales, but tepid reviews and the inevitability of a newer version with fewer bugs have kept analysts\u2019 estimates low \u2013 most estimate numbers for the quarter between three and five million. The company itself has been quiet about sales figures. Read Sam\u2019s full story here: Shares in Apple are currently down 1%, Microsoft shares are 0.3% lower and shares in Yahoo are up 0.3%. Back at the Treasury Committee, George Osborne has been asked about the UK\u2019s role in any potential eurozone bailouts. This follows on from the chancellor\u2019s insistence last week during negotiations over the bringing loan for Greece that he would oppose any deal in which UK taxpayer cash was put on the line, arguing that the \u201ceurozone needs to foot its own bill\u201d. In the event, he backed down over the use of an EU bailout fund to give the emergency loan to Greece. Under the rescue package, Greece will get its loan through the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), which borrows against the EU budget of which the UK contributes 14% or around \u00a3850m. But the chancellor said there would be an \u201cimpregnable ringfence\u201d around the up to \u00a3850m of British money in the fund to prevent any losses to the taxpayer in the event of any default. At today\u2019s hearing, asked for assurances that UK taxpayer money \u201cwill not be used in bailing out eurozone countries\u201d, Osborne told MPs: \u201cI can give the committee that assurance because of the agreement we reached within the last week.\u201d The chancellor said that the EFSM was indeed being used to bridge finance Greece but \u201cI made an absolute condition of the use of that fund\u201d that Britain and other non-eurozone members are protected from any liabilities that might arise. Osborne also appears to have let slip that an announcement is coming in the next couple of months on giving the Bank of England \u201cdirectional powers\u201d in the buy-to-let market. You can watch Osborne here and my colleague Andrew Sparrow has live updates in his politics live blog. Looking ahead to Wednesday now and the release of the minutes from the latest Bank of England meeting on interest rates - where they were held at 0.5%. Yes, that does indeed mean borrowing costs were held for the 76th (!) month running, but these minutes are still likely to garner a little more attention than usual. Investors will be scouring them for more hike hints after BoE governor Mark Carney indicated in a speech last week that rates might go up around the turn of the year. He also told a committee of MPs last week that an interest rate hike in the UK is \u201cmoving closer\u201d. But, and it\u2019s a big BUT, the minutes relate to a meeting held at the start of July when the Greek crisis was at its worst so the tone might not echo last week\u2019s remarks from Carney nor comments (also last week) from his fellow policymaker David Miles, who said the time is nearing to hike. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in London expects the vote to hold rates to have been a unanimous 9-0. But that could change in August. \u201cWe expect the minutes to show continued unanimity for unchanged policy (split voting might start in August), but we will be looking for clues on whether the MPC is edging closer to tightening, not least on the back of strengthening wage data.\u201d Economists at Morgan Stanley echo that: We\u2019ll be watching for more monetary policy commentary, but we don\u2019t expect a split vote in the MPC minutes yet. We expect two MPC members to again describe the decision as finely balanced. If some of the recent MPC speeches are anything to go by, the overall tone or emphasis of the minutes will probably be a bit more hawkish than in June. Shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street the main share indices have edged down, in line with moves in Europe today. In Europe, it is drugmakers that are pulling stock markets lower after SWitzerland\u2019s Novartis reported quarterly incomes below analysts\u2019 expectations. On commodity markets, in the spotlight on Monday as gold tumbled, the yellow precious metal has stabilised somewhat today. But it is not far off the the five-year lows hit on Monday, when the precious metal was hit by a sudden bout of selling in Shanghai and New York. Spot gold now stands at $1104.78 per ounce, compared with the five-year low on Monday of $1,088.05. \u201cWhile the market has managed to bounce back from the lows for now, the mood remains very nervous,\u201d comment Joni Teves and Edel Tully at UBS in a research note today. Analysts say $1,100 is a pschologically important \u201csupport level\u201d and that another fall through that would likely be followed by another sharp sell-off, possibly take gold as low as $1,000 an ounce. Oil prices have also steadied after a sell-off on Monday, with Brent crude little changed on the day at $57.05. US crude, which fell through $50 a barrel on Monday, has picked up to $50.65. George Osborne has just started giving evidence to the Treasury Committee on his summer budget from earlier this month. You can watch it live here My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the committee hearing in his politics live blog Time for a brief summary of business and economics news so far today, which has been largely dominated by the UK public finances and chancellor George Osborne\u2019s latest austerity push plans. Official figures showed UK public sector borrowing fell again in June as an improving economic backdrop started to show in tax takings. The deficit fell less than expected but economists say it\u2019s too early in the financial year to panic. George Osborne\u2019s Treasury says the national debt, at more than 80% of GDP is still too high, and it has launched its expected spending review, asking government departments to find more savings. The big corporate story of the day is that Toshiba\u2019s chief executive and president, Hisao Tanaka, and his predecessor, Norio Sasaki, have quit over a $1.2bn accounting scandal. In Athens, the government has submitted legislation to parliament as demanded by the country\u2019s creditors in order to get talks on a new bailout package underway. The Greek government wants to get through Wednesday\u2019s crucial votes and quickly get onto bailout negotiations with its lenders, tying them up by 20 August. Slovakia has kept up the tough talk on Greece, with its prime minister Robert Fico saying his country will be among the first to ask Greece to leave the eurozone if it fails to adhere to agreed conditions of further austerity. There are fresh signs of the political turmoil spilling in Greece\u2019s real economy. A UK jobs site reports a spike in traffic from Greek jobseekers while figures on flight bookings to Greece show a sharp drop on a year ago. European stock markets have edged lower as Monday\u2019s relief rally on Greece peters out. The gold price stabilised after slumping to a five-year low on Monday. Oil has also steadied, but on the back of expectations of higher supply and lower demand from key consumers like China, it has lost 11% so far in July. For regular followers of our Greek coverage, if you are missing former finance minister and maverick economist Yanis Varoufakis, you will be pleased to hear he has secured a regular slot on the Project Syndicate site. Another day, another Greek deadline to add to the diary. This time, seemingly a self-imposed one by Greece. Athens hopes talks with its international creditors on a new bailout package will be wrapped up by 20 August, the government\u2019s spokeswoman is quoted as saying on Reuters. Reuters reports: The negotiations will start after parliament votes on Wednesday on a new set of reforms required by international lenders, spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said a statement. \u201cImmediately after the vote of the prior actions, negotiations with the lenders will start, with August 20th being the final date,\u201d she said. As our reporter Jennifer Rankin reported earlier, the government must first get through another crucial vote in the Greek parliament on Wednesday. An update from Royal Mail today suggests emails continue to take their toll on letter deliveries. Royal Mail failed to increase sales in the first three months of its financial year as letter revenues fell amid \u201cchallenging\u201d trading conditions, the Press Association reports. It said the number of letters delivered was down 5% and sales dropped 4% in the quarter to 28 June in an environment in which the use of email continues to eat into the traditional letter market. This figure excludes the impact of election mailings. But at its parcels unit sales by volume rose 3% and revenues were up 2% in the period, as recent cost-cutting and other initiatives took effect. The full story: Trades union group, the TUC, has sent through a reaction to this morning\u2019s official figures showing UK public sector borrowing fell in June but by less than expected. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says over this financial year the chancellor is likely to borrow three and a half times more than expected under his original 2010 plans \u2013 that\u2019s \u00a370bn instead of \u00a320bn. \u201cAfter the longest recorded squeeze on living standards, income tax revenues and national insurance receipts are still way down on expectations. With interest rates on government borrowing at rock bottom, this is the perfect opportunity for the chancellor to invest in skills, infrastructure and much-needed affordable housing. But rather than learning from his mistakes the chancellor cut back on infrastructure spending in the budget. \u201cWe need a better plan for sustainable high-productivity growth that will deliver the quality jobs and decent services working people need.\u201d Back in the UK, chancellor George Osborne has launched his 2015 spending review, billed as \u201cthe next stage in the government\u2019s plan to fix the nation\u2019s finances.\u201d For already slimmed down government departments that means letters are in the post with words to the effect of: \u2018Must do better.\u2019 The Treasury says the review will be published on 25 November 2015, and will set out how the government will at once invest in \u201cpriority public services\u201d and deliver the \u00a320bn of further savings it sees as necessary to get rid of Britain\u2019s budget deficit by 2019/2020. The Treasury says in its announcement: \u201cWith the fastest-growing economy in the G7, and employment at near-record levels, the chancellor is clear that now is the time to finish the job of fixing the public finances. \u201cAt the Summer Budget, the chancellor took the first step towards finishing that job, setting out how the government would ensure Britain runs a surplus for the first time in almost twenty years in 2019/20, delivering economic security for working people. \u201cWe set out how \u00a312 billion savings from welfare and \u00a35 billion from addressing avoidance, evasion and imbalances in the tax system will deliver half of the savings needed to eliminate the deficit, over the next four years. Today the chief secretary will write to government departments asking them to draw up plans to deliver the remaining required consolidation (\u00a320bn).\u201d The letters will ask departments to model two scenarios of 25% and 40% of savings within their resource budgets by 2019-20 in real terms. These are the same reductions requested ahead of the spending review of 2010. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has full details in his politics live blog. Slovak prime minister Robert Fico has been talking tough on Greece this morning, saying his country will be among the first to ask Greece to leave the euro zone if it fails to adhere to agreed conditions of further austerity. Reuters reports that Fico told reporters that Slovakia was fundamentally against allowing any debt write-off for Greece. \u201cIf we se that Greece is diverging from meeting its commitments...Slovakia will belong into the first line of countries that will ask for Greece\u2019s departure from the euro zone,,\u201d Fico said. Slovakia has been one of the toughest countries in negotiations over the past months on new financing aid for Athens. via Reuters Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University, has been asking whether Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras could become the new Lula - the Brazilian leader who successfully confronted financial constraints. Writing for Project Syndicate, Frankel says: The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has the chance to become to his country what the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, and Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, were to theirs: a man of the left who moves toward fiscal responsibility and freer markets. Like Tsipras, both were elected in the midst of an economic crisis. Both immediately confronted the international financial constraints that opposition politicians can afford to ignore. On assuming power, Kim and Lula were able to adjust, politically and mentally, to the new realities that confronted them, launching much-needed reforms. Some reforms were \u201cconservative\u201d (or \u201cneo-liberal\u201d) and might not have been possible under politicians of the right. But others were consistent with their lifetime commitments. South Korea under Kim began to rein in the \u201cchaebols\u201d, the country\u2019s huge family-owned conglomerates. Brazil under Lula implemented \u201cBolsa Familia\u201d, a system of direct cash payments to households that is credited with lifting millions out of poverty. His full piece is on our site: New figures on flight bookings to Greece suggests there was a sharp drop in recent weeks as holidaymakers reacted to the turmoil caused by the debt crisis. But there has been a small reocvery in the latest week. Overall bookings slumped by 44% in the first two weeks of July, and then bounced back slightly to be down a smaller 35% in the third week, when compared with the same period last year, according to the company ForwardKeys, which monitors future travel patterns by analysing 14m reservation transactions each day. The first big dip in bookings was recorded on Sunday 28 June - the day bank clsoures were announced. Flight bookings from Germany and the US - both big market-share visitors to Greece - continue to decline. Olivier Jager, ForwardKeys chief executive, comments: \u201cOur data shows that Germany and the USA continue to lead the decline in bookings to Greece, and the over 40% fall is particularly worrying because of their high market share. \u201cWhat is encouraging is that our analysis shows in the third week of July, overall bookings saw some recovery, moving from -44% to -35%.\u201d More details here (in a PDF). In Brussels, our reporter Jennifer Rankin has been considering the political challenges that lie ahead as Greece hopes to kickstart talks on a new bailout package. She writes: The Greek debt crisis is no longer on the front pages, but plenty of work goes on as Greek authorities race to meet the conditions laid down by their eurozone creditors to secure a new bailout. On Wednesday the Greek parliament will vote on two new laws - on banking reform and changes to Greece\u2019s civil code. These are among the final hurdles Greece has to clear before embarking on talks aimed at securing a proposed \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout. The Greek government submitted legislation this morning to parliament, according to Kathimerini, ahead of a vote that will be a test for the weakened Syriza government, damaged by a series of rebellions and resignations over the latest deal with Greece\u2019s creditors. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is expected to rely on the support of three opposition parties to get the measures through. In a vote over the first package of reforms Tsipras lost the majority support of his ruling Syriza coalition, as 40 lawmakers on his side either voted against the plan, abstained, or didn\u2019t turn up to vote. That pattern is expected to be repeated in Wednesday\u2019s make-or-break vote, when parliament will vote on the two new laws. The first is adopting a new code of civil procedure, with the aim of speeding up court processes and reducing costs. Greece\u2019s current code of civil procedure has been little amended since it was introduced in 1967 and the country\u2019s international creditors have been pressing for change. Some civil and commercial disputes can take two or three years to come to court and there are few options for out-of-court settlements. The new code, which reduces the number of special procedures and replaces paperwork with electronic methods, was meant to be adopted in May 2014. The next task mandated by the eurozone is to put the EU\u2019s post-crisis banking rules into Greek national law. The EU\u2019s bank recovery and resolution directive aims to ensure creditors and shareholders, rather than taxpayers, bear the losses of any future bank failure, but has not yet been turned into domestic law in Greece. Greece was one of 12 EU member states that missed the December 2014 deadline to write the directive into national law. Other eurozone offenders include France, Italy, the Netherlands and Lithuania. The European commission - the guardian of EU law - has called on all countries to write the rules into their national law, or risk a fine, but none will have to act as quickly as Greece. Sticking with Greece, there has been a spike in the number of Greek workers searching for jobs in the UK, according to one jobs site, something that will come as no surprise perhaps to many of our readers there. With the Greek economy back in recession and expected to have taken a significant hit from the recent turmoil and the ongoing capital controls, last week alone CV-Library recorded a 111% jump on a year ago in the number of web visits received from Greek workers. It also says its web traffic figures point to 55.9% more Greek traffic in the last month, compared to previous month. At the same time it has seen an overall decline in traffic from other European countries throughout June/July 2015, including Poland, France and Portugal. Historical data from the job site suggests that web traffic from Greece is normally flat and steady, with a normal decline over the summer months, which is typical within the recruitment sector. The latest figures put Greek unemployment at more than 25%, the highest in the EU. Sticking with austerity drives, but turning to Greece, in Athens today the government has submitted legislation to parliament that has been demanded by the country\u2019s creditors in order to get talks on a new bailout package underway. Reuters reports from Athens: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until Wednesday night to get the measures adopted in the assembly. A first set of reforms triggered a rebellion in his party last week and passed only thanks to votes from pro-EU opposition parties. The second bill, though less divisive, will still be a test of his weakened majority. It puts into Greek law new European Union rules on propping up failed banks, decreed after the 2008 financial crisis and aimed at shielding taxpayers from the risk of having to bail out troubled lenders. The so-called bank recovery and resolution directive (BRRD) imposes losses on shareholders and creditors of ailing lenders, in a process known as \u201cbail-in\u201d, before any taxpayers\u2019 money can be tapped in a bank rescue. The full story is here. Business lobby group, the British Chambers of Commerce, says despite progress in cutting the UK deficit, \u201cmajor challenges\u201d remain for the government. Its chief economist David Kern says: \u201cWe must not understate the big challenges that the UK faces in restoring stability to our public finances. Britain\u2019s financial sector was hit hard in the recession and, together with lower oil and gas output, our ability to generate tax revenues has been seriously constrained. Therefore, we have to continue to focus on other means to tackle the deficit - including cutting current government spending. \u201cThe government must also put more emphasis on policies that will boost economic growth, most obviously infrastructure investment and supporting exports. Only by doing this will the UK be able to create an enterprising economy which can deliver sustained growth over the long-term.\u201d Reactions are coming in from economists to those public finance figures, which showed another improvement with borrowing down, but not by as much as the City had forecast. Experts highlight signs an improving economic backdrop is starting to come through in the government\u2019s finances. While it is not quite the picture the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had pencilled in, they see little reason for alarm, yet. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight says George Osborne will probably be pleased to see the shortfall on the public finances narrow for a sixth month running. Improved income tax receipts continue to underpin the improvement in the public finances, reflecting a pick-up in earnings growth as well as higher employment. However, June\u2019s increase of 2.5% year-on-year in income tax related payments was less than the recent increases. There was a particularly marked rise in Value Added Tax receipts in June reflecting the recent strength of retail sales. Additionally, corporation tax receipts were up13.9% year-on-year in June... With June\u2019s improvement being less than expected, the chancellor is now slightly off track to meet the reduced fiscal targets for 2015/16 contained in July\u2019s summer budget. However, this is nothing for George Osborne to worry about at his stage given that he is still very close to target \u2013 and the public finances can be volatile from month to month and subject to appreciable revisions.\u201d Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics also sees \u201cno need for the chancellor to panic yet\u201d even though some figures are slightly worse than what the OBR had been expecting when it updated its forecasts alongside this month\u2019s summer budget: \u201cThe overshoot in borrowing relative to the official forecasts entirely reflected stronger growth in current spending (2.9%) than the OBR expects (1.0%), rather than economic weakness. Indeed, annual growth in tax receipts of 4.4% slightly exceeded the OBR\u2019s forecast of 4.1%. \u201cJune\u2019s poor borrowing figure means that borrowing in the first three months of the fiscal year of \u00a325.1bn was \u00a331.3bn (20%) lower than last year. If this trend persists over the remaining nine months of the fiscal year, this year\u2019s deficit would be \u00a371.5bn, \u00a32bn higher than the OBR forecast in the Summer Budget. However, estimates for borrowing in the first few months of the fiscal year should be taken with a pinch of salt, given that they are based on more forecast data than those for later months. Accordingly, we do not think that June\u2019s borrowing figures should ring any alarm bells yet.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the Treasury has welcomed the latest improvement in the public finances. A spokeswoman sends through this comment: \u201cToday\u2019s figures show that our deficit reduction plan is working, with cumulative borrowing over \u00a36bn lower than at this point last year. We have more than halved the deficit, but with debt over 80% of GDP the job is not done. \u201cThat is why we will continue to work through our long term plan to achieve a budget surplus in normal times and secure a better economic future for working people.\u201d What the spokeswomen means by running a \u201cbudget surplus in normal times\u201d is what has been dubbed Osborne\u2019s \u201cMr Micawber Principle\u201d. This is Osborne\u2019s plan to run permanent budget surpluses in a bid to cut the national debt, which as today\u2019s figures showed stands at \u00a31.5tn in June, or 81.5% of GDP. His new fiscal framework, which the chancellor calls a \u201cnew settlement for the British economy\u201d, allows the government to borrow only in exceptional circumstances. Osborne\u2019s plan conjured images of Mr Micawber, a character in Charles Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield. Governments were expected to at least balance the books in the 19th century and in the first three decades of the 20th century, when the public finances were run on the Mr Micawber principle that income exceeding spending equalled happiness and spending exceeding income equalled misery. Picking out some of the highlights from those UK figures on the state of the public coffers in June: Government borrowing in June fell by less than expected but was its lowest for a June for seven years Headline public borrowing fell to \u00a39.4bn from \u00a310.2bn but missed economists\u2019 forecasts for a bigger drop to an \u00a38.5bn deficit For the first three months of the 2015/16 tax year, public sector net borrowing was \u00a325.1bn, down 20% on a year earlier and its lowest for the same period since the onset of the financial crisis in the 2008/09 financial year Income tax receipts in June rose to \u00a311.5bn, the highest since records began in 1997 Corporation tax was up nearly 14% to \u00a31.7bn, also the highest amount on record Public sector net debt, excluding state-controlled banks, totalled \u00a31.513 trillion in June equivalent to 81.5% of GDP, the second highest ratio on record (Chancellor George Osborne wants to start bringing that ratio down this financial year) Reuters has more details here. The Office for National Statistics says that \u00a30.8bn, or 8.3%, reduction in borrowing on a year ago came as income tax receipts rose to the highest level since records began in 1997. Corporation tax was also the highest amount on record. The ONS cautions against reading too much into volatile monthly public finances data. It points to figures for the financial year-to-date (April 2015 to June 2015), showing public sector net borrowing was \u00a325.1bn, a drop of \u00a36.1bn, or 20% compared with the same period in 2014. Official figures just out show UK public sector borrowing fell again in June but by less than expected. Public sector borrowing fell to \u00a39.4bn in June from \u00a310.2bn a year ago. The consensus forecast in the market was for borrowing to fall further to \u00a38.5bn, based on a Reuters poll of economists. European shares have edged lower in quiet trading this morning as the momentum from Monday\u2019s relief rally peters out. The FTSE 100 in the UK, Germany\u2019s Dax is flat and France\u2019s CAC40 are all down between 0.1 and 0.2%. As Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, notes it is debatable whether European stocks have further to climb. She comments: \u201cNow that the Greek problem has been kicked into the long grass, the key question for investors is whether the recent gains in European equity markets are simply a relief rally - or whether fears over Greece obscured a wider improvement in European economies and there is still significant value to be found? On top of the effects of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing (QE), the Greek crisis has left the euro considerably weaker than it otherwise would have been. Greek fears also depressed company valuations. Nevertheless, European exporters should benefit significantly from the weak euro, while the financial sector should benefit from the effects of QE. As a consumer of energy and raw materials, Europe should also benefit significantly from the recent drop in commodity prices. As we progress through second quarter earnings, investors from the dollar bloc may begin to see European assets as increasingly attractive. Corporations too may see European companies as potential targets for M&amp;A. So while Greek problems may be far from over, there is scope for European markets to capitalise on the back of lower currency and commodity prices and an increasing interest from a wider global market seeking value.\u201d The big corporate news of the day is that Toshiba\u2019s chief executive and president, Hisao Tanaka, and his predecessor, Norio Sasaki, have quit over a $1.2bn accounting scandal. An independent report said on Monday that Toshiba\u2019s management knew about accounting regularities dating back to 2008. The company\u2019s corporate culture put pressure on managers to manipulate figures to hit targets, the investigators said. Japan\u2019s finance minister stepped up the pressure today by saying the affair threatened to undermine faith in Japan\u2019s companies when the country was trying to demonstrate improved corporate governance. The revelations at Toshiba follows a $1.7bn fraud at Olympus that was uncovered in late 2011. My colleague Sean Farrell\u2019s story has more details: Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business and economics news from the UK, the eurozone and beyond. Things appear to have quietened down after a frantic month in Greece and on Monday banks re-opened after a three-week closure. Using a bridging loan, Athens also started to repay its debts to international creditors and the International Monetary Fund declared Greece was no longer in arrears. But more challenges lie ahead, of course, and Greece\u2019s ruling Syriza party has admitted it faces considerable political obstacles in pushing through reforms. The government, led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has appealed for unity as it faces another make-or-break vote in Athens on Wednesday. By Wednesday, the Greek parliament must, as requested by creditors, pass a law to overhaul its civil justice system, with the aim of speeding up processes and reducing costs. The government must also transpose the EU\u2019s bank recovery and resolution directive into law. Elsewhere, Asian shares edged up overnight after a higher close on Wall Street and gold prices pared some of their losses after a sharp sell-off on Monday that saw them hit a five-year low. Coming up today, the UK is in focus with the latest official figures on the public finances due at 9.30am (8.30GMT). Economists expect the June figures to show a further improvement, with borrowing down again, after May\u2019s data showed a jump in income tax receipts. That brought government borrowing down to \u00a310.1bn, the lowest since 2007. On today\u2019s data, Samuel Tombs at consultancy Capital Economics says: \u201cJune\u2019s public finances figures look set to show much lower borrowing than a year ago. Indeed, government departments may have already begun to find the \u00a33bn extra savings that the chancellor asked them to deliver this year. We have pencilled in borrowing of just \u00a38bn in June, versus \u00a310.4bn in June last year.\u201d There will be plenty more on chancellor George Osborne\u2019s austerity drive and his recent summer budget when he is quizzed at 2.15pm by MPs on the influential Treasury committee.

Saravelos argues that the sustainability of last week\u2019s euro leaders\u2019 agreement and the avoidance of Greek euro exit will require the eventual emergence of a broader \u201cpolitical centre\u201d in Greece. <br></p> <p>He writes:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>Irrespective of the near-term outcomes ... the inherent contradiction of programme implementation by a government from within which the bulk of opposition originates will have to be resolved. It is unlikely that uncertainty around the stability of the Greek economy and banking system recedes until this is the case.</p> <p>Resolution could be led by Greek PM and current party president [Alexis] Tsipras moving SYRIZA in a more moderate direction followed by an early general election later this year after ESM [European stability mechanism] negotiations have concluded. This would increase the odds of a government with greater commitment to implementation, irrespective of the electoral outcome. It would however risk a major splintering of the party or Tsipras\u2019 own loss of authority in the process. <br></p> <p>An alternative is that the party retains its own internal contradictions, but that a government of national unity with broader-based participation is formed irrespectively. However, it remains unclear if this could materialize without an early general election, which the opposition may eventually request.</p> <p>Either way, implementation risks are likely to remain strong until greater political change materialises, likely driven by the strong internal contradictions within the current ruling party, but ultimately settled by the Greek PM\u2019s own political initiatives.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d24b624977b69f410178b8ec0022d4df0be0228\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437493600098/8c2208f8-6135-4871-82d3-20fdd6a868c8-394x420.png\" alt=\"Deutsche Bank update on Greece\" width=\"394\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deutsch Bank update on Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deutsche Bank</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55ae621ee4b0571ff3515fc4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-21T15:27:30.633Z\">4.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US today, investor focus is on updates from big technology companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Yahoo.</p> <p><strong>When Apple reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell, all eyes will be on its watch sales. </strong> But, as my Guardian US colleague Sam Thielman reports, there may not be much to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fa19b62c654017feaa883fbe758827a1ecdc38e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/21/1437492310558/770023af-77ba-440f-a55d-307948d5f8bf-460x332.jpeg\" alt=\"Apple Watches.\" width=\"460\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple Watches.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Analysts have called for caution ahead of Apple\u2019s earnings call today, during which the company is expected to give its first official indication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple-watch\">Apple Watch</a> sales figures since they went on sale in April.

These are among the final hurdles Greece has to clear before embarking on talks aimed at securing a proposed \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout.</p> <p>The Greek government submitted legislation this morning to parliament, according to Kathimerini, ahead of a vote that will be a test for the weakened Syriza government, damaged by a series of rebellions and resignations over the latest deal with Greece\u2019s creditors.</p> <p>The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is expected to rely on the support of three opposition parties to get the measures through. In a vote over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/greek-mps-pass-austerity-bill-as-athens-police-clash-with-protesters\">the first package of reforms Tsipras </a>lost the majority support of his ruling Syriza coalition, as 40 lawmakers on his side either voted against the plan, abstained, or didn\u2019t turn up to vote.</p> <p>That pattern is expected to be repeated in Wednesday\u2019s make-or-break vote, when parliament will vote on the two new laws.</p> <p>The first is adopting a new code of civil procedure, with the aim of speeding up court processes and reducing costs. Greece\u2019s current code of civil procedure has been little amended since it was introduced in 1967 and the country\u2019s international creditors have been pressing for change.</p> <p>Some civil and commercial disputes can take two or three years to come to court and there are few options for out-of-court settlements. The new code, which reduces the number of special procedures and replaces paperwork with electronic methods, was meant to be adopted in May 2014.</p> <p>The next task mandated by the eurozone is to put the EU\u2019s post-crisis banking rules into Greek national law. The EU\u2019s bank recovery and resolution directive aims to ensure creditors and shareholders, rather than taxpayers, bear the losses of any future bank failure, but has not yet been turned into domestic law in Greece.</p> <p>Greece was one of 12 EU member states that missed the December 2014 deadline to write the directive into national law. Other eurozone offenders include France, Italy, the Netherlands and Lithuania.

Experts highlight signs an improving economic backdrop is starting to come through in the government\u2019s finances. While it is not quite the picture the government\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had pencilled in, they see little reason for alarm, yet.<br></p> <p><strong>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight</strong> says George Osborne will probably be pleased to see the shortfall on the public finances narrow for a sixth month running. <strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Improved income tax receipts continue to underpin the improvement in the public finances, reflecting a pick-up in earnings growth as well as higher employment. However, June\u2019s increase of 2.5% year-on-year in income tax related payments was less than the recent increases.</p> <p>There was a particularly marked rise in Value Added Tax receipts in June reflecting the recent strength of retail sales. Additionally, corporation tax receipts were up13.9% year-on-year in June...</p> <p>With June\u2019s improvement being less than expected, the chancellor is now slightly off track to meet the reduced fiscal targets for 2015/16 contained in July\u2019s summer budget. </p> <p> However, this is nothing for George Osborne to worry about at his stage given that he is still very close to target \u2013 and the public finances can be volatile from month to month and subject to appreciable revisions.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics </strong>also sees \u201cno need for the chancellor to panic yet\u201d even though some figures are slightly worse than what the OBR had been expecting when it updated its forecasts alongside this month\u2019s summer budget:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe overshoot in borrowing relative to the official forecasts entirely reflected stronger growth in current spending (2.9%) than the OBR expects (1.0%), rather than economic weakness. Indeed, annual growth in tax receipts of 4.4% slightly exceeded the OBR\u2019s forecast of 4.1%. </p> <p>\u201cJune\u2019s poor borrowing figure means that borrowing in the first three months of the fiscal year of \u00a325.1bn was \u00a331.3bn (20%) lower than last year. If this trend persists over the remaining nine months of the fiscal year, this year\u2019s deficit would be \u00a371.5bn, \u00a32bn higher than the OBR forecast in the Summer Budget. However, estimates for borrowing in the first few months of the fiscal year should be taken with a pinch of salt, given that they are based on more forecast data than those for later months. Accordingly, we do not think that June\u2019s borrowing figures should ring any alarm bells yet.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55ae0a60e4b068507c072b80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-21T09:14:11.564Z\">10.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Unsurprisingly, the Treasury has welcomed the latest improvement in the public finances.</p> <p>A spokeswoman sends through this comment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s figures show that our deficit reduction plan is working, with cumulative borrowing over \u00a36bn lower than at this point last year.

      "bodyText": "Toshiba\u2019s boss has quit the Japanese conglomerate over a 152bn yen (\u00a3780m) accounting scandal that the government said threatened to undermine investors\u2019 confidence in the country. Hisao Tanaka, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, will be replaced by Toshiba\u2019s chairman, Masashi Muromachi, until a new chief executive is found. Tanaka\u2019s predecessors, Norio Sasaki, who is vice-chairman, and Atsutoshi Nishida, who is an adviser to the company, will also leave. Toshiba overstated its operating profits over several years in accounting irregularities involving its top management, an independent panel of accountants and lawyers said on Monday. Tanaka and Sasaki knew about the profit overstatement and created a pressurised corporate culture that prompted business heads to manipulate figures to meet targets, the investigators said in their report. At a news conference on Tuesday, Tanaka said he did not tell anyone to falsify accounts but that he would take responsibility for the investigators\u2019 findings at a company that is regarded as one of the emblems of Japan\u2019s industrial prowess. \u201cI see this as the most damaging event for our brand in the company\u2019s 140-year history,\u201d Tanaka said after making a ritual deep bow of contrition while cameras whirred and flashed. \u201cI don\u2019t think these problems can be overcome overnight.\u201d Tanaka and Sasaki originally intended to resign in the coming months, but their ousting was announced soon after a government minister said the scandal could damage international confidence in Japanese business. The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, said: \u201cIf [Japan] fails to implement appropriate corporate governance, it could lose the market\u2019s trust. It\u2019s very regrettable.\u201d Japan has been trying to demonstrate improved corporate governance after it was revealed in late 2011 that Olympus, another of the country\u2019s biggest names, had hidden $1.7bn (\u00a31.1bn) of losses over 13 years. The country still lags behind the UK and the US on the openness of its company reporting and the independence of boards of directors. In the UK, it would be highly unusual for two former chief executives to retain influence at a big company. Loizos Heracleous, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cThe Toshiba scandal will be seen in the context of the Olympus event, with investors wondering whether there is a pattern of account manipulation in corporate behaviour, and observing much more closely. Japanese regulatory authorities will need to reassure the markets that they are casting a watchful eye over Japanese corporations, and also that Japanese corporate culture is moving towards global expectations with respect to robustness of corporate governance.\u201d In total, eight company officials resigned following the report, and Tanaka said Toshiba is now considering recruiting outside directors for more than half its board seats. Improper accounting at Toshiba included overstatements and booking profits early or pushing back the recording of losses or charges. Those actions often resulted in still higher targets being set for business divisions in the following period. \u201cThis led to a need to carry out improper accounting on an even bigger scale, and as this was repeated, the scale of the inappropriate bookkeeping also expanded,\u201d the investigators\u2019 report said. Toshiba, whose products range from laptops and televisions to nuclear power plants and railway systems, is one of the fixtures of the Japanese corporate scene. Despite its shares losing almost a quarter of their value since the irregularities surfaced in April, it is still Japan\u2019s 10th biggest company by market value. It was created by a merger in 1938 but its roots date back to 1875 and it was one of the companies that turned Japan into an industrial power. Koichi Ueda, a lawyer who headed the investigating panel, said: \u201c[For] a company that represents Japan to be doing something like this institutionally was shocking.\u201d One of the investigators\u2019 early theories was that top managers set unrealistic targets for new operations because they were worried about the impact of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on Toshiba\u2019s nuclear division. The report did not mention Fukushima but it said pressure within Toshiba was particularly strong in the accounting years 2011 and 2012. The report said much of the improper accounting, which stretched back to 2008, was intentional and would have been difficult for auditors to detect. Toshiba will have to restate its accounts and could face big fines. Shares in Toshiba rose 6% on Tuesday on relief the report did not contain worse findings. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, the rating agency, said the required restatement of Toshiba\u2019s profit could lead to its credit rating being downgraded.",

    "webTitle": "Navigating decline: what happened to TomTom?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At the end of 2007, TomTom was on top of the world. The Dutch satnav maker had taken record revenues of \u20ac634m (\u00a3445m) in the Christmas quarter, sold a record 4.2m devices, and was making a net profit of \u20ac107m, an all-time high. The fall, when it came, was going to be hard, and it took less than two years: by the first quarter of 2009, revenues had slumped to \u20ac213m and it recorded a net loss of \u20ac37m. What happened? Corinne Vigreux, the chief executive who is also one of TomTom\u2019s four co-founders, puts it down to two factors: \u201cThe economic crisis in 2008 \u2013 plus smartphones became popular, and Google began offering navigation for free on [Android-powered] phones.\u201d The arrival of a search engine company in the field of in-car navigation is not the sort of threat you would normally plan for. But Vigreux, 50, has seen enough change in the technology business to know that \u201cyour competitors come from different fields \u2013 they\u2019re not the ones you expect them to be. Hilton Hotels would never have expected their margins would be eaten away by Airbnb. Every company starts with a blank sheet of paper, and some of them then arrive like a tsunami.\u201d For TomTom, survival would quickly become a matter of adapting to the new reality, in which Google could undermine the paid-for satnav business \u2013 which was then selling millions of units each quarter \u2013 with software that would quickly be in everyone\u2019s hands. But where would the money come from? TomTom had already decided that the future lay in providing map data and telematics for vehicle makers. In July 2007, it made a \u20ac2bn offer for Tele Atlas, the company\u2019s map data supplier, which was one of only two independent mapping companies (and also supplied Google). In October 2007, Nokia bid \u20ac5.7bn for Navteq, the other independent. US-based Garmin tried to snatch Tele Atlas, but a brief bidding war saw TomTom prevail with a \u20ac2.9bn bid; the deal closed in June 2008. But the stock market did not like TomTom\u2019s purchase, which was funded by debt and a new share issue. Its shares plunged from their high of \u20ac64.80. At the start of 2009, the company wrote off more than \u20ac1bn on the Tele Atlas purchase. Shares hit an all-time low of \u20ac2.84. For Vigreux, however, reinvention and building from the ground up is what she is used to. Her first managerial role was running exports at Psion, the iconic and hugely influential British technology company, in the 1990s. She travelled widely, which was her original aim in getting into business. \u201cNorth Africa, Israel, Europe,\u201d she said, having joined Psion from business school in 1987. Psion was a stalwart of British technology, producing a much loved handheld computer series that rivalled the Palm, from the US, in the 1990s. But the rise of mobile phones pushed it to a software-only path: its Symbian software became the basis of the first successful range of smartphones, from Nokia. Vigreux is following a similar route. After four years at Psion \u2013 \u201cit was one of the most interesting tech startups around; we learned a lot, there was a bunch of smart people\u201d \u2013 she moved to Holland to join a software distributor for the Psion and other handhelds, and then helped set up TomTom in 1991. Initially, it made business-facing products for meter reading and barcodes for the popular handhelds \u2013 Palm Pilot, Compaq iPaq and Psion Series 5. Smartphones were not yet in use. At first, it wrote mapping applications for the handhelds, squeezing data into tiny (by today\u2019s standards) amounts of storage. \u201cIt was very difficult to put everything into one product; we had a city [map] product, but we were already very good at compressing data so we could fit it in.\u201d The company then saw an opportunity to make mapping devices for consumers. Before May 2000, civilian GPS systems were accurate to within only 100 metres; only the military could get its \u201cfull\u201d accuracy of a few metres. But a Bill Clinton-enacted change made it open, and Vigreux and the team at TomTom saw an opportunity. Rather than having to rely on people who already owned expensive PDAs, they realised they could sell them dedicated objects for less. The first, the TomTom GO, cost \u00a3499 and was released in March 2004. \u201cAnd the first touchscreen,\u201d Vigreux says proudly. \u201cWe created the [satnav] category.\u201d The market exploded; Vigreux and the team, now 40-strong, saw the business grow from revenues of \u20ac42m to \u20ac1.8bn in four years. \u201cWe probably drove the Ferrari close to the cliff a few times,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much the technology that\u2019s difficult to handle; it\u2019s the part of the iceberg that you don\u2019t see \u2013 the operations, the planning, the forecasts \u2013 and that\u2019s with a four-to-six-month lead time for some of the products.\u201d Coping with growth was a challenge: \u201cIt got faster and faster, without a stop button.\u201d The abrupt braking, when it came, hit the company hard. In mid-2011, it recorded another \u20ac500m write-off on the dwindling outlook for the standalone satnav market. Tele Atlas services generated much smaller revenues than selling physical devices; in retrospect, the purchases of Tele Atlas and Navteq were fuelled by legitimate fears that Google and smartphones would change the world of mapping, away from high-priced profitable devices to lower-priced services. And keeping maps updated is expensive \u2013 the world keeps changing. The analyst Horace Dediu estimates that each mapmaker\u2019s annual upkeep costs are at least $1bn. As a result, TomTom is seeking new sources of revenue beyond in-car satnavs. It recently collaborated with Nike on a sports watch with inbuilt GPS. However, it is the potential for self-driving vehicles that Vigreux is most keen to exploit. She said: \u201cThey will have a massive impact on the way we live. At present, our cars aren\u2019t used very much in the day; maybe when they can drive themselves it\u2019ll be more efficient, and there will be fewer on the road.\u201d The key, though, will be the mapping data, and information about road conditions. This is where TomTom hopes to eke out an advantage by offering 3D features that it can update in real time \u2013 quicker than Google. Meanwhile, Nokia is selling Navteq, rebranded as HERE, with a price tag that could top \u00a32.5bn, and the most likely buyer is a consortium of German luxury carmakers: Audi, BMW and the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler. TomTom is a smaller business now: its first-quarter revenues were \u20ac205m with an operating profit of \u20ac21.4m, but net loss of \u20ac7m. Despite this, Vigreux says she is optimistic about the future. Yet she still frets about the state of consumer electronics companies in Europe compared to their rivals in the US. Vigreux said: \u201cIn Europe, we invented GSM [the system used worldwide for mobile phones]. Today everyone uses a phone. Yet there aren\u2019t any big European players in the field. Consumer technology makers are disappearing: Nokia, Sagem, Philips, Alcatel.\u201d Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft last year \u2013 it now makes mobile network equipment. And she is proud that \u201cwe\u2019re the only entrepreneurial consumer electronics company to come out of Europe with a global business\u201d. So why the lack of others? Waze and DeepMind, two of the most innovative non-US companies (in travel and artificial intelligence) were both snapped up by Google. \u201cMaybe we sell out too quickly - look at Skype as well,\u201d Vigreux says. \u201cRegulation might be part of it, but in the end the technology that consumers believe in and demand will win. Look at Uber - it is coming to a market that was over-regulated. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t look for excuses. Maybe there isn\u2019t the right ecosystem of capital, entrepreneurs and universities together. But we have got the talent and the creativity.\u201d Does she support the idea of quotas for women in boardrooms? Vigreux replies: \u201cI think some countries do need quotas, just to put it under the spotlight. But it\u2019s better just done naturally. If we want more women in the board, then we need more executives, so you need more earlier in the organisation, and they need a career path through the organisation.\u201d In fact, she thinks, the lack of talented staff is \u201cthe biggest issue most organisations are facing. You have to fish in a bigger pond to fill those gaps. So of course you should look at women too\u201d. Vigreux is always watching out for new challengers, having seen Google come from nowhere to undermine what was a solid business. But for now, she is keeping her balance \u2013 and finding a new route through all the change. **** Corinne Vigreux Born: Lyon, France, December 1964 University: MBA ESSEC Business School, Paris 1987-1993: Psion UK 1994: co-founded Palmtop Software - later rebranded as TomTom Since 2008: managing director, sales director and chief commercial officer, TomTom NV Recipient of the Legion d\u2019Honneur Languages: French, English, Dutch, German",

      "body": "<p>At the end of 2007, TomTom was on top of the world. The Dutch satnav maker had taken record revenues of \u20ac634m (\u00a3445m) in the Christmas quarter, sold a record 4.2m devices, and was making a net profit of \u20ac107m, an all-time high. The fall, when it came, was going to be hard, and it took less than two years: by the first quarter of 2009, revenues had slumped to \u20ac213m and it recorded a net loss of \u20ac37m.</p> <p>What happened? Corinne Vigreux, the chief executive who is also one of TomTom\u2019s four co-founders, puts it down to two factors: \u201cThe economic crisis in 2008 \u2013 plus smartphones became popular, and Google began offering navigation for free on [Android-powered] phones.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival of a search engine company in the field of in-car navigation is not the sort of threat you would normally plan for. But Vigreux, 50, has seen enough change in the technology business to know that \u201cyour competitors come from different fields \u2013 they\u2019re not the ones you expect them to be. Hilton Hotels would never have expected their margins would be eaten away by Airbnb. Every company starts with a blank sheet of paper, and some of them then arrive like a tsunami.\u201d</p> <p>For TomTom, survival would quickly become a matter of adapting to the new reality, in which Google could undermine the paid-for satnav business \u2013 which was then selling millions of units each quarter \u2013 with software that would quickly be in everyone\u2019s hands.

      "bodyText": "The Australian building activity figures released last week showed that in the face of a massive decline in engineering construction, building work is growing steadily \u2013 if not enough to make up for the decline of work in the mining sector. The figures also show that by far the biggest residential building growth is in apartments and other units. Such growth does generate concerns about oversupply, but thus far, especially in Melbourne, dwelling prices continue to grow and the building of apartments continues to soar. Residential construction is consistently larger than non-residential building work, but while non-residential building remains just above its pre-GFC level, residential building is well above \u2013 18% higher in March 2015 than it was in September 2008. But residential building activity is of a different type to that prior to the GFC, one that suggests a rather different type of living in the future for Australians in the major cities \u2013 especially Melbourne and Sydney. For the 40 years since the ABS began collecting data on building activity of houses and other residential building, such as apartments and flats, the level of spending on houses has been about three times that of non-house residences. The ratio fell in the 1990s and early 2000s, but just before the GFC, due to a drop in building of apartments, spending on houses was back up to 2.5 times that of non-houses: But in March this year the value of house building was just 1.46 times that of apartments, flats and other homes. And the change isn\u2019t due to a decline in house building. While there was a fall in house construction after 2010, and before the interest rate cuts at the end of 2011 kicked in, in March this year spending on houses was 17.3% above what it was in the September 2013 quarter. But spending on non-house residential buildings was 24.2% higher: And while this is not unexpected, given the recent housing boom has been largely driven by investors, it would be wrong to think it was all about Sydney. Melbourne has seen a stunning increase in the construction of apartments and other non-house residences since 2008, and a massive upturn in the past 12 months: From March 2014 to March this year, non-house building activity grew 6% in NSW, but a jaw-dropping 22% in Victoria. And the big difference is that building of non-houses and houses in NSW is usually in synch \u2013 even if during this boom the house building has fallen a bit behind that of apartments and flats: But in Victoria a stark change has occurred. In the March quarter, in trend terms, building started on 8,123 new apartments/flats, etc. In seasonally-adjusted terms, it was 9,009. Either way, both were records and both were for the first time effectively equal with the commencement of new -house building: This is a massive shift in housing in Melbourne. In March 2010, work started on a record 10,146 new houses while in that quarter just 4,715 non-house residential buildings began construction. Five years on the number of new houses started has dropped 18.5% while the number of apartments, flats, etc. has risen 72.3%. The ratio of houses to non-house building begun in Victoria is now much more aligned with that in NSW than it has ever been. The boom of apartments has also occurred in Brisbane and parts of Queensland, with the number of housing commencements in March only barely above that of apartments: All of this new building of course brings with it concerns about oversupply and a possible bubble. Certainly the Reserve Bank has been aware of such concerns. In its March financial stability review it noted \u201ca risk of oversupply in some regions, particularly in the inner-city areas of Melbourne and Brisbane\u201d. It further noted that \u201cthe risk of oversupply appears most evident in inner-city Melbourne, where the level of high-rise apartment construction has been elevated for a number of years\u201d. It also relayed that \u201cbanks and other firms have conveyed\u201d to the RBA \u201csome concern about possible future oversupply\u201d in the Brisbane market. For the moment these concerns look to be unheeded. While approvals of apartments does not perfectly align with actual construction (Sydney for example always has more approved but not yet built apartments than it does houses), the number of approved apartments not yet commenced continues to grow strongly in Victoria to record levels: The massive surge in the supply of apartments is not dimming the growth in house prices in Melbourne, and the rental vacancy rate also remains steady \u2013 suggesting that there is little sense currently of oversupply. The shift towards higher-density housing in Melbourne, but nationally as well, does suggest a different landscape in our cities and inner suburbs \u2013 where apartment living becomes more of the norm.",

      "body": "<p>The Australian building activity figures released last week showed that in the face of a massive decline in engineering construction, building work is growing steadily \u2013 if not enough to make up for the decline of work in the mining sector. The figures also show that by far the biggest residential building growth is in apartments and other units. </p> <p>Such growth does generate concerns about oversupply, but thus far, especially in Melbourne, dwelling prices continue to grow and the building of apartments continues to soar.</p> <p>Residential construction is consistently larger than non-residential building work, but while non-residential building remains just above its pre-GFC level, residential building is well above \u2013 18% higher in March 2015 than it was in September 2008.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Volume of building work done - Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IJ37K/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>Volume of building work done - Australia</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But residential building activity is of a different type to that prior to the GFC, one that suggests a rather different type of living in the future for Australians in the major cities \u2013 especially Melbourne and Sydney.</p> <p>For the 40 years since the ABS began collecting data on building activity of houses and other residential building, such as apartments and flats, the level of spending on houses has been about three times that of non-house residences. The ratio fell in the 1990s and early 2000s, but just before the GFC, due to a drop in building of apartments, spending on houses was back up to 2.5 times that of non-houses:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ratio of value of work on house to other residential buildings\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/G5avb/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption>Ratio of value of work on house to other residential buildings</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But in March this year the value of house building was just 1.46 times that of apartments, flats and other homes.</p> <p>And the change isn\u2019t due to a decline in house building. While there was a fall in house construction after 2010, and before the interest rate cuts at the end of 2011 kicked in, in March this year spending on houses was 17.3% above what it was in the September 2013 quarter. But spending on non-house residential buildings was 24.2% higher:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of residential building work done - Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ltETU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while this is not unexpected, given the recent housing boom has been largely driven by investors, it would be wrong to think it was all about Sydney.

In the March quarter, in trend terms, building started on 8,123 new apartments/flats, etc. In seasonally-adjusted terms, it was 9,009.</p> <p>Either way, both were records and both were for the first time effectively equal with the commencement of new -house building:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dwelling commencements \u2013\u00a0Victoria\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PQVMS/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is a massive shift in housing in Melbourne.

Certainly the Reserve Bank has been aware of such concerns. In its <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/fsr/2015/mar/html/contents.html\">March financial stability review</a> it noted \u201ca risk of oversupply in some regions, particularly in the inner-city areas of Melbourne and Brisbane\u201d.</p> <p>It further noted that \u201cthe risk of oversupply appears most evident in inner-city Melbourne, where the level of high-rise apartment construction has been elevated for a number of years\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/jul/13/the-housing-booms-not-over-but-theres-good-news-for-hopeful-buyers\">The housing boom's not over, but there's good news for hopeful buyers | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also relayed that \u201cbanks and other firms have conveyed\u201d to the RBA \u201csome concern about possible future oversupply\u201d in the Brisbane market.</p> <p>For the moment these concerns look to be unheeded. </p> <p>While approvals of apartments does not perfectly align with actual construction (Sydney for example always has more approved but not yet built apartments than it does houses), the number of approved apartments not yet commenced continues to grow strongly in Victoria to record levels:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Dwellings approved but not yet commenced \u2013 Victoria\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/V96uJ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The massive surge in the supply of apartments is not dimming the growth in house prices in Melbourne, and the rental vacancy rate also remains steady \u2013 suggesting that there is little sense currently of oversupply.</p> <p>The shift towards higher-density housing in Melbourne, but nationally as well, does suggest a different landscape in our cities and inner suburbs \u2013 where apartment living becomes more of the norm.</p>",

After his company won the bid to develop part of Brisbane\u2019s waterfront into a huge casino and resort complex, Echo Entertainment boss Matt Bekier said on Tuesday that Australia could be seeing the beginning of a tourism boom. \u201cThis is going to be the next mining boom,\u201d the Echo chief executive said. \u201cIf we look in Asia in terms of the aspiration of where people want to go to, Australia stands out as No 1 in terms of aspiration and desire to go to. But we\u2019re about number 14 of the places they actually go to, there\u2019s a huge opportunity.\u201d China is Australia\u2019s fastest growing tourism market with 918,000 visitors in 2014 \u2013 a rise of 21.7% \u2013 and second only to New Zealand. Chinese visitors were, however, the biggest spenders in Australia, splurging $5.7bn in 2014, up 19% on the previous year. The continuing fall in the Aussie dollar, which some experts believe could fall to around US60 cents, is likely to help Bekier\u2019s prediction by making tourists\u2019 money go further. The US dollar strengthened again overnight on Monday after James Bullard, who sits on the US Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting committee, said a rate rise was likely in September. Combined with the falling price of key commodities such as iron ore, gold and oil, his comments put more pressure on the Aussie which lost ground on Tuesday to sit at US73.51c in afternoon trading. The minutes of the July meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia also kept the downward momentum on the currency when they were published on Tuesday. The bank said the Aussie\u2019s drop against the US dollar to six-year lows was not boosting the economy as expected. \u201cFurther depreciation seemed both likely and necessary,\u201d the RBA said. However, it noted noted signs of continued improvement in the jobs market, and said inflation remains well contained. Bekier said Echo, which beat James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts to the Brisbane prize, would be moving its headquarters and 300 staff to the city to oversee the new project. The Queen\u2019s Wharf waterfront precinct includes five hotels, three residential towers, 50 bars and restaurants, a grand ballroom, a cinema and new footbridge to across the river to South Bank. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the project would attract millions of tourists annually. \u201cThe flow-on effects will be felt for decades to come,\u201d she added. Tourism Australia managing director, John O\u2019Sullivan, said that Australia was entering an important economic cycle where its service sectors would play an increasingly important role in driving the country\u2019s future success and sustainability. \u201cWith international tourism to Australia continuing to grow to record levels continued investment in new product, including integrated resorts, as well as existing tourism product is critical to ensure we are able to cater to the growing number of visitors,\u201d he said. \u201cEnsuring we have a diverse range of product and experiences to meet the rapid growth and needs of this market in particular will become all the more important,\u201d Mr O\u2019Sullivan said. Construction on the Brisbane project is set to begin in 2017.",
