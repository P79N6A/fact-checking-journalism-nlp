      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports are a \u201cblack day\u201d for the world, according to the chief executive of BHP. Andrew Mackenzie\u2019s comments on Tuesday came as reports suggested Trump would meet American steel and aluminium users at the White House later this week to hear their concerns about proposed tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminium. The meeting organised by White House economics adviser Gary Cohn is part of a Republican rearguard action against the president\u2019s plan, which House speaker Paul Ryan has called \u201cextremely worrying\u201d. The Republican pushback, which was also supported by business groups who called the tariffs a tax on the middle class, helped shares in the Asia Pacific recover on Tuesday after slumping in the wake of Trump\u2019s surprise announcement. Analysts said investor anxiety about a trade war had eased, sending MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up by 1.3%. The Nikkei jumped 2.3%, a day after it hit a five-month low. Mackenzie, who heads world\u2019s largest mining company, said it was too early to tell how the tariffs would affect BHP, but he told a conference in Sydney he was concerned the restrictions could damage the current optimism towards free trade. \u201cOutside of the US the sense that I have at the moment is that people are re-embracing free trade after a bit of a wobble \u2013 partly driven by the result of several elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon but I am worried about this sort of sentiment shift, that people all around the world might suddenly say free trade is not good for the world, and that would be particularly bad for a trading company like BHP and a trading nation like Australia.\u201d Despite the uncertainty created by the tariffs, the BHP boss still believes the global economy is in its best shape in eight years. \u201cIn spite of recent moves made by the United States to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium products - a black day for the world and business - elsewhere we do observe buoyant economic conditions underpinned by the growth of free trade outside the US,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cWe see the world economy in probably the strongest shape it has been since 2010.\u201d Mackenzie said free trade was the \u201clifeblood and promoter of health\u201d of the global economy, and he expects it to flourish despite the recent developments in the US. \u201cWe [BHP] will live and die by what happens with free trade,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will never hide or seek to hide behind trade barriers to shield ourselves from our lack of competitiveness.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has ended the day pretty much where it started it. The Dow closed just 9 points higher at 24,884, as traders watched to see how the to-ing and fro-ing over tariffs will play out. Paul Ryan\u2019s call for \u2018surgical\u2019 tariffs, targeting countries who dump steel on America, confirms he\u2019s not happy with Donald Trump\u2019s plans and wants to water them down. But it\u2019s also a sign that some form of protectionist policies are heading our way. If so, a trade war can\u2019t be discounted.... On that cheery note - goodnight! GW Barry Gardiner MP, shadow Secretary of State for International Trade, is calling for the UK government to take a tougher line over Trump\u2019s tariffs. Gardiner (a member of the opposition Labour party) says strong action is needed: \u201cPresident Trump has made clear his appetite for a trade war. It started with Bombardier, and has now moved on to steel and aluminium. We are seeing a real threat to thousands of British jobs linked to UK exports to the US. On top of that there is a risk that other steel exporting countries try to reroute their surplus capacity from the US into the UK. \u201cWe need strong government action now, including at a multilateral level through the WTO, before entire sectors of UK industry are left wondering who\u2019s next.\u201d Ding! European stock markets have closed, with cautious optimism pushing shares higher. The FTSE 100 ended the day up 30 points at 7,146, up 0.4%. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.2%, but the standout performer was Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB which jumped by 1.75%. Fiona Cincotta, market analyst at City Index, says the prospect of North and South Korea holding a summit next month boosted risk appetite in the markets: North Korea has agreed to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests, whilst engaging in dialogue with South Korea. North Korea has also expressed an interest in holding talks with the US. These comments were made by Kim Jong Un to South Korea\u2019s national security chief in what can only be described as a complete change in tune from the rogue nation. The growing opposition to Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs from, among others, Gary Cohn and Paul Ryan is also soothing investors, she adds: Fears over a trade war appear to be abating as opposition to the measures, even from with Trump\u2019s own party are increasing. Whilst trade war fears haven\u2019t been completely erased, its fair to say that there are increasing doubts as to whether Trump will be able to go ahead with such a risky economic policy. However.... The US stock market isn\u2019t quite as cheerful; the main indices are in the red as New York heads for lunch... Wall Street\u2019s early rally is fizzling out. The Dow is now down 130 points, or 0.5%, having been up over 100 points at the open. Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, has warned the markets not to get complacent about the dangers of a trade war: \u201cWhile the deficit with China was the initial focus of much of Trump\u2019s ire, the real casualties of the proposed trade tariffs on steel and aluminium would be Canada and Mexico \u2013 both close allies. This may be part of a wider negotiating tact, flexing muscles in the run up to NAFTA negotiations. However, steel and aluminium import volumes make up little of the overall deficit, hence the actual economic impact of these tariffs is likely to be minimal. But the ripple effect is as yet unknowable if it causes further retaliation beyond words. Moreover, if these tariffs are a precursor to tougher trade relations with China, which alone accounts for over half to the US trade deficit, then this friction could have economic consequences. \u201cAt the moment markets largely seem unaffected, but if the war of words turns into actual tariffs and a trade war, markets are likely to react sharply. What began as campaign trail bombast, now risks undermining the success of the administration\u2019s biggest achievement to date \u2013 better economic growth as a result of tax reforms.Let\u2019s hope the globalists in the Trump administration prevail over the trade warriors.\u2019 John Higgins of Capital Economics says emerging markets could be badly hit: Donald Trump\u2019s bite may yet match his bark. In this case, we would expect the US dollar to rebound against the Mexican peso and the currencies of many other emerging economies, despite their weaker direct trade ties with the US. Admittedly, the US president\u2019s attitude to trade is not the only influence on the exchange rates of emerging market currencies. This can clearly be seen in the case of the Korean won. It has appreciated by more against the greenback so far this month than any other currency in the Fed\u2019s broad dollar index, amid signs of a thawing of relations between North and South Korea. But more generally, renewed concerns about a global trade war would almost certainly hit demand for \u201crisky\u201d emerging market currencies again, as it did initially after Trump\u2019s inflammatory \u201ctweets\u201d. What\u2019s more, it is likely that the prices of many commodities would fall back once more, adversely affecting some emerging market countries\u2019 terms of trade. The flipside would probably be a renewed strengthening of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, which are perceived to be \u201csafe havens\u201d. These were two of the biggest beneficiaries against the US dollar at the very outset of March, but they have since given back much of their gains. In another twist, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has just declared that Mexico and Canada could be exempted from new steel and aluminium tariffs. Testifying to Congress, Mnuchin says that Canada wouldn\u2019t be subject to them... IF the NAFTA trade deal is successfully renegotiated. There\u2019s growing speculation that Gary Cohn, Donald Trump\u2019s top economic advisor, could quit the White House over the tariffs row. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs, is fighting a rearguard action against Trump\u2019s plan -- calling in US business leaders who firms would be hit if steel and aluminium imports were costlier. Bloomberg reports that Trump suspects that Cohn could walk if he can\u2019t change the president\u2019s mind.... President Donald Trump has told advisers that he believes economic adviser Gary Cohn will leave his White House job if Trump decides to go forward with tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, people familiar with the matter say. Cohn has mounted a last-ditch effort, along with other administration officials and some Republican lawmakers, to head off steep tariffs that threaten to unleash a global trade war. Cohn has been summoning executives from U.S. companies that depend on the metals to meet this week with Trump to try to blunt or halt the tariffs, according to those familiar with the meeting planning. It\u2019s unclear whether Cohn\u2019s moves would be enough to change the president\u2019s mind. In a classic Trump move, the president has added to the mystery by tweeting that he\u2019s always looking to shake-up his staff in search for \u2018perfection\u2019 (aim high, Mr President!) More here: Here\u2019s a chart putting January\u2019s fall in US factory orders into context: Newsflash: Top Republican Paul Ryan has called for \u2018surgical\u2019 tariffs to be imposed on countries who are dumping steel and aluminium on the US economy. Speaking to reporters in Washington, House speaker Ryan says Donald Trump is right to point out that \u201csome abuse\u201d is occurring. Some countries, such as China, are dumping steel at unfairly low prices, he says. But rather than a blanket tariff, Ryan argues that America needs a \u2018smart\u2019 approach. Tariffs should be targeted so they focus on this \u2018legitimate\u2019 problem, rather than covering all countries, he said. As Ryan puts it: There clearly is dumping and trans-shipping of steel and aluminium. That\u2019s absolutely happening. There\u2019s a big overcapacity problem. Let\u2019s go and focus on that. Let\u2019s focus on the abusers of that. That\u2019s why we think the proper approach is a more surgical approach, so we do not have unintended consequences\u201d. In other words, this could avoid the risk of triggering a global trade war, and tit-for-tat retaliation from the European Union or Canada, for example. Just in: US factories have suffered their biggest drop in orders in six months. New orders for US-made goods shrank by 1.4% in January, new figures from the Commerce department show. That\u2019s the worst performance since last July, and follows a 1.8% gain in December. The decline was mainly driven by transport orders, which shrank 10% thanks to a drop in demand for civilian aircraft (a fairly volatile market). Stripping out transport, and the underlying orders were up by 0.4% - compared to 0.8% in December. The markets may be up, but there\u2019s no escape from Brexit anxiety. Today\u2019s warning comes from the head of carmaker Vauxhall, who has warned that the lack of clarity over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU threatens the future of its Ellesmere Port factory in North West England. Carlos Tavares, chief executive of French parent PSA, told the BBC that the lack of clarity over Brexit is \u201ca big concern\u201d, and could threaten Ellesmere Port\u2019s chances of getting more work after 2021. Tavares adds: \u201cWe cannot invest in a world of uncertainty. No one is going to make huge investments without knowing what will be the final competitiveness of the Brexit outcome.\u201d The New York stock market has just opened....and stocks are rising. The Dow has gained 80 points, or 0.3%, and there are similar gains on the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Traders are encouraged by the news that North and South Korea have agreed to hold a summit next month. As some of the geopolitical risk within the markets falls, shares rise and the US dollar dips. Wall Street is also reacting to speculation that Donald Trump could be persuaded not to implement tariffs on steel and aluminium - in the face of opposition from other countries and criticism from domestic politicians including US House speaker Paul Ryan. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, says: Risk appetite has improved on headlines North Korea has expressed a willingness to talk about denuclearization, according to South Korea. The North is apparently willing to discuss surrendering its nuclear weapons and freeze nuclear and missile programmes if it begins direct talks with the US. This is a dramatic easing of tensions. It follows a visit by senior South Korean politicians. Now it has emerged that Kim Jong-un will be meeting South Korean president Moon Jae-in in late April. Meanwhile fears over Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium have also eased after top Republicans advised against the plan. The US president has poured a little cold water over the markets\u2019 enthusiasm, warning that the breakthrough between North Korea and South Korea could be \u2018false hope\u2019. Here\u2019s political scientist Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group on the Korean breakthrough: Oil is also rallying, on hopes of detente between the two Koreas. Brent crude has gained almsot 1% to $66.09 per barrel. Here\u2019s my colleague Benjamin Haas in Gangneung, South Korea, on the breakthrough with North Korea today that has cheered the markets. North Korea is willing to discuss relinquishing its nuclear weapons, and will freeze its nuclear and missile programmes if it begins direct talks with the US, in a dramatic easing of tensions following a visit by senior South Korean politicians. The country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, will also meet his South Korean counterpart, president Moon Jae-in, in late April in the first summit of its kind in over a decade, Seoul\u2019s presidential office said. The two leaders will meet at Panmunjom, the only part of the highly militarised border where the North and South have any kind of contact. North Korea pledged to not use conventional or nuclear weapons against its neighbour, despite frequent threats from Pyongyang. The two sides have remained in a technical state of war since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. \u201cThe North side clearly affirmed its commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and said it would have no reason to possess nuclear weapons should the safety of its regime be guaranteed and military threats against North Korea removed,\u201d a South Korean presidential spokesman said, according to the Yonhap news agency. \u201cThe South and the North have agreed to set up a hotline between their leaders to allow close consultations and a reduction of military tension, while also agreeing to hold the first phone conversation before the third South-North summit..... More here: The South Korean won is getting a big boost - gaining 1.1% against the US dollar following the reports of a breakthrough with North Korea. The US dollar has suddenly slumped, and Wall Street futures have rallied, following reports that North and South Korea have agreed to hold a summit next month. This would be the first such summit in a decade, and could signal that relations between Seoul and Pyongyang are thawing. According to media reports, North Korea has also agreed to suspend all weapons testing during the summit in April. And in what could be a very significant move, North Korea has reportedly indicated that it could be willing to dispose of its nuclear technology. South Korean President Moon Jae-in\u2019s office says (via Bloomberg): \u201cNorth Korea has clearly expressed its intention for denuclearlization on the Korean peninsula, and if there is no military threat, and North Korea\u2019s regime security is promised, they have clarified that there is no reason to hold nuclear weapons.\u201d The prospect of tensions easing between North Korea and South Korea, and with the United States, has had an immediate impact on the markets. The US dollar has fallen against other currencies -- typically a sign that investors are less nervous. It\u2019s lost half a cent against the pound, to $1.39. The US stock market is also expected to jump when it opens later today. Department chain John Lewis has given us an insight into the damage caused by last week\u2019s disruptively snowy weather. Total sales for the week slumped by 14.4% on the same period last year, the company says, despite \u201can incredible effort to support trading\u201d by its staff. Electricals and Home Technology sales were down 6.3%, however heating products were up 265% on this week -- perhaps caused by households whose boilers failed in the big freeze. Sales of tumble dryers were up too, as families struggled with an avalanche of wet clothing. But every snowcloud has a silver lining -- sales of hats, gloves and scarfs with sales up 38%. Sales of boots were also up 36% compared to last year. A round of applause for City AM please.... After three hours of trading, Europe\u2019s stock markets are holding onto their early gains. The FTSE 100 is up 71 points, or 1.01%, at 7,187 - extending yesterday\u2019s recovery from Friday night\u2019s 14-month low. Italy\u2019s stock market is now leading the charge, up 1.4%, despite the political deadlock created by Sunday\u2019s general election. Miles Eakers, Chief Market Analyst at Centtrip, predicts that the recovery will continue - if fears of a trade war continue to ebb away. \u201cGlobal stock markets continue to trade within their medium-term trading range after another sell-off last week. \u201cWe expect they will continue to rise as fears of a trade war have subsided and there is some optimism that a Brexit transitional deal will be reached. Meanwhile, the Italian election had no major surprising outcomes, but the strong support for North League will unnerve the European Central Bank with its Eurosceptic stance. \u201cAs risk appetite has returned, we expect the Pound and the Euro will strengthen against the US Dollar.\u201d Italian government bonds are also strengthening, even though populist parties secured around half the votes on Sunday. Back to trade war fears..... and Bloomberg is reporting that the EU is drawing up its retaliation if Donald Trump imposes tariffs on steel and aluminium. Levi\u2019s jeans, bourbon and US motorbikes are all on the list of products that could be slapped with a 25% tariff..... Here\u2019s the details: The European Union is preparing punitive tariffs on iconic U.S. brands produced in key Republican constituencies, raising political pressure on President Donald Trump to ditch his plans for taxing steel and aluminum imports. Targeting \u20ac2.8bn ($3.5bn) of American goods, the EU aims to apply a 25 percent tit-for-tat levy on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products imported from the U.S. if Trump follows through on his tariff threat, according to a list drawn up by the European Commission and obtained by Bloomberg News. The list of targeted U.S. goods -- including motorcycles, jeans and bourbon whiskey -- sends a political message to Washington about the potential domestic economic costs of making good on the president\u2019s threat.

It\u2019s their normal Punk IPA, but bottled in a pretty pink label. It\u2019ll be sold at a 20% discount in BrewDog bars to those who identify as women - to highlight the gender pay gap. Why, I hear you cry, would anyone do this? BrewDog say it\u2019s \u201ca send-up of the lazy marketing efforts targeting the female market\u201d, and their way of helping to tackle inequality. It is also promising to donate 20% (the gender pay gap in the UK) of its proceeds from bottled Pink IPA and Punk IPA to causes that fight against gender inequality. Sarah Warman, BrewDog\u2019s Global Head of Marketing, says the company wants to help get more women into the beer-making industry. She adds: \u201cSexism in the beer industry is rife. We can no longer ignore that its existence prevents plenty of incredible women joining our eclectic and exciting industry. There is a long history of products that pander and patronise through harmful, sexist stereotypes and vulgar imagery, and we\u2019re rallying to put an end to this nonsense. The love of beer is not gendered. Beer is universal. Beer is for everyone.\u201d However, launching a pink beer for girls, even ironically, may not be the best way forwards. BrewDog is already getting a savaging on social media, including from Labour MP Jo Stevens: Here\u2019s City AM\u2019s Alys Key.... ..and writer Chloe Combi: But... Daniel Pryor of the Adam Smith Institute likes the idea Newsflash: The UK government has launched an investigation into the way the Co-operative Bank was regulated in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The probe will focus on Co-op\u2019s failed attempt to take over more than 600 branches from Lloyds. That bid collapsed in early 2013 when the problems on Co-op\u2019s balance sheet came to light. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: The British government on Tuesday asked the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to investigate its oversight of Cooperative Bank, in an independent review aimed at shedding light on how the troubled lender was supervised during 2008 and 2013. It said the investigation would focus on the Cooperative Bank\u2019s failed bid for 632 branches of Lloyds Banking Group in 2013. The PRA said it supported the call to launch an independent review of its supervision during a disruptive period for the bank, which was later found to suffer from significant funding problems and poor corporate governance. \u201cSince it was established in 2013, the PRA has been committed to learning the lessons of the past and the findings of this review will help the PRA meet its objectives in the future\u201d, the regulator said in a statement. Paul Flowers, the former Co-op Bank chairman who was dubbed the \u2018Crystal Methodist\u2019 after being caught in a drugs scandal in 2013, has been banned from working in the City. The Financial Conduct Authority has ruled that Flowers had shown \u201ca lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services\u201d. Flowers\u2019 chairman-ship of the Co-op Bank was not a great success. The bank was taken over by hedge funds after a massive black hole opened in its accounts. He also suffered a fearful grilling before MPs, where he revealed he didn\u2019t know the size of the Bank\u2019s assets. He fell from grace after being filmed apparently counting out \u00a3300 to buy cocaine and crystal meth in a drugs deal. He was later convicted of possession, which let to his dismissal as a minister by the Methodist Church. But, perhaps surprisingly, Flowers hasn\u2019t been banned for these failings. Instead, the FCA has sanctioned him for misusing his Co-op email account and mobile phone for, err, adult services. In a ruling published this morning, the FCA says that Flowers: used his work mobile telephone to make a number of inappropriate telephone calls to a premium rate chat line in breach of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank policies; and used his work email account to send and receive sexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages, and to discuss illegal drugs, in breach of Co-op Group and Co-op Bank policies despite having been previously warned about his earlier misconduct. The parliamentary session on the GKN takeover is underway - it\u2019s being streamed live here. We\u2019ll keep an ear on it..... A group of cross-party MPs has urged business secretary Greg Clark to block the proposed \u00a37bn hostile takeover of the British engineering company GKN by turnaround specialist Melrose. That ratchets up the tensions ahead of this morning\u2019s session at parliament, where Melrose and GKN bosses will face MPs. Angela Monaghan explains: Ahead of this select committee appearance by executives from both companies on Tuesday, the 16 MPs asked Clark to intervene in order to prevent a \u201cworld class\u201d industrial company from being \u201cdismembered\u201d, relating to concerns that Melrose would break the 259-year-old company into pieces before selling it off. \u201cA takeover of GKN by Melrose is highly likely to mean the break-up of GKN, and the selling on \u2013 and possible disappearance \u2013 of several of its constituent important components including its aerospace, driveline, powder metallurgy and additive divisions,\u201d the MPs wrote, according to the Financial Times. Britain is facing a sharp jump in business failures, according to a new report from trade insurer Euler Hermes. Euler Hermes warned overnight that the number of insolvencies in the UK will increase by +8% in 2018. That follows a 5% rise in 2017, as firm struggle to cope with rising costs and falling consumer confidence. It says: The UK will experience the second largest rise in business failures of any of the major global economies this year as uncertainties about Brexit become more pronounced. While China is expected to suffer a 10% jump in insolvencies, the picture is brighter in Europe. France (-7%), Germany (-4%), Netherlands (-5%) and Belgium (-5%) are all expected to see a drop in business failures, thanks to the strengthening European economy. A jump in insolvencies can have a serious knock-on effect on the wider economy, as firms lay off staff and default on payments to suppliers. Milo Bogaerts, Chief Executive, Euler Hermes UK and Ireland, explains: The rise in insolvencies has the potential to start a domino effect of overdue or non-payment which, as we have seen in recent months, can impact large companies and smaller suppliers throughout entire supply chains. At the same time, two possible base rate increases (+50bp to 1%) this year may progressively translate into higher interest costs for companies and households. Monitoring client and supplier payment behaviour is key given the high levels of uncertainty, company debt and thin corporate margins in some sectors. Worryingly, Euler Hermes predicts that UK corporate investment will shrink by up to 3% in the run up to Brexit in 2019, as firms hunker down. There\u2019s a frisson of takeover action in the City this morning. Shares in packaging firm Smurfit Kappa have soared by almost 20% after it received a takeover bid from US rival International Paper Company. Smurfit - described by the FT as \u201cEurope\u2019s largest cardboard box maker\u201d - has firmly rejected the approach, claiming it doesn\u2019t reflect its full value. Liam O\u2019Mahony, Chairman of Smurfit Kappa, says the company would be better off remaining independent. He says: \u201cThe Board of Smurfit Kappa has unanimously rejected this unsolicited and highly opportunistic Proposal. It does not reflect the Group\u2019s true intrinsic business worth or its prospects. Shares in rival packaging firms, such as Mondi and DS Smith, have also jumped this morning as investors anticipate a wave of mergers and consolidation across the sector. The president and CEO of Volvo has warned that it could abandon expansion plans in America, if Donald Trump triggers a trade war. Volvo has just built a new car-making plant in South Carolina, which employs four thousand people. Speaking at the Geneva Motor Show, Hakan Samuelsson told Bloomberg TV that half the cars build in Carolina are exported -- so effectively Volvo has already created 2,000 jobs in America that could have gone elsewhere. Volvo had been planning to expand the plant to create another 2,000 jobs, but Samuelsson warns that this could be at risk. If we cannot trade freely, you question can you really employ two thousand extra people? Samuelsson added that it\u2019s \u201ctoo early to speculate\u201d, but insists that protectionism should be resisted. If you think it through, everyone will see that it\u2019s beneficial for everyone to trade freely. We believe in free trade and it\u2019s good for everybody. A risk-on feeling has pushed European stock markets higher in early trading. Investors are putting trade war fears, and the inconclusive Italian election, behind them (for now, anyway). Germany is leading the charge, up 1.27%, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up almost 1%. In Milan, the Italian FTSE MIB has gained 1% too. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the City is reassured to see top Republicans, such as speaker Paul Ryan, break with Trump and oppose a trade war. While this signals yet more destabilising discord for the President, investors\u2019 primary focus was on the tariff-blocking obstacles created by Ryan and co., and their relief was immediate to see. There\u2019s relief in the markets that other world leaders haven\u2019t retaliated against the US over the planned tariffs on steel and aluminium. In particular, Beijing has taken a cautious stance, with Chinese officials insisting they don\u2019t want a trade war with America. That\u2019s helping to push shares higher today. But Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, warns that this situation may not last. On the back of this pause in trade tensions, currencies and equities are able to breathe easier with the major European currency pairs and the US equity markets leading the gains, which has started the week on a positive footing. However, this respite from risk aversion should be treated as just a break and traders need to remain cautious until we get a clear response from China, and the Eurozone, to Trump\u2019s protectionist decision. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The financial markets are rebounding today, as fears over an imminent global trade war recede. Investors are betting that president Trump will back away from triggering a protectionist clash that would hurt global growth. With top Republicans like Paul Ryan criticising Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, hope is building that a compromise will be found. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: Investors seem to believe that President Trump is using his \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d skills to get a better trade deals with the rest of the world or, as Ray Dalio, the Bridgewater Associates founder, wrote on Monday: \u201cwhat is happening now is more for political show than for real threatening.\u201d Trump tweeted yesterday that \u201cTariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new &amp; fair NAFTA agreement is signed\u201d. This confirms my belief that this mess will likely end up with Mexico, E.U. and China taking a less protectionist stance, rather than the U.S. taking a stronger one. So after several days of losses, Asian markets are rebounding with Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumping by almost 2%. Hong Kong is up over 2%, with China\u2019s main markets gaining 1%. European markets are also heading for gains, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 rallying up to 60 points in early trading. However, investors should still be cautious. As the World Trade Organisation warned yesterday, a global trade war could leave the world in a \u201cdeep recession\u201d. The takeover battle for British aerospace and automotive company GKN will also be in the spotlight today. MPs will quiz managers from GKN, and from Melrose over its takeover bid, plus union leaders, amid concerns that the \u2018world-class\u2019 company could be broken up. The agenda 9.30am GMT: Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee holds hearing into GKN takeover 3pm GMT: US factory orders",

This may be part of a wider negotiating tact, flexing muscles in the run up to NAFTA negotiations. However, steel and aluminium import volumes make up little of the overall deficit, hence the actual economic impact of these tariffs is likely to be minimal. But the ripple effect is as yet unknowable if it causes further retaliation beyond words.</p> <p>Moreover, if these tariffs are a precursor to tougher trade relations with China, which alone accounts for over half to the US trade deficit, then this friction could have economic consequences.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment markets largely seem unaffected, but if the war of words turns into actual tariffs and a trade war, markets are likely to react sharply. What began as campaign trail bombast, now risks undermining the success of the administration\u2019s biggest achievement to date \u2013 better economic growth as a result of tax reforms.Let\u2019s hope the globalists in the Trump administration prevail over the trade warriors.\u2019</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>John Higgins of Capital Economics says emerging markets could be badly hit:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s bite may yet match his bark. In this case, we would expect the US dollar to rebound against the Mexican peso and the currencies of many other emerging economies, despite their weaker direct trade ties with the US.</p> <p>Admittedly, the US president\u2019s attitude to trade is not the only influence on the exchange rates of emerging market currencies. This can clearly be seen in the case of the Korean won.

      "bodyText": "A $93m (\u00a367m) superyacht owned by Indian multimillionaire Vijay Mallya has been impounded in Malta in a dispute over the businessman\u2019s failure to pay the crew more than $1m in wages. Mallya\u2019s 95-metre Indian Empress was boarded by port officials and prevented from leaving Malta on Tuesday as part of the crew\u2019s legal action to recover unpaid wages. More than 40 crew, including several Britons, Indians and eastern European workers, have not been paid since September when Mallya \u2013 who is fighting extradition from the UK to India \u2013 abandoned the vessel. Some of the senior crew, who have not left the vessel since it was abandoned, are owed up to $92,000 in unpaid wages. Mallya, a co-owner of the Force India Formula One team and self-proclaimed \u201cKing of the Good Times\u201d, was arrested in London last year over allegations he supported his F1 team with money-laundered cash. Indian authorities are seeking his extradition to face trial in India. Mallya is on bail pending an extradition hearing scheduled to begin in April. Danny McGowan, strategic organiser of the maritime union Nautilus International, said crew were left with no choice but to ask the courts to hold the Isle of Man-registered superyacht ransom. The yacht, which features a 15-seat cinema and Sir Elton John\u2019s baby grand piano, has been impounded in a \u201cmaritime lien\u201d which gives the crew claim over the vessel to the value of the unpaid wages. \u201cOur members onboard gave their employer and the ship owner multiple opportunities to pay monthly wages, displaying a loyalty and restraint greater than many would show in such situations,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cThese opportunities were regularly ignored by the owner, leaving us with no option but to take the case to the courts.\u201d McGowan said it was the first that the financial security provisions of the Maritime Labour Convention have been enacted to help crew on an abandoned superyacht. He said the union had secured $615,000, which covers four months worth of unpaid wages from the vessel\u2019s insurers under the international Maritime Labour Convention. But he said Nautilus members were still owed an additional $330,000 and non-union crew members were owed hundreds of thousands more. Charles Boyle, Nautilus\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cThe superyacht sector is seen as one of glamour and glitz, but the sad reality is that crew members can experience exploitation and abuse, and that is why Nautilus has become increasingly involved in such justice case.\u201d A representative for Mallya did not respond to requests for comment. The 62-year-old businessman is on bail and living in a \u00a311.5m mansion in the Hertfordshire village of Tewin, nearly Welwyn, 20 miles north of London. Mallya, who was once known as the \u201cBranson of Bangalore\u201d for his business and sport empire that included Kingfisher beer and the Kingfisher airline, bought the Indian Empress in 2006. He spent more than \u00a35m refitting the yacht in 2015, which included making space for Sir Elton John\u2019s black Yamaha Disklavier, which the singer had used to write the Songs from the West Coast album. Mallya bought the piano for \u20ac226,000 at a charity auction.",

      "bodyText": "In the latest sign of retailers battening down the hatches Debenhams is considering renting space in its flagship London department store to a hot desking firm. The retailer is in talks to rent floor space to flexible-office provider WeWork, as it looks to scale back its high street presence. Last year Debenhams chief executive Sergio Bucher announced a shake-up of the 240-store chain that would close 10 shops, downsize others and strike partnerships with outside firms. It has already teamed up with Sweat! to open three gyms in surplus space. Retailers, including the major supermarkets, have been trying to get rid of excess space by bringing in other brands, cafes or restaurants, but are yet to tap into the market for shared office space. The talks with WeWork, a fast-growing American company, are said to be at an early stage, according to Bloomberg which first reported the discussions. Debenhams pruned its store management teams last month with 320 jobs going as part of a \u00a310m cost-saving plan launched in the wake of a disappointing Christmas. Bucher is also facing pressure from its biggest shareholder, Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, which last week upped its stake to 29.7%, just shy of the level that would trigger a bid for the company. Separately, it emerged that House of Fraser\u2019s Chinese parent, Sanpower, is set to hand control of the struggling chain to another investor. In 2014 the conglomerate, controlled by one of China\u2019s richest men, Yuan Yafei, acquired an 89% stake via its department store arm, Nanjing Cenbest. The group had promised to invest in the British chain but extra funding has not been enough to stop the business from struggling. In a stock market announcement on Tuesday, Nanjing Cenbest said it was in talks to sell 51% to Wuji Wenhua, a Chinese leisure group. \u201cNanjing Cenbest is in advanced discussions with Wuji Wenhua with a view to Wuji investing in House of Fraser,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that Wuji Wenhua can be a strong strategic equity partner as they possess vast experience in the leisure sector and have access to a large network of travellers.\u201d Like Debenhams, House of Fraser wants to cut the size of stores in an effort to slash its rent bill after a tough Christmas. House of Fraser said the proposed share sale would have no impact on the day-to-day operations, declaring: \u201cIt is business as usual.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The antics of Paul Flowers, aka \u201cthe Crystal Methodist\u201d from the Co-op Bank, feel like ancient history, so it almost came as a surprise to be reminded that the Financial Conduct Authority was still rooting around past disasters at the \u201cethical\u201d bank. The regulator\u2019s conclusion: Flowers has been banned from working in financial services, but not because of any day-to-day incompetence as chair of a bank that came close to collapse. Rather, the former reverend was ringing premium-rate chat lines on his work phone and used his email account to transmit \u201csexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages\u201d and discuss illegal drugs. As the FCA says with a straight face, \u201cthis pattern of disregard for standards that he is expected to meet demonstrates a lack of integrity\u201d. A more pressing question, however, is why it took the FCA four years to reach its conclusion. One assumes it is because the regulator was contemplating other enforcement actions against individuals at the Co-op Bank before deciding it didn\u2019t have sufficient evidence. Even so, a four-year investigation that ends up banning one individual (who is retired and unemployable for practical purposes) for sex and drug matters feels like a waste of valuable time. The serious consequence is that it is only now that the Treasury can order work to start on a separate independent review into whether regulators were asleep at wheel as the Co-op Bank descended into its \u00a31.5bn black hole. That investigation was first announced in 2013 but was delayed while the FCA did its enforcement thing. Investigatory wheels, it\u2019s probably true, must turn in the correct order. But why can\u2019t they turn more quickly? Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, clearly shares the frustration. Her committee could usefully ask how these investigations can be accelerated, and demand answers from the FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey. It is hard to believe US regulators would take so long. Melrose places its bets The Melrose crew will count that as a decent result. Two and a half hours of probing by MPs of their \u00a37bn bid for GKN produced few horrors. Melrose chief executive Simon Peckham even got to air his cheeky line that \u201cwe have a longer-term strategy than GKN has right now\u201d. That\u2019s fair in the sense that GKN is flapping wildly and may do a deal to sell or combine its automotive division with US group Dana. Yet Melrose always tries to flog the companies it buys within three to five years \u2013 it is hardly in a position to offer sermons on long-termism. In one area, though, the MPs made the task for Melrose slightly tougher. They rowed in behind the Pensions Regulator in pushing for pension arrangements at GKN to be cleared before any takeover. That demand is reasonable for two reasons. First, Melrose would run GKN with substantially more borrowings. Second, Melrose\u2019s excellent record in dealing with pension deficits elsewhere (no quibble on that point) is interesting but not strictly relevant; it\u2019s the new arrangements themselves that matter. So far, Melrose has offered to inject \u00a3150m into the GKN schemes. That\u2019s a start but probably isn\u2019t its best offer \u2013 and it\u2019s not a commitment to get a green light from the regulator. Why the hesitation? Possibly because Melrose would prefer to win over GKN\u2019s trustees before approaching the regulator. If so, the approach would be logical. But a deal with the trustees would have to be agreed soon since the last chance for Melrose to improve its offer for GKN itself is the week after next, and it would be better if the pensions issue was clearer by then. That pressure of time works to the trustees\u2019 advantage. This is their moment of maximum negotiating leverage. In their shoes, you\u2019d be pushing for an upfront sum greater \u2013 in fact, much greater \u2013 than \u00a3150m. Hard times on Oxford Street Oxford Street is London and Europe\u2019s premier shopping street, or so the marketing blurb usually runs, but here\u2019s a sign of the times: Debenhams is in talks to rent out excess space in its flagship store to a provider of temporary office space. This comes after news that part of the old BHS store off Oxford Street will be turned into a crazy golf centre. The rise of online shopping is hurting traditional stores everywhere. Even so, it\u2019s remarkable that, having done gyms, cafes and restaurants, retailers such as Debenhams are already turning to flexible office firms. Landlords, whistling cheerfully, tell us that retail rents are holding up. Really? For how much longer?",

That investigation was first announced in 2013 but was delayed while the FCA did its enforcement thing.</p> \n<p>Investigatory wheels, it\u2019s probably true, must turn in the correct order. But why can\u2019t they turn more quickly? Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, clearly shares the frustration. Her committee could usefully ask how these investigations can be accelerated, and demand answers from the FCA chief executive, Andrew Bailey. It is hard to believe US regulators would take so long.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Melrose places its bets</h2> \n<p>The Melrose crew will count that as a decent result. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/06/melrose-takeover-gkn-mps-greg-clark\">Two and a half hours of probing by MPs</a> of their \u00a37bn bid for GKN produced few horrors. Melrose chief executive Simon Peckham even got to air his cheeky line that \u201cwe have a longer-term strategy than GKN has right now\u201d.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s fair in the sense that GKN is flapping wildly and may do a deal to sell or combine its automotive division with US group Dana. Yet Melrose always tries to flog the companies it buys within three to five years \u2013 it is hardly in a position to offer sermons on long-termism.</p> \n<p>In one area, though, the MPs made the task for Melrose slightly tougher. They rowed in behind the Pensions Regulator in pushing for pension arrangements at GKN to be cleared before any takeover. That demand is reasonable for two reasons. First, Melrose would run GKN with substantially more borrowings. Second, Melrose\u2019s excellent record in dealing with pension deficits elsewhere (no quibble on that point) is interesting but not strictly relevant; it\u2019s the new arrangements themselves that matter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"18dfc61e-83b7-42d2-a310-205549f08e0c\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>GKN is a global engineering business based in Redditch, Worcestershire. It employs nearly 60,000 people across 30 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Once known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, the firm can trace its origins back to 1759 and the birth of the Industrial Revolution in Britain.</p>\n    <p>Split into three key divisions - GKN Aerospace, GKN Driveline and GKN Powder Metallurgy \u2013 the multinational designs, &nbsp;manufactures and services systems and components for most of the world\u2019s leading aircraft, vehicle and machinery makers.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In 2017 it recorded pre-tax profits of \u00a3572m.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So far, Melrose has offered to inject \u00a3150m into the GKN schemes. That\u2019s a start but probably isn\u2019t its best offer \u2013 and it\u2019s not a commitment to get a green light from the regulator. Why the hesitation? Possibly because Melrose would prefer to win over GKN\u2019s trustees before approaching the regulator.</p> \n<p>If so, the approach would be logical. But a deal with the trustees would have to be agreed soon since the last chance for Melrose to improve its offer for GKN itself is the week after next, and it would be better if the pensions issue was clearer by then. That pressure of time works to the trustees\u2019 advantage. This is their moment of maximum negotiating leverage. In their shoes, you\u2019d be pushing for an upfront sum greater \u2013 in fact, much greater \u2013 than \u00a3150m.</p> \n<h2>Hard times on Oxford Street</h2> \n<p>Oxford Street is London and Europe\u2019s premier shopping street, or so the marketing blurb usually runs, but here\u2019s a sign of the times: Debenhams is in talks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/06/debenhams-to-rent-flagship-store-space-to-hot-deskers\">rent out excess space</a> in its flagship store to a provider of temporary office space.

      "bodyText": "Car manufacturers have stepped up warnings about the impact of Brexit on one of the UK\u2019s key industries, led by suggestions from the owner of Vauxhall that the future of its Astra plant was in doubt. Jaguar Land Rover also said it could not plan to make electric cars in Britain until the terms of its departure from the EU were clear, as a series of industry executives called for clarity. Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Vauxhall owner PSA Peugeot Citroen, described the uncertainty as \u201ca big concern\u201d for the French carmaker. PSA has already announced it will axe about 650 jobs at its Ellesmere Port factory, where the Vauxhall Astra is made. It is one of two Vauxhall plants in the UK. Speaking at the Geneva motor show, Tavares told the BBC: \u201cWe cannot invest in a world of uncertainty. \u201cNo one is going to make huge investments without knowing what will be the final competitiveness of the Brexit outcome.\u201d Tavares said it was \u201ca problem for the whole UK automotive industry\u201d. The Ellesmere Port plant has been assured by PSA that production of the Astra would continue until 2021 \u2013 although Tavares also said the company was not planning redundancies when it bought Vauxhall-Opel from General Motors in 2017. Tavares said a decision on whether the UK plant could be given more work would have to be made very soon. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, said Brexit uncertainty \u201cshould not be used by Mr Tavares to raise the fear of closure of Ellesmere Port\u201d. He added: \u201cThe UK market is vitally important to Peugeot and if he wants to protect that market share he should openly commit to new models in both Ellesmere Port and Luton.\u201d Jaguar Land Rover said it would need more information on post-Brexit tariffs and trade before it could plan to make electric cars in Britain. Ralf Speth, chief executive of JLR, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, told Reuters a \u201ccritical decision\u201d on investment was being held up because of the spectre of customs checks and delays. JLR has started building a new electric model, the I-Pace, in Austria. The Brexit outcome \u201cmakes the decision this year very, very critical and I don\u2019t know whether we can make it\u201d, Speth said. He added: \u201cUncertainty is really challenging us very much and not only us, it\u2019s for the complete industry. You hardly see inward investment any more.\u201d Another major manufacturer, Ford, called for the UK to remain in a customs union after Brexit. Steven Armstrong, Ford\u2019s European president, said: \u201cAny sort of border restrictions or customs friction is going to be an inhibitor to us continuing to transact business as we have done for the last 40 years. \u201cSo we are looking forward to hopefully some sort of customs union, or at least tariff-free trade between the UK and EU.\u201d Armstrong said Ford would continue to trade in the UK \u201cas long as it remains competitive for us to do business\u201d. Aston Martin said its business plans were on hold pending Brexit talks, telling Reuters that a possible IPO would be delayed for at least another year, should no deal be reached on a transition period at the EU leaders\u2019 summit in late March. Industry concerns over tariffs and trade were underlined by a recent report by the Commons business committee, warning that failing to strike a Brexit deal would put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk as trade barriers would leave UK manufacturers unable to compete with European rivals. However, Nissan, BMW and Toyota have decided since the 2016 referendum to produce new models at existing UK plants.",

      "bodyText": "Is Australia\u2019s economy diverse enough? Dr Andrew Leigh, the shadow assistant treasurer, believes policymakers need to think deeply about the economy\u2019s level of complexity. In a speech to the Insurance Council of Australia, Leigh will warn on Wednesday that despite the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, the complexity of the products Australia exports has become \u201csimpler\u201d in recent decades when compared with products exported by other advanced economies. He will say economic complexity is a good predictor of a country\u2019s level of income and future economic growth, and Australia is now ranking \u201cbadly\u201d compared with its peers. He will also say if the Turnbull government doesn\u2019t secure an exemption for Australia from Donald Trump\u2019s proposed new steel and aluminium tariffs, it will make Australia a less complex economy, too. \u201cWe need to encourage a wider variety of export industries.\u201d Leigh will say the economic principle of comparative advantage tells us the world can become richer when countries specialise in what they produce best, before then engaging in global trade. But too much specialisation can create excess risk, he says. \u201cIf your national prosperity strategy relies on exporting sugar, you\u2019re going to be at risk when diet soft drinks take over.\u201d Leigh will say a useful way of thinking about a country\u2019s degree of specialisation is the Harvard Atlas of Complexity, which was developed a decade ago by a team led by Ricardo Hausmann. The atlas starts with the idea that some products are more complex than others. To make medical imaging devices or jet engines takes plenty of knowledge and extensive networks of people. To make wood logs or coffee beans requires less knowledge and smaller networks. It shows the world\u2019s most complex economies are Japan, Switzerland and Germany, and the three least complex economies are Cameroon, Guinea and Nigeria. How does Australia fare on the Economic Complexity Index? In a word, badly. \u201cOut of 122 economies that the experts have assessed, we come 65th , just below halfway,\u201d Leigh will say. \u201cFor a nation that consistently ranks among the top 20 for our income per person, this is an astonishingly poor performance.\u201d Leigh will say it isn\u2019t just that Australia exports relatively few products; it\u2019s that the products we export tend to be exported by undiversified countries. And Australia\u2019s lack of complexity is not simply a response to the mining boom \u2013 it turns out that even before the boom, our exports weren\u2019t particularly complex. \u201cOver the longer run, Hausmann and his colleagues estimate that Australia\u2019s economic complexity ranking stayed pretty constant from the mid-1960s to the late-1970s, then fell markedly over the past generation,\u201d Leigh will say. \u201cOn their measures, we have never been an especially complex economy. But we\u2019ve gotten a lot \u2018simpler\u2019 in recent years.\u201d Leigh admits there are limitations to the atlas methodology. He will say services exports are excluded, which means higher education, tourism, financial services and legal services exports are not counted. And the Hausmann approach looks only at trade, so a nation could in theory have a complex and diversified domestic market, but sell only simple products to the rest of the world. \u201cBut just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of any growth theory is how it predicts growth,\u201d he will say. \u201cAnd anyone who wants to airily dismiss the Atlas of Complexity needs to explain the fact that it has a pretty good track record of forecasting past economic growth across nations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A proposed \u00a37bn hostile takeover of the UK engineering company GKN by the turnaround specialist Melrose poses a threat to Britain\u2019s national security and must be stopped by the government, MPs have been told. Union leaders said Melrose\u2019s strategy of buying companies and holding on to them for just three to five years was incompatible with GKN, which supplies parts and technology to the UK and US defence industries and develops products over periods spanning more than a decade. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary for aerospace at Unite, described Melrose as \u201casset strippers\u201d, adding that the business secretary, Greg Clark, should \u201cabsolutely\u201d use his powers to call in the deal. \u201cThere are very clear national security implications for this we believe and it\u2019s not just about what GKN are involved in now, it\u2019s also about our future defence capabilities moving forward.\u201d GKN\u2019s work is focused on the automotive, metallurgy and aerospace industries and it is involved in sensitive programmes including technology for the US defence company Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35B fighter jet, 138 of which have been ordered for the Royal Air Force. Turner said the lifespan of some products could be up to 50 years, from initial development, through manufacturing and then in service. However, addressing the same House of Commons committee in an earlier session, Melrose executives insisted they would grow and improve GKN. They said the business had lost its way under current management. In a sometimes tetchy exchange, Melrose bosses insisted they would not sell off parts of the business to China, Russia, or other countries deemed a threat to national security. \u201cWe\u2019re British citizens too,\u201d said Simon Peckham, co-founder and chief executive. \u201cI live in this country. My family lives in this country. We are not going to sell GKN military protected assets to anyone who is not an appropriate buyer of it. We would never do it, even if we were free to.\u201d Peckham confirmed that Melrose would sack the GKN board if its takeover bid was successful, leaving the business to be run by the management teams of the different divisions. Earlier, a group of 16 cross-party MPs wrote to the business secretary, urging him to block the proposed takeover. Before the session the 16 MPs asked Clark to intervene to prevent a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial company from being \u201cdismembered\u201d, relating to concerns that Melrose would break the 259-year-old company into pieces before selling it off. \u201cA takeover of GKN by Melrose is highly likely to mean the break-up of GKN, and the selling on \u2013 and possible disappearance \u2013 of several of its constituent important components including its aerospace, driveline, powder metallurgy and additive divisions,\u201d the MPs wrote, according to the Financial Times. The company employs about 58,000 people, with 6,000 in the UK. The Pensions Regulator warned separately that the potential deal was likely to have a \u201cdetrimental impact\u201d on the company\u2019s ability to fund its pension scheme. In a letter published by the House of Commons work and pensions committee, the regulator wrote: \u201cFrom the outset we have been concerned that the increased leverage involved in the proposed takeover by Melrose is likely to have a detrimental impact on covenant.\u201d Melrose said it had a strong track record on pensions and would put money into the GKN scheme. During the course of the hearing, Melrose\u2019s three senior executives revealed they had each earned about \u00a340m so far in the financial year to the end of March, with the package boosted by the end of a five-year incentive plan which paid out in shares. After the committee session, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, highlighted the profits the \u201cbig bosses of Melrose could receive \u2026 if this takeover goes ahead\u201d. She added: \u201cManagement has failed to give any clear assurances or definite commitments on the future of GKN. The government must intervene and investigate this matter urgently.\u201d Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: \u201cFor shareholders, workers and pension holders, Melrose should do more than point to its track record with smaller acquisitions. \u201cMelrose should set out their plans for applying for clearance from the Pensions Regulator and the areas in which they would be willing to consider making formal post-offer undertakings regarding their future plans for the business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BrewDog\u2019s launch of a pink \u201cbeer for girls\u201d, ostensibly to raise awareness about gender pay inequality and sexist advertising, has come in for criticism as a cynical marketing stunt. The independent craft brewer has launched a \u201cnew\u201d Pink IPA \u2013 in reality a repackaging of its flagship Punk IPA \u2013 with a pledge to sell it a fifth cheaper in its bars to \u201cthose who identify as women\u201d. The discount is aimed to reflect the 18.1% average gender pay gap between men and women in the UK. \u201cThe fact that the gender pay gap is still an issue in 2018 shows that a lot of lip service is being paid, but not enough action is being taken to tackle inequality,\u201d said the BrewDog global head of marketing, Sarah Warman. \u201cWith Pink IPA, we are making a statement the only way we know how \u2013 with beer. The love of beer is not gendered. Beer is universal. Beer is for everyone.\u201d BrewDog has disclosed a 2.8% median gender pay gap in favour of men across its global business, which employs 1,000 people. It is yet to file its official figure for the UK, where most staff are employed. The Aberdeenshire-based company says it will donate 20% of sales of bottles of its \u201cbeer for girls\u201d and Punk IPA to causes that fight against gender inequality. The blue-branded Punk IPA will be sold at the regular price, a discrepancy the brewer says it hopes will \u201ctrigger questions about why women continue to earn less than their male counterparts\u201d. Sara Barton the director of Brewster\u2019s Brewing Company and instigator of Project Venus, a network of female brewers, says BrewDog\u2019s goals are laudable but consumers may not understand its approach to such sensitive subjects. \u201cBrewDog is trying to be clever, sarcastic and ironic but I think it may be viewed as a patronising beer from one of the big boys,\u201d she said. \u201cI applaud the thought \u2013 it is an issue that needs highlighting in brewing and beyond \u2013 but it may be too subtle for people to understand, over their heads and therefore patronising.\u201d Paul Domenet, an executive at design firm Dew Gibbons whose female-focused clients include Aussie, Coty and Baby Dove, said: \u201cHowever much they clothe it in a good cause it might be more to do with wanting more of a share of the lucrative female drinkers\u2019 market.\u201d BrewDog says the \u201clurid pink\u201d packaging and stereotyped Pink IPA brand name are meant to be a \u201csend-up of the lazy marketing efforts targeting the female market\u201d. \u201cThere is a long history of products that pander and patronise through harmful, sexist stereotypes and vulgar imagery, and we\u2019re rallying to put an end to this nonsense,\u201d said Warman. A beer industry blogger, The Crafty Beeress, questioned whether BrewDog\u2019s tongue-in-cheek approach to such serious issues was appropriate. \u201cIf you have to explain the joke then it\u2019s probably not a very good joke,\u201d she tweeted. Jo Stevens, the Labour MP for Cardiff Central, also questioned the brewer\u2019s tactics. \u201cI\u2019m a huge @Brewdog fan but oh dear me....,\u201d she tweeted. Proceeds from the four weeks of sales in the UK will go to the Women\u2019s Engineering Society, a charity and a professional network of women engineers, scientists and technologists. Pink IPA will also be sold in South Korea, Ireland, Germany, the US and the Netherlands.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has been accused of \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d with plans to increase basic pay for shop-floor staff but axe paid breaks, premium pay for Sundays and an annual bonus. The deal, which the Unite union is recommending its members reject, will result in some staff taking a pay cut. The supermarket group said most staff would receive about an 8% rise in annual pay, after accounting for the removal of a half-hour paid break every eight-hour shift and a 15-minute paid break for seven-hour shifts. Staff will continue to be entitled to take breaks but will not be paid for that time. The 8% increase does not take into account the removal of the performance-related bonus from non-management staff, which can amount to hundreds of pounds. Longer-serving staff who receive time and a half for working on Sundays may see their pay fall. But the supermarket said those affected would receive top-up payments to ensure no one was paid less for the next 18 months. Sainsbury\u2019s said it was spending \u00a3100m on improving pay and the vast majority of staff would see more in their pocket. It said the latest pay rise to \u00a39.20 an hour, or \u00a39.80 in London, came after three years of 4% pay increases. The \u00a39.20 basic rate of pay is above the government\u2019s legal minimum of \u00a37.50 for over-25s and \u00a37.05 for 21- to 24-year-olds. It is also more than the independently calculated living wage of \u00a38.75 an hour paid by rival Lidl and the \u00a38.85 paid by Aldi. Sainsbury\u2019s new London rate of \u00a39.80 an hour is lower than the independently calculated London living wage of \u00a310.20, which is also Aldi\u2019s minimum rate for the capital. Simon Roberts, the Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, said: \u201cThe retail sector has never been more competitive and we know that our customers really value our colleagues and the excellent service they provide in our shops. \u201cWhich is why we think it is so important to invest further in our colleagues so they feel rewarded and motivated to do the best possible job for our customers every day.\u201d The company said all 130,000 store staff would be put on new contracts \u201censuring consistency and fairness across all stores, regardless of age or length of service\u201d. Unite, which has 12,000 members working at the supermarket, welcomed the \u00a39.20 basic rate of pay as a positive move. But the acting national officer for food and drink, Bev Clarkson, said: \u201cWe are in a classic \u2018robbing Peter to pay Paul\u2019 situation, which we don\u2019t think will benefit our members in the long run. \u201cThere will be no further increase in salary until 2020 and given what our members have been asked to give up in return for this headline rate, the overall package doesn\u2019t look that attractive. We are recommending rejection and will decide on the next steps after our members have expressed their views in the consultative ballot, which should be known by the end of April.\u201d The move comes as Sainsbury\u2019s struggles to compete in a fast-changing grocery market. The retailer was the worst-performing of the four biggest grocers in the three months to 25 February, according to market share data from Kantar Worldpanel. Its sales rose by just 1.1%, compared with 2.7% growth at Tesco and Morrisons, and 2.3% at Asda. Joanne McGuinness, the national officer for Usdaw, the shop workers\u2019 union, said it too would be looking closely at the deal: \u201c We want to check the effects on all individual workers.

The structure of the board was later criticised by the Treasury select committee as \u201can accident waiting to happen\u201d. Four months after news of the black hole, secret footage of Flowers emerged that led to him pleading guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and acquiring the nickname \u201cthe Crystal Methodist\u201d. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had only investigated Flowers\u2019 use of company technology and his drug convictions, and not his role in the near-collapse of the bank. However, the Treasury immediately announced that it has launched a new independent review into supervision of the Co-operative Bank between 2008 and 2013. In its ruling on Tuesday, the FCA said that Flowers\u2019 conduct demonstrated a \u201clack of fitness and propriety\u201d required to work in financial services. Mark Steward, its executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: \u201cThe role of chair occupies a unique place of trust and influence. The chair is pivotal in setting expectations of a company\u2019s culture, values and behaviours. \u201cMr Flowers failed in his duty to lead by example and to meet the high standards of integrity and probity demanded by the role. These high standards are what the financial services industry and the wider community rightly expect of its senior individuals.\u201d The FCA found that Flowers demonstrated an \u201cunwillingness to comply\u201d with its and other legal, regulatory and professional requirements and standards, as its investigation found that he had used his work mobile phone to make \u201ca number of inappropriate calls to a premium-rate chat line\u201d, in breach of Co-operative Group and Co-op bank policies. In addition, he used his work email account to send and receive \u201csexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages, and to discuss illegal drugs\u201d, the FCA added, despite having been warned about his earlier misconduct. Following the scandal, Flowers was also removed from the list of Methodist Church ministers, stripped of the title reverend and the power to lead services for \u201cseriously impairing the mission, witness or integrity of the church\u201d. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said she had written to Andrew Bailey, head of the FCA, last week to ask why an investigation into the Co-op bank had still to begin.",

Its shares fell by 12%, making it the biggest early faller in the FTSE 100, after the company posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a376m for last year. The loss came on the back of a \u00a3180m charge in Australia, where it faces intense competition in Sydney and Melbourne. Investors also reacted to the news that Just Eat is planning to make major investments in delivery services in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Just Eat has traditionally collected orders on behalf of independent restaurants, which deliver the food themselves. However, the new chief executive, Peter Plumb, said that delivering on behalf of branded restaurant chains \u2013 such as KFC and Burger King \u2013 represented an \u00a318bn market opportunity and was a \u201csignificant new driver of long-term growth\u201d. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said investors were nervous about the shift in strategy. \u201cThere are doubts whether this will deliver for investors and there is a risk of becoming embroiled in a low-margin street fight with the likes of Amazon, Uber Eats and Deliveroo,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a risk of management taking the eye off the ball by focusing on delivery instead of making the most of its status as the go-to platform and primary distribution channel for restaurants.\u201d Just Eat\u2019s revenues jumped by 45% to to \u00a3546m in 2017, and highlights included a record December when the company processed 10m orders. On the day of the final of ITV\u2019s The X Factor, sponsored by Just Eat, it took more than 500,000 orders, breaking its previous daily records. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said news of the investment overshadowed the results. \u201cMr Plumb has a big job to do today to convince the market that this investment will deliver returns strong enough to justify derailing Just Eat\u2019s earnings growth in the near term,\u201d he said. \u201cExpected returns on capital have yet to be spelled out, likewise the expected payback timeframe for the investment.

      "bodyText": "Retailers suffered tough trading in February after a squeeze on household incomes forced consumers to spend more money on food and essential items. The British Retail Consortium, the lobby group for high street shops, said more of consumers\u2019 monthly salaries were being swallowed up by higher prices for food, leaving little cash leftover to spend on other items. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said consumers wanted to spend but \u201cthey just don\u2019t have the resources to do so\u201d. The consumer spending squeeze has pushed several well-known high street names into financial trouble, with Toys R Us and Maplin the latest casualties to go into administration last week, while Mothercare joined the growing list of chains planning to close stores. Overall, like-for-like retail sales rose by 0.6% from February 2017, mostly on food, which grew by 2.8% on the previous year. Cheap credit and an extension of post-Christmas discounting lifted furniture sales from a slump in January, but the recovery was too small to prevent a decline of 1.1% in non-food sales. Dickinson said: \u201cThe headwinds to retail spending continued to blow strong in February. Inflation is still eating into shoppers\u2019 budgets, pushing them to spend a greater share of their income on essentials and leaving less left over to buy discretionary, predominantly non-food, retail items. \u201cAt the same time, weak growth in household earnings is keeping overall sales low,\u201d she added. Monthly figures for the services sector from IHS Markit, excluding retail, showed that firms were expecting the consumer squeeze to end soon as the higher valued pound brought an end to high rates of inflation. Analysts said a strong showing by the financial services sector was behind a recovery in the IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers index for the services sector from a 16-month low in January of 53 to a four-month high of 54.5 in February, where a figure above 50 indicates expansion. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said consumers remained under pressure after a year-long inflationary squeeze on their incomes, but the Bank of England was still likely to raise interest rates in May. He said: \u201cThe BoE seems keen to normalise interest rates even if output growth is below levels it would normally like to see when tightening policy. With policymakers sounding hawkish even following the January fall in the PMI to a one-and-a-half-year low, the February upturn surely leaves a May rate hike very much in play.\u201d Elizabeth Martins, UK economist at HSBC, said earlier surveys showing the construction sector bouncing back from recession and the manufacturing sector expanding were consistent with real GDP growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018. \u201cThis is also consistent with the 1.5% annual growth the BoE say is the UK\u2019s speed limit. So, the monetary policy committee do not need to see an acceleration from current growth rates to justify a rate rise in May.\u201d She said it was possible the snow and freezing weather last week would dent growth in the first quarter, but the underlying picture would remain the same.",

With policymakers sounding hawkish even following the January fall in the PMI to a one-and-a-half-year low, the February upturn surely leaves a May rate hike very much in play.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elizabeth Martins, UK economist at HSBC, said earlier surveys showing the construction sector bouncing back from recession and the manufacturing sector expanding were consistent with real GDP growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is also consistent with the 1.5% annual growth the BoE say is the UK\u2019s speed limit. So, the monetary policy committee do not need to see an acceleration from current growth rates to justify a rate rise in May.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p>She said it was possible the snow and freezing weather last week would dent growth in the first quarter, but the underlying picture would remain the same.</p>",
