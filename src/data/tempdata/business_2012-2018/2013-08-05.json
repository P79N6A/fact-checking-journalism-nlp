The more transparent stance by the Bank is in response to criticism that it has failed to create the foundations for long-lasting growth following the 2008 banking crash. George Osborne asked Carney to review the Bank's remit, which is to maintain inflation at 2%, and consider whether broader criteria would allow the monetary policy committee (MPC) to take a more activist stance when setting rates.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "McDonald's has emerged as potentially the biggest zero-hours employer in the private sector after admitting that it employs 90% of its entire workforce in Britain, or 82,800 staff, on the controversial terms. Politicians said the UK's largest food chain should offer staff minimum guaranteed hours, while also suggesting that the latest revelation increases the pressure on the business secretary, Vince Cable, to ensure that an ongoing review of the contracts is far-reaching. Zero-hours contracts have been criticised because they offer no guarantee of regular work and no stability of income. However, the Institute of Directors, which represents 38,000 directors including several bosses of FTSE 100 companies, attacked calls for a ban, claiming the UK could be in the same situation as Italy or Spain without a flexible labour market. Andy Sawford, a Labour MP who has campaigned to abolish zero-hours contracts, said: \"McDonald's could lead on addressing this issue. There will be some employees working 20 to 30 hours a week, week in week out, and it is indefensible not to put those people on contracts. In the ordering of their food they know how to identify customer levels so they cook the right amount, so they could use that same information with staff levels and give employees more certainty.\" McDonald's employs 92,000 staff throughout the UK, running 1,200 restaurants. A spokeswoman said prospective employees are asked during the application process to say which days they can work. She added: \"Many of our employees are parents or students who are looking to fit flexible, paid work around childcare, study and other commitments. \"Employee hours are scheduled in advance and we never ask people to be 'on call'. \"The zero-hours contracts which all our hourly-paid employees are on do not affect employee benefit entitlement and all of our employees are entitled to a range of benefits including life assurance, employee discounts and access to a range of training and qualifications.\" She said McDonald's has employed zero-hours contract workers since it entered the UK in 1974. It has also emerged that a rival fast food franchise, Subway, employs hundreds of staff on zero-hours contracts. The Guardian has seen a contract for staff at one of the largest Subway franchisees, Made To Order, which runs more than 100 Subways in Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The contract states: \"The company has no duty to provide you with work. Your hours of work are not predetermined and will be notified to you on a weekly basis as soon as is reasonably practicable in advance by your store manager. The company has the right to require you to work varied or extended hours from time to time.\" It adds that by signing the contract all non-management staff \u2013 or \"sandwich artists\" \u2013 waive their right under working time regulations to work no more than 48 hours a week. Subway said in a statement: \"All Subway stores are independently owned and operated by franchisees. As part of their agreement, franchisees are responsible for all employment matters. Franchisees are required to comply with employment law when recruiting, contracting and in all dealings with employees.\" By comparison, sandwich chain Pret A Manger said it does not use zero-hours contracts and that all staff are on a minimum of eight guaranteed hours a week. The latest revelation has led MPs to call for a broader investigation by the government into the issue since the Guardian first disclosed that retailer Sports Direct employs 90% of its 23,000 staff zero-hours contracts. Alison McGovern, another Labour MP who has campaigned against the contracts, saidthat the issue is clearly more widespread than first thought. She said: \"Every day that goes by and we find out more about how widespread the practice is, the more concern there is and the more there needs to be action. We can't ignore this issue any longer because the calls for change are getting louder and louder. Saying it's fine and we don't need to do anything does not address the issue.\" The IoD criticised calls for a change to the rules and said banning the contracts would have extremely damaging results for businesses and employees. It said the flexibility was vital to a strong economy. Alexander Ehmann, head of regulatory policy at the IoD, said: \"Calls to ban zero-hours contracts are deeply misguided and any such action would have extremely damaging results. It would hurt thousands of employees who rely on the flexibility such contracts allow and employers, especially small and medium-sized firms, would struggle to hire the staff they need to meet varying demand. \"Countries with a flexible labour market tend to have lower unemployment and higher employment, and one of the reasons that the UK economy has not gone the way of southern Europe is because employers have been able to adapt swiftly to changing demand.\" The IoD employs around 200 staff at its London head office on Pall Mall, with 16 catering and bar staff on zero-hours contracts. 'Staff numbers' Companies and their staff numbers on zero-hours contracts: McDonald's 82,800 JD Wetherspoon 24,000 Sports Direct 20,000 Spirit Group 16,000 Boots 4,000 Cineworld All part-time employees Subway All non-management staff in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, at least Tate Catering All part-time employees Buckingham Palace 350 summer workers",

      "bodyText": "Britain's services sector has fuelled hopes that a sustained economic recovery is under way by posting its best monthly figures since before the financial crisis. The purchasing managers index, published by Markit, jumped to 60.2 in July from 56.9 in June, far above the 50 level that signals a rise in activity. It was the highest reading since December 2006, when Britain was booming - but less than a year before the run on Northern Rock signalled the arrival of the credit crunch. The news was greeted by the chancellor, George Osborne, as a further sign of rising business and consumer confidence after surveys last week revealed a bounce-back in manufacturing and construction output. The reading for the crucial sector, which makes up 75% of Britain's economy, sharply beat forecasts of just over 57. The recent good weather and pick-up in the housing market were drivers of growth for services, according to the Markit/CIPS survey, and demand was stronger both at home and overseas. Paul Smith, senior economist at Markit, said there seemed to be genuine momentum in the sector. Services were also boosted by rising confidence amid stronger market conditions in recent months, which drove new business to the highest levels since November 2006. However, industry groups have warned that the recovery remains fragile as long as consumer demand is largely based on increases in debt and lower savings rates. Fears that major trading partners such as China and the eurozone may suffer a slowdown in growth have also made firms reticent to invest and increase production. The outlook portrayed by the Markit/CIPS survey, which excludes data from retailers, was also supported by strong July data from the retail sector. A separate report by the British Retail Consortium and KPMG showed total retail sales jumped 3.9% last month, the biggest July rise since 2006, driven by sales of summer clothing and barbecue foods, and price discounting. Like-for-like sales, which take account of stores open for more than a year, were up 2.2%. \"July was a golden month for retail sales and marks a return to form for British retailers. Hopefully this uptick in sales is another indication that the UK economy has turned the corner towards growth. Murraymania, summer sun and the arrival of the royal baby gave consumers that much-needed feelgood factor, encouraging them to leave caution behind and help retailers put in a champion performance,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG. While service providers and retailers were helped by the warm weather, economists said there was a pattern emerging that suggested a broader recovery was becoming entrenched. The economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, building on 0.3% growth in the first. \"While some temporary factors may have played a role in boosting activity, a turnaround in the economy's fortunes seems to be in train,\" said Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics. There was good news from the eurozone, too, where the battered private sector posted a rise in activity for the first time since January 2012. Markit said its PMI survey of the region hit 50.5 in July. The Bank of England will give its latest verdict on the UK economy when it publishes its August Inflation Report on Wednesday. Speaking after the services PMI was published, Osborne said it was a further sign the economy was moving to a recovery phase, but that more \"difficult decisions\" would be needed.",

    "webTitle": "US energy regulator threatens BP with $28m fine over irregular gas trades", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is threatening energy giant BP with a $28m fine over alleged irregular trades in natural gas, just a week after it reached a $410m settlement with JP Morgan. In a sign that the agency is stepping up its action against powerful trading firms it suspects of manipulation, the FERC required BP on Monday to respond to allegations that it first made back in 2011, about trades made by BP's south-east gas trading desk in 2008. FERC alleges that BP tried to increase the value of its gas contracts by manipulating the price of physical gas through false trades. FERC is also looking to claim $800,000 in BP's profits from the scheme. BP heatedly denied the allegations, calling them \"without merit\". Geoff Merrell, BP's head of communications, said in a statement: \"BP is disappointed that the FERC has brought this action and we will vigorously defend against these allegations. The FERC bases its allegations on a recorded two-minute phone conversation between a BP trainee and BP natural gas trader that the regulator has taken completely out of context.\" BP says that the trainee misunderstood a trade and was corrected by a senior trader, who reported the conversation to BP's compliance staff. The tussle with BP is the latest in a series of aggressive FERC fines or settlements with energy traders, which have included Constellation Energy, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and JP Morgan. The FERC has levied closed to $1.3bn in fines and penalties on Wall Street firms since 2005 \u2013 although it has sometimes met challenges in court, and the trading firms frequently fight its charges. In its most recent cases, JP Morgan did not admit wrongdoing in its settlement, and Barclays said it will go to court to fight a proposed $470m fine from FERC. FERC's progress has been contrasted with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which says it is perpetually underfunded, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which may get a new chief less familiar with Wall Street's ways. \"By historical standards and compared to other regulatory agencies, FERC is being very aggressive,\" said Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston and director of the Global Energy Management Institute. FERC's goal is to create a \"culture of compliance,\" according to a former official. \"FERC feels like its job is to prevent another Enron,\" said Sheila Slocum Hollis, a former director of enforcement for FERC who heads the Washington office at law firm Duane Morris. She noted that FERC has \"gone after big fish, and they are big fish doing big things\". JP Morgan cited regulation as one factor last week when it said it is examining ways to sell or spin off parts of its $14bn energy trading businesses, which include everything from power plants to warehouses. Several other firms have privately spoken of doing the the same, according to people familiar with the matter. \"These FERC fines really hurt,\" Hollis said. \"They hurt financially and they hurt reputationally.\" To that end, Hollis said, the regulator has taken a renewed zeal for policing energy trading, using methods for criminal prosecution and a staff bolstered by former US attorneys. They use recordings of phone conversations \u2013 as in the BP case \u2013 as well as the prosecutorial technique of assessing penalties based on how cooperative the firms are with the agency. In several of its dealings, including with JP Morgan, FERC has openly and publicly chided firms it believed were hiding information or being less than forthright, and used that as a basis to increase their fines. Norman Bay, the agency's director, is a Harvard-trained lawyer and a former US attorney in Mexico. Slocum said FERC's renewed zeal was based on a number of factors, including more congressional funding, a congressional mandate several years ago to levy fines as high as $1m a day \u2013 far above the previous $10,000 a day limit \u2013 and greater staffing and money for computer-based tracking of trades. \"With the computer capabilities, it can pick up manipulations that would have been missed before except by elbow grease,\" Hollis said. That aggressiveness has caused several Wall Street firms to consider getting out of the energy trading business to avoid tangling with FERC. Pirrong said that the FERC cases are not \"black and white\" and that the exit of trading firms from the energy business may create problems with liquidity, which is the Wall Street term for finding a buyer for every seller. For Hollis, the former FERC enforcement director, the surprise of the trading firms are growing pains. \"These organizations are not used to dealing with FERC,\" she said. \"They knew it existed, but they just didn't know the things it was doing.\"",

The FERC has levied closed to $1.3bn in fines and penalties on Wall Street firms since 2005 \u2013 although it has sometimes met challenges in court, and the trading firms frequently fight its charges. In its most recent cases, JP Morgan did not admit wrongdoing in its settlement, and <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/bp-ferc-idUKL1N0G60PM20130805\">Barclays said it will go to court</a> to fight a proposed $470m fine from FERC.</p> <p>FERC's progress has been contrasted with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which says it is perpetually underfunded, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which may get a new chief less familiar with Wall Street's ways.</p> <p>\"By historical standards and compared to other regulatory agencies, FERC is being very aggressive,\" said Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston and director of the Global Energy Management Institute.</p> <p>FERC's goal is to create a \"culture of compliance,\" according to a former official.</p> <p>\"FERC feels like its job is to prevent another Enron,\" said Sheila Slocum Hollis, a former director of enforcement for FERC who heads the Washington office at law firm Duane Morris.

    "webTitle": "Seabed mining could earn Cook Islands 'tens of billions of dollars'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Cook Islands hopes to transform itself into one of the world's richest countries within a decade by sending robots to the sea floor to collect minerals that it believes are worth tens of billions of dollars. Mark Brown, the Cook Islands' finance minister, said mining the minerals on the bottom of the South Pacific could increase gross domestic product a hundredfold. \"It has the potential to basically transform our economy hugely significantly with just the value of the resources sitting on the sea floor,\" he told the Guardian. Brown said there is such a supply of minerals at the bottom of the ocean surrounding the Cook Islands \u2013 an archipelago of 15 small islands between New Zealand and Hawaii \u2013 that it could transform the nation into one of the richest in the world in terms of per-capita income. The UN estimates that the per-capita income of the Cook Islands, which has a population of 14,000, is currently $12,200 (\u00a37,945). This compares with about $50,000 in the US and $40,000 in the UK. \"We still have a jump to make the move from developing nation status to a developed nation status,\" Brown said. \"The seabed mining industry provides that potential for us.\" But environmentalists warn mining could irreparably damage the country's beaches and marine ecosystem. The Cook Islands \u2013 named after Captain Cook, who visited the islands in 1773 and 1777 \u2013 were found to have a vast amount of underwater riches in the 1970s, but only recent advances in technology have made mining economically viable. A new geological survey by Imperial College marine geochemist David Cronan estimates that the Cook Islands' 2 million square kilometre exclusive economic zone contains 10bn tonnes of manganese nodules. The nodules, which vary from the size of a potato to that of a dining table, contain manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and rare earth minerals used in electronics. The minerals will be mined using robots first developed for underwater warfare and espionage. The technology has already been adapted for underwater oil and gas projects, but has yet to be used for large deep-sea mining projects. Brown said it would be about five years before mining starts. He said he is in talks with some of the world's biggest mining companies and other nations about licensing deals. \"We are here to meet the new players,\" Brown said at the world's first deep-sea mining conference in London last week. \"We have had a lot interest from some companies and countries, [but] we certainly won't be jumping into bed with the first person to come along.\" Talks are under way with the UK, China, Korea, Japan and Norway, and the first tenders are due to be granted before June 2014, he said. Papua New Guinea has already granted a deep-sea mining licence to Canadian mining firm Nautilus Minerals to extract gold and copper from the seabed, but large-scale mining has yet to start. The Cook Islands government acknowledges that the prospect of largely untested deep-sea mining in some of the world's most pristine tropical waters raises serious environmental concerns. \"The Cook Islands already has a very good industry in terms of tourism,\" said Paul Lynch, the islands' seabed minerals commissioner. \"The good, clean, green beaches are not something we want to harm just for the sake of mineral wealth. \"We have the only legislation in the world dedicated to deep water minerals,\" he added. He says the country has introduced legislation to protect the environment and turn half of the country's waters into a marine park. Greenpeace warns that deep-sea mining \"poses a major environmental threat to our oceans, which are already suffering from a number of pressures including overfishing, pollution, and the effects of climate change\". Natalie Lowrey, communications manager of Deep Sea Mining campaign said: \"Serious concerns have also been raised about the potential for heavy metals entering marine food chains with serious consequences for the health of coastal communities.\" Brown said the Cook Islands \u2013 which is self-governing in free association with New Zealand, and whose head of state is the Queen \u2013 would expect \"stakes in [mining] companies for free\" in return for their \"rights to exploit our resources\". He said the islands would maintain a significant stake in each stage of the mining process from exploration and extraction to refinement and sale. One of the first mining companies to be involved is likely to be UK Seabed Resources, a British subsidiary of US defence and engineering giant Lockheed Martin. Lockheed first collected nodules from the Cook Islands' seabeds in the 1970s. UK Seabed Resources has already been awarded a licence to explore 58,000 square kilometres of Pacific seabed outside of territorial waters. The licence, awarded in March, was granted by the International Seabed Authority, a UN-created body that controls oceans outside of national exclusive economic zones. David Cameron, who supported UK Seabed Resources' bid, said the seabed mining industry could be the worth \u00a340bn to the UK economy over the next 30 years. \"We are involved in a global race where we have to compete with the fast-growing economies of the south and east of the world,\" the prime minister said. \"We want to make sure we get every opportunity out of this.\" Brown said the potential income for the Cook Islands could be so vast that a sovereign wealth fund would be set up to manage the cash for future generations and provide a safety net if the islands are swamped by rising sea levels as a result of climate change. He is about to embark on a world tour to learn about their sovereign wealth funds. \"It's important to learn lessons of the past from other counties that have come into wealth,\" he said. \"To learn lessons from those that have squandered theirs. This is not a renewable resource, you exploit it once, you have the revenue from it once,\" he said. Squids in If mining doesn't work for the Cook Islands, there's always squid. The country is considering creating a new industry centred on fishing for giant squid, following the successful creation of a squid fishing industry on the Japanese island of Okinawa. \"We thought to ourselves, if we can find it here maybe we could do the same, something for our own local market,\" said William Sokimi, the fisheries development officer of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, which represents 22 Pacific island countries. A recent small-scale fishing trial caught four diamondback squids and a neon flying squid, the biggest one weighing in at 17kg. \"So far, it is looking very promising \u2026 we have now established that giant squid can be caught in the Cook Islands,\" Sokimi told Radio Australia. He admitted, however, that work needs to be done to convince the locals to eat squid. \"We've given out some recipe booklets with about 53 recipes,\" he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 August",

      "body": "<p>The Cook Islands hopes to transform itself into one of the world's richest countries within a decade by sending robots to the sea floor to collect minerals that it believes are worth tens of billions of dollars.</p> <p>Mark Brown, the Cook Islands' finance minister, said mining the minerals on the bottom of the South Pacific could increase gross domestic product a hundredfold. \"It&#xa0;has the potential to basically transform our economy hugely significantly with just the value of the resources sitting on the sea floor,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Brown said there is such a supply of minerals at the bottom of the ocean surrounding the Cook Islands \u2013 <a href=\"http://ngscollectors.ning.com/photo/cook-islands-flag/prev?context=user\" title=\"\">an archipelago of 15 small islands between New Zealand and Hawaii </a>\u2013 that it could transform the nation into one of the richest in the world in terms of per-capita income.</p> <p>The UN estimates that the per-capita income of the Cook Islands, which has a population of 14,000, is currently $12,200 (\u00a37,945). This compares with about $50,000 in the US and $40,000 in the UK. \"We still have a jump to make the move from developing nation status to a developed nation status,\" Brown said. \"The seabed mining industry provides that potential for us.\"</p> <p>But environmentalists warn mining could irreparably damage the country's beaches and marine ecosystem.</p> <p>The Cook Islands \u2013 named after Captain Cook, who visited the islands in 1773 and 1777 \u2013 were found to have a vast amount of underwater riches in the 1970s, but only recent advances in technology have made mining economically viable.</p> <p>A new geological survey by Imperial College marine geochemist David Cronan estimates that the Cook Islands' 2&#xa0;million square kilometre exclusive economic zone contains 10bn tonnes of manganese nodules. <a href=\"http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/docs/research_paper.pdf\" title=\"\">The nodules</a>, which vary from the size of a potato to that of a dining table, contain manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and rare earth minerals used in electronics. The minerals will be mined using robots first developed for underwater warfare and espionage. The technology has already been adapted for underwater oil and gas projects, but has yet to be used for large deep-sea mining projects.</p> <p>Brown said it would be about five years before mining starts. He said he is in talks with some of the world's biggest mining companies and other nations about licensing deals. \"We are here to meet the new players,\" Brown said at<a href=\"http://deepsea-mining-summit.com/index.html\" title=\"\"> the world's first deep-sea mining conference in London last week</a>. \"We have had a lot interest from some companies and countries, [but] we certainly won't be jumping into bed with the first person to come along.\"</p> <p>Talks are under way with the UK, China, Korea, Japan and Norway, and the first tenders are due to be granted before June 2014, he said.</p> <p>Papua New Guinea has already granted a deep-sea mining licence to Canadian mining firm Nautilus Minerals to extract gold and copper from the seabed, but large-scale mining has yet to start.</p> <p>The Cook Islands government acknowledges that the prospect of largely untested deep-sea mining in some of the world's most pristine tropical waters raises serious environmental concerns. \"The Cook Islands already has a very good industry in terms of tourism,\" said Paul Lynch, the islands' seabed minerals commissioner. \"The good, clean, green beaches are not something we want to harm just for the sake of mineral wealth.</p> <p>\"We have the only legislation in the world dedicated to deep water minerals,\" he added. He says the country has introduced legislation to protect the environment and turn half of the country's waters into a marine park.</p> <p>Greenpeace warns that deep-sea mining \"poses a major environmental threat to our oceans, which are already suffering from a number of pressures including overfishing, pollution, and the effects of climate change\". Natalie Lowrey, communications manager of Deep Sea Mining campaign said: \"Serious concerns have also been raised about the potential for heavy metals entering marine food chains with serious consequences for the health of coastal communities.\"</p> <p>Brown said the Cook Islands \u2013 which is self-governing in free association with New Zealand, and whose head of state is the Queen \u2013 would expect \"stakes in [mining] companies for free\" in return for their \"rights to exploit our resources\".</p> <p>He said the islands would maintain a significant stake in each stage of the mining process from exploration and extraction to refinement and sale.</p> <p>One of the first mining companies to be involved is likely to be UK Seabed Resources, a British subsidiary of US defence and engineering giant Lockheed Martin. Lockheed first collected nodules from the Cook Islands' seabeds in the 1970s. UK Seabed Resources has already been awarded a licence to explore 58,000 square kilometres of Pacific seabed outside of territorial waters. The licence, awarded in March, was granted by the International Seabed Authority, a UN-created body that controls oceans outside of national exclusive economic zones.</p> <p>David Cameron, who supported UK Seabed Resources' bid, said the seabed mining industry could be the worth \u00a340bn to the UK economy over the next 30 years. \"We are involved in a global race where we have to compete with the fast-growing economies of the south and east of the world,\" the prime minister said. \"We want to make sure we get every opportunity out of this.\"</p> <p>Brown said the potential income for the Cook Islands could be so vast that a sovereign wealth fund would be set up to manage the cash for future generations and provide a safety net if the islands are swamped by rising sea levels as a result of climate change.</p> <p>He is about to embark on a world tour to learn about their sovereign wealth funds. \"It's important to learn lessons of the past from other counties that have come into wealth,\" he said. \"To learn lessons from those that have squandered theirs. This is not a renewable resource, you exploit it once, you have the revenue from it once,\" he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-414437914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/6/1375772866110/Map-of-the-Cook-Islands-008.jpg\" alt=\"Map of the Cook Islands\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of the Cook Islands.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Squids in</h2> <p>If mining doesn't work for the Cook Islands, there's always squid.</p> <p>The country is considering creating a new industry centred on fishing for giant squid, following the successful creation of a squid fishing industry on the Japanese island of Okinawa.</p> <p>\"We thought to ourselves, if we can find it here maybe we could do the same, something for our own local market,\" said William Sokimi, the fisheries development officer of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, which represents 22 Pacific island countries.</p> <p>A recent small-scale fishing trial caught four diamondback squids and a neon flying squid, the biggest one weighing in at 17kg.</p> <p>\"So far, it is looking very promising \u2026 we have now established that giant squid can be caught in the Cook Islands,\" Sokimi told Radio Australia.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a brief closing summary. \u2022 The UK service sector has posted its biggest leap in activity in over six years. The monthly PMI survey, conducted by Markit, jumped to 60.2 in July, showing strong growth, and suggesting the UK recovery continues to pick up pace. Details from 9.,39am onwards. Analyst reaction at 10.14am \u2022 There was also optimism in the eurozone that the recession is over. PMI surveys from the region indicated that its private sector had finally returned to growth. Germany led the way, and there were signs of stabilisation in Spain and Italy. The eurozone data is covered at 9.18am The key highlights by country begin at 8.31am \u2022 However, other countries performed less strongly. Brazil (see 2.19pm), India and Russia (8.10am) all saw a fall in service sector activity. Meanwhile in the eurozone... \u2022 there were fresh protests against public sector job cuts in Greece (see 1.24pm and 12.50pm)... \u2022 ...as Italy remained gripped by Silvio Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud (see 11.12am)... \u2022 ...and the IMF urged France to rein in its austerity programme in 2014 (see 4.41pm) I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for the great comments, as ever, and goodnight. GW After a bright opening, Europe's stock markets have closed with losses in London, and little change elsewhere today. The news that Britain's service sector enjoyed a bumper July, and that the eurozone private sector returned to growth, didn't spark much of a rally. In London, the FTSE 100 was dragged down by HSBC -- which warned of an emerging market slowdown in today's financial results. David Madden, market analyst at IG, commented: In London, the banking sector dragged the market lower after HSBC's first-half figures were good but not good enough to entice traders to go long. The largest bank in Europe announced an increase in profit but fell below expectations, prompting traders to unload their positions in the Asian-focused bank. Natural resource stocks initially propped up the FTSE but as the day went on dealers lost their appetite for risk. And here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 28 points at 6619, -0.43% \u2022 German DAX: down 8 points at 8398, -0.1% \u2022 French CAC: up 4 points at 4049, +0.1% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 21 points at 16757, -0.13% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 13 points at 8,560, -0.15% In the world of banking, HSBC is considering responding to the EU's cap on bonus payments by boosting the basic salaries paid to its staff. Our City editor, Jill Treanor, reports: Speaking from Hong Kong, [chairman Douglas] Flint said one of the options being considered to tackle the bonus cap was a potential pay rise for staff and he said he was confident that shareholders would support policies intended to keep the bank competitive. \"We are looking at a whole range of things,\" he said. Here's the full story: HSBC may raise banker pay to overcome bonus cap Over in America, the head of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank has declared that the Fed is almost ready to start slowing the US monetary stimulus programme. President Richard Fisher told the National Association of State Retirement Administrators that the moment of 'execution' on 'tapering' the US bond-buying programme (currently $85bn per month) was close. Here's the key quote: Having stated this quite clearly, and with the unemployment rate having come down to 7.4%, I would say that the (Fed's policy-setting) committee is now closer to execution mode, pondering the right time to begin reducing its purchases, assuming there is no intervening reversal in economic momentum in coming months. Fisher also declared that the Fed must avoid 'market havoc' when it begins to withdraw the QE punchbowl - having already seen stock markets tumble in May when the prospect was first floated. The International Monetary Fund has offered the French government some support, and urged Francois Hollande to slow the pace of austerity next year. France has been criticised for not taking more decisive action to cut its deficit, which is forecast to be 3.9% of GDP this year. But the IMF reckons Paris's priority must be growth next year, meaning Hollande should ease up on fiscal consolidation. In its latest report (online here), the IMF warned: The pace of adjustment should be eased in 2014 relative to current plans in order to support the recovery. Adjustment should also be rebalanced toward expenditure containment. The IMF also ruled out a surge in growth later this year, predicting that French GDP would shrink by 0.2% in 2013. It also predicted meagre growth in 2014, of just 0.8%. More from JP Morgan. Senior economist Joe Lupton says the global economy made \"a positive start\" to the third quarter of 2013, but warned: Although the stronger performance signalled is pleasing in itself, the structure remains uncomfortably uneven by region, particularly with regard to job creation. JP Morgan has added up all July's PMI data, and concluded that the global services sector posted a healthy increase in activity last month, from 51.1 to 54.9. This meant stronger growth across the global private sector too, with a PMI of 54.1, the highest level in 16 months, up from 51.2 in June. Here's the details: Back to Italy, where Silvio Berlusconi is receiving a friendly visit from none other than Russian president Vladimir Putin. That's according to La Stampa, which reports that \"Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, arrived in Rome to meet with his great friend Silvio Berlusconi\". Berlusconi's conviction for tax fraud clearly didn't deter Putin from making the date to see his long-time ally. More here: Putin in visita da Berlusconi This handy graph from Reuters compares the service sector growth in the US (dark blue), the eurozone (light blue) and China (green) over the last five years: Larger version here. Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior policy advisor, agrees that the jump in British service sector output in July (9.39am) is good news. He cautions, though, that the economy is still a tough place for many people. He's blogged five quick thoughts on the data, including: Third, the real measure of the recovery will be found in falling unemployment and rising real wages and living standards. We have a triple crisis of jobs, wages and investment and a very long way to go to get out of them. Here's the full piece: The Service Sector PMI: 5 Quick Thoughts America's services sector has followed the UK by posting forecast-smashing activity for July. The US ISM Non-Manufacturing Composite index (which measures its service sector) jumped to 56.0 last month, up from the three-year low of 52.2 reported in June. That's the highest reading since February, and indicates much stronger growth. Economists had expected a reading of 53.1. The jump in the monthly index was mainly due to a surge in new orders (the sub-index leapt to 57.7 from 50.8 in June). Last month's surge in UK service sector activity (see 9.39am onwards) is the best monthly performance in over six years. Apart from that, though, July 2013 and December 2006 have little else in common. The recession, and its aftermath, has pushed Britain's jobless rate up to 7.8%, from 5.5% six and a half years ago. Interest rates were 5% - compared to 0.5% today. And Tony Blair hadn't got round to swapping Downing Street for a new career as Middle East envoy and JP Morganite. My colleague Angela Monaghan has more here: UK service sector high: the last time we had it so good was 2006 More economic data, this time from Brazil -- where service sector activity has fallen. Markit's Brazilian Services PMI dropped from 51.0 in June to 50.3 in July. That's enough to drag the wider private sector PMI down to 49.6, into contraction territory. New orders fell and job creation was unchanged. It's another sign of slowing growth in emerging markets, after India's service sector output shrank for the first time since October 2011 (see opening post). The drop in activity was also blamed on the anti-government protests which began in cities across Brazil in June. A few more photos from Athens of today's protest by employees from the Greek Manpower Employment Organization and the social security offices (as mentioned at 12.50pm): Greece isn't the only country experiencing industrial action today. In Germany, the country's canal workers have downed tools today in a row over job cuts. Transport on the country's canal network is likely to be hit, as Reuters reports: Several canals in Germany will be partially blocked to cargo shipping this week due to renewed strikes by lock operators, German trade union Ver.di said on Monday. The strikes, set to last the rest of the week, are in protest against government plans to restructure the German inland navigation authority WSA. Traders said they did not expect the strikes to cause widespread disruption and that shipment delays were likely to be local and restricted to smaller canals. In Greece, workers at the country's employment offices pension fund are holding a walk-out today in the latest protest at planned job cuts. Despite regular protests, the Athens government continues to push on with its targets for cutting 15,000 pubilc sector positions by the end of 2014. Administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Mega TV that 12,500 workers will be transferred to the new labour pool (which can lead to redeployment or redundancy). Mitsotakis said: The truth is that the ministries have lived up to the commitment they made to the prime minister and we have formed a clear timeline about how we will keep to one of our main pledges to have 12,500 people in the scheme by the end of September. More here: Mitsotakis confident Greece will meet civil service target by September The latest retail sales from the eurozone show that the region's consumers are still facing hard times. Sales across the euro area sales in the euro zone fell for the first time in three months in June, dropping 0.5% compared with May, as households continued to struggle. The largest monthly decreases were registered in Estonia (-3.3%), Hungary (-1.9%), Austria (-1.7%) and Germany (-1.5%) Malta (+1.8%), Luxembourg (+1.3%) and Denmark (+1.2%) bucked the trend with rising sales compared with May. And on a year-on-year basis, recession-hit Spain showed the largest decline, falling by 6.9% compared with June 2012. Here's our full news story on the UK service sector's knock-out performance last month: UK service sector hits pre-crisis levels, boosting growth hopes Speaking of Silvio Berlusconi (11.12am), political analyst Alberto Nardelli flags up that the next key development is a vote in the Senate in September to rubberstamp his sentence: As the odds are significantly stacked against Berlusconi (8-15 in the committee which decides on immunity, and 117-198 in the senate itself which would need to vote on the committee\u2019s decision), he may decide to directly step down as a senator. Berlusconi will also need to decide (by mid-October) how he intends to serve his one year sentence (house arrest or community service). Nardelli also suggests that Italy faces the real prospect of another election within the year: In summary, I believe the lifetime of the current government has been inevitably shortened and I wouldn\u2019t bet on it lasting a full-term, and 12 more months are probably also optimistic at this point. The earliest an election could take place is November, but a spring 2014 election is more likely. More here: Italy - what could happen next (politically) Silvio Berlusconi continues to dominate the news in Italy following his failure to overturn a conviction and jail term for tax fraud last weekend. Yesterday, hundreds of supporters gathered outside the former PM's home to protest against the sentence, and were treated to a classic appearance from Berlusconi himself. Despondent at one stage, and celebratory at another, Berlusconi insisted he was innocent, while also showing support for the country's coalition. He declared: I am here. I am staying here. I won't give up. We will continue together to fight this battle for democracy and freedom. (full story by Lizzy Davies here) Senior members of Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PdL) party are due to meet President Giorgio Napolitano today to discuss his future. The ANSA news agency reports: PdL Senate whip Renato Schifani and House whip Renato Brunetta are expected to discuss ways to make it possible for Berlusconi to stay active in politics after the four-year prison sentence - three of which have been commuted because of an amnesty - comes into effect in October. PdL supporters are pushing for Berlusconi to be pardoned. But, as ANSA explains, that's a tough sell: This could be difficult for Napolitano to do for many reasons, including the fact that Berlusconi is appealing against two other criminal convictions, a seven-year sentence for paying for sex with an underage prostitute and a one-year term for involvement in the publication of an illegally obtained wiretap. Europe's stock markets hit two month highs this morning, following the news that the eurozone private sector returned to growth last month (see 9.18am) In London, the FTSE 100 is up 12 points at 6660, led by Lloyds Banking Group (+4% at 76/7p). That is driven by speculation that the UK government is on the brink of selling some of its 38% stake in the bank. My colleague Jill Treanor wites: Shares in Lloyds Banking Group have hit their highest levels in almost three years amid speculation that the government could begin to sell off its 39% stake in the bailed-out bank. The shares were trading above 76p on Monday, higher than the 73.6p average price at which the government bought its stake in the bank in 2008 and 2009. They have now enjoyed a sustained rise since Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Lloyds boss, said last week it was now up to the government when and how to sell the shares. More here: Lloyds shares above 76p, fuelling sell-off expectations Good news for UK readers poised for a well-earned foreign holiday \u2013 sterling is strengthening against other major currencies following today's service sector report. The pound is up three-quarters of a cent against the US dollar, at $1.5363, and has also gained half a euro cent against the euro to \u20ac1.156. City economists agree that today's strong service sector data (see 9.39am) shows Britain's recovery is taking root. Robert Wood of Berenberg headlined his research note \"UK: WOW\" - underlining the surprisingly strong surge in service sector activity last month. Wood wrote: From zero to hero in six months, the UK is flying as tumbling mortgage rates and rising confidence are driving a consumer led recovery. Monetary policy is working.... With continued support from the Bank of England, the quagmire of the past couple of years will recede rapidly in the rear-view mirror. We expect the recovery to move onto a firmer footing next year, supported by rising real wages and recovery in the Eurozone. The UK is certainly not facing a \u2018new normal\u2019 of weak growth. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight called it a: show-stopping survey that completes a very impressive hat-trick of improved purchasing managers surveys for July. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency firm World First, commented that 'the good news keep coming\". But Cook also warned that the recovery remains fragile: The key to this, and the sustainability of the recovery, is the confidence around the employment components of these surveys - jobs will only be added if these levels of growth are sustained. Wages should also increase along the way as well further improving confidence and lessening the gap between wage settlements and price rises. Although the improvement in the weather has helped things, I do worry about sales being dragged forward from months in the future. There could be a potential \u2018deflating of the balloon\u2019 as we move through the rest of the year, and when consumers begin to save cash for the inevitable Christmas splurge. Economist Shaun Richards also tweeted that Britain made a strong start to the third quarter of 2013: While Deutsche Bank flags up that the service sector's growth poses some interesting questions for the Bank of England, which releases its next inflation report on Wednesday (with thanks to The Times's economics editor, Sam Fleming). The BoE is expected to flesh out its new 'forward guidance', effectively promising to keep borowing costs low until the economy improves..... Today's blowout reading comes after six months of steadily rising activity in the UK service sector, as this image shows: (anything above 50 = growth). Services makes up around three-quarters of the UK economy, and this graph shows how the surge in activity last month could equate to a jump in GDP: The full report is online here (pdf). Britain's dominant services sector has recorded its best monthly performance since before the financial crisis began, smashing analyst forecasts and suggesting the recovery is gathering pace. The UK service sector PMI index has surged to 60.2 up from June's 56.9. That's the strongest monthly reading since late 2006, and shows extremely strong growth. The survey found a solid rise in new orders, driving optimism higher across the service sector. Underlying demand was reported to be stronger, with firms saying they see better conditions both at home and abroad. Recent good weather in the UK, and a recovery in the housing market, were also credited with driving the service sector in July. A separate survey last Thursday showed that Britain's factory activity hit its highest level since 2011 last month. Taken together, the two reports suggest that Britain's economic recovery is well underway. And with the eurozone private sector also returning to growth in July (see 9.18am), Europe's prospects look brighter. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, commented: The services sector stormed to a six year high in July, registering levels of performance not seen since before the financial crisis. Combined with the manufacturing and construction figures, this is the clearest sign yet that the UK economy is experiencing a broad based economic recovery and has the momentum to deliver continued growth. The seventh month of sustained, accelerated growth in services was underpinned by improved market conditions both domestically and abroad. Business confidence for UK services is now the highest it has been for 15 months, allowing businesses to expand, develop new products and increase their fees. The steep rise in new business and the sharpest rise in backlogs of work since 2010 have put some pressure on capacity, giving firms the conviction to take on more staff and increase wages, which have been stagnant for a long time. Taken together, these could signal a significant month in the turnaround of the fortunes of UK plc. More to follow.... Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that today's data (see 9.18am) shows that the eurozone economy has stopped shrinking: The near stabilization in Eurozone services activity in July fuels hope that Eurozone GDP has finally stopped contracting and is on course to eke out marginal growth over the second half of the year. Furthermore, all countries saw an improved services performance in July compared to June. However the recovery will be constrained by tight fiscal policy, record unemployment and \"limited consumer purchasing power\", Archer added. It's official... the eurozone's battered private sector has posted a rise in activity for the first time since January 2012. Markit's survey of thousands of firms across the eurozone showed a final private sector PMI reading of 50.5, which indicates output has risen. The region's service sector has almost returned to growth, while data last Thursday shows that manufacturing activity increased last month. Markit said that the Eurozone economy has stabilised as the \"German recovery accelerates and downturns ease in France, Italy and Spain\" (see 9.01am for the data). Job losses slowed, and business confidence hit a 16-month high. Here's the key data (where 50 = the gap between expansion and contraction) \u2022 Germany: 52.1 5-month high \u2022 Italy: 49.7 26-month high \u2022 France: 49.1 17-month high \u2022 Spain: 48.6 25-month high Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said the data showed \"a welcome return to growth for the Eurozone economy\", boosting hopes that the recession will end this quarter. Granted, the euro area has experienced false dawns before, but the improvements in confidence and other forward-looking indicators warrant at least some optimism for the outlook this time around. Germany posted a return to expansion in July, while the downturns in the other big-four economies all eased. Dobson added that export demand had driven growth in the eurozone manufacturing sector, but there are also signs of recovery in domestic markets. However... The labour market remains the main bugbear of the eurozone, as rising joblessness hurts growth and raises political and social tensions. Back in the eurozone.. and Italy, Germany and France are all showing signs of recovery. Activity in Italy's service sector has hit a two year high in July, rising to 48.7 on Markit's index -- much stronger than June's 45.8. Still a contraction, but at a much slower pace. In France, the service sector posted its best reading in 11 months. Its July Services PMI of 48.6 was an improvement on June's 47.2. And, as predicted, Germany's service sector leads the way - with a PMI of 51.3. That indicates growth in Europe's largest economy for the third month in a row. Egypt stands out as the worst-performing of the major Middle East economies, with firms in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE reporting an increase in activity. Grim confirmation that Egypt's economy is contracting at an alarming rate. Its private sector deteriorated sharply in July, with the headline PMI diving to 41.7, down from June\u2019s 47.5. That's a very sharp drop in activity. No surprise, given the political turmoil and violence that grips the country following the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi's presidency at the start of July. The number of people in work fell during July, and orders from overseas also dropped. Simon Williams, chief economist for the Middle East at HSBC, warned that Egypt's situation was perilous. Political order is a prerequisite for recovery, but even if that is achieved, it will prove very challenging to quickly reverse the losses of the past 10 months. And here's a graph comparing Spain's service sector PMI to its GDP -- showing how the worst of its recession could be over..... The long slump in Spain's service sector has eased, but firms are still suffering a drop in activity. That's the message from its Services PMI, which came in at 48.5, up from 47.8 in June. The best reading in nearly a year, but still a decline. Markit, which compiled the data, said the decline in activity was slowing, suggesting Spain's two-year recession could finally be over by Christmas: Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit and author of the report, commented; The Spanish service sector came close to a change of momentum in July, with the rate of contraction in activity easing further during the month. Should this current trend be built upon, we could be in line to see a return to growth of GDP by the end of the year. This remains far from assured, however, with service providers continuing to highlight the effects of the economic crisis in their responses to the latest survey. Sweden's service sector has roared back into growth, with a PMI of 56.6 - up from 44.8 in June. Encouraging news for the Swedish economy, which suffered a rare (but small) contraction in the last three months (details). This morning's data is expected to show that Germany is the only eurozone member whose service sector is actually growing. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets rounds up the predictions: Of all the countries only Germany\u2019s PMI is expected to show any form of expansion with a reading of 52.5 expected. All the others are expected to show an improvement but are still expected to remain firmly stuck in contraction territory. Italy is expected to improve to 46.5, Spain 48.1 and France 48.3, while the broader European measure is expected to come in at 49.6. Meanwhile, the UK service sector is expected to show stonking growth, with a PMI of at least 57, up from 56.9 in June. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It's a big day for economic data, with a string of surveys showing how the world's service sectors performed in July. And it's already begun with alarming signs from two key economies \u2013 India and Russia. The Indian service sector has shrunk for the first time since October 2011, driven by a drop in new orders and weaker economic activity. This means India's private sector's output has contracted for the first time in over four years, fuelling fears that its economy is on the slide. This graph shows how India's once-buoyant private sector has slipped in recent months: The Indian service sector PMI tumbled to 47.9, down from 51.7 in June. Any number below 50 shows a fall in activity. Leif Eskesen, chief economist for India at HSBC - which compiled the data - warned that manufacturing and services companies are both seeing a drop in new work. Activity in the service sector contracted in July led by a drop in new business, which also led to a decline in optimism among the surveyed companies. The slump in activity comes as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has battled to bolster the rupee, which has hit a series of record lows against the US dollar in recent weeks. Eskesen argued that the RBI will soon need to prioritise growth: While the RBI has to cater to the currency at the moment, it will eventually need to cater more to growth as economic activity continues to soften. The picture isn't too much better in Russia either, where the private sector has suffered its first drop in activity in three years, and hit a four-year low. The Markit/HSBC Services PMI, released this morning, fell marginally to 48.7 from 48.8 in June -- meaning another month of falling activity. This followed a similar drop in Russian manufacturing output last week, so Russia's private sector PMI has now slipped to 48.7. That's the first reading below 50 since August 2010, and the lowest since July 2009. Russia has been hit by recent falls in commodity prices, which helped to push down privat sector employment. Alexander Morozov, chief economist for Russia and CIS at HSBC, warned that Russia faces both cyclical and structural problems -- with many firms declining to spend more on investment. Like a duet of synchronised springboard divers, output in services and manufacturing dove in unison at identical rates in July, the HSBC Russia Composite PMI survey revealed. Apparently, this kind of diving is not the one that can cheer anybody. In essence, it appears that the Russian economy has lost its growth engines, with neither manufacturing nor services being able to sustain overall economic growth alone anymore. And here's the obligatory graph: A bad start to the morning. Can Europe do better? We get service sector from across the eurozone (9am BST), and from the UK (9.30 BST) this morning. Last week's manufacturing data was encouragin, suggesting that the eurozone recession was over, and Britain's recovery was gathering pace. On top of all this economic data, I'll be tracking the latest political developments across the eurozone area. Italy continues to be gripped by Silvio Bersluconi's tax fraud conviction, while in Greece prime minister Antonis Samaras is preparing for a trip to America....",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Lloyds Banking Group have hit their highest levels in almost three years amid speculation that the government could begin to sell off its 39% stake in the bailed-out bank. The shares were trading above 76p on Monday, higher than the 73.6p average price at which the government bought its stake in the bank in 2008 and 2009. Banking analysts UBS earlier increased their forecast for the share price to 100p from 72p. \"Lloyds is returning to the business model of 1996 to 1999 which we have been anticipating for some time \u2013 with costs falling, revenues on an upward path, provisions sharply below expectations and with the capital intensity of the business declining, Lloyds is on the verge of delivering material returns to shareholders through dividends, business growth and potential share buybacks,\" UBS analyst John-Paul Crutchley wrote. He also brought forward his forecast for a dividend payment for the full 2013 results rather than the end of 2014. The shares have now enjoyed a sustained rise since Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Lloyds boss, said last week it was now up to the government when and how to sell the shares. He was speaking after the bank roared back into profit and he sketched out a plan to resume dividends for the first time since the 2008 bailout. He told reporters that he wanted to pay out 50% of revenue in dividends although the Financial Times reported on Monday that he was telling shareholders he wanted to pay out 70%. \"I believe we have completed the first phase \u2026 the share price is now in a position where the government can return taxpayers' money at a profit,\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio said as the bank reported first-half profits of \u00a32.1bn. His bonus is linked to selling off the stake. He cannot get the bonus in the next five years unless the share price meets 73.6p for a certain period of time, or the government sells at least 33% of its stake at prices above 61p \u2013 the latter is the price of the Lloyds shares in the national accounts as this was the average price at which they were trading when the stake was bought, although it was not the actual price paid for the shares. The deputy prime minster, Nick Clegg, last week tried to played down expectations that a sell-off could start quickly. Chancellor George Osborne has indicated that the first sell-off of the stake is likely to be to big institutional investors. Crutchley at UBS, which acts as house broker to Lloyds, suggested this could be the \"first and last institutional placing\". Crutchley said that after an institutional placing, the government could then conduct a \u00a39bn offering to retail investors and after that Lloyds could eventually buy out the rest of the government stake. While Lloyds shares were the largest risers in the FTSE 100, shares in rival bailed-out bank Royal Bank of Scotland were among the biggest fallers. Shares in RBS \u2013 which last week named Ross McEwan to replace Stephen Hester as chief executive \u2013 were down 1% to 319.1p.",

He also brought forward his forecast for a dividend payment for the full 2013 results rather than the end of 2014.</p> <p>The shares have now enjoyed a sustained rise since Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the Lloyds boss, said last week it was now up to the government when and how to sell the shares. He was speaking after the bank roared back into profit and he sketched out a plan to resume dividends for the first time since the 2008 bailout. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/01/lloyds-sell-off-moves-nearer-profit\" title=\"\">told reporters that he wanted to pay out 50% of revenue in dividends</a> although the Financial Times reported on Monday that he was telling shareholders he wanted to pay out 70%.</p> <p>\"I believe we have completed the first phase \u2026 the share price is now in a position where the government can return taxpayers' money at a profit,\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio said as the bank reported first-half profits of \u00a32.1bn.</p> <p>His bonus is linked to selling off the stake. He cannot get <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/lloyds-banking-group/rns/2012-annual-remuneration/201303010701049865Y/\" title=\"\">the bonus in the next five years unless the share price meets 73.6p for a certain period of time, or the government sells at least 33% of its stake at prices above 61p</a> \u2013 the latter is the price of the Lloyds shares in the national accounts as this was the average price at which they were trading when the stake was bought, although it was not the actual price paid for the shares.</p> <p>The deputy prime minster, Nick Clegg, last week tried to played down expectations that a sell-off could start quickly.</p> <p>Chancellor George Osborne has indicated that the first sell-off of the stake is likely to be to big institutional investors. Crutchley at UBS, which acts as house broker to Lloyds, suggested this could be the \"first and last institutional placing\". Crutchley said that after an institutional placing, the government could then conduct a \u00a39bn offering to retail investors and after that Lloyds could eventually buy out the rest of the government stake.</p> <p>While Lloyds shares were the largest risers in the FTSE 100, shares in rival bailed-out bank Royal Bank of Scotland were among the biggest fallers. Shares in RBS \u2013 which last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/rbs-ross-mcewan-stephen-hester\" title=\"\">named Ross McEwan to replace Stephen Hester as chief executive</a> \u2013 were down 1% to 319.1p.</p>",

The Productivity Commission\u2019s 2011 report, <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/study/regulation-reforms/report\">Identifying and Evaluating Regulation Reforms</a>, for example, noted of past claims of cost savings, \u201cdespite the estimated savings, business surveys report little reduction in compliance costs.

It sounds good, but I\u2019ll wait until I see more than Tony Abbott saying \u201cwe believe\u201d before I will believe.</p> <p>The big issue on which both sides furiously agree to disagree is debt. Tony Abbott noted that \u201cour gross debt is skyrocketing towards $400bn\u201d, while Kevin Rudd took a broader view saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And while others continue to make false claims that somehow this country is in a debt and deficit crisis, they can never answer this simple question: if that is the case, why does Australia, among only eight countries in the world, continue to have a triple-A credit rating and stable outlook? Nor can they answer why the Australian government debt per head of population is one of the lowest across all the developed countries in the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now Abbott might be over-egging the amount a bit \u2013 the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2013-14/content/economic_statement/html/index.htm\">recent economic statement</a> has gross debt reaching $370bn in 2016-17 \u2013 but aside from that, both sides are correct.

Australia\u2019s debt level is low compared with the rest of the world \u2013 and as I noted in my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/may/28/australia-economy-myths-gfc\">first post</a>, even the increase in debt in the past five years has been lower than average.</p> <p>But why Rudd refers to debt per head of population is a mystery. The ALP has recently put out an infographic on Facebook showing that we are only second to Estonia in terms of lowest debt per capita. Of course we are second only if you leave out a few countries such as Sweden, Norway and Finland.</p> <p>But economists pretty much only talk in terms of debt per GDP.
