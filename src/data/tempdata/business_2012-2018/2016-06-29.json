      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England is to use a speech on Thursday to try to calm fears that Britain\u2019s financial system could experience a heart-stopping shock following last week\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Mark Carney is expected to say the contingency plans put in place by Threadneedle Street have kept funds flowing in the City and bolstered confidence among the business community. His soothing message will follow fresh warnings that the gyrations seen in financial markets since last Friday are only a taster for later in the year and 2017 when exit negotiations get under way. Surveys of business owners and lenders also showed the UK economy was poised to have a run of insolvencies, a downturn in investment and higher unemployment as the after shocks of the referendum vote damage business and consumer confidence. A poll for YouGov found that consumer confidence dived in the five days since the referendum vote as concerns grew about house prices and the likelihood of being made redundant. The YouGov/Cebr consumer confidence index, which measures people\u2019s economic sentiment daily, tumbled from at 111.9 in the first three weeks of June to 104.3 in the days after the vote. The last time consumer confidence was at this level was in May 2013 when it was at 102.9, those behind the index said. An earlier barometer of consumers by market research fim GfK found that an already nervous public went into the referendum with \u201ca deepening pessimism over the general economic situation\u201d. The Gfk survey, which is conducted in each EU country for the European commission, was slightly higher in June at -1 compared with -3 in May, but still 18 points lower than the same time last year. The rating agency Fitch warned that firms were going to delay investment and hiring decisions as a result of the Brexit vote, taking a significant toll on the UK economy. Fitch \u2013 which along with fellow rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, downgraded the UK\u2019s credit rating on Monday \u2013 cut its forecasts for GDP growth and said the UK\u2019s vote to the leave the EU had come at a time when the world economy was at a \u201cfragile juncture\u201d. The Economist Intelligence Unit went further, saying financial markets would continue to panic as the twists and turns of negotiations between the UK and EU reverberated across international money markets. \u201cThis process will commence with the triggering of article 50 of the EU treaties. We expect financial market volatility to persist as events unfold and uncertainty over the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will feed into the real economy,\u201d the consultancy firm said. Britain\u2019s economy will shrink next year by 1%, it said, revising its previous prediction of 1.8% growth. Oxford Economics, another consultancy, said the Brexit vote had come at a bad time for the global economy, which has slowed over the last year. It said: \u201cOur world recession indicator is already at elevated levels and suggests a significant danger of world growth slipping below 2% this year; not a recession, but it might feel like one.\u201d It said the UK would avoid a recession, but would see its growth seriously damaged. Insolvencies would rise in the short term across the UK and in countries with close ties to the UK, especially Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, trade credit insurer Atradius said. It said the food business would be among the worst affected along with other industries that depend on trade, including lorry and truck makers, textile and electrical equipment firms and the chemicals sector. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on the prime minister to relax the Treasury\u2019s austerity measures in response to the credit rating agencies\u2019 downgrades and forecasts of a worsening outlook. Corbyn asked for reassurances about investment and called for the government to relax its fiscal rules that aims to achieve a budget surplus by 2020. \u201cOur country is divided, so we must heal that division,\u201d he said. \u201cOur economy is fragile so we must begin to rebuild it.\u201d Fitch said the outcome of the referendum would hit investment because of the uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU; the regulatory backdrop; and political uncertainty, including a possible referendum in Scotland. \u201cThe main source of uncertainty relates to the future of the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU \u2013 its main trading partner and destination for 44% of UK exports,\u201d Fitch said. It also cast doubt on any hope that the UK would secure membership of the European Economic Area trading bloc, as suggested by some. \u201cThis uncertainty will prompt firms to delay investment and hiring decisions, while elevated financial market volatility will further damage business confidence,\u201d the agency said. Carney\u2019s speech will follow his address from the Bank last Friday, just as the markets were opening for the first time since the result of the referendum was announced. In that televised address he said the central bank would take any measures needed to secure economic and financial stability. Five days ago, with the markets wrongfooted over the Brexit vote, Carney had stressed banks were stronger than before the 2008 financial crisis. But he also spelt out that bank officials could inject an additional \u00a3250bn to the system ensure that financial institutions did not run short of cash during the uncertain period ahead.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The vote to leave the EU has exposed divisions in society that mean reform of executive pay at big companies is urgently required, according to one of the UK\u2019s top fund managers. A senior executive at Hermes Investment Management, which manages \u00a324bn of funds and advises 42 investors holding almost \u00a3170bn, said runaway executive pay had probably contributed to the alienation felt by many people in marginalised parts of Britain who voted for Brexit. The average FTSE 100 chief executive earns \u00a35m, compared with \u00a327,600 for all UK workers, a pay gap that underscores wider divisions between the populace and the elite, Hans-Christoph Hirt, co-head of Hermes\u2019 stewardship arm, Hermes EOS, said. Hirt said: \u201cThere is a big gap between people on the street and the people who do voting on remuneration and that is not sustainable. Fund managers are waking up to the fact that they work for pension funds and the man on the street. The discussions have been ongoing but [Brexit] will give a different dimension to it.\u201d He added: \u201cBridging the gap in pay is the equivalent of bridging the gap between Westminster and east England. \u201cThere is a similarity between the two situations. The pay gap is growing and growing and it is comparable to the situation in north-east and east England where people feel out of touch and not represented.\u201d Last Thursday\u2019s vote to quit the EU has been blamed on a wider alienation of working class people outside prosperous city centres who have felt left behind by globalisation and rising prosperity for top earners. Hirt said bosses\u2019 pay is too high and too complicated and that remuneration committees should stand up to senior executives over pay levels. \u201cThe discussion should focus more on what is necessary and not what is the maximum possible or acceptable. If they see an outcome that doesn\u2019t feel right they should use discretion to make an adjustment.\u201d The Resolution Foundation said on Tuesday that weak income growth and rising housing costs had caused living standards to stagnate for low- and middle-income families over the past decade. The squeeze on living standards helped spur disillusionment with the political and economic status quo, the foundation said. Hirt said the recent spate of rebellions against excessive pay at companies\u2019 annual general meetings showed the investment industry was starting to take the matter seriously and that Brexit would increase pressure for pay to be reined in. Protests included votes against pay at Shell and Smith &amp; Nephew and a big rebellion against the \u00a370m pay deal for Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP. Hermes\u2019 comments expand on a warning from another big British fund manager, Standard Life, which said on Tuesday that Brexit underlined the dangers posed by the gap between the rich and poor. It said the effect would be felt in the US, where populist resentment of political elites has risen, as well as in the UK. \u201cThe vote has highlighted deeper fault lines in the global economy. Increasing income inequality over recent decades has fostered populist anger across many economies. A failure to address these challenges raises the risk of these types of political shocks,\u201d Standard Life said. Brexit also prompted the US financial houses Bank of America and Pimco to turn their attention to inequality. Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank, said Britain\u2019s economic recovery had been unequal and that the vote to leave the EU was the biggest rejection so far of the age of inequality. Pimco, the $1.5tn (\u00a31.12tn) fund whose advisers include Gordon Brown, said if populist or nationalist parties did not come to power, Brexit would still increase pressure on governments to address inequality and adopt protectionist policies.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "BHS collapse: Goldman Sachs is left looking foolish", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is a remarkable thing to say about Goldman Sachs but, to judge by vice chairman Michael Sherwood\u2019s shrunken and apologetic demeanour in front of MPs, he knows it himself: the investment bank was a naive fool in the BHS debacle. And that\u2019s the generous interpretation of events. Sherwood arrived in Westminster repeating colleague Anthony Gutman\u2019s previous line that Goldman had only a walk-on role in Sir Philip Green\u2019s disastrous sale of BHS to thrice-bankrupt Dominic Chappell. The bank wasn\u2019t engaged formally by Green as an adviser and had declined to be so. It didn\u2019t earn a penny in fees. Its job was merely to provide informal observations. And \u2013 most importantly \u2013 Goldman never told Green it was OK to proceed with Chappell, said Sherwood. Contrast that account with the version told by Green and his band of loyal Arcadia executives who have emphasised Goldman\u2019s role as \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and \u201cadviser\u201d on the deal. Green said a couple of weeks ago that \u201cone million per cent\u201d he would have ditched Chappell if he had failed Goldman\u2019s \u201csniff test.\u201d There was no sniff-test, said Sherwood. There is no reason to doubt his word: there is not a single email to suggest Goldman gave formal approval to Chappell. Most of the exchanges were indeed equivocal. But, come on, the Goldmanites were gullible in the extreme if they couldn\u2019t spot the danger that their qualified \u201cobservations\u201d about risks might be over-interpreted as approval in principle. Green, remember, was trying to ditch a loss-making company with a large hole in its pension fund. An association with the Goldman name tends to get wheels turning. In this case, the bank had previously given advice to the BHS pension fund. It also managed money for Green and his family. And, as Sherwood put it, it had been \u201changing around the goalmouth\u201d for a decade hoping to act on a Green deal. Goldman may have retreated to the stands when BHS popped up, but it should not be surprised if others portrayed it as chief playmaker, or even referee. If you\u2019re \u201chalf in, half out,\u201d as one MP put it, there is confusion. Sherwood is a streetwise operator, we used to think \u2013 to get to the top of Goldman, you have to be. On this occasion, when he wasn\u2019t apologising for forgetting about Green\u2019s request for a \u00a340m loan to support the BHS transaction, he found himself regretting that Goldman\u2019s \u201cextremely limited\u201d role had not been put in writing. That is one hell of a regret. If Goldman\u2019s role was indeed so limited, Sherwood was played for a fool by his old mate Green. Don\u2019t blame the regulators Whatever Goldman\u2019s failings, the buck stops at the top, a point made forcefully by Frank Field MP later in the session. He\u2019s right, of course. We should not be overly distracted by the parade of advisers making their excuses in front of the committee \u2013 notable others include Chappell\u2019s crew, Olswang and Grant Thornton. In the end, it will be Sir Philip Green and his wife \u2013 principal owner of BHS for 15 years \u2013 who will have to honour his pledge to \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit. Field called for Green to get on with it. The fury was understandable if Paul Budge, Green\u2019s lieutenant at Arcadia, is going to continue to bleat about \u201cthe way pension regulation is set up\u201d to explain the failure to tackle the deficit earlier. The rules may indeed be cumbersome but a competent pension regulator would also need to understand the blizzard of related-party property deals taking place within BHS and the greater Green empire. Since the committee had just spent an hour being baffled by complexity, blaming the regulations is not going to wash. Let\u2019s get back to first principles. BHS should have addressed the deficit when it first started to appear. Instead, a small problem became a very big problem. It was silly for Field to appear to imply the Green family was \u201cnicking\u201d money from BHS. But the MP is right to say the Topshop tycoon still needs to write \u201ca very large cheque\u201d. Brexit: a problem for another day Was the referendum only a week ago? It was, so time to assess the damage to the stock market. What\u2019s this? After its biggest one-day gain since October 2011, the FTSE 100 index is higher than it was last Thursday. The FTSE 250 index \u2013 a better measure of UK plc \u2013 is 7.6% lower, it should be added. But even that scoreline looks respectable against the gloom of Friday and Monday. The outbreak of semi-confidence seems to have two sources. First, there are no signs of Brexit-induced strains in the financial system. The Bank of England hasn\u2019t had to invoke emergency measures, a point governor Mark Carney will probably make in his speech on Thursday. A crisis in the Italian banking sector is close to boiling point but that can\u2019t be blamed on Brexit. The other factor is the City\u2019s belief that the a new prime minister will play for time and that article 50 will not be triggered for a while. Brexit is suddenly a problem for another day. Angela Merkel could spoil the mood at any moment, of course, but she hasn\u2019t yet. City short-termism is alive and well.",

And that\u2019s the generous interpretation of events.</p> <p>Sherwood arrived in Westminster repeating colleague Anthony Gutman\u2019s previous line that Goldman had only a walk-on role in Sir Philip Green\u2019s disastrous sale of BHS to thrice-bankrupt Dominic Chappell. The bank wasn\u2019t engaged formally by Green as an adviser and had declined to be so. It didn\u2019t earn a penny in fees. Its job was merely to provide informal observations. And \u2013 most importantly \u2013 Goldman never told Green it was OK to proceed with Chappell, said Sherwood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/29/bhs-committee-goldman-sachs-michael-sherwood-apologises-not-disclosing-talks\">Goldman Sachs banker apologises to MPs for not disclosing BHS talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contrast that account with the version told by Green and his band of loyal Arcadia executives who have emphasised Goldman\u2019s role as \u201cgatekeeper\u201d and \u201cadviser\u201d on the deal. Green said a couple of weeks ago that \u201cone million per cent\u201d he would have ditched Chappell if he had failed Goldman\u2019s \u201csniff test.\u201d</p> <p>There was no sniff-test, said Sherwood. There is no reason to doubt his word: there is not a single email to suggest Goldman gave formal approval to Chappell. Most of the exchanges were indeed equivocal.</p> <p>But, come on, the Goldmanites were gullible in the extreme if they couldn\u2019t spot the danger that their qualified \u201cobservations\u201d about risks might be over-interpreted as approval in principle. Green, remember, was trying to ditch a loss-making company with a large hole in its pension fund. An association with the Goldman name tends to get wheels turning.</p> <p>In this case, the bank had previously given advice to the BHS pension fund. It also managed money for Green and his family. And, as Sherwood put it, it had been \u201changing around the goalmouth\u201d for a decade hoping to act on a Green deal. Goldman may have retreated to the stands when BHS popped up, but it should not be surprised if others portrayed it as chief playmaker, or even referee. If you\u2019re \u201chalf in, half out,\u201d as one MP put it, there is confusion.</p> <p>Sherwood is a streetwise operator, we used to think \u2013 to get to the top of Goldman, you have to be. On this occasion, when he wasn\u2019t apologising for forgetting about Green\u2019s request for a \u00a340m loan to support the BHS transaction, he found himself regretting that Goldman\u2019s \u201cextremely limited\u201d role had not been put in writing.</p> <p>That is one hell of a regret. If Goldman\u2019s role was indeed so limited, Sherwood was played for a fool by his old mate Green.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t blame the regulators</h2> <p>Whatever Goldman\u2019s failings, the buck stops at the top, a point made forcefully by Frank Field MP later in the session.

      "bodyText": "Frank Field has accused the Green family of \u201cnicking money\u201d from BHS and exploiting its workers as MPs ramp up the criticism of the parties involved in the collapse of the 88-year-old retailer. The Labour MP called on Sir Philip Green to write a \u201cvery large cheque\u201d to fix the \u00a3571m deficit in the BHS pension scheme in an extraordinary outburst during a parliamentary hearing. Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said the evidence that MPs had heard about the collapse of BHS was \u201cpreposterous\u201d. He said the City was furious about the damage to its reputation from the scandal. Green last night called for Field to apologise for his \u201cshocking and offensive behaviour\u201d. He added: \u201cAccusing me and my family of theft is totally false and unacceptable on any basis.\u201d Field made the comments as the leading UK banker at Goldman Sachs said it was not to blame for the failure of BHS. However, the finance director of Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia claimed Goldman Sachs had \u201clet us down\u201d. BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green and his wife Lady Green controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. There is growing anger about the collapse of BHS because Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest during the Topshop owner\u2019s period in charge. Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions also collected at least \u00a317m from BHS, despite owning it for just 13 months. MPs on the work and pensions committee, and the business, innovation and skills committee, are investigating how the BHS pension scheme ended up heavily in deficit and why Green sold the company to Chappell. Field said: \u201cIf Sir Philip was serious he could today settle the pension issue. We are fed up with hearing: \u2018I am about to fix it.\u2019 He does not fix it. What is required is a very large cheque from the Green family, that have done so well out of the whole of this exploitation. \u201cThe City is furious with your [Arcadia\u2019s] behaviour, the image you have put over, that business is not about creating jobs, about spreading wealth, it\u2019s about nicking money off other people. That is what we have seen, and we have got left very vulnerable pensioners and very vulnerable people trying to find a job in the labour market. Sir Philip could fix this today if he was serious.\u201d Field also said that the Arcadia executives were \u201cstretching incredulity\u201d with their evidence, adding: \u201cI think all along we have had to shoehorn things out of you.\u201d The MPs have heard allegations of death threats, blackmail and abusive text messages during their investigation into BHS. \u201cWe have heard evidence that if it was in a novel, you would get the novel thrown back at you by the publisher because it is unrealisable,\u201d Field said. \u201cThis is clearly going to be made a film, the elements that we have had.\u201d Field made his outburst after Arcadia executives declined to take sole responsibility for the failure of BHS. Paul Budge, the finance director of Arcadia, said there were \u201ca number of people to blame\u201d. He said: \u201cWe let ourselves down. Goldman Sachs let us down.\u201d Budge said Arcadia had left BHS with \u00a394m of cash, as well as valuable property assets. \u201cIn the right hands, the turnaround plan was achievable,\u201d he said. The BHS finance director also said that a rescue deal for the pension scheme is a \u201cwork in progress\u201d. Speaking after the meeting. Green said Field\u2019s comments were \u201coutrageous\u201d. He said: \u201cMr Field\u2019s outrageous outburst today demonstrated yet again his clear prejudice against myself, my wife and my executives, who turned up for a second time. \u201cHe arrived very late, offered no apology, heard no evidence, clearly just to put on a 10 minute show and was extremely rude.\u201d Goldman was thrown into the centre of the BHS scandal after Green claimed that he \u201cone million per cent\u201d would not have sold the department store chain to Chappell had he not passed an informal vetting by the bank. Goldman had previously said it provided only preliminary observations to Green on the prospective buyer and was not paid for its work. Michael Sherwood, vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, told MPs that the US bank was not to blame for the scandal. \u201cI absolutely do not accept blame,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cHe [Chappell] never passed our sniff test. If I had a regret, which I do, I wish we had documented more clearly our role in writing so that we did not have this confusion over our role that we do today.\u201d The Goldman banker said his company\u2019s role had been \u201cextremely limited\u201d, that it had never been a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d as Green claimed, and that a paid adviser would have done full due diligence on Chappell. Nonetheless, he said Goldman had \u201cdone a good job of highlighting the risks\u201d in dealing with Chappell. Sherwood is arguably the most influential banker in the City and has worked with Green for 12 years. He suggested that Goldman was reviewing whether to continue working with the billionaire tycoon, but the bank is still managing Green\u2019s private wealth. \u201cThe frequency with which we review clients will be looked at again,\u201d he said. When asked by MPs whether Goldman\u2019s work on the BHS deal had enhanced its reputation, Sherwood replied: \u201cNo.\u201d The banker was forced to apologise to MPs after he revealed that Goldman was approached by Green about offering a \u00a340m loan to BHS when it was bought by Chappell. Goldman had not previously disclosed talks about the loan, despite giving oral and written evidence to the parliamentary committee. This evidence included details of 79 emails, 13 calls, and three meetings that Goldman was involved in during the sales process. Iain Wright, the chair of the business, innovation and skills committee, said: \u201cHow can clients trust you when you\u2019ve failed to remember a potential \u00a340m transaction?\u201d Sherwood said he had forgotten the conversation with Green and that a formal request for the loan did not materialise. \u201cWe never put terms of the loan, ever,\u201d he said.",

Slotted into the governor\u2019s diary at the last moment, the speech is part of efforts by Threadneedle Street to reassure the public and investors following the historic vote on 23 June for the UK to leave the EU. It follows his address from the Bank on Friday, just as the markets were opening for the first time since the result of the referendum was announced, in which Carney said the Bank would take any measures needed to secure economic and financial stability.

      "bodyText": "Leading London-listed shares have recorded their biggest daily rise since October 2011, regaining all their losses and more since the Brexit vote, with nearly \u00a360bn added to the value of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies. Despite warnings from economists that the UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union could cause a new recession, the FTSE 100 jumped 3.58% to 6360, taking it above the 6338 level it closed at on Thursday before the polls closed. Analysts said the initial panic selling had been reversed as investors realised any departure from the EU would not happen for months, given the turmoil in the UK government. In the meantime it was more or less business as usual, they added. Bargain hunters had also come out in force, believing the recent falls had been overdone. On top of that, there were suggestions that central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, might cut interest rates further to fend off any economic downturn. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trader IG, said: \u201cThe contrarian nature of markets has never been more apparent than in the past few days. We could all understand the selloff seen on Friday and then again at the beginning of this week, but the storming rally on the FTSE 100, which has seen the index rally over 7% from Monday\u2019s low, is much harder to explain. \u201cThe market has certainly been quite sanguine in its assessment of the situation, noting that, technically, nothing has really changed in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, and that even negotiations about negotiations have yet to start.\u201d He added: \u201cOf all the post-Brexit outcomes discussed across the City over the past few months, \u2018buying frenzy\u2019 was not one that was viewed as very likely.\u201d The buying was spread over most sectors, from companies that earn in dollars which will benefit from the recent falls in sterling, to housebuilders and banks which bore the brunt of the initial selling following the vote. But dealers pointed out that in dollar terms, the FTSE 100 was still down since Thursday given the decline in the pound, which despite a 1% rise on Wednesday has still fallen from around $1.4 before the referendum to $1.34. And the FTSE 250, which consists of companies more focused on the UK economy than those in the FTSE 100, has not recouped its post-Brexit losses. Despite a 3.2% rise on Wednesday it is still down 7.6% since the result of the vote.",

      "bodyText": "It was not just the FTSE 100 which moved sharply higher for the second day running. As bargain hunters returned after the recent hefty falls, markets across Europe and in the US recorded big gains despite talk of possible recession following the Brexit vote. Analysts said buyers had also moved back into the market as they realised that despite the referendum, the UK would not trigger Article 50, setting the exit from the EU in motion, for months, given the political turmoil in the country. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 3.58% or 219.67 at 6360 regaining all its losses and more since the Brexit vote The FTSE 250, more focused on the UK domestic economy, ended 3.22% higher at 16,002.90 but is still down 7.6% since Thursday Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.75% to 9612.27 France\u2019s Cac closed up 2.6% at 4195.32 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.21% to 15,946.93 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 3.45% at 8105.3 In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.6% at 541.88 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 227 points or 1.3%. Meanwhile the pound has added 1% to $1.348 and 0.75% to \u20ac1.214. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The UK\u2019s leading index is up 219.67 points at 6360.06, above the 6338 level it closed at on Thursday before the referendum polls closed. In fact it is the highest closing level for the index since 21 April this year. And the 3.58% gain looks like the biggest one day rise since October 2011. The FTSE 250 has finished 3.22% better at 16,002.90. The FTSE 100 has closed up 3.58% and has regained all its losses and more since the referendum. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: The contrarian nature of markets has never been more apparent than in the past few days. We could all understand the selloff seen on Friday and then again at the beginning of this week, but the storming rally on the FTSE 100, which has seen the index rally over 7% from Monday\u2019s low, is much harder to explain, other than via the usual combination of short-covering and bargain hunting. The market has certainly been quite sanguine in its assessment of the situation, noting that, technically, nothing has really changed in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, and that even negotiations about negotiations have yet to start. It is safe to say that, of all the post Brexit outcomes discussed across the City over the past few months, \u2018buying frenzy\u2019 was not one that was viewed as very likely. Today\u2019s list of top risers is somewhat more diverse than yesterday, with miners enjoying healthy gains, although once again UK-focused names like house builders and insurers predominate. Elsewhere a whistleblower who leaked details of corporate tax deals was found guilty of theft, writes Simon Bowers: A former employee of PricewaterhouseCoopers has been convicted of theft after a court in Luxembourg found he was behind an unprecedented leak of controversial tax deals privately granted to many of the world\u2019s largest corporations. A judge in Luxembourg told Antoine Deltour he would avoid jail but must receive a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31200). He found Deltour guilty on charges including theft and violating Luxembourg\u2019s strict professional secrecy laws. In 2014, Deltour won widespread praise for helping bring to light hundreds of controversial tax deals granted in previous years by the Luxembourg tax office. The revelations helped lay bare the tax arrangements of companies including Burberry, Pepsi, Ikea, Heinz, Shire Pharmaceuticals and others. The full story is here: The Bank of England has announced that governor Mark Carney will give a speech there on Thursday at 4pm. There are no details as to what he might say, a week after the referendum, but there is of course speculation: Some snippets about Brexit and its fallout from the ECB\u2019s Vitor Constancio at the central banks forum, and he thinks things could get quite bad: Markets continue to move higher, and could get a further boost after the US Federal Reserve releases its latest annual bank stress tests later (see here), says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Against the odds this post-Brexit rebound has carried through to a second day; not only that but, if analysts are correct, the markets may well receive a boost this evening in the form of the Federal Reserve\u2019s bank stress test results. If the US banking sector proves its resilience in the face of the Fed\u2019s imaginary scenarios it may reassure investors that the institutions can deal with the fallout of Britain leaving the EU, therefore extending the rebound into Thursday. If the report uncovers too many weaknesses, however, the market\u2019s recent gains may be undermined. More signs of a slowing US housing market. The National Association of Realtors index for pending home sales - contracts to buy previously owned homes - fell 3.7% to 110.8 in May. Analysts had expected a fall of 1.1%, according to Reuters. The index is 0.2% lower than in May 2015, declining year on year for the first time in almost two years. Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said: With demand holding firm this spring and homes selling even faster than a year ago, the notable increase in closings in recent months took a dent out of what was available for sale in May and ultimately dragged down contract activity. Realtors are acknowledging with increasing frequency lately that buyers continue to be frustrated by the tense competition and lack of affordable homes for sale in their market. Yun said the fallout from the Brexit vote provided headwinds but also opportunities: In the short term, volatility in the financial markets could very likely lead to even lower mortgage rates and increased demand from foreign buyers looking for a safer place to invest their cash. On the other hand, any prolonged market angst and further economic uncertainty overseas could negatively impact our economy and end up tempering the overall appetite for homebuying. Over at the ECB Forum in Portugal a number of central bankers, including ex-ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet and former Bank of England MPC member and deputy governor Charles Bean, are discussing Brexit: There may be warnings of a UK recession, and concerns that market volatility will continue for some time, but investors are still keen to push shares higher. In the US, Wall Street has followed the lead of other global markets and opened sharply higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 145 points or 0.85%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.7% better and Nasdaq 0.8% better. The FTSE 100 is still around 2% higher although off its best levels, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.7% and France\u2019s Cac up almost 2.5%. Stock markets are staging a remarkable rally today, as investors manage to put aside worries about Britain\u2019s Brexit crisis. The FTSE 100 index is up 135 right now, a gain of 2.2%. That means it is positive for 2016 again, and only around 60 points below last Thursday\u2019s figure, when Britain headed to the polls. The top riser right now is building firm Taylor Wimpey (+7%), followed by a clutch of other builders, plus mining companies and major exporters. The pound is also gaining ground, up 1.5 cents today at $1.35. That\u2019s around 4 cents higher than Monday\u2019s 31-year low, but still 10 cents below pre-referendum levels. The rally comes despite a tidal wave of warnings about Brexit, and signals from Brussels that negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawal will be tough. For example: Fitch has predicted Britain will suffer a slump in investment A credit insurer has warned of a spike in insolvencies The Economist Intelligence Unit, and Pantheon Economics, have both warned of a UK recession in 2017 Claims that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are renting office space in Frankfurt, ready to move jobs from the City, have been denied Britain\u2019s refusal to pull the trigger on Article 50, to leave the EU, has left Europe in the dark. But it also - paradoxically - seems to be reassuring the City, and sparking some bargain-hunting in the markets. But Adam Jepsen, founder of Financial Spreads, reckons more market volatility is likely. \u201cAny investors who think the markets have calmed down should think again. It is far more likely that we are in the eye of the storm,\u201d. Especially when politicians are still grappling with how to handle the Brexit vote.... The FT is reporting that the Bank of England had a little chat with the bosses of Britain\u2019s largest banks today. Apparently... BoE officials gave the bosses of big British banks a supportive message about the amount of liquidity in the system, while pressing them to keep lending to consumers and companies to avoid a repeat of the \u201ccredit crunch\u201d that hit after Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, according to a person briefed on the meeting. Over in Brussels, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is making a new push against Europe\u2019s austerity measures: This week\u2019s summit was a rare treat for Tsipras; the Brexit issue means it was one of the few gatherings where Greece\u2019s debt crisis wasn\u2019t on everyone\u2019s mind. A nice bit of history here: The Brexit uncertainty has also driven investors to buy more government debt, as it is a standard \u2018safe haven\u2019 during times of crisis. That forced prices higher, meaning that the yield on 10-year government bonds has hit a fresh record low - at under 0.6%. That\u2019s a ridiculously cheap level; good news for governments running deficits, but an alarming sign that markets expect little growth and weak inflation for a while. Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor, has just published an impassioned plea to Leave campaigner Boris Johnson to stop dithering, for the sake of the country. He warns that Britain is sinking into recession while the man who helped win the referendum, and who now hopes to become prime minister, wonders what to do next. In the Brexit void, the Boris bust gains momentum Here\u2019s a flavour: Boris Johnson\u2019s Vote Leave lieutenants blame their vanquished foes for the absence of a plan. It sounds like a joke, because it is a sick joke. Officials in government cannot plan what to do next until they have a policy to follow. That is how Britain works, Mr Johnson. Officials advise, politicians decide. The man who hopes to head the government within weeks has not decided his policy for leaving the EU. He is even less prepared to enter Number 10 than Gordon Brown was. Of course, we all know why Mr Johnson has not stated what sort of Brexit he favours because any choice he makes will be a betrayal. He could choose to retain membership of the European single market, keeping Britain a member of the European Economic Area while ditching its EU membership. That would betray those with legitimate concerns about immigration, and the xenophobes. He could prioritise the strict control of movement of people. That would betray his beloved London and the young. Or he could dither and betray the whole country as it sinks into recession. The time has passed when you can be all things to all people, Mr Johnson. To govern is to choose and your choice is who you betray... More here: US shares are expected to rise when Wall Street opens, in an hour\u2019s time. It\u2019s being called the \u2018Brelief rally\u2019 -- but investors should remember to be cautious, given these warnings of a UK recession.... Could another European Union member \u2018do a Britain\u2019 and hold a referendum? Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at Eurasia Group, reckons not - even though Brexit has given populist parties a lift (Marine Le Pen was particularly chuffed yesterday). He\u2019s produced a map, showing where the EU will be a hot topic. Rahman writes: Despite the noise, we don\u2019t believe there is an immediate risk of a \u2018copy-cat\u2019 referendum taking place in another EU member on the heels of the UK vote. Even if we are wrong, it would very unlikely pass. But in a handful of countries, populist Eurosceptic parties have gained sufficient momentum to ensure EU membership and referenda will be a prominent feature of the domestic political debate, particularly around elections (France, Denmark and Italy). Directly or indirectly, this will influence government policy. Only in the Netherlands and Austria is there a concrete risk of referenda over EU or euro membership, though even in these states, we view it as something of a remote possibility. But... We would change our mind if there was a major escalation of migrant inflows and/or a major new economic downturn affecting sovereign debt markets to the point it triggers the need for more bailouts. JP Morgan have also issued an interesting note on Brexit. It predicts that David Cameron\u2019s successor will ask MPs to vote on whether to Trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and implement the result of last week\u2019s referendum. They also expect that Britain will struggle to get many concessions out of the EU during the negotiations, and will end up with \u2018curtailed\u2019 access to Europe\u2019s markets. The note (which Ed Conway has tweet) also predicts that Scotland will break away from the UK, and implement a \u2018new currency\u2019 Here are a couple of charts from Fitch\u2019s latest report on Brexit: Fitch, the rating agency, has issued another dire warning about the impact of the EU referendum on the UK economy. In a new report, Fitch predicts a \u201clarge investment shock\u201d, as businesses struggle with the implications of the Brexit vote. Fitch warn: Businesses are facing a surge in uncertainty on three separate fronts - the future of the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU, the shape of the regulatory framework, and domestic political uncertainty, including the future status of Scotland. This uncertainty will prompt firms to delay investment and hiring decisions, while elevated financial market volatility will further damage business confidence. And this means that the UK economy will be much weaker than expected. Here\u2019s the key points: We expect investment to fall by 5% in 2017 and by 2018 for it to be 15% lower than previously expected in Fitch\u2019s May 2016 Global Economic Outlook (GEO). Overall spending by UK residents will see a mild decline in 2017. The sharp fall in the value of sterling will provide some offset to the demand shock, with exports likely to benefit somewhat in the near term. Imports look likely to decline as investment contracts and foreign products become more expensive, resulting in expenditure switching to domestically produced goods and services and higher inflation. UK GDP growth is expected to fall to around 1% in both 2017 and 2018. This is a downward revision of 1 percentage point in each year from the May 2016 GEO. Fitch point out that the long-term effects are harder to predict, partly because no-one knows what relationship the UK will have with the European Union. But they don\u2019t expect much of a Brexit dividend: In addition to less favourable access to the European Single Market, reductions in trade openness and inward foreign direct investment could harm productivity performance, while reduced immigration would slow labour supply and potential GDP. These negatives will likely outweigh any GDP gains from deregulation outside the EU or the redirection of EU budget transfers. They also predict that the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 25 basis points (from 0.5% to 0.25%) later this year, while the Federal Reserve will resist raising borrowing costs until the end of this year. The BoE\u2019s reaction to Brexit is quite hard to call -- do they slash rates to fight the recession, or hike them to bolster the pound? The Economist Intelligence Unit are also predicting that Britain will slide into recession next year. Goldman Sachs have also responded to the report that it has \u2018pre-rented\u2019 office space in Frankfurt: \u201cWe have not made any changes to our real estate requirements in Frankfurt as a result of the referendum result. As we have already communicated to our employees, there is no immediate change to the way we conduct our business or where we conduct our business.\u201d Britain\u2019s economy will fall into recession next year, according to Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics: Morgan Stanley has denied that it has rented office space in the German financial capital (as bankers heard this morning). A spokesman tells us: \u201cMorgan Stanley does not have pre-let office space in Frankfurt, or anywhere else.\u201d Economic confidence across the eurozone has taken a dip, even before the UK\u2019s referendum result. The eurozone\u2019s headline economic sentiment measure has fallen to 104.4 in June, from 104.6 in May. That may suggest that growth is slowing; bad news for a region facing months of uncertainty. Atradius, which provides credit insurance, has predicted that the Brexit vote will wipe out some businesses. In a new report, it predicts: Insolvencies are expected to rise in the short-term, especially in Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, due to close trade and investment ties. Insolvencies in the UK predicted to increase by 4% Insolvencies also forecast to rise 3.5% in Ireland, 2.5% in Belgium and 2% in Netherlands Corporates operating in the transport equipment, food, textiles, electrical equipment and chemicals sectors are most exposed due to close trade linkages. Brexit could trim 1% to 3% off UK GDP by 2018 Uncertainly will persist in coming years which will continue to be reflected in financial markets and business sentiment. Borrowing would become more expensive for UK firms. European countries will feel short and long-term economic impacts The Brexit crisis is looming over UK bankers as they gathers for a conference in London. City minister Harriet Baldwin told the British Banking Association\u2019s event that London\u2019s financial sector will survive: But Justin Bisseker, analyst at Schroders, has predicted that the UK economy will suffer badly from Brexit. Katherine Griffiths, banking editor at The Times, flags up that some investment banks have already made exit plans: Analysts at Credit Suisse are speculating that last week\u2019s vote may not be the end of the matter.... Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says today\u2019s rally is a surprise \u2013 some in the City had expected heavy losses after the Brexit vote. A disconnect is appearing between the pessimistic mood that is permeating the media and the insatiable optimism that seems to be driving yet another day of gains in the FTSE100. For many, the widespread selling that dominated the financial markets in the immediate wake of Friday\u2019s referendum result was expected to persist, providing one of the deepest corrections for years. It appears that investors are eagerly buying shares because they don\u2019t expect Britain to trigger Article 50 soon. Mahoney adds: However, there is a confidence within the City that perhaps the implications to this vote may not be as immediate nor far reaching as many initially thought, providing opportunities for bargain hunters to grab shares at a discount. EU leaders will chivy Britain along to do the deed, but they may have to wait until a new prime minister is installed. Shares in London are climbing steadily this morning. The FTSE index has now gained 120 points, or almost 2%, to 6260. That\u2019s only 78-points shy of its closing level last Thursday, when the City expected the Remain campaign to win. Housebuilding firms are up, with Persimmon gaining 5% and Barratt Development up 3.5%. Financial stocks are also rallying; Prudential has jumped 5%, while Barclays is 3% higher. However, both sectors are still *sharply* lower than last week.... The FTSE 250 index, which includes smaller UK companies, has risen by 1.5%. Shawbrook, a new \u2018challenger bank\u2019 which tumbled yesterday after admitting making some loans that it shouldn\u2019t, are up 23%. So, is the Brexit wobble over? Not according to Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, who says: \u201cStocks and the pound are continuing to firm but the post-Brexit reality will bite sooner or later. What we\u2019re seeing in the FTSE is hope in Britain being able to ride it out by remaining part of the single market. This looks like wishful thinking. The line from the chief leavers seems to be that Britain can have its cake and eat it by maintaining access to the common market without the free movement of people. Unfortunately this looks like an impossible circle to square as the EU is not prepared to offer this kind of special relationship - Switzerland risks wrecking its bilateral trade deals with the EU if it implements a binding 2014 referendum blocking free movement. Greene King, the pub chain, has warned that consumer spending will probably suffer as Britain falls deeper into Brexit uncertainty. CEO Rooney Anand has told the City that: \u201cThe increasingly uncertain trading environment is likely to weigh on consumer sentiment in the near term.\u201d On the upside, Greene King might benefit from Remain voters drowning their sorrows... Just in: British consumer credit has expanded at the fastest annual pace since 2005 in May, in the run-up to last week\u2019s referendum. Also, lenders approved more mortgages than expected, in another sign that consumers had remained pretty confident - before the Brexit bombshell landed. That\u2019s according to new Bank of England data, which shows: Mortgage approvals for house purchases numbered 67,042 in May, up from 66,205 in April. Consumer credit rose 9.9 percent compared with a year ago, the biggest annual increase since November 2005 and up from 9.6 percent in April. Telegraph business editor Ben Wright explains why Brexit could be such bad news for the City, and thus the rest of the UK: The recent stabilisation in the value of the pound is unlikely to last, warns currency expert Jane Foley of Rabobank. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, she warns that the current Brexit uncertainty is bad for investment and bad for UK businesses, and thus not great news for the national currency. \u201cWe have political uncertainty and probably recession - that isn\u2019t something that sterling should celebrate.... Sterling faces a huge amount of volatility, and we possibly haven\u2019t seen the lows yet.\u201d On Monday, the pound hit a 31-year low around $1.312, and is now hovering around $1.34. Finland\u2019s former finance minister, Alex Stubb, has experienced plenty of European rough-and-tumble . He reckons Brexit is currently in the \u2018chaos\u2019 phase, but will eventually move forwards... But how many crises can Europe handle, asks Aengus Collins of the Economist Intelligence Unit.... Mario Monti, the former European commissioner (and one-time technocratic Italian PM), has warned the UK it can\u2019t get access to the single market without accepting the free movement of people: Our Politics liveblog is tracking the fallout from last night\u2019s EU summit meeting, and the race to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. They\u2019re also following Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to not become Labour\u2019s next former leader, after losing a vote of confidence last night. The UK car industry is hoping that Britain retains access to the European single market. A new report shows that the industry enjoyed a record year, partly due to the ability to sell vehicles without tariffs across the EU. Life is continuing in Brussels without the UK today, as the other 27 leaders sit down sans Cameron. It\u2019s unclear whether today\u2019s rally is a dead-cat bounce or a genuine recovery, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, a City trading firm. European stock markets are a sea of green this morning, as shares rally across the continent: In the City. shares are rallying at the start of trading, as we predicted. In London, the FTSE 100 index has jumped by 110 points, or 1.8%, to 6251. That means the blue-chip index is only 100 points below its level on Thursday night, before the EU referendum polls closed. Banks and mining companies are among the top risers, as investors regain some optimism after last week\u2019s Brexit shock. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: London\u2019s FTSE-100 is once again surging higher in early trade, as the air of panic that gripped global markets in the wake of that Brexit vote continues to ebb. UK house price inflation has picked up this month, according to Nationwide. It reports that prices rose 0.2% between June and May, raising the average property price to \u00a3204,968. That means prices were 5.1% higher than a year ago. However, we\u2019ll have to wait a few months to discover what the Brexit vote means for prices. As Jonathan Hopper, managing director of the buying agents Garrington Property Finders, puts it: \u201cNationwide\u2019s June data gives a snapshot of the housing market immediately before the Brexit referendum. \u201cIt shows a functioning market with decent price growth but limited supply \u2013 a languid calm before the storm. \u201cUnfortunately this data is about as much use in predicting the future course of the property market as sun-dappled photos of the summer of 1914. It\u2019s a historical record of a lost age before Europe changed forever. Japan\u2019s prime minister has urged his central bank to ensure ample funds are available to help Japanese companies ride out the Brexit shock. Shinzo Abe told the Bank of Japan that it must do everything in its power to prevent any credit squeeze, as: \u201cA sense of uncertainty and worry about risks remain in the markets.\u201d Many Japanese companies have operations in the UK, such as carmaker Nissan, which runs Britain\u2019s largest car factory in Sunderland. A majority of voters in Sunderland put their cross in the \u2018Leave the EU\u2019 box last week, and some are now wondering about the consequences.... The pound is also looking quite stable this morning, hovering around the $1.335 mark in early London trading. But Nordea analyst Aurelija Augulyte reckons sterling is poised to move sharply soon, either higher or lower. Good morning. Global stock markets are shaking off the worst of the Brexit panic today, despite massive uncertainty over the UK\u2019s political and economic future. Yesterday\u2019s rally, which saw the FTSE 100 jump 2.6%, is likely to continue this morning. City firm IG are predicting another 1% jump, which would take the blue-chip index close to its levels before referendum day. Asian markets have already rallied overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei closing 1.5% higher. It\u2019s a curious rally, given Britain is wallowing in an unprecedented political crisis. Conservatives MPs are racing to find a new leader, while their Labour counterparts are trying the damnest to ditch their current one. Oh, and we also need a new football manager. But investors may be relieved that the financial world hasn\u2019t descended into mass panic over the last five days. They may also be hoping that central bankers will do whatever it takes to prevent chaos breaking out. So, an odd limbo has set in, since it became clear that Britain wouldn\u2019t immediately trigger Brexit by activating Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Meanwhile, UK companies are still chewing through the implications of the Brexit vote - which could be very severe if Britain loses access to the single markets. Last night, European leaders held a farewell dinner with David Cameron, where the UK PM blamed unrestricted migration for his failure to win last week\u2019s vote. They\u2019ll be meeting again this morning to discuss the way ahead; Cameron, though, has headed home....

      "bodyText": "Trinity Mirror has started a round of targeted cuts of editorial staff as the owner of the Daily Mirror faces up to a tough market for publishers. The company has seen its share price slump by more than 40% over the last six months - and 20% since the Brexit vote - with investors taking fright at the tough outlook for publishers relying on advertising income. An email to staff on Wednesday said that a consultation has been launched with staff about the proposed job cuts with the exact number still to be finalised. The email from Lloyd Embley, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, said the company would endeavour to keep the job losses to a \u201cminimum\u201d. It is thought that the number set to go may be as low as about 15, although this is unconfirmed and a final figure has yet to be set. Staff on the flagship titles have been concerned about job cuts to cover the up to \u00a36m/\u00a37m cost of the failed New Day, the short-lived national newspaper launched and closed within months by Trinity Mirror earlier this year. However, Trinity Mirror insists the latest cuts have nothing to do with the closure of the New Day, nor the collapse in the company\u2019s share price. A spokesperson said: \u201cLike all media companies, it is essential that we adapt to the changing industry and ensure we continue to operate efficiently and control costs. \u201cAn unfortunate but necessary part of this work is identifying savings in editorial budgets, which will include some redundancies at the Mirror.

Brian started Countryside Hire in Hertfordshire in the mid-1960s with a secondhand Commer van, building up a fleet of more than 600 vehicles over 25 years. Innovative in putting customer service and employees first \u2013 in a sector that generally had a poor reputation for both \u2013 he not only prospered, but became a popular figure in the vehicle rental industry. This was partly due to his annual \u201cIdes of March lunch\u201d, which sought to bring his competitors together to talk about industry matters rather than stab each other in the back. Once the business was booming, Brian and his young family moved, in 1971, to Easton Lodge, near Great Dunmow in Essex \u2013 formerly the seat of the Countess of Warwick. Part of one wing of the house was all that remained after fires and demolition, and over 30 years Brian brought the house up to scratch. But it was in the grounds of the building that he had the biggest impact. Using reclaimed materials and carrying out most of the manual labour himself, he almost singlehandedly restored the gardens that had lain undisturbed and forgotten for three decades. In the 1990s he acquired a further 4.5 acres of the original gardens and permission to restore another 23 acres adjoining the house. With the help of volunteers and funds raised by opening the gardens to the public, the remaining grounds were restored to a state that retained their \u201cforgotten\u201d feel but made them more orderly and attractive. Brian was born to Mary (nee Leslie) and Gaylor in Knebworth, Hertfordshire, and from Alleyne\u2019s grammar school in Stevenage went to Bishop\u2019s Stortford college, where he picked up his love of gardening from joining the college\u2019s alpine rock garden society. He was a good long-distance runner who also played rugby for Welwyn Garden City.Following national service in the Royal Artillery at Oswestry, and then returned to Knebworth to work in the family\u2019s motor dealership business, HG Creasey &amp; Sons. When business conditions got tough and the firm was in effect dissolved, Brian set out on his own with Countryside Hire. In 1990 he sold the business to the French company VIA for \u00a31.76m, and after a short handover period stopped working to concentrate on Easton Lodge, which was his true love. He retired from running the gardens in 2008, later moving to Somerset as his health declined. Although Easton Lodge is now in new ownership, a charitable trust oversees the gardens, parts of which are still open to the public. Brian is survived by his wife, Diana (nee Ramsey), whom he married in 1958, by four children, Simon, Anne-Louise, me and Philip, and by nine grandchildren.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British consumers borrowed more than expected in May to buy homes and fund other purchases in a sign of confidence before last week\u2019s shock decision to leave the EU. The amount of credit extended to borrowers, which includes credit cards, personal loans and overdrafts, rose by 9.9% compared with a year earlier. This was the fastest annual rate in more than a decade and up from 9.6% in April. Over the month consumer credit rose by about \u00a3200m to \u00a31.5bn in May. UK lenders approved 67,042 mortgages for house purchase last month, up from 66,205 in April, according to figures published by the Bank of England. Economists had forecast a drop in approvals to 65,250. The figures suggest the appetite among British consumers for borrowing money \u2013 and the willingness of banks to lend \u2013 was strong as the 23 June referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU drew closer. Economists warned, however, that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU would weigh on lending in the coming months amid uncertainty over the country\u2019s economic and political future. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cIt is very possible that heightened uncertainty and concerns following the Brexit vote will markedly rein in consumers\u2019 willingness to borrow. Banks may also become more wary about unsecured lending to households.\u201d The Bank of England data showed net borrowing on credit cards rose by \u00a3418m over the month in May, and outstanding debt on cards is now \u00a31.3bn more than at the beginning of 2016. Consumers\u2019 appetite for borrowing on plastic has picked up markedly since the months after the financial crisis, when borrowing slumped and on some occasions repayments outstripped new debt. The figures, published exactly 50 years after the first credit card was issued in the UK, are likely to concern debt charities. Mike O\u2019Connor, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: \u201cAlthough credit cards can be a cost-effective way to borrow, for many people they have become very expensive, long-term debts.\u201d He added: \u201cThe average credit card debt we see is now at \u00a38,403, about half our clients\u2019 average annual take-home pay, and there is a clear need for change.\u201d Despite the rise in May, mortgage approvals were still at their second lowest level since May 2015. Approvals were above 70,000 in every month during the first quarter, partly as buyers rushed through purchases to beat a rise in stamp duty from April on buy-to-let properties and second homes. In the weeks leading up to the referendum the International Monetary Fund warned that a vote to leave the EU could trigger a UK housing market crash. Housebuilders suffered sharp falls in their share prices after the decision to leave was announced on Friday, with fears that a broader economic slowdown and loss of consumer confidence would weigh on the market. Archer said: \u201cHousing market activity and prices now look to be at very serious risk of an extended, marked downturn following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. \u201cWe suspect that house prices could fall by 5% over the second half of 2016 and there could well be another 5-7% drop in 2017.\u201d Lending to UK business outside the financial sector rebounded sharply in May, increasing by \u00a32.8bn compared with a \u00a3176m drop in April. However, fears are mounting that investment by companies will start to slow in the coming months, as businesses delay spending amid heightened economic uncertainty. Fitch said on Wednesday that the UK would see a \u201clarge investment shock post-Brexit\u201d. The ratings agency forecast a 5% drop in investment in 2017 and said that by 2018, investment would be 15% lower than it was previously expecting.",

      "bodyText": "Greene King has warned that consumer spending is likely to suffer following Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Rooney Anand, the chief executive of the pubs group, said less was spent in the run-up to the referendum and that he thought this trend would continue. The UK\u2019s exit would need time to be implemented and the resulting uncertainty was likely to hold back the economy as a whole, he added. \u201cThe increasingly uncertain trading environment is likely to weigh on consumer sentiment in the near term,\u201d Anand said. \u201cWe will not be immune from its effects, but our business has shown resilience in the past.\u201d The comments came as Greene King announced a 61% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3189.8m for the year to 1 May, with revenues reaching \u00a32.1bn for the first time. The company\u2019s integration of rival firm Spirit, recently acquired for \u00a3774m, has been successful. Like-for-like sales increased by 1.5%, beating the market, which was up by 1.3%. Anand said Greene King, which brews ales including Old Speckled Hen and Belhaven Best, had limited exposure to European sales, although it would be affected by the weaker pound through overseas sourcing. \u201cWe will look to mitigate the impact of this as far as possible,\u201d he said The referendum aside, Anand said eating and drinking out in the UK remained a \u201cdynamic market with intense competition for every pound in the consumer pocket\u201d. The pubs group is competing with supermarkets and takeaway outlets, which have made staying in more attractive. Greene King, founded in 1799 and based in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, employs 44,000 people across 3,035 pubs, restaurants and hotels, and at its breweries in Bury and Dunbar. England football fans drowned their sorrows at home after the country crashed out of Euro 2016 on Monday. This was bad news for pubs, but proved a boon for convenience stores as customers headed to the shops to stock up on alcohol following the defeat to Iceland. Alcohol sales at convenience stores rose by 23% between 10pm and midnight, compared with the June 2015 average, according to data from EposNow.com.",

      "bodyText": "Growth in UK house prices picked up in June, but agents and analysts are warning that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU will affect demand and prices in the coming months. The average price of a property rose by 5.1% from a year ago to \u00a3204,968, according to Nationwide building society (pdf). This compares with an annual growth rate of 4.7% in May. It has been fairly stable over the past 12 months at between 3% and 6%. The data gives a snapshot of the housing market immediately before the EU referendum. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cFollowing the referendum, demand likely will weaken as unemployment begins to edge up and confidence falls. Meanwhile, banks soon will reflect the recent increase in funding costs in their mortgage rates. Prices in London look particularly vulnerable, given that job insecurity has increased in the City and banks will be thinking twice about high loan-to-income lending.\u201d Foxtons, the London-focused estate agent, issued a profit warning this week. It believes the vote to leave the EU will limit property sales in the capital for the rest of the year. Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of buying agents Garrington Property Finders, said the brisk pace in June was likely to be the high water mark for the property market for some time. The data showed a \u201cfunctioning market with decent price growth but limited supply \u2013 a languid calm before the storm\u201d, he added. \u201cUnfortunately this data is about as much use in predicting the future course of the property market as sun-dappled photos of the summer of 1914. It\u2019s a historical record of a lost age before Europe changed for ever. The referendum result has since plunged the property market into a \u2018hard reset\u2019, especially in the higher price brackets,\u201d Hopper said. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t be sure how much things will slow, it\u2019s inevitable that more nervous investors will sit on their hands while the opportunists circle. Prime central London, where most property purchases are discretionary, is the most exposed to such confidence-sapping doubts.\u201d Hopper, along with some analysts, expects a soft landing rather than a housing crash. Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said it was too hard to predict what would happen in London, where increased uncertainty after the vote to leave the EU could put buyers off, while the sharp drop in the pound would attract overseas investors, leading to a \u201cBrexit bubble\u201d. Charlie Campbell, an analyst at Liberum Capital, said: \u201cLondon might be more resilient than we all first thought.\u201d Gardner noted that landlords and overseas buyers play a larger role in the capital than elsewhere, and that recent stamp duty changes and forthcoming alterations to the tax deductibility of landlords\u2019 expenses would affect investor demand. Turning to the UK as a whole, he said: \u201cEven if demand does soften a little, there\u2019s going to be underlying demand. There are so few properties on the market.\u201d Data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggests stock on estate agents\u2019 books is nearly at the lowest level in 30 years, as construction of new homes has been slow, unable to keep up with demand. The area around London again had the strongest rate of annual price growth of 12.4% in the second quarter, up from 12.2% in the first quarter. Despite a slowdown, London was still the second strongest region, with prices rising by 9.9% to an all-time high of \u00a3472,384 \u2013 54% above pre-financial crisis levels. Northern England was the only area where house prices fell in the second quarter, replacing Northern Ireland as the UK\u2019s least expensive region. Prices in the north of England are now 9% below their pre-crisis peak. Following the surge in house buying in March before the introduction of stamp duty on second homes, Gardner said, it would be hard to assess \u201chow much of the likely fallback in transactions in the quarters ahead is because buyers brought forward purchases to avoid additional stamp duty liabilities, and how much is due to increased economic uncertainty following the referendum result. Gauging the likely impact on house prices will be even more difficult\u201d.",

Merlin Entertainments, operator of Alton Towers and Legoland, is 2.6% higher at 425.8p after analysts at JP Morgan moved from underweight to neutral and raised their price target to 464p. The bank said: We forecast a full year 2015 to 2018 estimated earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 17.4% (but only 9.3% adjusting for the Alton Towers base effect). This is driven by4.3% like for like sales growth and 7 new Midway sites per year, as well as Legoland Japan and Legoland Korea (due to open by 2018) and accommodation rollout across the estate. Merlin\u2019s 2017 estimated valuation has come down to 16 times/4.7% free cashflow yield, compared to European hotel stocks on 14.9 times/2.3% and Whitbread on 13 times / -1.5%. If Merlin were to accelerate the Midway rollout, open a new owned/leased Legoland or conduct further bolt-on M&amp;A, there could be upside to our forecasts. But this looks unlikely, in our view, before our 2017 estimated \u201cpeak\u201d capex forecast of \u00a3271m (17% of sales, 1.9 times depreciation) But tourism-related shares have fallen after the attacks at Istanbul airport, with Tui down 33p at 845p and British Airways owner International Airlines Group 10.9p lower at 346.3p. Dixons Carphone is down 9.5p at 332.5p on uncertainty on the outlook post-Brexit despite a 17% rise in full year profits. Among the mid-caps Electrocomponents has fallen 13.4p to 247.8p after Credit Suisse cut from neutral to underperform with a 220p target price, down from 265p. It said: Following the UK referendum result and Datwyler\u2019s acquisition of Premier Farnell we re-visit our estimates for organic growth and margin improvement. With Credit Suisse economists forecasting a shallow recession in the UK in the second half of 2016 and a Euro area slowdown we moderate our organic growth forecasts which now average 2.1% across 2017 to 2021 (from 2.9%). The foreign exchange movements which have followed the Brexit vote provide revenue benefits, however as a net buyer of dollar denominated COGS [cost of goods sold], Electrocomponents are exposed at the gross margin level by a weakening in the pound. Consolidation in the market place not involving Electrocomponents was highlighted as a risk to our recommendation in our April 2016 note and following Datwyler\u2019s 165p cash offer for Premier Farnell we believe Electrocomponents is likely to experience incremental competitive pricing pressures, especially in Europe where operations overlap. We reduce our EBITA estimates by around 60 basis points per annum across the forecast period with the gross profit margin decreasing from prior estimated by 90 basis points to 2021. The company continues to execute well its business improvement strategy, increasing the growth of own label products and over-delivering against cost reduction targets. However, the stock currently trades at a 50% premium to its 2009 two year forward PE multiple and whilst we are not forecasting a global recession and recognise current management\u2019s positive impact, in our view there is room for a pronounced de-rating. Elsewhere technology group Qinetiq is down 9.7p to 213.4p after a downgrade from JP Morgan and news that finance director David Mellors was stepping down at the end of December to join Cobham, up 6.3p at 156.7p. Distribution group Brammer has slumped 54% to 65.75p after warning half year profits would be below expectations at around \u00a35m and said it would be close to its net debt/earnings bank covenant at the end of the period.",
