      "bodyText": "The TUC has called for a government crackdown on abuses of gig economy workers after revealing that almost half of self-employed adults aged 25 or over were earning less than the minimum wage. In a new report, the TUC said that \u2013 despite Theresa May pledging to help struggling families \u2013 wages for those working for themselves were far lower than for employees and had actually fallen in the latest year. Of the four million adults over 25 classified as self-employed, 49% (1.96 million) were earning less than the current minimum wage, the TUC said. Self-employment has risen from 12% to 15% of workers since 2001, with a particularly marked increase in the years after the financial crisis of a decade ago. Including the under 25s, the Office for National Statistics says the total stands at 4.8 million. The TUC said the self-employed aged 25 and over earned \u00a312,300 on average in 2016-17, down from \u00a313,200 the previous year, and well below the average of \u00a321,600 for employees and self-employed combined. Ministers have lauded the 2.5m increase in jobs since 2010 and the decline in the unemployment rate to a 43-year-low of 40% as examples of Britain\u2019s flexible labour market. However, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cSelf-employment can be a great option but it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not working for everyone, with millions of self-employed workers stuck on poverty pay. \u201cToo many workers have been forced into sham self-employment \u2013 like at Uber and Herm\u00e8s. It\u2019s not about helping workers. \u201cTheresa May promised to change things for \u2018just about managing\u2019 families but she\u2019s done nothing. She should be cracking down on businesses that use sham self-employment. She should ban zero-hours contracts. And she should give agency workers the right to equal pay to stop undercutting and encourage employers to create more permanent jobs.\u201d The TUC believes the growth in self-employment has been caused in part by an increase in sham forms of employment, where workers who would once have counted as part of a company\u2019s payroll are treated as self-employed to reduce tax liability, duck the minimum wage and deny workers their rights. It added that bogus self-employment included some gig economy workers and people who were contracted to a single employer through a personal service company, rather than being contracted as an employee. \u201cThe two million people in low-paid self-employment are part of at least 3.7 million people in insecure jobs. The other 1.7 million include agency workers, casual workers, seasonal workers and those whose main job is on a zero-hours contract,\u201d the TUC said. The government commissioned a report into modern employment practices from Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, which was published a year ago. The report called for gig economy workers to be given greater protection and benefits but the TUC said the government has failed to take action to tackle insecure employment.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s another question about John McDonnell\u2019s whizzy \u201cinclusive ownership funds\u201d, or IOFs. What happens when companies get taken over? Sky is about to be bought by Comcast for \u00a330bn in cash, so a workers\u2019 fund, if it held the eventual 10% stake that the shadow chancellor intends, in theory would be entitled to \u00a33bn. Divvy up the sum among the 30,000 Sky staff and it comes to \u00a3100,000 a head, which would be a supremely generous gift to the Murdoch toilers from a socialist chancellor. Would employees see the money in practice? If McDonnell has developed rules to deal with takeover situations, he\u2019s yet to share them. As with the \u00a3500-per-worker cap on annual dividends, one can only speculate that his Treasury would demand the lion\u2019s share when the pots of money become huge. Or perhaps, since only income from dividends has been mentioned to date, employees would be denied takeover windfalls altogether. In that case, they would never really have owned the shares in the first place, either individually or collectively. Definitive details of McDonnell\u2019s proposal are promised in time. Let\u2019s hope so, because the workers themselves would surely want to know if they would be quids in when acquisitions happen. Put another way, the IOF idea has not been thought through in detail. Best to get a more credible version on the table sharpish, which means a plan that does not dilute pension funds\u2019 investments and is not seen as a tax grab. Employee share ownership is fertile ground for a popular policy, as McDonnell has correctly identified, and the Tories will surely be working on a rival scheme. Even amid their Brexit shambles, they will not find it hard to find a proposal that is more financially coherent. Hargreaves must shout louder about Unilever technicalities \u201cOur aim is to give you all the tools, information and support you need to venture into the world of investing,\u201d says the blurb on Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s website. Customers who hold shares in Unilever via the investment platform may beg to differ. Hargreaves\u2019 email to Unilever shareholders, before the big \u201cgo Dutch\u201d vote next month, omitted a crucial piece of information \u2013 the fact that, for their vote to count in the possibly crucial \u201cmajority in number\u201d tally, private shareholders need to get their shares registered in certified form, in the jargon. The \u201cmajority in number\u201d test, remember, is the poll in which each shareholder gets one vote, whether they own 100 shares or 100,000. It is different from the conventional vote that counts the pure numbers of shares. The certification problem is this: the 20,000 people who hold Unilever shares via Hargreaves fall under nominee arrangements. For the \u201cmajority in number\u201d poll, they will be pooled within Hargreaves Nominees Ltd, which gets only one vote. But it\u2019s easy to remove oneself from the pool by asking for a certified shareholding, albeit Hargreaves will charge a fee. So you would think Hargreaves would shout loudly about this important technical detail. After all, it\u2019s supposed to be a champion of private investors and the Unilever vote is rare chance for small shareholders to make a difference. But the platform did not mention the voting wrinkle in its email. It just advertised its normal pooled voting service, which is ideal most of the time \u2013 just not on this occasion. Hargreaves agrees it failed to be explicit. For customers who feel aggrieved, it suggests buying a single certified share to get full bang for voting buck. That is good advice that should have been given earlier and explicitly. Ashley goes Day-Glo route You can see some shocking pictures on the Daily Star website. For example, there\u2019s evidence that at least some House of Fraser stores are now selling Sports Direct products \u2013 Lee Cooper belts, Adidas tracksuits and so on \u2013 complete with ugly Sports Direct Day-Glo stickers. Mike Ashley, after Sports Direct\u2019s purchase of HoF out of administration, can run the business as he wishes, of course. One suspects shifting a lot of stock quickly was always part of his strategic plan as Christmas approaches. And those loyal HoF customers who pine for the pre-takeover \u201cluxurious\u201d image may recall that the old regime was not averse to holding a vulgar sale or two. But Ashley\u2019s tactics suggest his vision for HoF to become \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d is not going to be realised quickly. Nobody, surely, expected it to be.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda could be forced to offload more than 460 stores to satisfy the competition watchdog before a planned merger. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found a \u201crealistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition\u201d in 463 places in the UK where local supermarkets\u2019 catchment areas overlapped. The CMA announced last week that it had referred Sainsbury\u2019s plan to buy Asda to a more in-depth \u201cphase two\u201d investigation, but a 21-page ruling published on Thursday gives the full detail behind that decision. The watchdog said its initial investigation indicated overlap within the supply or acquisition of groceries, fuel and homewares. It said the two grocers would account for just over 30% of the groceries sold by the top nine UK supermarket chains and, alongside the market leader Tesco, would control a total of 60%. While the number of stores that Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda may have to offload to complete the deal is high \u2013 equivalent to nearly 40% of the combined group\u2019s 1,210 supermarkets \u2013 analysts expect the final number of stores that need to be offloaded could be significantly lower. Concerns were raised about 369 areas in the CMA\u2019s initial investigation into Tesco\u2019s merger with Booker, and about 92 stores when Poundland bought rival 99p Stores, but ultimately the watchdog did not require any sales to satisfy competition concerns. Patrick O\u2019Brien, at analysts GlobalData said the second phase of the CMA investigation would apply a more complex analysis technique that would weight the impact of competitors by their geographic distance and how closely they compete for the same kind of shop \u2013 a quick dash for pint of milk and a loaf, say, compared to a monthly family stock up. But O\u2019Brien said a key factor affecting the outcome for Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda would be the CMA\u2019s decision on whether to consider Aldi and Lidl stores, which are generally under 1,400sq m in size, as direct competitors to larger Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda outlets. \u201cWhether the merger goes ahead is dependent on the number of disposals the CMA demands being palatable to the merging parties,\u201d he said. The CMA\u2019s initial analysis of the effect of the \u00a310bn merger of the UK\u2019s second and third-largest supermarkets only took into account potential overlap between the two chains\u2019 medium-sized and largest stores, and those of their four traditional rivals. It did not consider potential competition from convenience stores or Aldi and Lidl. The CMA said that while competition from the two discounters had been considered in recent cases, such as Tesco\u2019s merger with the convenience store supplier Booker, those investigations had largely been concerned with convenience stores. It said that their competitive position against medium and large-sized stores, which make up the bulk of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda\u2019s businesses, had not been previously considered in detail and so this would be a matter for the phase two investigation. A spokesperson for Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda said: \u201cWe welcome the start of the phase two process. The grocery market has changed significantly in the last decade and is more competitive than ever, with the rise of discount formats, online grocery and food delivery businesses. \u201cWe look forward to working with the CMA on the phase two inquiry, where we expect it to conduct a full review of the market and take these changed market dynamics into consideration. \u201cCustomers will be the big winners from this combination.\u201d But Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said he thought the CMA\u2019s statement indicated it was less well disposed towards the merger than previously thought. \u201cSticking to the view there\u2019s a very good chance they won\u2019t get approval, you have to ask: where is Sainsbury\u2019s left? It\u2019s losing market share to discounters and has no credible plan except this merger. All Sainsbury\u2019s eggs are in one basket, but it\u2019s being taken to the checkout by the CMA.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market has stepped up its efforts to crack down on union activity among employees \u2013 instructing managers to watch out for warning signs of union activity and to tell possible union members that joining a union is a \u201croll of the dice\u201d. Following a mass email sent out on 6 September by Whole Foods employees seeking to coordinate with one another to discuss workplace issues and the prospect of forming a union, Amazon released training videos for managers in an attempt to head off union efforts. The Guardian obtained Amazon training videos first reported by Gizmodo that were recently sent out to Whole Foods store management and team leaders (department managers), coaching them on how to union bust within their stores. \u201cBargaining is a roll of the dice. Things could get better for associates, but they could get worse or stay exactly the same,\u201d said one cartoon character in the training video. In another segment, the narrator noted a character could have blamed General Motors\u2019 bankruptcy as a symptom of labor unions. \u201cHaving a union could make it hard to stay competitive,\u201d another character in a video segment said. \u201cThey don\u2019t share our same values.\u201d During the same segment, the character cited that the majority of political donations from unions go to Democrats, and the narrator reaffirmed this characterization. \u201cA union severs the direct working relationship between associates and managers we value so highly,\u201d the narrator added. One training video segment includes teaching managers how to find \u201cwarning signs\u201d of unionization efforts, which included any employees who stick around after their shift has ended. Warning signs also included looking out for \u201cunion words\u201d such as a \u201cliving wage\u201d. The training videos provide managers with tips and information on how to navigate around labor laws to prevent unionization efforts and how to express criticism toward union efforts without committing an unfair labor practice. \u201cAvoid absolutes, speak in possibilities instead,\u201d advised the narrator. In one example cited in the video, the narrator said: \u201cYou would never threaten to close your building just because associates joined a union. But you might need to talk about how having a union could hurt innovation which could hurt customer obsession which could ultimately threaten the building\u2019s continued existence.\u201d Over the past few weeks since the Whole Worker Community first announced its existence and sent a mass recruiting email to stores around the country, several Whole Foods employees have reported managers and team leaders being sent into training meetings on labor unions. \u201cThey told us how as team leaders we are expected to toe the company line and be anti-union,\u201d one Whole Foods employee who recently attended one of the meetings told the Guardian. \u201cAs team leaders we have been told that we are expected to support the company\u2019s anti-union stance and that unions were good at the turn of the century, but aren\u2019t necessary any more because the government has labor laws.\u201d Other Whole Foods workers claimed their management wasn\u2019t forthright about the meetings focusing on unions. \u201cI peeked into the store conference room and there was some slide up titled \u2018WFM and Unions\u2019, and I asked several team leaders about it afterwards who all declined to comment or made something up about it being about the new signage stuff,\u201d one employee told the Guardian. Another worker said their manager claimed the meetings were about the holidays. In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said of the union training videos: \u201cWe\u2019re perplexed as to why Gizmodo takes issue with a company wanting to better engage its employees, train hundreds of managers to maintain an open and direct dialogue with associates, and create channels to drive innovation on behalf of the customer in a caring and inclusive environment. The reporter clearly cherry-picked soundbites from the video to meet his editorial objective and do not align with our view on how to create career opportunities for employees. \u201cIn the US, the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers, including cash, stock and incentive bonuses is over $15/hour before overtime. That\u2019s in addition to our full benefits package that includes health, vision and dental insurance, retirement, generous parental leave, and skills training for in-demand jobs through our Career Choice program, which has over 16,000 participants.

    "webTitle": "Halfords focuses on electric bikes and cars to put spark into sales", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Halfords has unveiled a back-to-basics turnaround plan that focuses on motoring and cycling, as it looks to capitalise on rising sales of electric vehicles. The UK\u2019s biggest bike retailer said it would scale back the sale of products such as power tools and camping equipment and turn Halfords into a bike and motoring specialist to make it more competitive in a \u201crapidly changing retail environment\u201d, with a focus on electric vehicles. Halfords\u2019 chief executive, Graham Stapleton, who took the helm in January after Jill McDonald joined Marks &amp; Spencer, said: \u201cCustomer behaviours and the competitive environment are changing and we face an increasing number of headwinds. Our new long-term strategy means we will become far more focused on the categories we are best known for, motoring and cycling.\u201d Electric bike sales figures released on Thursday underscored the strategic move, which also followed reports this week that Halfords is among the bidders for Evans Cycles, its struggling rival. Sales of electric bikes have surged and were Halfords\u2019 \u201cstandout performer\u201d in the 20 weeks to 17 August, the company said during a strategic presentation to investors on Thursday. Electric bikes are popular with younger people but also make cycling accessible to older people. Prices at Halfords start at \u00a3600 for a folding electric bike, while a top-of-the-range mountain bike costs \u00a33,000. Electric scooters for children range between \u00a3115 and \u00a3700. Halfords has about 800 shops and garages offering MOT testing and repairs, and wants to raise this to 1,000. This includes opening a further 100 autocentres \u2013 it currently has 316 \u2013 and doubling the number of bike shops that trade under the upmarket Tredz and Cycle Republic brands to 50. The firm shut six underperforming Halfords stores in 2017 and similar closures are planned this year. The retailer has also given trials to mobile vans that offer a car parts fitting and repair service on people\u2019s driveways, and wants to roll them out across the UK. Analysts at Stifel, a stockbroking firm, said the overhaul \u201crecognises the significant threat posed by Amazon, Argos and other price-led mass merchandisers\u201d. However, it came at a cost that rattled investors.

      "bodyText": "Sentiment among European investors has improved, with most major markets reversing earlier losses and following Wall Street higher. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 20 points at 7,531. In Italy, the FTSE MIB is still down 0.8% on those budget concerns, but losses have been trimmed. Aside from the tensions in Italy over budget deficit targets, investors have been focused on events in the US, where the Federal Reserve raised rates for the third time this year on Thursday, citing confidence in the world\u2019s largest economy. There was respite for Argentina, after the IMF agreed to a loan of $57bn over the three years - the Fund\u2019s largest ever loan. In the UK, car manufacturing fell by 13% in August, marking the third monthly drop in a row. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for all your comments and please join us again tomorrow. The opening bell has rung and US markets have opened higher, helped by the Fed\u2019s confidence in the strength of the economy: Dow Jones: +0.2% at 26,448 S&amp;P 500: +0.2% at 2,912 Nasdaq: +0.4% at 8,022 Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda could be made to offload hundreds of stores if they are to win approval for their planned merger from the UK competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had found a \u201crealistic prospect of a significant lessening of competition\u201d in 463 places in the UK where local supermarkets\u2019 catchment areas overlapped. The finding is part of the CMA\u2019s in-depth investigation into the planned merger of two of the UK\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d supermarkets (the other two being Tesco and Morrisons). Full story here: Anthony Kurukgy, a trader at currency firm Foenix Partners, says the US GDP figures show the Fed\u2019s Jerome Powell was justified in his positive view of the economy: Today\u2019s US GDP print remaining at 4.2% reaffirms the Federal Reserve\u2019s bullish assessment of its economy in the latest FOMC meeting. Having raised short term interest rates for the third time in 2018 this week, the Fed remain on course for further monetary tightening before the year is out, with the futures market heavily speculating a December rate increase. With unemployment at multi-year lows and wage inflation accelerating to its quickest pace in 9-years, the Fed may have no other alternative. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, at a time when some workers were likely to have been displaced by Hurricane Florence. Initial jobless claims rose by 12,000 in the week ending 22 September, to 214,000. The Labor Department also revised up the figure for the week before, by 1,000 to 202,000. The four-week moving average was 206,250, an increase of 250 from the previous week\u2019s revised average. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 4.2% in the second quarter, data just out confirmed. It was the Commerce Department\u2019s third estimate, unchanged from the second quarter. It was the fastest rate of growth since the third quarter of 2014, and up from 2.2% in the first quarter. The FTSE 100 is up 0.3% or 22 points, bucking the trend across Europe where the main markets are down. The UK\u2019s leading index is being boosted by a weaker pound, which is struggling against the dollar after last night\u2019s US rate hike by the Federal Reserve. FTSE 100: +0.3% at 7,533 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,369 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,509 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.2% at 21,396 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 9,474 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 384 The US investment bank Goldman Sachs is targeting Britain\u2019s savers with a new account that pays out 1.5% in annual interest. Launching its Marcus savings account today, the Wall Street bank is hoping to appeal to UK savers who have suffered dwindling returns over the past decade as the Bank of England left interest rates at record lows below 1%. At 1.5%, Goldman is offering the highest rate on the market, although it includes a bonus of 0.15% for the first 12 months. An account can be opened with as little as \u00a31. Des McDaid, Marcus\u2019s managing director and formerly the head of savings at TSB, said: Over the last decade savers have been on the wrong end of low interest rates. We\u2019ve spoken in depth to people across the country and there is a real disillusionment about savings \u2013 while most UK adults are diligently trying to save every month, some do not even have a savings account, with low interest rates and complexity being put to blame. Read our full story here: Over in Rome, Guardian correspondent Angela Giuffrida reports on the latest developments on budget talks: Tensions are rife in Italy as reports emerged that the presentation of the populist coalition government\u2019s budget targets for 2019 could be delayed. By law, the targets must be presented by midnight. For weeks, the government\u2019s two deputy prime ministers \u2013 Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, and Matteo Salvini, who heads up the far-right League \u2013 have been engaged in a bitter standoff with Giovanni Tria, the economy minister, who is trying to resist pressure to put together a budget that will see Italy\u2019s deficit increase in order to pay for election campaign promises such as a basic income and flat tax. Specifically, Di Maio is pushing hard for a 2.4% deficit target, while Salvini is also unwilling to soften the line on that either. They could well compromise on 2%, but anything beyond that would make it very difficult for Tria to stay. A failure to agree to increase the deficit could see Tria out of a job. If the targets are not presented today then the only other option would be to resort to the fiscal goals, including a budget deficit target of 0.8%, outlined by the previous administration in the Economic and Financial Document (DEF) in April. \u201cThe problem [with the DEF] is that the fiscal targets are much more aggressive than what the government wants, so politically it\u2019s not an option, but legally it\u2019s the only other option [if the budget gets delayed],\u201d Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence, a research firm in London, told the Guardian. Piccoli added that although \u201cby law\u201d the targets should be presented by midnight, this could well be ignored! US futures are roughly flat ahead of the bell on Wall Street, as the Federal Reserve avoided rocking the boat on Thursday when it announced a 0.25 point rise in interest rates to 2.25%. Not everybody was pleased with the decision, however, including Donald Trump who has said before he does not approve of the Fed\u2019s rate hikes. Speaking at a press conference in New York, the US President said: Unfortunately they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well. I\u2019m not happy about that. I\u2019d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs. Optimism about prospects for the eurozone economy fell among industry and consumers for the ninth month in a row in September, according to a regular survey by the European Commission. The economic sentiment indicator slipped to 110.9 from 111.6 in August, weaker than economists\u2019 forecasts of 111.2 and the lowest level in 15 months. Jack Allen, senior European economist at Capital Economics, says the survey is the latest evidence that economic growth in the single currency bloc is slowing gradually. Consistent with the message from the hard data and the PMI surveys, the EC survey showed that the slowdown has been driven by the industrial sector, presumably reflecting the impact of a stronger currency and weaker growth in the currency union\u2019s major trading partners. Today\u2019s data are not weak enough to deter the European Central Bank from ending its asset purchases this year. But they support the Bank\u2019s cautious approach to interest rate hikes. Brent crude oil prices are hovering just below the $82 barrel mark this morning, up 0.8% at $81.98, just off the near four-year highs achieved on Tuesday. Prices are rising over fears of a supply shortage as Washington\u2019 prepares to reimpose sanctions on Iran from 4 November. The number of calls rolling of UK production lines fell for the third month in a row, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The trade body said a total of 89,254 cars were built in UK factories last month, down 13% compared with the same month last year. It was a weak picture all round, with cars built for the domestic market down 39% at 16,271, and those destined for overseas markets down 4% at 72,983. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to re-certify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on September 1. With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade; for our sector, \u2018no deal\u2019 is not an option. In the first eight months of 2018, a total of 1.04m cars were built in the UK, down 5% compared with the same period last year. The euro is down 0.3% at $1.1703, with traders unsettled by reports of a row in Italy\u2019s new government, ahead of a deadline to present its first budget. Earlier it hit a one-week low of $1.1690 following a report in Italian newspaper, the Corriere della Sera that this afternoon\u2019s budget meeting was likely to be delayed. Investors are also concerned that the government will seek to increase next year\u2019s budget deficit, potentially putting Italy on a collision course with the European Commission and investors who would like to see a cut. Europe\u2019s main markets have opened down, following in the wake of losses on Wall Street last night. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 1.8% as investor nerves rise about how budget talks will play out as the deadline looms. FTSE 100: -0.1% at 7,505 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 12,329 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,501 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.8% at 21,268 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.6% at 9,469 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 384 Argentina was offered respite overnight after securing a $57bn loan from the International Monetary Fund. The loan - which will be handed to Argentina in tranches over the next three years - is aimed at supporting the economy after a currency crisis which has seen a run on the peso, and double-digit inflation. Rubber-stamping the loan, the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said it was dependent on Argentina eliminating its deficit by 2019, but that the most vulnerable in society must be protected from further cuts. She said: Argentina has developed a strengthened economic plan that is aimed at bolstering confidence and stabilising the economy. At the core of the new plan is a fiscal policy aimed at strengthening its fiscal position and having a sustainable, appropriately financed budget, a strong monetary policy focused on reducing inflation, a floating exchange rate policy without intervention. A central element of the authorities\u2019 plan will be to reach budgetary balance by 2019, one year earlier than previously intended, and to move to a 1% primary surplus in 2020. These decisive steps will reduce the government\u2019s financing needs and bring down public debt. Congressional approval of the 2019 budget will be an essential next step. From the beginning, the Argentine authorities have made protecting the most vulnerable people in society a top priority in their economic reform plan. This remains a crucial component of this revised plan and is fully supported by the IMF. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Wall Street closed lower last night after the Federal Reserve delivered the widely expected 0.25 point rise in interest rates, to 2.25%. European markets are expected to follow when markets open shortly: While the rate decision itself surprised precisely nobody, investors paid closed attention to the wording of the accompanying statement for the Fed, and to comments made by chairman Jerome Powell at the press conference. Powell\u2019s message appeared to be slightly more dovish, painting a picture of a strong US economy, while also saying he doesn\u2019t expect inflation to surprise on the upside. He was also asked about the risks of the trade war with China, which he suggested could start to come through over the longer term. Michael Hewson, from CMC Markets, says the message from Powell was one of \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d. Fed chair Jay Powell\u2019s comments that there was no evidence whatsoever of inflationary pressure knocked US yields which had been climbing in the lead up to this week\u2019s meeting, down quite sharply, and also saw both the S&amp;P500 and Dow finish the day lower. That, combined with a slight nudge higher in the unemployment forecast gave the impression that US policymakers were slightly less optimistic about the long term future outlook than they were a few weeks ago, and this saw US yields slip back, as investors indulged in a spot of profit taking. In some ways this is a welcome respite for emerging markets, where concern about rising US rates has been at its highest, while the US dollar was only slightly firmer, in the aftermath of the decision. The Fed appears to have done it again in offering something for the doves as well as the hawks, while at the same time keeping borrowing costs on a fairly even keel. This constructive ambiguity keeps the optionality of another potential four rate rises on the table by the end of 2019, while at the same time hinting that a slowing economy might cause them to reassess that outlook over the next 12 months. Also overnight, the IMF agreed its biggest ever bailout, loaning Argentina $57bn. More on that soon.

      "bodyText": "British Airways\u2019 safety training for cabin crew has been called into question at the inquest into the death of a teenager with food allergies who collapsed on one of the airline\u2019s flights. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, from Fulham, south-west London, was on flight BA342 from London to Nice on 17 July 2016 when she fell ill after eating a baguette she had bought from a branch of Pret A Manger at Heathrow airport\u2019s Terminal 5. She died later that day in hospital. The inquest, at west London coroner\u2019s court, has heard that BA staff did not fetch an onboard defibrillator nor tell a doctor treating Natasha that there was one. Addressing the airline\u2019s learning and development manager, Clare Durrant, on Thursday, Sean Cummings, the assistant senior coroner for west London, said: \u201cI am struggling a little bit with why the full range of kit wasn\u2019t made aware to Dr [Thomas] Pearson-Jones.\u201d Durrant replied: \u201cThat [the defibrillator] wouldn\u2019t have helped at that stage.\u201d But Cummings questioned the ability of BA staff to make that judgment rather than a doctor. \u201cThat seems to me like a quantum leap in terms of judgment that your crew is being asked to make,\u201d said the coroner. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem safe to me.\u201d Cabin crew have told the inquest previously that because Natasha went into cardiac arrest as the plane was landing, it would have been unsafe to retrieve the defibrillator from the back of the plane, where it was stored, while Natasha was being tended to at the front. This explanation was also called into question by Cummings on Thursday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem entirely logical to have some equipment [the medical kit] at the front of the plane and the defibrillator at the back,\u201d he said. Durrant said the crew would not have retrieved the device earlier, before cardiac arrest, because they were trained to wait for the agonal breath (a gasp) before fetching it. Jeremy Hyam QC, representing Natasha\u2019s family, responded: \u201cThe way you have explained it, the training to get the defibrillator is unsafe.\u201d He suggested it would have been sensible to have it ready when Natasha was deteriorating. Earlier, the court heard from Dr Alex Croom, a consultant allergist, who said the defibrillator may not have made a difference because it was unlikely there was an abnormal rhythm that needed correcting. \u201cThe heart simply wasn\u2019t pumping,\u201d she said. Croom said two EpiPens that Natasha carried and that were administered on the plane by her father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, may have been ineffective because the needles were too short. \u201cThe normal length for an EpiPens is 16mm and in some individuals even with a normal BMI [body mass index] \u2026 this might be insufficient for the needle to reach muscle,\u201d she told the court. She said some newer devices were 24mm, and she agreed with the proposition put to her by Hyam that the standard length should be 25mm, as recommended by the Resuscitation Council. Croom also told the court that the second EpiPen may have been ineffective because Natasha\u2019s father administered it in the same place as the first, on the teenager\u2019s right thigh. The usual practice was to do it in alternate thighs because otherwise it could restrict blood flow and prevent the drug\u2019s dispersal, she said. The court has previously heard that Pearson-Jones, who was on the flight the day after graduating from Oxford University, was not told by cabin crew that the plane\u2019s medical kit contained an EpiPen. Croom said another EpiPen would have been expected to lead to some improvement in Natasha\u2019s condition, but she could not say to what degree. The inquest continues.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the accountancy group PwC and a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) from 2006 to 2011 There is a disconnect at the moment between the political process, which is aimed at delivering Brexit, and the latest economic news. On the political front, the government has produced a raft of papers on no-deal scenarios and the talks with the EU seem to have reached an impasse. But much of the economic news is reasonably positive. Retail sales volumes are up around 3.5% on a year ago, according to the latest figures. Manufacturing and export growth has been relatively resilient, buoyed by a strong world economy. And the unemployment rate has fallen to a new 40-plus-year low \u2013 4%. The most worrying indicator has been the pickup in inflation, to 2.7%, but I am not greatly surprised that inflation has risen, given the weakness of the pound. One explanation for this pattern is that UK consumers and businesses are resilient and are not paying much attention to the latest political ups and downs. This would be quite rational, given that we have all been living with Brexit uncertainty for some time. On the other hand, this may be the lull before the storm. If Brexit negotiations do go badly, there could be a sharp downward correction in the UK economy in the first half of next year. The most likely scenario is that we are heading towards a Brexit deal, but it will say much more about the terms of separation from the EU than the future relationship with our European partners. In that case, businesses may well start to take some actions next year that reflect longer-term uncertainty about future trade and investment relationships with our EU partners. We may therefore be heading into a period of increased volatility, in which consumers, businesses and financial markets are continually changing their assessment in a rapidly shifting political environment. Things don\u2019t look too bad now, but hold on to your hats as we move from autumn into winter. It could get choppy in the next few months. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and a member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from 2006 to 2009 The big economic news on the month was that oil prices continued their inexorable rise, with Brent crude rising to more than $82 a barrel. A barrel of oil was under $60 as recently as October. Petrol prices and inflation are poised to rise as a result. Already there has been a surprise rise in inflation, to 2.7% this month. The major concern here is that means once again that real wages will be hit further. Prices are up 6% more than wages since 2008 and there has been no real wage growth in the last year. Wage growth jumped this month due to a statistical anomaly in the same month a year ago, but will likely fall back as this impact is removed from the data. Rising interest rates inevitably have a downward impact on mortgage costs and hence on house prices as the price of money rises. The latest data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows that sales volumes across the UK were the weakest for five months, while house price growth across Britain is slowing and the London market \u2013 which is the most exposed part of the property market to Brexit uncertainty \u2013 has slumped. The growing likelihood of failure for Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan represents significant downside risks to growth. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, rightly warned the cabinet of the risks to growth from a chaotic Brexit. The imposition of a three-day week by Jaguar Land Rover and the indications by BMW Mini that it will shutter its factories if a hard Brexit occurs are likely the tip of the iceberg. Brexit continues to represent the biggest downside risk to UK growth. Six months to go and counting and still the government has no credible Brexit plan. Sanity needs to prevail and soon. A no-deal Brexit would be a job and economic output killer. In addition, the outlook for world trade is sharply deteriorating as the US becomes more protectionist and imposes import tariffs on Chinese goods. The Chinese then retaliate and down we go. Rising protectionism is likely to make life difficult for the UK to negotiate trade deals outside the EU. Good news is still hard to find.",

      "bodyText": "Pound gradually climbs despite Brexit uncertainty The pound dropped the most in a day for the whole of 2018 as Theresa May gave an angry speech this month, after returning empty-handed from the latest round of EU talks in Salzburg. The prime minister warned both sides were at an impasse, triggering a decline of about 1.5% on the day. Despite the recent decline, sterling over the course of the past month as a whole has edged up on foreign exchanges as investors bet that a Brexit deal can be done. The pound remains more than 12% down against the dollar on the day before the EU referendum in June 2016. Equities rattled by US-China trade dispute A weak pound is usually good for the FTSE 100 \u2013 as many firms in the index of leading UK companies make much of their profits in foreign currencies \u2013 but share prices have been buffeted in recent weeks by renewed trade tensions between the US and China. There are also concerns about potential contagion for financial markets from crises in emerging markets, including Turkey and Argentina, which have seen rapid declines in their domestic currencies. The leading index of UK company shares has dropped by about 2% in the past month. Worse than forecast Inflation unexpectedly hits six-month high The launch of more expensive new-season autumn clothes and the rising price of a range of other items, including package holidays and theatre tickets, caused a surprise jump in inflation last month. The Consumer Price Index increased to 2.7% in August from 2.5% a month earlier, confounding economists\u2019 forecasts for a decline to 2.4%. Although some observers suggest the increase may be temporary, others worry that wages are only just rising faster than inflation to the detriment of living standards. Better than forecast Trade deficit unexpectedly narrows The UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 by how much imports exceed exports \u2013 narrowed slightly in July to one of the best monthly readings in 20 years, driven by stronger exports around the world. The trade in goods deficit shrank to \u00a310bn from \u00a310.7bn in June, confounding economists\u2019 forecasts for a deficit of about \u00a311.8bn. The overall UK trade deficit for goods and services fell by \u00a31.4bn in the three months to July to reach \u00a33.4bn. Over the past 12 months, however, exports and imports of goods to and from EU countries increased by more than those to and from non-EU countries. Better than forecast Services offset manufacturing slowdown There were positive readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, pointing towards stronger growth from the services sector despite a slowdown in manufacturing output. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index showed an increase for the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK economy, from 53.5 to 54.3. Anything above 50 indicates expansion versus contraction. Despite better news from the service sector, manufacturing output dropped to 52.8 from 53.8 a month earlier. Construction also suffered a sharp contraction, from 55.8 to 52.9. Better than forecast Pay growth accelerates amid growing skills shortage There were signs in the past month that the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s could finally be helping workers demand higher wages, with the rate of annual pay increases rising to the highest level for three years in the three months to July. The Office for National Statistics said regular pay rose by 2.9% compared with a year ago, up from 2.7% in the quarter to June, while total pay including bonuses picked up from 2.4% to 2.6%. The jobless rate stayed the same at 4%. However, there are mounting concerns over the growing numbers of job vacancies due to a slowdown in the number of EU workers coming to Britain, which firms warn could be made worse by a no-deal Brexit. Better than forecast Sales of household goods boost struggling high street Consumers shrugged off the impact of higher inflation and prolonged their summer spending spree. The ONS found retail sales increased by 0.3% in August compared with July \u2013 confounding City predictions that consumers would retrench following the boost provided by the heatwave and the World Cup. Sales of food and drink and clothing did fall back after their weather-related surge, but this was offset by the strongest performance of the household goods sector in two years. Worse than forecast Worst August for public finances in three years The UK budget deficit \u2013 the difference between government spending and tax income \u2013 unexpectedly widened in August, handing Philip Hammond bad news ahead of the autumn budget. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by \u00a32.4bn to \u00a36.8bn compared with August a year ago. City economists had forecast the deficit would fall by about \u00a31bn. Borrowing for the year so far, however, remains on-track to see Britain record the strongest year for the public finances for 16 years. Alongside the promise to lift NHS spending by \u00a320bn, the chancellor may still therefore have room for greater spending, although he is believed to be worried about the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Meets forecast House prices drop amid falling sales volumes House prices fell slightly last month across the UK, driven by falling prices in London despite increasing valuations elsewhere. The latest reading from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors house price index, measuring the balance of British surveyors expecting price rises against those forecasting a fall, fell to +2 in August from July\u2019s six-month high of +4, meeting economists\u2019 expectations. The RICS said sales volumes across the UK were the weakest in five months, while house prices fell in London. However, there was solid demand in Northern Ireland and southwest England. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Trump\u2019s trade war may harm post-Brexit trade deals The growing likelihood of failure for Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan has given rise to a slew of counter proposals from leading Brexiters \u2013 calling for a no-deal and Britain to trade with the EU using WTO rules, while seeking free trade deals with the rest of the world. The outlook for world trade is, however, sharply deteriorating as the US slaps import tariffs on Chinese goods. Rising protectionism could make life difficult for the UK outside the EU, economists warn. The Swiss bank UBS estimates the cumulative impact of no-deal Brexit and America\u2019s trade war with China would stand to reverse about 15 years of progress of reducing global trade tariffs. The very worst scenarios envisage the US imposing average tariffs at levels unseen since the 1940s.",

      "bodyText": "The British economy is putting in a resilient performance, led by strong consumer and business activity, despite a month of political upheaval that pushed the UK closer to a no-deal Brexit, according to a Guardian analysis. The latest snapshot suggests a disconnect between the economy and the political process, as Theresa May dealt with cabinet resignations over her Chequers plan. Senior economists are, however, warning there is a \u201clull before the storm\u201d with little more than six months until the UK formally leaves the EU. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee, said: \u201cIf Brexit negotiations do go badly, there could be a sharp downward correction in the UK economy in the first half of next year. \u201cThings don\u2019t look too bad now, but hold onto your hats as we move from autumn into winter. It could get choppy in the next few months.\u201d Threadneedle Street has begun to identify shifting patterns of behaviour in the UK economy as businesses put investment on hold and reallocate spending to the continent rather than Britain. Some companies have also made plans to stockpile goods amid concerns over border delays. Delays of only half an hour at UK ports and the Irish border would risk one in 10 British firms going bankrupt, according to a survey from the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. To gauge the impact of the referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. In the latest figures, consumers shrugged off the impact of higher inflation and prolonged their summer spending spree, while there was also an upswing for growth in the dominant services sector. The pound has gradually recovered strength and the UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 measuring the difference between imports and exports \u2013 narrowed slightly in July to one of the best monthly readings in 20 years. Although there was a slowdown in manufacturing and construction output, the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index for the services sector \u2013 which accounts for 80% of economic activity in the UK \u2013 jumped from 53.5 to 54.3 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion versus contraction. However, there are fears of labour shortages from a slowdown in the numbers of EU workers coming to Britain in the two years since the Brexit vote. Pay growth for British workers showed signs of strengthening amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the winter of 1974-75, helping to alleviate pressure on household finances. However, the latest economic figures do paint a picture of Britain just before the worst of the recent political turmoil. Much of the data on the dashboard covers the summer months of July and August. There was some negative news from the latest dashboard. Inflation unexpectedly increased, while global oil prices have risen, which could add further pressure on households in the near future. The government finances also recorded the worst August deficit in three years, ahead of next month\u2019s budget on 29 October. With little clarity on the future relationship between the UK and the EU yet to emerge, the International Monetary Fund has warned that any failure to secure a deal would have \u201cdire consequences\u201d for the economy. There are also concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s pursuit of a more protectionist trade policy which could damage the global economy, with potentially negative effects for the UK as it tries to strike new trade agreements elsewhere around the world after Brexit. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, warned of the risks to US trade while warning that Brexit represented the \u201cbiggest downside risk to UK growth\u201d on the horizon. \u201cSix months to go and counting and still the government has no credible Brexit plan. Sanity needs to prevail and soon. A no-deal Brexit would be a job and economic output killer,\u201d he warned.",

      "bodyText": "The launch of an online savings account by Goldman Sachs has raised hopes of higher returns for Britain\u2019s long-suffering savers, putting pressure on other banks to up their savings rates. The Wall Street bank has entered the UK retail banking market with the launch of its Marcus savings account. It pays 1.5% interest a year, currently the highest rate on the market, although it includes a bonus of 0.15% for the first 12 months. UK savers have seen returns dwindle in recent years as the Bank of England kept its base rate at record lows for almost a decade. Savings rates have started to creep up after the central bank started raising interest rates last year, but they remain low, with savers losing more to inflation than they earn in interest. After trialling the Marcus account with its UK staff, Goldman Sachs started offering the account to the public on Thursday. Charlotte Nelson of Moneyfacts said it was likely that other \u201cchallenger banks\u201d would follow suit and up their savings rates. The Marcus savings account can be opened with just \u00a31. The next highest-paying easy access savings account, from Yorkshire Building Society, offers 1.41%.

      "bodyText": "The tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife, Annie, have bought Australia\u2019s most expensive home, Lady Fairfax\u2019s sprawling Point Piper mansion Fairwater. Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of software company Atlassian, has reportedly paid $100m for the historic 1.12 hectare estate on Sydney harbour after more than a century in the hands of the Fairfax family. \u201cWe are delighted with the purchase of Fairwater for our young family and look forward to continuing the legacy of this beautiful Sydney home,\u201d Cannon-Brookes said in a statement. \u201cWe love the idea of raising our four young children in this historic property.\u201d Fairwater is the largest privately held property on Sydney harbour, and one of the most significant heritage homes in Australia. Built in 1882, the waterfront estate in leafy Point Piper stretches from New South Head Road to Seven Shillings Beach. The mansion had been the residence of the Fairfax publishing family since 1900, when it was bought by James Oswald Fairfax, grandson of the founder of the Sydney Morning Herald, John Fairfax. It was the home of Mary Fairfax until her death in September last year. According to the New South Wales heritage register, the home is of \u201crare historic, aesthetic, social and scientific significance\u201d. During Mary Fairfax\u2019s long residence, the home was decorated with priceless artworks including a 2-metre tall bronze nude Rodin sculpture and paintings by Chagall, Degas and Arthur Boyd. The property was listed this month despite rumours that it would be bequeathed to the state of NSW, and reportedly took a little more than two weeks to sell. Founded by Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar in Sydney in 2002, Atlassian was worth $29.9bn at the beginning of September. The pair attended the University of NSW together, and are now among the 10 richest Australians. They are now also neighbours. Last year Farquhar paid more than $70m for the neighbouring estate Elaine, also previously owned by the Fairfax family. At the time, this was the record for Australia\u2019s most expensive home but that has now been exceeded by his business partner\u2019s purchase.",
