    "webTitle": "Co-op bank's ethical ethos may not survive new ownership \u2013 Q&A", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "What the rescue deal means for customers, employees and holders of bank bonds", 
      "body": "<p>The Co-operative Bank was battling last night to reassure its 4.7 million customers that the ethical and mutual ethos of the bank would not be buried, despite losing control to a group of US hedge funds in its attempts to plug a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances.</p> <p>The chief executive, Euan Sutherland, declared that the bank's rescue had been achieved without the need for a taxpayer bailout, but the restructuring has left customers with serious questions about its future direction and strategy.</p> <p>The initial rescue plan, drawn up in June, would have seen the Co-operative Group retain a 75% controlling stake in the bank, but that deal collapsed following intense pressure from bondholders. The Co-operative Group will now hold just 30%, which Sutherland said still made it the biggest single shareholder. This leaves 70% in the hands of the hedge funds, destroying hopes for a major mutual challenger to the traditional high street banks.</p> <p><strong>What went wrong at Co-op Bank? </strong></p> <p>When Co-op Bank merged with Britannia building society in August 2009 the idea was to create a \"super-mutual\" big enough to take on the high street banks. As recently as August 2011 the bank appeared to be progressing healthily, announcing a transformative deal to take over 632 branches of Lloyds. But behind the scenes losses were piling up, much of them a result of commercial property and buy-to-let loans made by Britannia that had gone sour, plus an IT project that went horribly wrong, costing \u00a3150m. In March 2013 the bank revealed an annual loss of \u00a3674m, and a month later it abandoned its deal with Lloyds.</p> <p>In May Co-op Bank suffered a devastating downgrade by the ratings agency Moody's, as it was revealed that more than 10% of commercial loans, valued on the books at \u00a31.7bn, were \"impaired\" and possibly heading for default. The chief executive resigned and the next month the bank admitted it needed to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. It outlined a novel \"bail in\" by bondholders who would shoulder the losses in return for shares in the bank when it floated in October. The idea was that the Cooperative Group - the supermarkets, funeral parlours and so on - would retain a controlling 70-75% holding.

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Bank was battling last night to reassure its 4.7 million customers that the ethical and mutual ethos of the bank would not be buried, despite losing control to a group of US hedge funds in its attempts to plug a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances. The chief executive, Euan Sutherland, declared that the bank's rescue had been achieved without the need for a taxpayer bailout, but the restructuring has left customers with serious questions about its future direction and strategy. The initial rescue plan, drawn up in June, would have seen the Co-operative Group retain a 75% controlling stake in the bank, but that deal collapsed following intense pressure from bondholders. The Co-operative Group will now hold just 30%, which Sutherland said still made it the biggest single shareholder. This leaves 70% in the hands of the hedge funds, destroying hopes for a major mutual challenger to the traditional high street banks. What went wrong at Co-op Bank? When Co-op Bank merged with Britannia building society in August 2009 the idea was to create a \"super-mutual\" big enough to take on the high street banks. As recently as August 2011 the bank appeared to be progressing healthily, announcing a transformative deal to take over 632 branches of Lloyds. But behind the scenes losses were piling up, much of them a result of commercial property and buy-to-let loans made by Britannia that had gone sour, plus an IT project that went horribly wrong, costing \u00a3150m. In March 2013 the bank revealed an annual loss of \u00a3674m, and a month later it abandoned its deal with Lloyds. In May Co-op Bank suffered a devastating downgrade by the ratings agency Moody's, as it was revealed that more than 10% of commercial loans, valued on the books at \u00a31.7bn, were \"impaired\" and possibly heading for default. The chief executive resigned and the next month the bank admitted it needed to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. It outlined a novel \"bail in\" by bondholders who would shoulder the losses in return for shares in the bank when it floated in October. The idea was that the Cooperative Group - the supermarkets, funeral parlours and so on - would retain a controlling 70-75% holding. But the bond holders rejected that as unfair, and the group will now hold just 30% of the restructured bank following Monday's announcement. Will the Co-op Bank remain ethical? This is the big question for many customers. The bank is known for its ethical policy, which reflects customers' concerns and includes issues such as human rights, the arms trade, genetic modification and animal welfare. In a statement, the Co-operative Group said it remained committed to preserving the bank's \"ethical focus\". However, as the board is in effect handing control of the bank to US hedge funds and bondholders, it is hard to see how the group can provide the reassurance that many ethically minded customers are seeking. The Co-operative Group will only have a 30% stake. Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said: \"It is unlikely that the Co-op will maintain its ethical approach in the long run. History suggests that once a mutual bank is privatised, it drops the focus on doing good to focus on doing well for shareholders.\" On Twitter, plenty of customers expressed their displeasure. Marcher Lord wrote that \"the 'Ethical' Co-Op bank has floundered and is now in the hands of evil Hedge Funds!!!\" while Molly4Europe said: \"Hedge funds to take control of Co-op Bank: time to move my account from Smile methinks.\" However, given that ditching its ethical policy could result in the bank losing a sizeable chunk of its customer base, perhaps its new majority owners will be keen to adopt a \"business as usual\" stance. Can it still call itself a co-operative? The definition of a co-operative is a business that is owned and run by and for its members, who receive an equal say and share of the profits. The Co-op group's chief executive says it will \"remain a co-operative bank\" with co-operative values embedded in the business's articles of association. But critics say this will be in name only as control of the bank switches to shareholders rather than members. Is the Co-op also putting aside extra money to cover mis-selling? Yes. The bank also admitted it would need to boost its capital provisions by about \u00a3100m, with a good chunk of this relating to compensation for customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI). This bill is also understood to include compensation for some mortgage customers who were overcharged mistakenly. Extra money has also been set aside to compensate loan customers who, it is understood, were affected by errors in the bank's paperwork, and will now be repaid interest they should not have been charged. Are customers protected if the bank goes belly-up? Yes. If a bank becomes insolvent the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) steps in. This is backed by the government and protects people's deposits and savings up to a limit of \u00a385,000 per person, per authorised bank or building society. If you have more than that in an account with any bank or building society, you should consider spreading your money around. I work for Co-op Bank. Is my job at risk? The bank employs about 10,300 people, but hundreds of jobs are expected to go following the refinancing. The axe will fall hardest on the commercial lending and corporate banking side, as the bank slims down to becoming a niche player in the retail savings and loans market. I bought a bond in Co-op Bank. Is it now worthless? There are two types: fixed-term savings bonds sold to bank customers, which are protected by the FSCS up to \u00a385,000; and the bank's corporate bonds, which are its capital and are at risk.

      "bodyText": "American hedge funds have forced the Co-operative Group to relinquish control of its banking arm in a deal that raises concerns about its ethical approach to business for 4.7 million customers. After months of intense talks with two US hedge funds, the UK's largest mutual \u2013 and owner of pharmacies, grocers and funeral homes \u2013 was forced to cede majority control in the bank as it battles to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. The latest twist in the attempts by the Co-op to stave off nationalisation of the bank means that the group, formed by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, will be left with a 30% stake when the bank is floated on the stock market rather than the 75% it had originally hoped for when the rescue deal was first announced in June. The Unite union's national officer, Dominic Hook, said the inability of the mutual to keep control of the bank was \"a tragic day for the UK\". He added: \"This is dreadful for the staff, customers and the wider banking industry. This may mean customers will have even less choice on the high street and means we will have yet another finance company seeking shareholder returns over better banking.\" The loss-making bank was forced to admit it had incurred another \u00a3105m of losses caused by mis-selling products including payment protection insurance. Euan Sutherland, the former boss of the retailer B&amp;Q who became chief executive of the Co-op in May, said the renegotiated deal was a good one for the group and its bondholders even though it had forced the group to redraw its original plan. \"This is the first bank to be rescued and to survive as a standalone entity without taxpayer money,\" Sutherland said. But the dramatic change in the ownership of the bank, which is likely to take place later this year, led to concerns about cultural change in the bank, its future approach to its ethical stance and the job prospects of its 10,000 staff. It is also a blow to the government, which had been hoping mutuals would create vast new challenger banks on the high street. Co-op Bank had spent a year negotiating to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group before abandoning the ambitious scheme in April when its problems began to emerge. Sutherland's predecessor, the Co-op veteran Peter Marks, who led the proposed takeover of the Lloyds branches, will face questions from the Treasury select committee of MPs about when he knew about the losses in the bank. Many disgruntled customers of the bank took to Twitter, one saying: \"Closing my account tonight after 23 years run by members for members you have let us down.\" Another said: \"I think I'd rather you'd have taken taxpayers money than to sell out to Corporate Vultures!\" The hedge funds that have scuppered the Co-op's original plans are known for their activism at troubled companies. Aurelius Capital Management, best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts, and Silver Point Capital, linked to distressed groups such as Lehman, are thought to have amassed their stakes in the bank's bonds after it was downgraded to junk in May. They had been fighting for a bigger a stake in the bank and in convincing the Co-op to reduce the group's stake to 30% they are also taking bigger losses on their bonds. The bondholders are now expected to put \u00a31bn into the bank \u2013 compared with \u00a3500m previously \u2013 while the Co-op will now inject less than the \u00a31bn it had originally been stumping up to prop up the bank. Led by Mark Brodsky, Aurelius has been involved in debt restructurings as diverse as port owner Dubai World and the US publisher Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times. Silver Point Capital is run by two former Goldman Sachs employees, Edward Mul\u00e9 and Robert O'Shea, and has a wide range of investments covering broadcasting \u2013 it bought two US TV stations out of bankruptcy \u2013 as well as car-makers and financial services and was involved in the bankruptcy of Hostess, the US food company best known for its Twinkies cakes. The Co-op Group is thought to be ready to make a concession to 15,000 private investors \u2013 who were \"very elderly and vulnerable\", it had been warned. It is expected to swap their bonds for new ones that continue to pay them regular income streams rather than handing them shares. Trading in bonds has been temporarily suspended. The precise details, which are still being hammered out, are likely to be revealed in the coming days. Sutherland said customers should not be concerned about the changing structure of ownership. The Co-op Bank has been a plc for some time but it is fully-owned by the mutual group which is now relinquishing total control. For the first time Sutherland said the bank's ethical approach would be embedded in its articles of association. \"This bank will remain the Co-operative Bank. We are embedding the co-operative principles in the constitution of the bank to guarantee this,\" he said. But Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, doubted that the bank would maintain its ethical stance in the long term. \"History suggests that once a mutual bank is privatised it drops the focus on doing good to focus on doing well for shareholders. Many ex-mutuals became some of the worst offenders in the lead-up to the financial crisis . The number of staff the Co-op employs is likely to drop as management search for efficiencies. Staff who remain are likely to find themselves loaded down with various restructuring efforts. Despite assurances by the new owners, the Co-op is likely to have a more commercially focused culture.\" New management had been hired for the bank only as recently as May when a former veteran of HSBC, Niall Booker, was appointed as chief executive. He is expected to stay as part of the deal. Richard Pym, the former boss of Alliance &amp; Leicester and now the chairman of nationalised parts of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, was also appointed as chairman for the Co-op Bank. The pair had been part of the independent committee set up by the Co-op Group to review the approach from the hedge funds. While a deal has been hammered out in principle, the details will need to be voted on by bondholders. As part of the attempt to raise the \u00a31.5bn ordered by the Bank of England, the Co-op asset management division has been sold off and the insurance arm is also on the block.",

Aurelius Capital Management, best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts, and Silver Point Capital, linked to distressed groups such as Lehman, are thought to have amassed their stakes in the bank's bonds <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/10/cooperative-bank-chief-quits-moodys-downgrade\" title=\"\">after it was downgraded to junk in May</a>.</p> <p>They had been fighting for a bigger a stake in the bank and in convincing the Co-op to reduce the group's stake to 30% they are also taking bigger losses on their bonds. The bondholders are now expected to put \u00a31bn into the bank \u2013 compared with \u00a3500m previously \u2013 while the Co-op will now inject less than the \u00a31bn it had originally been stumping up to prop up the bank.</p> <p>Led by Mark Brodsky, Aurelius has been involved in debt restructurings as diverse as port owner Dubai World and the US publisher Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times.</p> <p>Silver Point Capital is run by two former Goldman Sachs employees, Edward Mul\u00e9 and Robert O'Shea, and has a wide range of investments covering broadcasting \u2013 it bought two US TV stations out of bankruptcy \u2013 as well as car-makers and financial services and was involved in the bankruptcy of Hostess, the US food company best known for its Twinkies cakes.</p> <p>The Co-op Group is thought to be ready to make a concession to 15,000 private investors \u2013 who were \"very elderly and vulnerable\", it had been warned. It is expected to swap their bonds for new ones that continue to pay them regular income streams rather than handing them shares. Trading in bonds has been temporarily suspended.</p> <p>The precise details, which are still being hammered out, are likely to be revealed in the coming days. Sutherland said customers should not be concerned about the changing structure of ownership. The Co-op Bank has been a plc for some time but it is fully-owned by the mutual group which is now relinquishing total control.</p> <p>For the first time Sutherland said the bank's ethical approach would be embedded in its articles of association. \"This bank will remain the Co-operative Bank. We are embedding the co-operative principles in the constitution of the bank to guarantee this,\" he said.</p> <p>But Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, doubted that the bank would maintain its ethical stance in the long term. \"History suggests that once a mutual bank is privatised it drops the focus on doing good to focus on doing well for shareholders. Many ex-mutuals became some of the worst offenders in the lead-up to the financial crisis . The number of staff the Co-op employs is likely to drop as management search for efficiencies. Staff who remain are likely to find themselves loaded down with various restructuring efforts. Despite assurances by the new owners, the Co-op is likely to have a more commercially focused culture.\"</p> <p>New management had been hired for the bank only as recently as May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/27/niall-booker-co-op-executive-hsbc\" title=\"\">when a former veteran of HSBC, Niall Booker</a>, was appointed as chief executive. He is expected to stay as part of the deal. Richard Pym, the former boss of Alliance &amp; Leicester and now the chairman of nationalised parts of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, was also appointed as chairman for the Co-op Bank. The pair had been part of the independent committee set up by the Co-op Group to review the approach from the hedge funds.</p> <p>While a deal has been hammered out in principle, the details will need to be voted on by bondholders. As part of the attempt to raise the \u00a31.5bn ordered by the Bank of England, the Co-op asset management division has been sold off and the insurance arm is also on the block.</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Npower becomes latest major energy supplier to announce price rises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The storm over rising energy prices intensified on Monday when npower became the third major supplier to announce inflation-busting rises and told customers to use less energy if they wanted lower bills. The company said it would increase prices by an average of 10.4% from 1 December, adding \u00a3137 to the average annual dual fuel bill, which will rise to \u00a31,459. Gas prices will increase by 11.1% and electricity by 9.3%. About 3.1 million UK customers will be affected by the rise, which follows similar moves by fellow big six energy providers SSE and British Gas in the last two weeks. Npower chief executive Paul Massara took to YouTube to defend the decision which he said was \"a really hard one\". He advised customers to reduce their energy consumption to save money. \"It may be a cliche but it's true, the cheapest unit of energy is always the one that isn't used,\" he said. The price rise further antagonised consumer groups which said a rise in tariffs of more than three times inflation would be a huge blow for households just as winter arrives. Citizens Advice said it had received double the usual number of energy queries following the recent price rises. \"Yet again profits are being put before customers,\" said chief executive Gillian Guy.Which? called for an independent review of all government energy policy and wholesale market costs, with an assessment of whether consumers are getting value for money. Npower's move came on the same day the government announced an agreement with French-owned EDF to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley in Somerset, the UK's first new power station in 20 years. Critics have warned that a government guarantee to pay \u00a392.50 a megawatt hour of electricity produced could lead to higher bills for consumers. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if his party is elected in 2015, and he responded angrily on Monday, accusing npower of over-charging its customers. He said: \"Neither the energy companies nor the government want Labour's price freeze because they are content for prices to carry on rising at 10% a year. \"It's another day, another 10% price rise in energy. We've got a prime minister who is standing up for the energy companies, not hard-pressed families. That's why we need Labour's price freeze. \"The reason prices are going up is because you've got a broken market and you've got companies that are overcharging people.\" David Cameron last week urged consumers to switch providers following the decision by British Gas to raise energy bills by about 10%. Thousands of people took to Twitter to express their anger over the rise imposed by Britain's biggest power provider, turning the company's attempts to head off criticism through social media into a public relations disaster. Nick Clegg, speaking on Monday night's ITV programme The Agenda, said: \"Profit is what drives a lot of these things but you can't operate without public consent so I think they do need to be very careful that they don't sort of exhaust public consent and confidence that they're doing the right thing by these very, very significant price hikes.\" British Gas's decision followed an announcement by SSE that it would increase prices by 8.2%. Npower echoed SSE and British Gas, blaming the rises on increased wholesale prices and government initiatives whichhave an impact on bills. It also argued it was taking \"a fair return\" for delivering reliable energy supplies. Massara hit out at Miliband's price freeze pledge in a statement online, arguing it would lead to higher prices. \"Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices.\" Npower last increased household tariffs, by 8.9%, in November 2012. The company, which is owned by German group RWE, defended the collective move by energy companies to raise prices. \"All suppliers face the same pressures from the wholesale energy market and increasing government and regulatory costs, so there is a natural tendency for prices to move at the same time. \"When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p, no one is surprised if Sainsbury's does the same, because they are subject to the same costs.\"",

Gas prices will increase by 11.1% and electricity by 9.3%.</p> <p>About 3.1 million UK customers will be affected by the rise, which follows similar moves by fellow big six energy providers SSE and British Gas in the last two weeks.</p> <p>Npower chief executive <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99aGzjv15-k\" title=\"\">Paul Massara took to YouTube</a> to defend the decision which he said was \"a really hard one\". He advised customers to reduce their energy consumption to save money. \"It may be a cliche but it's true, the cheapest unit of energy is always the one that isn't used,\" he said.</p> <p>The price rise further antagonised consumer groups which said a rise in tariffs of more than three times inflation would be a huge blow for households just as winter arrives. Citizens Advice said it had received double the usual number of energy queries following the recent price rises. \"Yet again profits are being put before customers,\" said chief executive Gillian Guy.Which? called for an independent review of all government energy policy and wholesale market costs, with an assessment of whether consumers are getting value for money.</p> <p>Npower's move came on the same day<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/britain-nuclear-power-station-hinkley-edf\" title=\"\"> the government announced an agreement with French-owned EDF to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley in Somerset</a>, the UK's first new power station in 20 years.</p> <p>Critics have warned that a government guarantee to pay \u00a392.50 a megawatt hour of electricity produced could lead to higher bills for consumers.</p> <p>Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices for 20 months if his party is elected in 2015, and he responded angrily on Monday, accusing npower of over-charging its customers.</p> <p>He said: \"Neither the energy companies nor the government want Labour's price freeze because they are content for prices to carry on rising at 10% a year.</p> <p>\"It's another day, another 10% price rise in energy. We've got a prime minister who is standing up for the energy companies, not hard-pressed families. That's why we need Labour's price freeze.</p> <p>\"The reason prices are going up is because you've got a broken market and you've got companies that are overcharging people.\"</p> <p>David Cameron last week urged consumers to switch providers following the decision by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/17/british-gas-backlash-price-hike-energy-bills\" title=\"\">British Gas to raise energy bills by about 10%</a>. Thousands of people took to Twitter to express their anger over the rise imposed by Britain's biggest power provider, turning the company's attempts to head off criticism through social media into a public relations disaster.</p> <p>Nick Clegg, speaking on Monday night's ITV programme The Agenda, said: \"Profit is what drives a lot of these things but you can't operate without public consent so I think they do need to be very careful that they don't sort of exhaust public consent and confidence that they're doing the right thing by these very, very significant price hikes.\"</p> <p>British Gas's decision followed an announcement by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">SSE that it would increase prices by 8.2%</a>.</p> <p>Npower echoed SSE and British Gas, blaming the rises on increased wholesale prices and government initiatives whichhave an impact on bills. It also argued it was taking \"a fair return\" for delivering reliable energy supplies.</p> <p>Massara hit out at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/24/ed-miliband-labour-freeze-prices-2017\" title=\"\">Miliband's price freeze pledge </a>in a statement online, arguing it would lead to higher prices.</p> <p>\"Only 16% of the bill is under our control and imposing price controls discourages investment, increases uncertainty and ultimately leads to higher prices.\"</p> <p>Npower last increased household tariffs, by 8.9%, in November 2012.</p> <p>The company, which is owned by German group RWE, defended the collective move by energy companies to raise prices. \"All suppliers face the same pressures from the wholesale energy market and increasing government and regulatory costs, so there is a natural tendency for prices to move at the same time.</p> <p>\"When Tesco puts up the price of a loaf of bread by 5p, no one is surprised if Sainsbury's does the same, because they are subject to the same costs.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The embattled JP Morgan chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said on Monday the bank was attempting to put its problems behind it, as prosecutors weighed a record $13bn fine. Dimon reached a tentative deal this weekend with the Justice Department to end a number of civil investigations into its sale of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis. The deal is not thought to end a potentially more serious criminal probe into the US's largest bank and its executives. \"I am so damn proud of this company. That's what I think about when I wake up everyday,\" Dimon told CNBC in an interview that aired on the Squawk Box show, adding: \"260,000 people around the world are doing a great job for our clients. We're gaining market share. We're doing great stuff. We're trying to get our problems behind us.\" The deal with the Justice Department comes amid a series of investigations into the bank in the US, UK and China. The Justice Department deal is thought to include a $4bn payment to settle claims that the bank misled lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about the quality of mortgage-backed securities it sold them before the 2008 crash. Another $4bn would be paid in consumer relief, and $5bn in penalties. The fine stems from the investigations of a government working group created nearly two years ago to look at misconduct in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. Reuters reported over the weekend that as part of the deal the bank will likely cooperate in criminal inquiries into certain individuals involved in the conduct at issue. The fine comes as JP Morgan faces continuing investigations over the $6bn plus loss the bank suffered in its London operations after bets made by a trader - known as the London Whale - went wrong. The bank is also facing a bribery investigation by US officials over allegations that the bank hired the children of powerful Chinese officials in order to further its business interest in the country. The record fine now being discussed with the Justice Department would not, reportedly, end an investigation by California's prosecutors into the bank's alleged role in the sale of shoddy mortgage securities. Settlement talks have been ongoing for much of the year. A breakthrough in long-running talks came late last week, after Dimon reportedly spoke by phone to the US attorney general, Eric Holder, and agreed to leave criminal liability out of the deal. Some of the settlement relates to sales made by the securities firm Bear Stearns and savings bank Washington Mutual \u2013 two operations JP Morgan bought with the encouragement of US regulators during the financial crisis.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. To recap, world stock markets have hit new five-year highs today, driven by expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep pumping $85bn into the US economy each month until the end of 2013, and perhaps into 2014. This sent many markets higher, including the FTSE 100 which gained 0.5%. The US crude oil price, though, dropped below $100/barrel following reports that inventory levels are higher than expected. In the UK, US hedge funds have won a battle over the future of Co-op Bank, which is being rescued through a new deal between the Co-operative Group and its bondholders. Under the new plan, Co-op Group will own just 30% of its bank. Our closing round-up of the European markets is here..... and here's the lunchtime round-up too. There's also details of the overnight rally in Asia (feels a long time ago now!) Our coverage of the new rescue deal for the Co-operative Bank, in which the Co-op Group will only hold 30% of the company, starts here. The official video statement from the company is covered here And here's some reaction from (unimpressed) customers. Elsewhere: \u2022 The Bundesbank has warned that German house prices may have risen too high, and also predicted that the country's economy will keep growing this year. \u2022 Italy's unions say they will organise fresh strike action to protest against the 2014 budget \u2022 UK energy firm NPower has hit customers with 10.4% price rises, as Britain announces a new deal with EDF for the construction of a \u00a314bn nuclear plant \u2022 Jamie Dimon insists he's \"so damn proud\" of JP Morgan, as a $13bn settlement for mis selling sub-prime mortgages looms. Thanks, and goodnight. GW Wall Street remains subdued, with the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 both down around 0.1%. Optimism in New York has been dampened by McDonalds. It warned that sales around the globe will be pretty flat this month, and may not really pick up before the end of 2013. Don Thompson, chief executive, suggested the global economy was tough, saying: While we are focused on strengthening our near-term performance, the current environment continues to pressure results. The FTSE 100 blue-chip share index just posted its eighth daily rise in a row, helping European stock market to shuffle up to their highest levels in more than five years. The FTSE 100 gained 31 points to finish at 6654, up 0.5%, despite Royal Bank of Scotland dropping 5%. The FTSEurofirst 300, which tracks the biggest companies in the region, finished 0.23% higher at 1280.66. That's its highest close since May 2008 - as this graph shows: Germany's DAX closed marginally higher after hitting a new five-year high of its own this afternoon. Spain's IBEX rose 0.3%, Italy's FTSE was flat and the French CAC fell 0.2%. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, commented It has been yet another positive day for the FTSE 100, which is not too surprising given the strong finish by the S&amp;P 500 in the US on Friday, after it closed at another all-time high. RBS was one of the larger blue-chip movers, down 5% on the day as the UK government considers its options \u2013 including splitting a part of it off into a 'bad bank'. It feels like a few years since this phrase has been used so today\u2019s weakness could well just be a short-term, knee-jerk reaction until plans are clearer for the bank\u2019s future. There was some caution among traders ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US unemployment numbers. This has been delayed due to the recent government shutdown and is typically one of the more eagerly-awaited economic releases. Sentiment being what is at the moment, any stock market weakness following the release is likely to be seen as a buying opportunity. A good jobs number means the economy is fine; a bad number means the US Federal Reserve is likely to further delay withdrawing support. The net result is that so far shares have seldom stayed down for long as a result of the US unemployment levels. Some Co-operative Bank customers are suggesting they will take their accounts elsewhere after learning that the Co-op Group is losing majority control of the company. The prospect of US hedge funds and City investors holding the bulk of Co-op Bank has disappointed at least a few account holders who were attracted by its reputation for ethics. With the Co-op Group owning just 30% of the 'saved' Bank (see earlier post for details of the deal reached with bondholders), there's already some Twitter chatter about the merits of switching elsewhere. Only a tiny handful of Co-op's customer base, of course. But it must be a worry for a Bank that proudly declares that 90% of customers would recommend them to a friend. US housing sales fell by 1.9% month-on-month in September, as American households absorbed the impact of higher prices and rising mortgage rates. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing homes sales fell to an annual rate of 5.29 million last month compared to August's reading of 5.39 million (revised down from 5.48 million). The amount of homes on the market rose by 1.8% year-on-year in September, the first such rise since early 2011, which also suggests demand dipped a little (after several strong months). European stock markets inched a little higher on the back of the data -- with traders perhaps concluding there's nothing here to encourage the Federal Reserve to ease its stimulus programme sooner than before. It's official, the Co-operative Group is losing majority control of the Co-op Bank after a battle with its bondholders, in a deal that will save the bank from collapse. Co-op Group has released a video message in which Euan Sutherland, group chief executive. announces that it will hold a 30% stake in the Bank once its \u00a31.5bn recapitalisation is achieved. This means success for the two US hedge funds who have been battling to prevent Co-op maintaining majority control of the Bank after it has been recapitalised. As Sutherland put it: I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement in principle which saves Co-operative Bank. The deal means the Co-operative Bank will continue to operate, without having to seek a bailout from taxpayers, Sutherland added. Full details of the deal weren't disclosed, but it's likely that that City investors and its bondholders will own the remaining 70%. Sutherland says that the Group will \"maintain control of the bank, with 30% of the equity\" - which makes it the largest-single shareholder. He also tried to calm fears that the Bank's culture will change once hedge funds get a larger shareholding, insisting that the group will embed \"the co-operative principles in the constitution of the Bank\". As reported this morning (see 9.16am), Co-op Bank's bondholders had pushed back against the Group's original plan, in which it would have provided \u00a31bn of fresh capital while its bondholders provided \u00a3500m. Sutherland was looking to the future in his video message, saying that: Most importantly, we have to build a fair and attractive proposal for small investors, the hard-working families across Britain who have invested in the Co-op Bank. Wall Street has opened calmly, with the main indices fairly flat after the S&amp;P hit record highs last week. \u2022 DOW JONES .DJI UP 3.66 POINTS, OR 0.02 PERCENT, AT 15,403.31 AFTER MARKET OPEN \u2022 S&amp;P 500 .SPX UP 1.28 POINTS, OR 0.07 PERCENT, AT 1,745.78 AFTER MARKET OPEN \u2022 NASDAQ .IXIC UP 9.05 POINTS, OR 0.23 PERCENT, AT 3,923.33 AFTER MARKET OPEN JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon is unbowed after inching closer to agreeing a $13bn penalty to settle charges of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. CNBC grabbed a word with Dimon this morning, and learned he is eager to put the bank's problems behind it and crack on with doing a 'great' job. Dimon said: I am so damn proud of this company. That's what I think about when I wake up everyday. 260,000 people around the world are going a great job for our clients. We're gaining market share. We're doing great stuff. We're trying to get our problems behind us. CNBC reports that Dimon was also asked about the possibility of future criminal charges against JPMorgan, and replied that \"We are going to resolve every matter as best as we can, and then we're going to move on and serve our clients.\" More here: We're gaining market share, we're trying to get our problems behind us: Jamie Dimon Here's our latest story on the issue: JP Morgan close to agreeing $13bn settlement with US authorities Back in the financial markets, and world stocks remain near their highest levels in five years today, despite a somewhat lacklustre session in Europe so far. The MSCI world equity index, measuring stocks around the globe, is up 0.7% today at its highest level since Macy 2008. It was driven by decent gains in Asia overnight, where Australia's index hit a five-year and China's stocks enjoyed their biggest daily rise in two weeks. As explained in the opening post, markets are being driven higher by steady speculation that the Federal Reserve will resist cutting its $85bn/month stimulus programme this year. Many analysts suspect the Fed will not 'taper' the scheme until the consequences of the US shutdown are clear. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 crept a little higher -- helped by decent results from Philips and Akzo Nobel. London's FTSE 100 is up a modest 10 points - with Royal Bank of Scotland's shares down almost 5% as rumour swirl of a good bank/bad bank breakup. Matt Basi of CMC Markets reports that City traders are starting to ponder a festive rally: With high street stores seemingly intent on starting the Christmas shopping period earlier each year, equity traders too seem to be weighing an early start to festivities as we approach \u2018santa rally\u2019 season. With many major indices making fresh highs last week and barriers to further upside apparently reduced, the potential for record-breaking gains by year end is strong \u2013 though the prospect of another round of political wrangling in the US in early 2014 may be enough to prevent a full bear capitulation\u2026 The oil price, though, has fallen today - with a barrel of US crude sliding below the $100 mark for the first time since July 3 this year. That follows reports of production increases, and comes ahead of new (postponed) government oil inventory data later today. Fawad Razaqzada of GFT Global Markets in London said prices could well keep falling: The ample and rising supply of oil, combined with a weaker demand growth prospects, point toward lower prices in the months ahead. There'll be a rush of US data this week, with the delayed publication of various reports that were held up by the US shutdown (including the Non-Farm Payroll report on the jobs market). This means some investors are being cautious, for the moment. Here's Monex Capital Markets's take, ahead of the Wall Street open, in around 15 minutes. With the overdue non-farm payrolls and a busy week for US corporates, Wall Street is certainly set to find some fresh direction. What's more, with the threat of a default having weighed on US equities for most of the month so far, there's arguably some catching up to be done. Ahead of the open we're calling the DOW down 6 at 15394 and the S&amp;P down 2 at 1743. In after hours trade, Nikkei futures are down 19 at 14675. In other Italian news, police in Bologna say they yesterday arrested a former banker who is wanted in the United States over accusations of allegedly helping wealthy US clients to set up Swiss bank accounts. AP has more details: Police said on Monday that when Raoul Weil checked into a hotel Friday evening, authorities were alerted that he is wanted in the U.S. on an international arrest warrant. Weil was indicted in 2008 in Florida on charges that he conspired to defraud the government when he was chief of UBS's wealth management business. Weil's lawyer has said his client is innocent, and that the charges should have been dropped when UBS agreed to turn over clients' names in 2009 to settle allegations it conspired to defraud the U.S. government of taxes. Political tension is rising in Italy again, with the country's major unions agreeing to hold strikes and protests to protest against the country's 2014 budget. The head of the UIL union, Luigi Angeletti, told reporters in Rome that prime minister Enrico Letta had blundered by not making more radical changes in next year's fiscal programme, arguing: Everything stays the same, he shouldn't have done a budget to stabilise the government, he should have done one to stabilise the country. Angeletti was speaking after a meeting with other union heads. The planned protests are not a full-blown general strike. The budget, announced last week, has been badly received across Italy. Many people had hoped for a major cuts to labour taxes, to narrow the gap between the cost of employ workers and what they actually get, along with an easing of austerity. Instead, prime minister Enrico Letta only offered minimal changes, after struggling to get agreement for spending cuts and deciding to comply with EU debt targets (the budget cuts Italy's deficit from 3% this year to 2.5% in 2014). Anger over the budget hit the streets of Rome on Saturday, when thousands of people took part in an anti-austerity protests: Writing in the FT today, Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau explains how Italy's fragile coalition made it impossible for Letta to cut labour taxes and compete better with Germany: Mr Letta\u2019s Democrats are one of Europe\u2019s last unreformed socialist parties. It supports the prime minister in his determination to stay within the EU-mandated deficit target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. But it also opposes the changes needed to free up resources for tax cuts. Meanwhile, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s centre-right People of Liberty party, another member of the coalition, opposes increases in wealth, property and consumption taxes. If one coalition partner vetoes spending cuts, and the other vetoes tax increases, the margin for budgetary manoeuvre is close to zero. More here: Italy misses the chance to reform Royal Bank of Scotland shares remain the biggest faller in London, with 5% wiped off the value of the state-controlled company this morning. Earlier I blamed uncertainty over its future, with the government poised to say whether it will be broken up. There is another factor, though, as fastFT flags up. With JP Morgan close to a $13bn settlement over the mis selling of mortgage-backed securities, could RBS be facing another penalty? Berenberg analysts reckon it could be $3.7bn. The upshot is that RBS shares have slipped to their lowest level in almost six weeks, -5.2% at 353p, as this graph shows. The Bundesbank's warning that German house prices could be overpriced (see also 11.21am) is online here: Possible overvaluation of residential property in German cities In it, the central bank cites Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf as cities where prices are up to 20% above the level that demographic and economic factors would suggest as reasonable. The Bundesbank suggests that overseas investors are piling into the German property market, seeking higher returns than are possible from government debt. In Germany, renting a home has traditionally been more common than in the UK. That attitude may be changing ,though, as Germans look for a safe place for their savings. As the Bundesbank put it: The belief that the value of one\u2019s assets can be best secured through property ownership was certainly an argument for many households to consider investing in property. Germany's economic recovery will continue through the winter, according to its central bank's latest assessment. The Bundesbank predicted that Europe's largest economy kept growing between July and September, partly thanks to rising orders across the industrial and construction sectors. It said: Economic output should have increased in the summer quarter. and also suggested German consumers will push private consumption higher. The monthly report also flagged up concerns over German house prices (rising by around 4% year-on-year), saying: Price increases have so far concentrated in large cities. Measured by longer-term demographic and economic influence factors, overvaluations could be between 5 and 10 percent In the attractive large cities, the deviations are up to 20 percent. (quotes via Reuters) Wonder what they make of the situation in the UK, with one survey finding London house prices leapt 10% last month alone (driven by hot demand for the priciest residences). The latest assessment of European government finances confirms that deficit levels fell last year, but with stark differences across the region. Eurostat reported that the total national debt of eurozone countries rose from 87.3% of GDP in 2011 to 90.6% of GDP in 2012. The region's annual deficit dropped from 4.2% to 3.7%. Across the wider EU, national debts rose in 2012, from 82.3% to 85.1% of GDP. The updated data also found that Greece's deficit in 2012 was 9%, not 10% as estimated six months ago. Ireland's, though, was 0.6% higher at -8.2% of GDP. Eurostat also reported that: In 2012 the lowest government deficits in percentage of GDP were recorded in Estonia and Sweden (both -0.2%), Luxembourg (-0.6%) and Bulgaria (-0.8%), while Germany (+0.1%) registered a government surplus. Seventeen Member States had deficits higher than 3% of GDP, with the largest registered in Spain (-10.6%), Greece (-9.0%), Ireland (-8.2%), Portugal and Cyprus (both -6.4%). In all, fifteen Member States recorded an improvement in their government balance relative to GDP in 2012 compared with 2011, twelve a worsening and one remained stable. Cyprus finance minister has reportedly told the country's parliament this morning that most of its capital controls could be raised \"before the spring\" next year. Harris Georgiades made the comments as he briefed MPs on next year's budget. He cautioned that people could still be restricted on sending money overseas even if other controls are lifted. Since March, Cypriots have faced stringent restrictions on how much money they could take out of their bank accounts, to prevent a bank run following its bailout. Cyprus's central bank governor also testified, telling MPs that Cyprus's banks face a rise in bad debts as its recession hits firms Reuters has the details: Cyprus's banking sector is expected to show further losses in 2014 as the economy worsens and banks book rising non-performing loans, but the sector is adequately capitalised, the head of its central bank said on Monday. Panicos Demetriades also told lawmakers the island state would see an economic contraction of less than the 8.7 percent forecast by international lenders this year, but that risks were on the downside for 2014. The big news in the energy sector today is that France's EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group, have agreed a \u00a314bn deal to build a new UK nuclear power station at Hinkley, in Somerset. Prime minister David Cameron has declared it was a \"very big day\" for Britain, and suggested Hinkley Point C will be followed by other new reactors. He said: This is about guaranteeing secure and safe long-term supply of electricity for this country,\u2026and creating thousands of jobs. Here's our latest news story on the deal: UK to build new nuclear power station Our Politics liveblogger, Andrew Sparrow, is tracking all the action here: Hinkley Point nuclear power station deal announced: Politics live blog The deal involved a hefty incentive -- the government is agreeing to pay roughly twice today's rate for electricity. Energy editor Terry Macalister writes that Britain is guaranteeing \"decades of guaranteed financial returns\" in exchange for the \u00a314bn of investment. City AM's Allister Heath isn't impressed by the deal: Another day, another energy price hike. This time it's NPower, hitting UK consumers with a 10.4% hike in dual-fuel tariffs. This makes an unpopular hat-trick for the industry, after SSE announced an 8.2% rise and British Gas raised prices by 9.2% (the increases are getting steadily higher). These steep hikes, just as the weather turns colder, has intensified concern over Britain's living standards squeeze (wages continue to lag well behind inflation). The opposition Labour Party continues to pledge to freeze bills for 18 months if it wins the next election, while the government encourages consumers to consider changing tariffs. Tricky if everyone raises their prices.... Over in Greece, local authority workers have announced a three-hour walkout tomorrow to protest against the Athens's government's cuts to the public sector workforce. The strike will coincide with the arrival of a group of school guards in the capital. They began walking from Thessaloniki, 300 miles away, in 28 September to object to being dismissed from their jobs. The protests come as Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, insists that the government will not swallow any further austerity measures. Stournaras told the Kathimerini newspaper that: We are negotiating hard, as we always do.... However, realism and calm has to prevail on all sides. At a time when markets are starting to trust Greece again, illogical demands can only cause damage. But Athens does appear to be running out of options to fix its financing gap of around \u20ac4bn in 2014. Here's the full story. Our banking expert, Jill Treanor, writes that Co-operative Group could lose control of Co-op Bank to its bondholders. She explains what the statement released this morning about the \u00a31.5bn rescue plan really means: After a month of intense talks with two US hedge funds, Co-op Group has conceded that its original plan, which allowed it to keep a majority stake in the bank, needs rethinking. The US hedge funds which own debt in the Co-op Bank have been warning they have enough support to block the original plan, under which the overall group kept a 75% stake in the bank, which was to be listed on the stock market. The Co-op was asking bondholders to take \u00a3500bn of losses while the group injected \u00a31bn into the bank. But Aurelius Capital Management, best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts, and Silver Point Capital, linked to distressed groups such as Lehman, had argued that Co-op Group should give them more shares in return for the losses on their bonds. They do not want the Co-op to own as much as 50% of the bank after it floats on the stock market. The Co-operative Group's plan to recapitalise its troubled banking operation appears to have hit problems. In the last few minutes, the Group released a statement on the process, revealing that negotiations with its bondholders over how to inject \u00a31.5bn in fresh capital are continuing. It insisted that the talks remain \"constructive\", but admitted that its original plan -- to float the Bank on the stock market with \u00a31bn of capital from the Group and \u00a3500m from bondholders - will change substantially. Here's the key point: The Board of the Group remains committed to delivering a solution that provides both the necessary capital for the Bank, while preserving its ethical focus, and an acceptable outcome for bondholders, including private investors. To this end, we have been engaging with different bondholder constituencies and seeking to balance the requirements and expectations of these parties. We currently expect that many elements of any recapitalisation plan will be materially different to the outline provided on 17 June 2013, whilst still meeting the additional \u00a31.5bn Common Equity Tier 1 capital requirement. The news comes as Co-op also admitted that its bill for PPI provisions will be \u00a3100m higher than expected. More to follow... World stock markets have nudged a new five-year high this morning. The FTSE All-World equity index crept up to its highest level since January 2008, on the back of Asia's overnight rally where China was the stand-out performer. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 hit a new five-year high too, although the main markets are somewhat mixed. While the FTSE 100 is slightly higher, the German DAX and French CAC are both down 0.2%. The star performer is Philips - up 6% after posting strong profit number. However, the FTSE 100 is being dragged down by the banking sector, with Royal Bank of Scotland tumbling 6% on speculation that the government is about to split it into a good and bad bank. China's stock market just posted its biggest one-day gain since early September, following reports that the Beijing government is urging officials to keep reforming its economy to hit growth targets. Reuters has the story: China's CSI300 share index posted its strongest daily gain in six weeks on Monday, outshining Asian markets after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said there should be \"no slackening\" in implementation of policies that ensure growth targets are met. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings finished up 1.9% at 2,471.3 points, its biggest gain since September 9. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.6%. Reports in official Chinese media said that Li, at a State Council meeting on Friday, urged officials to keep up the pace of making reforms and reiterated that the policy focus will not change. The market also responded positively to local media reports on Monday that China's securities regulator, over the weekend, said that more steps have been added to the approval process for new initial public listings. Investors took that to suggest that the freeze on IPO approvals since late 2012 will not be lifted by the end of this year . Stock markets are traditionally roller-coaster rides. Now the owner of the Alton Towers Theme park wants to join the fun. Merlin Entertainments has announced plansto float 20% of its business on the stock market, three years after an early IPO was scuppered by the financial crisis. Merlin is Europe's largest operator of visitor attractions, including Madame Tussauds, LEGOLAND, and Chessington World of Adventures. It's owned by a group of private equity firms, who hope to raise \u00a3220m to pay down existing debt. The float suggests its advisors see calm times ahead on the markets (always tricky to get an IPO off the ground when shares are dropping faster than the Nemesis) If you're interested, you need to buy at least \u00a31000 of shares. Succeed, and you get money off Merlin annual passes. More fun than just getting a dividend cheque. Official statement here. The Bank of Japan struck a positive tone this morning, raising its rating on all nine of the country's regional economies in a sign that its huge stimulus package was having an effect. The BoJ used the terms \"recovering\" or \"picking up\" for each area, with most now 'recovering moderately', adding; Many regions said employment and salaries are showing signs of improvement amid firm domestic demand and a gradual improvement in factory output. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Stock markets are starting the new week on the front foot, with Australia's main index hitting a new five-year high as Asian markets romp upwards. Having hit their highest levels since 2008 on Friday, equities seem set to climb even higher today. Three factors seem to be driving the rally: \u2022 optimism over global economic prospects (after encouraging Chinese GDP data on Friday) \u2022 ongoing relief that America's government shutdown is over. \u2022 predictions that the disruption it caused means the Federal Reserve will keep its stimulus programme unchecked a while longer, continuing to pump $85bn of new money into the economy each month through bond purchases. As Alpari analyst Craig Erlam put it: A U.S. default has been averted and the disruption caused by these events has almost certainly ensured that the Fed won\u2019t taper until at least December, but probably towards the end of the first quarter of 2014. This pushed Japan's Nikkei up 0.9%, while China's CSI 300 is up 1.7%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed up 0.5% at a five-year high, while New Zealand's benchmarkNZ50 hit a record high. Mind you, America's political problems (let alone the fiscal ones) aren't over, as Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out: Away from the markets, there's plenty afoot today, including the Germany Bundesbank's monthly report (at 11am BST). We'll also be digesting the latest news from Greece, where the government continues to insist that it will not swallow any more austerity...",

      "standfirst": "Banking group hit by renewed reports of split, as well as US mortgage worries", 
      "body": "<p>Despite markets continuing to move higher in the wake of the recent US debt deal, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> was under the cosh once more.</p> <p>Its shares fell 19.6p or 5% to 353.1p amid growing talk the government would split it into a good and bad bank, with many in the City believing this could be to the detriment of minority shareholders. On top of that, the banking sector came under pressure after JP Morgan reportedly made a tentative $13bn settlement relating to bad mortgage loans sold before the 2008 crisis. Others may have to follow suit. Nomura said:</p> <blockquote> We think it is becoming more likely that the good bank/bad bank review will result in significant change for RBS. A decision is said to be imminent in the next few weeks and several options are being considered: 1) setting up a bad bank inside RBS to be run by an independent team; 2) setting up a bad bank inside RBS, in a model similar to that of UBS, which had more support from the central bank; 3) the final option would be the taxpayer-backed bad bank for the assets, similar to the solution from the Swedish government in the 1990s. We continue to believe that minority shareholders have much to lose from an unfavourable outcome of the review with the government maintaining considerable leverage over the minorities. <br> </blockquote> <p>On the US mortgage securities, Nomura said there was a material risk for RBS:</p> <blockquote> RBS was involved in the sale of around $32bn of the MBS securities under scrutiny (similar to JP Morgan's $33bn). The largest Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) suit is in Connecticut courts rather than New York, where more of the harsher settlements have been imposed and losses on RBS portfolios experienced by the FHFA have been said to be lower. However, due to the legal uncertainties and the large settlements discussed by the press, we see this as a material tail risk to the group. Potential capital release from [the sale of US subsidiary] Citizens helps in this context to plug any holes, though we don't see it as a means to buy back shares. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 31.62 points higher at 6654.20, ahead of Tuesday's US non-farm payroll numbers, delayed because of the US government shutdown. With uncertainty over the effect of the closure on the country's economy, most observers believe the US Federal Reserve will be reluctant to begin easing its $85bn a month bond buying programme in the immediate future. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> It has been yet another positive day for the FTSE 100, which is not too surprising given the strong finish by the S&amp;P 500 in the US on Friday, after it closed at another all-time high. <br> There was some caution among traders ahead of Tuesday's US unemployment numbers.

      "bodyText": "Despite markets continuing to move higher in the wake of the recent US debt deal, Royal Bank of Scotland was under the cosh once more. Its shares fell 19.6p or 5% to 353.1p amid growing talk the government would split it into a good and bad bank, with many in the City believing this could be to the detriment of minority shareholders. On top of that, the banking sector came under pressure after JP Morgan reportedly made a tentative $13bn settlement relating to bad mortgage loans sold before the 2008 crisis. Others may have to follow suit. Nomura said: We think it is becoming more likely that the good bank/bad bank review will result in significant change for RBS. A decision is said to be imminent in the next few weeks and several options are being considered: 1) setting up a bad bank inside RBS to be run by an independent team; 2) setting up a bad bank inside RBS, in a model similar to that of UBS, which had more support from the central bank; 3) the final option would be the taxpayer-backed bad bank for the assets, similar to the solution from the Swedish government in the 1990s. We continue to believe that minority shareholders have much to lose from an unfavourable outcome of the review with the government maintaining considerable leverage over the minorities. On the US mortgage securities, Nomura said there was a material risk for RBS: RBS was involved in the sale of around $32bn of the MBS securities under scrutiny (similar to JP Morgan's $33bn). The largest Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) suit is in Connecticut courts rather than New York, where more of the harsher settlements have been imposed and losses on RBS portfolios experienced by the FHFA have been said to be lower. However, due to the legal uncertainties and the large settlements discussed by the press, we see this as a material tail risk to the group. Potential capital release from [the sale of US subsidiary] Citizens helps in this context to plug any holes, though we don't see it as a means to buy back shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 31.62 points higher at 6654.20, ahead of Tuesday's US non-farm payroll numbers, delayed because of the US government shutdown. With uncertainty over the effect of the closure on the country's economy, most observers believe the US Federal Reserve will be reluctant to begin easing its $85bn a month bond buying programme in the immediate future. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, said: It has been yet another positive day for the FTSE 100, which is not too surprising given the strong finish by the S&amp;P 500 in the US on Friday, after it closed at another all-time high. There was some caution among traders ahead of Tuesday's US unemployment numbers. Sentiment being what is at the moment, any stock market weakness following the release is likely to be seen as a buying opportunity. A good jobs number means the economy is fine; a bad number means the US Federal Reserve is likely to further delay withdrawing support. The net result is that so far shares have seldom stayed down for long as a result of the US unemployment levels. This was the eighth successive daily rise for the FTSE 100, the best performance since a 10 day winning streak in May.

IT group Aveva added 15p to \u00a325.95 on hopes it would benefit from the news of the go-ahead for a new nuclear power plant.

    "webTitle": "UK supermarkets face mounting pressure to cut food waste", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British supermarkets are coming under increasing pressure to go further than rival Tesco to show shoppers what progress they are making in reducing food waste, as the government insists that such action should remain voluntary. Green campaigners have called on all major supermarkets to put an end to multi-buy deals and other marketing tools which result in customers wasting millions of tonnes of fresh food \u2013 much of it still edible \u2013 every year. The announcement on Monday by the UK's largest supermarket that it was dropping some food promotions after finding that two-thirds of produce grown for bagged salad is wasted \u2013 and revealing food waste data for its operations for the first time \u2013 was broadly welcomed. Environmental campaigners and charities, however, said they amounted to only \"baby\" and \"tentative\" steps and urged all retailers to go further. Tesco revealed that 68% of bagged salad was thrown out \u2013 35% of it in the home. It also found that 40% of apples were wasted, and just under half of bakery items. The supermarket tracked 25 bestselling products and combined information with data from the government's waste reduction advisory body, Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), to give an overall food waste \"footprint\" for each item. In the first six months of this year, 28,500 tonnes of food waste were generated in Tesco's stores and distribution centres. Annual figures from Wrap show that, in total, 15m tonnes of food are discarded each year in the UK, with households responsible for nearly half the waste. Of this, almost 4m tonnes are thrown away despite being edible. The announcement follows Tesco's pledge earlier this year to use its size and clout to reduce the amount of food wasted by its customers and elsewhere in its international supply chain. Friends of the Earth food campaigner Vicki Hird said: \"Tesco is the largest food retailer in the UK. It is responsible for far too much of the UK waste food mountain which means wasted water, energy and land. \"The supermarket needs to go much further than these baby steps to tackle the huge waste it causes in its operations, such as over-ordering and demanding cosmetic perfection, and via marketing. All retailers should stop multi-buy deals and other marketing tools which lead to customers wasting fresh food.\" Hird highlighted the enormous \"hidden\" energy, water and land costs of producing food \u2013 particularly meat and dairy products \u2013 and said there should be a national drive to slash food waste to zero. She urged retailers \"to clearly change their buying practices, marketing strategies and demand for cosmetically perfect produce and also help farmers and customers towards that goal\". The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) oversees food and waste reduction through the third phase of the Courtauld Commitment \u2013 a voluntary agreement with the grocery and retail sector to cut both food and packaging waste in the supply chain, which was launched this spring. A Defra spokeswoman said: \"We are determined to support food retailers, industry and consumers in their efforts to reduce food waste but we do not believe in mandatory targets. The voluntary agreement with the retail grocery and manufacturing sectors sets ambitious targets for businesses but gives them the flexibility on how to meet them in the most cost-effective way.\" Alice Ellison, environmental policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers took such commitments seriously and had reduced waste in the supply chain by 8.8% since 2009. \"While cutting waste in the supply chain is important, these figures make clear that reducing household food waste will deliver the greatest gains for the environment, and this is another area in which food retailers have made significant progress.\" She said food retailers and manufacturers had recently committed to cutting household food waste by 20% from 2005-15. Large volumes of food past its \"best by\" and \"use by\" dates which might have once been sent straight to landfill was now sent by supermarkets to food banks run by charities such as FareShare and the Trussell Trust. Hannah Stoddard, head of economic justice policy at Oxfam, said: \"Wasting this amount of food when almost a billion people go hungry every day and record numbers in the UK are using food banks, is nothing short of a scandal. It is a damning indictment of a food system that places greater importance on corporate profits than ensuring everyone has enough to eat. \"It's great news that the biggest supermarket in Britain is taking tentative steps to tackle the problem, but we need urgent action like greater regulation and investment from governments worldwide to fix the system.\" Of the other major supermarkets, Marks &amp; Spencer pointed to the progress it had made under its \"Plan A\" ethical and environmental programme, launched in 2007, with the aim of sending no waste to landfill by 2012. It said that for the 2012-13 financial year, the total amount of food waste it produced was down by 32% against 2008-09. \"This reduction is partly because we now sell short-life food products at a discount to our customers. In this year, we sold an estimated 60% of the food products that would have otherwise gone to waste at a reduced price. \"Most of our food waste (89%) is sent to anaerobic digestion and the remainder reused in other ways (including working with FareShare) \u2013 nothing goes to landfill.\"",

In the first six months of this year, 28,500 tonnes of food waste were generated in Tesco's stores and distribution centres.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-420540974\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/21/1382362654860/Tescos-Matt-Simister-016.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/21/131021Tesco-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/21/131021Tesco_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/21/131021Tesco/131021Tesco.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/21/131021Tesco_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Annual figures from Wrap show that, in total, 15m tonnes of food are discarded each year in the UK, with households responsible for nearly half the waste. Of this, almost 4m tonnes are thrown away despite being edible.</p> <p>The announcement follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/may/23/tesco-pledges-action-food-waste\" title=\"\">Tesco's pledge</a> earlier this year to use its size and clout to reduce the amount of food wasted by its customers and elsewhere in its international supply chain.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth food campaigner Vicki Hird said: \"Tesco is the largest food retailer in the UK. It is responsible for far too much of the UK waste food mountain which means wasted water, energy and land.</p> <p>\"The supermarket needs to go much further than these baby steps to tackle the huge waste it causes in its operations, such as over-ordering and demanding cosmetic perfection, and via marketing. All retailers should stop multi-buy deals and other marketing tools which lead to customers wasting fresh food.\"</p> <p>Hird highlighted the enormous \"hidden\" energy, water and land costs of producing food \u2013 particularly meat and dairy products \u2013 and said there should be a national drive to slash food waste to zero. She urged retailers \"to clearly change their buying practices, marketing strategies and demand for cosmetically perfect produce and also help farmers and customers towards that goal\".</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) oversees food and waste reduction through the third phase of the Courtauld Commitment \u2013 a voluntary agreement with the grocery and retail sector to cut both food and packaging waste in the supply chain, which was launched this spring.</p> <p>A Defra spokeswoman said: \"We are determined to support food retailers, industry and consumers in their efforts to reduce food waste but we do not believe in mandatory targets. The voluntary agreement with the retail grocery and manufacturing sectors sets ambitious targets for businesses but gives them the flexibility on how to meet them in the most cost-effective way.\"</p> <p>Alice Ellison, environmental policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers took such commitments seriously and had reduced waste in the supply chain by 8.8% since 2009.</p> <p>\"While cutting waste in the supply chain is important, these figures make clear that reducing household food waste will deliver the greatest gains for the environment, and this is another area in which food retailers have made significant progress.\" She said food retailers and manufacturers had recently committed to cutting household food waste by 20% from 2005-15.</p> <p>Large volumes of food past its \"best by\" and \"use by\" dates which might have once been sent straight to landfill was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/16/tesco-surplus-food-banks-fareshare-charities\" title=\"\">now sent by supermarkets to food banks</a> run by charities such as FareShare and the Trussell Trust.</p> <p>Hannah Stoddard, head of economic justice policy at Oxfam, said: \"Wasting this amount of food when almost a billion people go hungry every day and record numbers in the UK are using food banks, is nothing short of a scandal. It is a damning indictment of a food system that places greater importance on corporate profits than ensuring everyone has enough to eat.</p> <p>\"It's great news that the biggest supermarket in Britain is taking tentative steps to tackle the problem, but we need urgent action like greater regulation and investment from governments worldwide to fix the system.\"</p> <p>Of the other major supermarkets, Marks &amp; Spencer pointed to the progress it had made under its \"Plan A\" ethical and environmental programme, launched in 2007, with the aim of sending no waste to landfill by 2012.</p> <p>It said that for the 2012-13 financial year, the total amount of food waste it produced was down by 32% against 2008-09.</p> <p>\"This reduction is partly because we now sell short-life food products at a discount to our customers. In this year, we sold an estimated 60% of the food products that would have otherwise gone to waste at a reduced price.</p> <p>\"Most of our food waste (89%) is sent to anaerobic digestion and the remainder reused in other ways (including working with FareShare) \u2013 nothing goes to landfill.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government's Help to Buy scheme and low interest rates are driving up demand in a tight UK property market but it is not the job of the Bank of England's new financial policy committee to cap price rises, one of its members has argued. Martin Taylor, a former Barclays chief and an external member of the FPC, reiterated that he and fellow members \"have our eye on developments\" in the housing market. But said there was no plan to act for now, despite a recent high-profile call from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) for the FPC to act to cap house price inflation. \"The idea seems to have entered the public mind that we might, or even ought to, do something about the more excitable conditions now visible in the housing market in some parts of the country,\" Taylor said in remarks at a business lunch. \"I don't know what, if anything, the FPC will decide at its future meetings to do about housing \u2026 I don't think, personally, that it should be the FPC's job to stop house prices going up,\" he added, according to a text of the remarks to the Black Country Reinvestment Society and Black Country Diners Club in Wolverhampton. Taylor touched only briefly on concerns about the Help to Buy scheme, which is intended to make it easier for customers with a 5% deposit to get a mortgage. He also referred to the impact of low borrowing costs on the housing market, echoing Bank monetary policy committee member Martin Weale, who said last week that very low interest rates risked pushing prices up too fast. Taylor said: \"Indeed, if you have an economic recovery, rising numbers of households and very tight supply \u2013 all of which we seem to have at the moment \u2013 it would be surprising if they didn't. But then add to that low official interest rates, and a government scheme in Help to Buy 2 that \u2013 and, in isolation, this feels like quite a desirable objective \u2013 will give access to the market to those potential buyers who have enough income to service a mortgage but not enough capital to put down a deposit, and you certainly have some vigorous facilitation of demand.\" The FPC, set up to guard the financial system from a repeat of the 2008 crash, would be watching for \"signs of over-extension on the part of the banks and the public, especially signs that borrowers were not in a position to withstand an eventual rise in interest rates,\" Taylor said. The committee, which is chaired by Bank governor Mark Carney, would also be watching signs in general that a more speculative market might be developing, Taylor added. \"Housing boom and bust and financial stability make uneasy bedfellows,\" he said. In a bid to stem criticism of its Help to Buy scheme, the Treasury recently gave the FPC greater powers to prevent the measures causing a property boom. Fears have been raised that the attempt to kickstart the market could result in a house price \"bubble\", with the market overheating and borrowers over-stretching themselves. Earlier this month, Sir Jon Cunliffe, the incoming deputy governor, warned banks that the way they grant mortgages to customers with small deposits would be closely monitored but insisted the UK was not in the grip of a housing bubble. Taylor's remarks coincide with the latest house price survey to provide fodder for Help to Buy scheme critics, who say price rises are already out of control, particularly in the capital. Rightmove, the UK's largest property website, said that the average asking price of a London home surged by more than \u00a350,000 last month. The site said that was unsustainable and that many buyers will need help from deep-pocketed parents despite the expansion of George Osborne's Help to Buy scheme.",

      "standfirst": "Citigroup upbeat on civil aerospace sector but more cautious on defence prospects", 
      "body": "<p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> and <strong>Rolls-Royce</strong> are among the major risers after positive comments from Citigroup.</p> <p>In a hefty note on the aerospace and defence sectors, Citi analysts Devang Doshi and Natalia Mamaeva said they were upbeat on civil aerospace but cautious on defence:</p> <blockquote> Our positive outlook on civil aerospace is driven by ramp-up in production of new aircraft and rising production of legacy aircraft. Record backlogs, better-than-expected aircraft orders and robust air traffic trends remain supportive of an ongoing delivery cycle upturn. We expect civil aftermarket to continue recovering as air traffic remains resilient and de-stocking trends end. <br>  [But] we expect defence budgets in the US and Europe to stay roughly flat over the coming years. The recent US debt ceiling deal has removed some immediate risks overhanging US defence, although these are likely to re- appear early next year. Given tough budgetary conditions in the US and Europe, large export contracts are likely to become important catalysts for Defence share price performance, in our view. </blockquote> <p>On BAE, up 12.1p to 457p, they kept their neutral rating but raised their target price from 350p to 460p along with their 2014 and 2015 forecasts. They said:</p> <blockquote> While we like BAE's robust Saudi growth prospects, its large export pipeline and its exposure to both the F-35 and the Eurofighter combat jets, we remain concerned over US defence budgets and its potential impact on BAE. The impact of US sequestration has been relatively limited so far, although the ongoing budget battles suggest more risks for the second half of 2013 and 2014, in our view.

We raise our target price from 1200p to 1280p driven by a combination of modest earnings upgrades, updated net cash and pension deficit assumptions and an updated weighted average cost of capital of 9.3% versus 9.4% before (reflecting updated market inputs). </blockquote>", 
      "bodyText": "BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce are among the major risers after positive comments from Citigroup. In a hefty note on the aerospace and defence sectors, Citi analysts Devang Doshi and Natalia Mamaeva said they were upbeat on civil aerospace but cautious on defence: Our positive outlook on civil aerospace is driven by ramp-up in production of new aircraft and rising production of legacy aircraft. Record backlogs, better-than-expected aircraft orders and robust air traffic trends remain supportive of an ongoing delivery cycle upturn. We expect civil aftermarket to continue recovering as air traffic remains resilient and de-stocking trends end. [But] we expect defence budgets in the US and Europe to stay roughly flat over the coming years. The recent US debt ceiling deal has removed some immediate risks overhanging US defence, although these are likely to re- appear early next year. Given tough budgetary conditions in the US and Europe, large export contracts are likely to become important catalysts for Defence share price performance, in our view. On BAE, up 12.1p to 457p, they kept their neutral rating but raised their target price from 350p to 460p along with their 2014 and 2015 forecasts. They said: While we like BAE's robust Saudi growth prospects, its large export pipeline and its exposure to both the F-35 and the Eurofighter combat jets, we remain concerned over US defence budgets and its potential impact on BAE. The impact of US sequestration has been relatively limited so far, although the ongoing budget battles suggest more risks for the second half of 2013 and 2014, in our view. The UK defence budgets also face the risk of further cuts as was highlighted in the recent 2013 Spending Review. While our 2013 forecasts are broadly unchanged, we have raised our 2014-2015 forecasts by 5%-8% mainly to reflect resumption of Saudi Typhoon deliveries and the five-year \u00a31.8bn follow-on Saudi Typhoon support contract awarded in June.

    "webTitle": "Merlin Entertainments to float on London Stock Exchange", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The company behind Madame Tussauds and Legoland is planning to sell shares to the public in a \u00a33bn offer that is a further sign of a buoyant stock market that has sent Royal Mail's stock price soaring. Nick Varney, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, which also owns Alton Towers and the London Eye, said the recent revival in initial public offerings had helped the company make its decision to float. \"Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have been looking healthy \u2026 the reception people have given to good-quality IPOs is encouraging.\" Private equity-owned Merlin was on the brink of a stock market listing in 2010, but pulled out because of market volatility. Merlin's announcement came as renewable energy company Infinis, which is owned by Guy Hands' Terra Firma private equity group, said it was seeking to sell 30% of its shares on the stock market next month. The spate of listings shows how equity markets have come roaring back to life since IPO activity crashed in 2008 when the economy fell into recession. The privatisation of Royal Mail, which has netted investors gains of more than 50% and complaints that it was sold off too cheaply, has been the most high-profile share offer. But scores of other companies have come to market, raising a total of \u00a310.6bn so far this year \u2013 the highest since a record \u00a316.5bn in 2007, according to Dealogic. The roll-call of firms going public includes housebuilder Crest Nicholson, whose shares have gained 70% on the back of surging house prices in London and the south-east, and estate agency Foxtons, which has gained 30% since its flotation last month. Life insurance company Partnership Assurance has also seen a rising share price, although insurer esure bucked the trend, with its shares sliding since its listing in March. In the waiting room for market listings are sofa retailer DFS, over-50s women's fashion retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 and property website Zoopla. Katya Kuznetsova, director of capital markets at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said IPO activity had picked up at the end of the summer as private equity investors sought to take advantage of favourable market conditions and sell stakes. \"Private equity [investors] had been sitting on their portfolios for a long time and they were desperate to exit.\" According to PWC's analysis, four of the five biggest IPOs in London have seen their stock price rise faster than the FTSE 100 average for blue chip companies. Kuznetsova predicted that \"strong\" IPO activity would continue well into next year. With a valuation of \u00a33bn, Merlin ould sail into the FTSE 100 when it makes its stock market debut next month. The company plans to use the proceeds of the sale to pay off \u00a3200m worth of debt, as well as opening more theme parks and waxwork museums in Asia and north America. In 2014 the company will open a huge Madame Tussauds near Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Also to be unveiled next year in the US are a Madame Tussauds and a \"dungeon\" for San Francisco, a Sealife Centre in Charlotte, North Carolina and a small indoor Legoland \"discovery centre\" in Boston. In 2011 Merlin opened Legoland in Florida, stepping onto the turf of its number one rival Disney. Varney said public ownership would help to fund such long-term projects. \"Private equity has been good, but being bought and sold every three to five years can be disruptive. We also need to be able to consider some long-term investment projects that under private equity ownership you wouldn't be able to do because of their investment horizons.\" The company's 22,000 employees will be offered shares at discounted rates, while members of the public buying Merlin shares will be entitled to a 30% discount on theme parks. Such offers have been dismissed as gimmicks by analysts \u2013 Merlin is offering a 25% discount to people booking tickets on its website, while the remaining saving would be swallowed up in fees. The recession does not appear to have put customers off visiting Legoland or the waxworks museum. The total number of visitors to Merlin's theme parks has been growing by around 11% a year since 2008, with the fastest growth coming from Asia.",

      "body": "<p>The company behind Madame Tussauds and Legoland is planning to sell shares to the public in a \u00a33bn offer that is a further sign of a buoyant stock market that has sent Royal Mail's stock price soaring.</p> <p>Nick Varney, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, which also owns Alton Towers and the London Eye, said the recent revival in initial public offerings had helped the company make its decision to float.</p> <p>\"Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic have been looking healthy \u2026 the reception people have given to good-quality IPOs is encouraging.\"</p> <p>Private equity-owned Merlin was on the brink of a stock market listing in 2010, but pulled out because of market volatility.</p> <p>Merlin's announcement came as renewable energy company Infinis, which is owned by Guy Hands' Terra Firma private equity group, said it was seeking to sell 30% of its shares on the stock market next month.</p> <p>The spate of listings shows how equity markets have come roaring back to life since IPO activity crashed in 2008 when the economy fell into recession. The privatisation of Royal Mail, which has netted investors gains of more than 50% and complaints that it was sold off too cheaply, has been the most high-profile share offer. But scores of other companies have come to market, raising a total of \u00a310.6bn so far this year \u2013 the highest since a record \u00a316.5bn in 2007, according to Dealogic.</p> <p>The roll-call of firms going public includes housebuilder Crest Nicholson, whose shares have gained 70% on the back of surging house prices in London and the south-east, and estate agency Foxtons, which has gained 30% since its flotation last month. Life insurance company Partnership Assurance has also seen a rising share price, although insurer esure bucked the trend, with its shares sliding since its listing in March. In the waiting room for market listings are sofa retailer DFS, over-50s women's fashion retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 and property website Zoopla.</p> <p>Katya Kuznetsova, director of capital markets at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said IPO activity had picked up at the end of the summer as private equity investors sought to take advantage of favourable market conditions and sell stakes. \"Private equity [investors] had been sitting on their portfolios for a long time and they were desperate to exit.\"</p> <p>According to PWC's analysis, four of the five biggest IPOs in London have seen their stock price rise faster than the FTSE 100 average for blue chip companies. Kuznetsova predicted that \"strong\" IPO activity would continue well into next year.</p> <p>With a valuation of \u00a33bn, Merlin ould sail into the FTSE 100 when it makes its stock market debut next month. The company plans to use the proceeds of the sale to pay off \u00a3200m worth of debt, as well as opening more theme parks and waxwork museums in Asia and north America.</p> <p>In 2014 the company will open a huge Madame Tussauds near Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Also to be unveiled next year in the US are a Madame Tussauds and a \"dungeon\" for San Francisco, a Sealife Centre in Charlotte, North Carolina and a small indoor Legoland \"discovery centre\" in Boston.</p> <p>In 2011 Merlin opened Legoland in Florida, stepping onto the turf of its number one rival Disney.</p> <p>Varney said public ownership would help to fund such long-term projects. \"Private equity has been good, but being bought and sold every three to five years can be disruptive. We also need to be able to consider some long-term investment projects that under private equity ownership you wouldn't be able to do because of their investment horizons.\" </p> <p>The company's 22,000 employees will be offered shares at discounted rates, while members of the public buying Merlin shares will be entitled to a 30% discount on theme parks. Such offers have been dismissed as gimmicks by analysts \u2013 Merlin is offering a 25% discount to people booking tickets on its website, while the remaining saving would be swallowed up in fees.</p> <p>The recession does not appear to have put customers off visiting Legoland or the waxworks museum. The total number of visitors to Merlin's theme parks has been growing by around 11% a year since 2008, with the fastest growth coming from Asia.</p>",
