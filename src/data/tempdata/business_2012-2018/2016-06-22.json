      "bodyText": "Part of the Liberal party\u2019s scare campaign against the Labor party\u2019s negative gearing policy is that it will cause housing prices to fall. And yet the latest housing data suggests that such an occurrence is already occurring, with Sydney housing prices definitely coming off the boil, and the value of housing finance falling sharply as investors cut back their house buying. The latest residential housing price data released on Tuesday by the ABS makes it pretty clear that the heat has gone out of the market. In the March quarter, the national average of the residential housing prices fell for the first time since September 2012. As ever, the big driver of the fall is the Sydney market which saw prices fall by 0.7% in March. Coming off the back of a 1.6% fall in the December quarter, this meant residential housing prices in Sydney in March were 2.3% lower than they were in September last year. That gives a bit of context to the scare campaign by the Liberal party, which has drawn on research by the Grattan Institute and Applied Economics to suggest Labor\u2019s policy would cause house prices to fall between 2% and 4%. Prices dropped by that amount in six months, and yet oddly, Sydney\u2019s housing market (or economy) has not been destroyed. While there have been some recent falls in prices, the annual growth remains strong, especially in Melbourne. While Sydney\u2019s annual growth of prices has come down from the 19.9% of last September to 9.7%, Melbourne has taken over as the city with the fastest annual growth of housing prices with 9.8%: But even with the heat gone from the market, let\u2019s not pretend a bonanza of housing affordability has arrived. Since the end of 2011 when the Reserve Bank began cutting rates, house prices in Sydney have risen by 53%, compared to overall inflation rising by just 8.4% in that time: The Sydney-centric nature of this latest housing boom is made obvious by a comparison of the median housing prices in capital cities since 2010. Back in 2010, the median Sydney house price was 1.2 times that of those in Melbourne; now they are 1.5 times: The initial reason for the slowing of housing prices last year was the drop off in investors. This was driven largely by a requirement for banks to limit the annual growth of credit to investors at 10% And while the value of housing loans to investors began to fall last year, for owner-occupiers the growth in the size of the home loans continued to rise. But no longer. In October last year, the value of investor home loans was falling by 8.9% in annual terms and owner occupier loans were growing by 19.5%. Now owner-occupier loans are growing by just 5.6%: One of the problems with the ABS\u2019s residential housing price index is it is very much in the rear vision mirror. The June quarter is almost finished and yet we\u2019ve only just received the data on the March quarter. In the minutes of its latest board meeting, the Reserve Bank noted that \u201cprices increased significantly in Sydney and Melbourne over April and May and, to a lesser extent, in a number of other capital cities.\u201d And this was among the factors which stopped it from cutting the cash rate to a record low 1.5% (something the market still expects to occur by February next year). But the comparison of the housing finance and housing price data does suggest that unless here is a sharp turnaround the growth in house prices should continue to fall: One reason the RBA believes that housing prices over the next 12-18 months will ease is the strong backlog of apartment construction. The RBA noted that \u201cthe pipeline of residential work yet to be done had remained at high levels\u201d. Certainly in Sydney and Melbourne this is the case. Prior to 2012, in Sydney it was rare for there to be more than 8,000 non-housing dwelling units which had been approved for building, but for which construction had not commenced. Right now however there are nearly 13,000 such apartments/flats. The picture is similar in Melbourne where the average level of 2,000 such units sky-rocketed to 4,600 in September last year: The RBA argues that this \u201cwould continue to add to the supply of housing over the next year or so, particularly in the eastern capitals\u201d and as a result, lessen even more the heat in the housing market. For all the scare campaign about falls in the housing prices, the reality is that at various times housing prices do actually fall \u2013 even by the amount which the Liberal party suggests would be calamitous. The mix of housing data across the nation \u2013 where prices are generally holding up in some capital cities but less so in others \u2013 has kept the Reserve Bank from cutting rates further. But such reticence may not last for long. The increase in supply of residential apartment in Melbourne and Sydney, coupled with the data showing mortgage growth is slowing is a solid signal that the housing market in the major cities is cooling. If that is the case, the Reserve Bank will be able to cut rates to stimulate an economy that otherwise lacks much heat. If that occurs the cash rate would be 1.5%, making it twice as close to 0% than the 4.5% it was when the RBA started cutting rates back in 2011.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the \u201cbiggest change process in Volkswagen\u2019s history\u201d, says VW\u2019s chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller. The company wants to make more electric and self-driving cars and take a slug out of its cost base. This may be big news in Wolfsburg but, as far as VW\u2019s sensible shareholders are concerned, the plan is an elaborate attempt to avoid proper reform in the boardroom. The fund manager Hermes has been complaining about inadequate corporate governance at VW for more than a decade. It would be forgiven for assuming the diesel emissions scandal would prompt VW\u2019s ruling cabal \u2013 the state of Lower Saxony, the Porsche family and Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to concede that Hermes was right all along. Instead, VW has carried on as if nothing has happened. In a year in which VW reported a loss of more than \u20ac4bn, the company paid its management board \u20ac63m, more than half in the form of performance-related bonuses. The air of corporate insouciance is underlined every time M\u00fcller refers to \u201cthe diesel issue\u201d as if it were an everyday occurrence. The same mindset has seen Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, VW\u2019s finance director for 12 years, promoted to a supervisory board whose duties include examining whether claims can be made against former executives. It makes no sense. Hermes says VW\u2019s disregard of governance principles has \u201cundoubtedly tarnished the reputation of the German two-tier board system and employee representation among foreign investors, resulting in collateral damage to the German economy\u201d. That\u2019s a grand statement, but it\u2019s spot-on. FTSE leaders and the status quo Let\u2019s not be churlish. Rounding up 1,270 business folk \u2013 including a chair or chief executive from half the companies in the FTSE 100 index \u2013 is impressive. The remain-supporting letter to the Times makes no fresh arguments (what is there left to say about the obvious economic risks of Brexit anyway?) but, as a way to demonstrate where the weight of opinion lies in the business world, it does the job. But why do such dispatches, seemingly, make little impact? Perhaps there is a clue in the first few words of the letter. \u201cWe own and run more than 1,200 businesses\u201d it starts. Well, yes, some of the signatories do indeed both own and run their businesses \u2013 they are the entrepreneur-owners on the list. But most of signatories are not owners. They are managers of public companies who serve at the will of the owners, the shareholders. Some will have a few (or quite a few) shares in their employer but that\u2019s not the same as being an owner. To be strictly accurate, the letter should have read: \u201cWe own or run.\u201d A trivial point? Possibly. But it may hint at a reason why these pronouncements from the top of the greasy pole get lost in the general noise. People sense something underhand about the boss co-opting the corporate name when expressing a personal view. When executives are also casually describing themselves as owners of the company, rather than well-paid career men and women, the tone jars. Any of the 1,000-odd signatories could have insisted on changing \u201cand\u201d to \u201cor\u201d to avoid overstating his or her status. None, it appears, did. Has Tesco\u2019s Benny Higgins heard of the tube? \u201cAll Tesco colleagues adhere to a clear policy that allows travel and other expenses for business reasons.\u201d That was Tesco\u2019s curious response when this paper revealed last month that Benny Higgins, the \u00a32.2m-a-year head of Tesco bank, had clocked up \u00a318,000 on London taxis in eight months. The statement was curious because it seemed to say \u2013 without stating so explicitly \u2013 that Higgins had obeyed the internal rules. Can that really be the case? Was it really OK, for example, for Higgins to claim \u00a3389.85 for a trip from the Soho hotel to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum, a journey of five stops by underground? And does Tesco really approve of Higgins\u2019s daughters being named as the passengers in many trips to London airports? Tesco shareholders gather on Thursday for the company\u2019s annual meeting and have the opportunity to press for clarity. They should. In the end, it\u2019s their money paying for Higgins\u2019s taxis; and, these days, they can\u2019t even console themselves with a dividend cheque twice a year. The chap to ask is the chief executive, Dave Lewis, who used to trumpet his preference for the train over a chauffeur when travelling from Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office to central London. The policy kept a checkout worker in employment, he used to say. Has he told Higgins to take the tube occasionally, or at least pay his own taxi bills?",

Perhaps there is a clue in the first few words of the letter.</p> <p>\u201cWe own and run more than 1,200 businesses\u201d it starts. Well, yes, some of the signatories do indeed both own and run their businesses \u2013 they are the entrepreneur-owners on the list. But most of signatories are not owners. They are managers of public companies who serve at the will of the owners, the shareholders. Some will have a few (or quite a few) shares in their employer but that\u2019s not the same as being an owner. To be strictly accurate, the letter should have read: \u201cWe own <em tabindex=\"-1\">or</em> run.\u201d</p> <p>A trivial point? Possibly. But it may hint at a reason why these pronouncements from the top of the greasy pole get lost in the general noise.

When executives are also casually describing themselves as owners of the company, rather than well-paid career men and women, the tone jars.</p> <p>Any of the 1,000-odd signatories could have insisted on changing \u201cand\u201d to \u201cor\u201d to avoid overstating his or her status.

    "webTitle": "Pension fund wants second administrator to be appointed to BHS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pensions lifeboat is to demand that a second administrator is appointed to BHS amid accusations of a close relationship between current administrator Duff &amp; Phelps and the retailer\u2019s former owner Sir Philip Green. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF), an industry-backed body that acts as a safety net for the pensions of insolvent companies and is BHS\u2019s biggest creditor, is to call for the appointment of FRP Advisory at a creditors\u2019 meeting on Thursday. BHS collapsed into administration in April and went into liquidation earlier this month after failing to find a credible buyer, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. It is understood that the PPF has wanted other advisers to be appointed alongside Duff &amp; Phelps for several weeks, although it would not comment on the source of its concern. The new administrator would have a role in investigating the conduct of BHS\u2019s former directors, including under Green, who controlled the company for 15 years before selling it for \u00a31 last year to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt. In a report published this month, Duff &amp; Phelps said it had uncovered a number of financial transactions within BHS Ltd, the main trading company, that required further investigation. It said: \u201cAdditional information is required to understand the true nature of the transactions.\u201d The likely appointment of a second administrator comes amid close scrutiny of the demise of the company, including two inquiries by MPs. On Tuesday it emerged that MPs had asked Green\u2019s wife, Tina, to explain the \u201cvery opaque web\u201d of family companies behind the couple\u2019s retail empire. Iain Wright, the chair of the business, innovation and skills committee, said: \u201cThe evidence so far points to a complex and very opaque web of privately owned family businesses which helped make the deal possible. These complicated arrangements make it very difficult to trace where all the funds have gone.\u201d It has been suggested that current administrator Duff &amp; Phelps is close to BHS\u2019s former owner Green, who was the first to contact the firm before the retail chain\u2019s collapse, according to evidence passed to MPs. Chappell, whose company Retail Acquisitions was at the helm when BHS went into administration, described Duff &amp; Phelps as \u201cheavily conflicted\u201d. \u201cThey are, as Philip refers to them, his ponies, and they do exactly what Philip tells them to do,\u201d he told MPs at a parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS. Both sides have rejected Chappell\u2019s view of the relationship. Green has denied that he had any improper influence over the firm\u2019s appointment as the administrator to BHS. At a meeting at a London hotel on Thursday, BHS\u2019s creditors will vote on whether to approve work by Duff &amp; Phelps continuing and to review a report on the administration so far. Documents published by the administrator earlier this month revealed that BHS collapsed owing more than \u00a31.1bn. This includes a \u00a3571m pension deficit, \u00a3358m to landlords and \u00a348.5m to suppliers. The secured creditors are led by Green\u2019s retail business, Arcadia, which is owed \u00a335m. Arcadia is likely to be repaid in full which is expected to provoke angry debate at the creditors\u2019 meeting. Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS. Dozens of BHS outlets have launched final closing-down sales with some now only trading from sections of the store. Duff &amp; Phelps is winding down the 163-store chain after it failed to secure a rescue deal for the retailer. The administrator\u2019s report confirmed that a potential deal broke down after the would-be buyer, thought to be a Portuguese-backed consortium, failed to prove it had the funds to buy BHS.",

    "webTitle": "Volkswagen's handling of emissions scandal a shambles, say investors", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen shareholders have accused its executives of overseeing a shambles and demanded changes to the management structure in the first annual meeting since the carmaker became embroiled in a diesel emissions scandal. Investors used the meeting in Hanover to criticise the German company\u2019s board for its handling of the scandal and call for a dramatic overhaul of its corporate governance. Ulrich Hocker, head of the German shareholder association DSW, said there had been a collective failure by the management board. \u201cWe are looking at a shambles,\u201d he added. The carmaker admitted last September that 11m diesel cars had been fitted with software that allowed them to cheat emissions tests. VW has set aside \u20ac16.2bn (\u00a311bn) to deal with a scandal that led to the carmaker\u2019s first annual loss in 20 years. It also faces a string of regulatory and legal cases around the world. However, the full impact of the scandal remains unclear. VW is in the process of recalling and repairing affected vehicles, while an internal investigation into how the defeat software came to be installed, led by law firm Jones Day, is yet to be published. German prosecutors announced this week they had opened an investigation into VW\u2019s former chief executive Martin Winterkorn over alleged market manipulation for not announcing earlier that the company had manipulated emissions test. Winterkorn left as a result of the scandal. Shares in VW, which owns Audi and Porsche, remain roughly a quarter below where they were when the emissions test cheating emerged last September. Matthias M\u00fcller, who replaced Winterkorn, apologised to shareholders for the scandal. He said: \u201cOn behalf of the Volkswagen Group and everyone who works here, I apologise to you shareholders for your trust in Volkswagen being betrayed. \u201cThis misconduct goes against everything that Volkswagen stands for.\u201d Hans-Dieter P\u00f6tsch, chairman of VW, said the scandal casted \u201ca shadow on this great company\u201d. Some shareholders made an unsuccessful attempt to have P\u00f6tsch, who was VW finance director at time when the defeat devices were being installed, replaced as chairman of the meeting. \u201cYou are a conflict of interest personified,\u201d Markus Dufner, managing director of the Association of Ethical Shareholders in Germany, told the AGM. Hermes, one of the world\u2019s biggest institutional investors, also criticised VW\u2019s corporate governance and Winterkorn\u2019s \u20ac7m pay deal last year. The equity ownership services firm pledged to vote against key resolutions at the meeting, including the \u201cthe discharge of the management and the supervisory board\u201d, and called for an independent audit of the board\u2019s structure. Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes said: \u201cVW\u2019s continuous disregard of fundamental corporate governance principles may have contributed to the emissions scandal. It has undoubtedly tarnished the reputation of the German two-tier board system and employee representation among foreign institutional investors, resulting in collateral damage to the German economy.\u201d Despite the criticism, all resolutions at the meeting were expected to be voted through thanks to the backing of the company\u2019s biggest shareholders \u2013 the Porsche family, the Lower Saxony local government and the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. M\u00fcller told shareholders that the the scandal could prove to be beneficial for VW. \u201cThe crisis has also opened doors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt forced us to strengthen and speed up overdue changes, and to set new priorities. To turn this crisis into an opportunity has been my goal from the beginning.\u201d The VW boss announced the company would invest billions into developing a collection of more than 30 fully electric vehicles by 2025, and would ensure that emissions tests on its vehicle are independently evaluated. M\u00fcller added: \u201cWhat\u2019s done cannot be undone. But what does lie in our power is ensuring we act in a responsible manner. This is our commitment to you. What unites all of us with a role to play here at Volkswagen \u2013 whether it be the supervisory board, board of management, executives, employee representatives or workers \u2013 is the desire to do everything we can to win back trust.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... here comes another opinion poll from TNS. And it shows that Leave are in the remain, by 2 percentage points. That means the gap has narrowed, compared to the seven point-lead which TNS recorded last week. But.... among those likely to vote, TNS has a healthier lead of 7 points... And this latest poll-of-polls suggests that the two sides are still neck-and-neck.... Something for the City to chew on overnight..... And that\u2019s all for us for tonight.... Our main EU referendum blog is still running, and full of all the political developments. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thanks. GW Pantheon Economics, the City firm, have just predicted that the Remain campaign are in a better position than the polls show. They believe that the opinion polls are wrong, when they suggest the result is close, and that the markets are right to predict a Remain victory. Chief economist Samuel Tombs says: Polls suggest Brexit is a coin toss, but they usually miss the last minute surge in status quo support. The self-reported likelihood to vote of younger people, who typically back Remain, has shot up. Europhile areas of Britain have seen bigger rises in voter registrations than Eurosceptic areas. One factor is that polling companies think young people are relativels unlikely to vote. That\u2019s a false assumption, Samuel reckons: Polls by ORB have shown that the proportion of 18-to-24 year olds reporting that they will definitely vote rose to 51% last week, from 29% at the start of June. The same trend was observed among 25-to-34 year olds. Just time for some thoughts from Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global (part of asset management firm Legg Mason). I\u2019m betting Brexit will be more similar to \u201cY2K\u201d than a Lehman moment. The wildcard will be if it is a fairly tight outcome, so I\u2019m not sure if a \u201cremain\u201d vote will solve the underlying EU problems. Clearly, it highlights that a big, vast part of the U.K. populous will still show discontent and frustration. My view has been that the Brexit referendum was really a symptom of the broader disease. What\u2019s the disease? That we are in a prolonged period of sustained, low economic growth. Incomes have been stagnant for years, which means there is a lot of pent up frustration with the U.K. electorate. This also explains the support for Donald Trump as the next leader of the US, among those who feel they\u2019re not getting a fair deal. In this period of challenged growth, politicians and the general populous are pointing the finger at other entities to explain why growth, and therefore incomes, have has been challenged. Opinium\u2019s website has crashed, under the weight of interest for details about tonight\u2019s poll. The closing auction for today\u2019s City trading session lasted rather longer than usual, as the London Stock Exchange matched up the last trades and tidied up loose ends. And when it finally ended, the FTSE 100 is up just 34 points today, or 0.5%, at 6261. That\u2019s a two-week high.....but it could have been better. Going into the auction, the index was up 76 points and heading for a seven-week high, before a flurry of late sell orders dragged it down. Financial stocks led the rises, led by investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, suggesting that investors are expecting the Remain side to win tomorrow\u2019s vote. Tony Cross, analyst at Trustnet, says: There can be little doubting the way that sentiment has swung round \u2013 in the region of \u00a3100bn has been added to London\u2019s blue chip equities since those lows last Thursday, and the market is pricing in less than a 25% chance of the Leave camp now winning. The pound has fallen back, after Opinium reported that Leave have taken a small lead: It dropped half a cent when the results hit the wires, and is now up just 0.3 of a cent at $1.4674. Breaking: Opinium have just released their latest opinion poll. And it shows that the Leave campaign have a slender lead. They give 45% to the Leave campaign, and 44% to Remain. That\u2019s a slight move to Leave, compared to the last Opinium poll putting the two sides neck-and-neck. City traders may be tempted to head home for a rest, before the inevitable drama of Thursday night and Friday. But with an opinion poll due soon, they might want to hang on..... The FTSE 100 is creeping higher, now up 72 points today at 6299 -- still a two-week high. My colleague Fiona Walsh has spied people stocking up on foreign currency ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote, confirming what the Post Office have said today. A couple more photos of people queueing at foreign exchange dealers in London have also arrived in our system: Bond trading giant Pimco has predicted that sterling could hit a 30-year low against the US dollar, if Britain votes to leave the European Union. Mike Amey, PIMCO\u2019s head of sterling portfolios, told a forum organised by Reuters that the pound could fall as far $1.30 (from $1.47 today). Amey also reckons there is a 60% chance that Britain would remain in the EU. If that doesn\u2019t happen, he believes the Bank of England would cut interest rates to zero. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz has found a queue to buy foreign currency in London today: That photo was taken at lunchtime; often a busy time in the City. But there does appear to be quite a rush for dollars and euros.... Some Brits are racing to the high street to stock up on foreign currency, in case the pound plunges following Thursday\u2019s referendum. The Post Office reports that currency sales this week are 74% higher than a year ago, suggesting that talk of sterling crashing has worried the public. My colleague Rupert Jones has the details: The Post Office said branch sales were up by 48.8% on the same period a year ago, while online purchases had increased by 381%.... A surge in transactions was also reported by FairFX, which specialises in prepaid currency cards that can be loaded with money in advance and allow people to lock into a rate now. It said many people heading to Europe or the US in the coming weeks were buying now to guarantee their exchange rate ahead of the referendum result. FairFX said the amounts being loaded on to US dollar cards, plus orders of dollar banknotes, were up almost 300% this week compared with the start of last week. It has also seen a 100%-plus increase in euro cards being loaded over the same period. Here\u2019s the full story: DING DING. Shares on Wall Street are inching higher at the start of trading, as traders watch events across the Atlantic closely. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 34 points, or 0.2%, in the first few minutes of action, with investors remaining cautious. The stock market is staging a small rally, perhaps a sign of confidence about tomorrow\u2019s referendum. The FTSE 100 has now risen by 57 points, or 0.9%, to 6284. That\u2019s a two-week high, taking us back to the times before polls showed Leave gathering support. Financial stocks, such as Standard Chartered and RSA Insurance, are leading the rally, as are mining giants like Rio Tinto (who are usually hit by economic worries) The pound is also holding onto its earlier gains; it\u2019s now up 0.4 cents at $1.4683. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, says the City is anticipating that the British public will vote to stay in the EU. \u2018\u2019With the EU referendum now only a day away, markets are braced for the impact. Polls are very close at the moment, global stocks and the pound continued to rise today, while safe haven assets continue to slip \u2013 an indication that investors, at least, are optimistic of a Remain vote come Friday morning. But if they\u2019re wrong, we could see massive volatility on Friday. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The sharp readjustment out of safe havens in favour of risky assets including the British pound in the last few days means markets may be underestimating the fallout from a Brexit. Even if betting and financial markets are proven correct and the UK votes against Brexit, the potential for political fallout in the aftermath is a downside risk. She\u2019s got a point..... UBS has raised the stakes ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote by predicting that share prices could plunge by 20% if the Leave campaign win. Analysts at the Swiss bank have predicted that a Brexit victory would sent the FTSE 100 plunging to 4,900 points, wiping \u00a3350bn off the index. That level hasn\u2019t been seen since late 2011, when the Greek and Italian government\u2019s were collapsing under the strain of the eurozone debt crisis. However, a Remain win could send the FTSE 100 back up to 6800, UBS reckon. That would be a one-year high. More here: Theme of the day..... Britain\u2019s state agents are gearing up for a busy Friday, whichever way the vote goes. Guy Gittins, sales director at London agent Chestertons, said the firm had five or six sales ready to exchange after the vote. He says: \u201cThey are waiting to go through if the result goes the right way for the buyer\u2019s circumstances.\u201d . It is not just buyers who are sitting tight - a branch of Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff reports that a \u00a31.4m property in the Midlands has been photographed and is ready to market, but may only be formally put up for sale if the UK votes to remain. If the country votes to remain Gittins predicts the central London property market will be \u201cback to business as usual\u201d. He said: \u201cThe backlog of the last five months of indecision will come back to the market and there will be good trading towards the end of the year.\u201d If the UK opts to leave, and the value of the pound drops \u201cThere will be [overseas] buyers who suddenly see a fall in the price of property \u2026 we expect the same as in 2008, when the rest of the world was in meltdown and the London market continued to do well as investors looked for a safe haven.\u201d Peter Wetherell of Mayfair agency Wetherell said a leave vote could lead to a \u201cBrexit bubble\u201d. He points out that a weaker pound will boost the buying power of foreign investors. \u201cIf the value of Sterling plummets post-Brexit then it will create a short-term buying opportunity for US dollar and Euro based property investors. For overseas buyers, a big drop in the value of Sterling will effectively offset the Stamp Duty and tax adjustments and make Prime London property a lucrative investment.\u201d \u201cDollar based Middle East and Asian investors in particular will look at short-term buying opportunities in Central London and look at acquiring residential property priced up to \u00a36m.\u201d The pound is creeping higher as lunchtime approaches. It is now up 0.2% against the US dollar, at $1.4678. It has already gained a whole 4% in the last few days, as investors became more confident that Britain would remain in the EU. Online bookmaker Betfair has now taken \u00a345m on the referendum, giving an \u2018implied probability\u2019 of 76% that Britain will stay in the EU. Spokesperson Naomi Totten says it is the biggest political event in its history, with punters now wondering how big the victory margin will be: Tuesday night\u2019s debate saw very little significant movement in the odds, despite \u00a31m being traded during and immediately after. Attention is now being drawn to the margin of victory for Remain, with between 50.01% and 55% the favourite on the vote percentage mark. There had been a surge of betting on Leave in early June, as polls showed the mood shifting. But this has reversed in the last week or so.  The current market calm will be spectacularly broken, once the results of the EU referendum becomes clear. Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management, says: Last night\u2019s debate has had little bearing on the markets today, which appear pensive ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote. Sterling, the FTSE 100 and the gilt market are all flat, levelling off from some of the cautiously optimistic rallies earlier in the week. \u201cPolls released later today have the potential to move market expectations either way, but the reluctance of investors to move unambiguously in one direction is a reflection of how tight polling has been. Once the result starts to become clear on Friday, we expect that markets will move quickly.\u201d Here are some highlights of last night\u2019s EU debate, by the way, in case you missed it: Another sign that the City is on edge: A year ago, everyone was panicking about the prospect of Greece leaving the eurozone. There\u2019s not the same feeling of panic this time; Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi wonders why..... With the pound and the Footsie 100 both flat, you might think that there wasn\u2019t much going on today. But traders aren\u2019t out enjoying the sun (even if they could find it). Instead, they\u2019re sitting anxiously at their desks, wondering what drama lies ahead. Two days ago, the markets were soaring after a flurry of opinion polls suggest a late swing to Remain. That has now petered out, though. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says nervousness is rife: With less than 24 hours left until the UK hits the polling booth, there is a tangible feeling of uncertainty and anxiety permeating through financial markets this morning, with the bullish sentiment that started the week is short supply. One in three German firms believes a Brexit would hurt them, according to a survey just released by the Munich-based IFO thinktank. IFO found that 38% of companies believe they would suffer if Britain left the EU, while 62% believe it makes no difference and 1% believe it would be positive. Brexit jitters are especially common among Germany\u2019s largest companies, IFO says: Large companies with 500+ employees were particularly anxious about the referendum outcome and 53% expect a Brexit to negatively impact their operations. For manufacturers in the export business, the figure is 41%, which is slightly higher than the overall average. More here. Trading is very muted in the City today, says Mark Priest, head of index and equity market making at ETX Capital: \u201cThe recent poll-inspired surge looks like it has run its course and trading is going pretty sideways for now. Any last minute shifts in polls could radically change things but while the result is too close to call investors seem unwilling to take any big decisions until after the vote.\u201d Finland government is concerned that it could be dragged back into recession by a Brexit vote. A finance ministry official told a press conference in Helsinki that: It [a recession] is possible. But we could fall into that territory also without Brexit. The growth is not that strong, other external shocks could have that impact, too.\u201d Finland\u2019s economy has already endured a rocky few years due to the eurozone debt crisis, the impact of sanctions in neighbouring Russia, the downturn in the paper industry, and the demise of once-mighty Nokia. Its membership of the eurozone meant it couldn\u2019t devalue its currency; instead it has embarked on a austerity programme that hit wages, pushed up unemployment, and placed serious strains on its coalition government. The pound is having a nervous morning. Sterling has been bobbing against the US dollar, and is currently flat at $1.4654. It\u2019s also down 0.3% against the euro, to \u20ac1.2997. It feels like investors are keeping on the sidelines until the referendum is over. Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, says there could be more drama today: There will be last ditch attempts by both sides to persuade the undecided ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote so volatility will be rife with Sterling bearing the brunt of it and equity markets look likely to be risk-off until the results are announced. Many traders will be poised for the last few opinion polls: Iain Duncan-Smith, a leading Leave campaigner, also dismisses economic worries about Brexit. He\u2019s on Bloomberg TV now, saying that German industry, for example, would want to access UK customers. The EU is mired in an economic mess and needs access to Britain\u2019s economy, says Duncan-Smith, arguing that the UK could cut a decent trade deal with Europe. Pro-Brexit economist John Longworth has rejected the concerns of the business chiefs who are pushing for a Remain victory. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Longworth argued that businesses would thrive away from Brussels red tape. He believes Britain could cut trade deals with other countries, pointing out that China manages to export huge amounts of goods to Europe without joining the single market. Longworth, who resigned as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) after expressing support for Brexit, said: \u201cYou don\u2019t need trade arrangements to trade with the world, but they oil the wheels\u201d He also criticised Europe for imposing tariffs, which push up the cost of food and clothing from outside the EU. Financial jobs are likely to shift from the UK to Germany and France if the Leave campaign win. That\u2019s according to the EU\u2019s financial services commissioner, Jonathan Hill (a Brit appointed by David Cameron). Hill told German business newspaper Handelsblatt that: \u201cI\u2019ve visited London, Manchester and other British financial centres in the past weeks and warned of the consequences of an exit from the EU. \u201cThen it could happen that banks and investment funds shift activities and jobs to Frankfurt and Paris.\u201d Traders in London are anxious this morning, as the final day before voting gets underway. The FTSE 100 is basically flat, lagging behind the rest of Europe. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says investors are posed for the next developments in the referendum race, including new opinion polls: On the Brexit referendum polling front, there are are online polls due from YouGov, Opinum and TNS, along with a ComRes phone poll, all of which will underline that the pool of floating/undecided voters remains high, and should therefore be treated with enormous circumspection Italy\u2019s prime minister has urged Britain to remain in the EU and help tackle the world\u2019s economic, social and security problems Writing in The Guardian, Matteo Renzi, the centre-left reformist PM, said the UK must not make \u201cthe wrong choice\u201d by embracing isolationism. Here\u2019s a flavour: Contra spem, as the ancient Romans used to say: meaning \u201cto hope against hope\u201d, to dare to dream. I am reminded of this exhortation when thinking of Britain\u2019s EU referendum, a vote which offers a clear choice either to stay in, as we hope is the outcome, or to leave Europe. In my mind\u2019s eye, like all of you, I can see the smiling face of the MP Jo Cox, her life given over to great causes, the photograph with her little son peering at the sunlight through a glade of trees; her senseless death. I can see also the strength and dignity of a democracy that can be divided \u2013 bitterly so \u2013 on everything, but which nevertheless can stand united and strong when faced with hatred, with the unthinkable, with the absurd. Seen from Italy, a vote to leave Europe would not be a disaster, a tragedy or the end of the world for you in the UK. It would be worse, because it would be the wrong choice. It would be a mistake for which you the voters primarily would pay the price. Because who really wants Britain to be small and isolated? Wondering how the stock market would respond to a Leave victory? Swiss bank Credit Suisse has told its clients today that it would slash its year-end forecasts for Britain\u2019s benchmark FTSE 100 equity index by 6%, if Britain voted to leave the European Union this week. It currently expects the blue-chip index to reach 6,600 by the end of December, but it would cut that to 6,200 if a Brexit occurred. That\u2019s quite a big drop. However, the FTSE 100 is currently trading around 6233. So Credit Suisse are definitely not predicting a full-blown meltdown. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s EU referendum is just one day away, and there\u2019s really nothing else on the financial world\u2019s agenda. Last night, UK TV viewers were transfixed by England vs Sri Lanka Spain vs Croatia at Euro 2016 a special debate between the Leave and Remain campaigners, which saw both side trade blows ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote [here\u2019s a full round-up]. A snap YouGov poll for the Times found 39% thought leave had won it, over 34% for remain (with 17% on the fence). The same group were just a smidgen more likely to vote for remain: 41% to 40%. So it\u2019s still awfully tight. And this morning, almost 1,300 business leaders haves signed a letter recommending a Remain vote, as EU membership is \u201cgood for business and good for British jobs\u201d . The letter is packed with big names, including Michael Bloomberg and Sir Richard Branson, plus the bosses of half the FTSE 100 (including the chairman of Barclays and BAE Systems and Standard Life, and the CEOs of BT, Burberry and WPP) They claim that Brexit would damage the UK economy, especially if it meant leaving the single market. They write: \u201cBritain leaving the EU would mean uncertainty for our firms, less trade with Europe and fewer jobs... Smaller businesses and the people they employ are particularly vulnerable to any economic shock which could follow.\u201d Some of them, such as Branson, have made their pro-EU views known before. But other names on the list are new entrants to the debate. The letter is online here (behind a paywall, alas): British business \u2018benefits massively from EU\u2019 Will it make a difference? It could possibly sway waverers, worried that their jobs could be hit by the economic shock caused by Brexit. But pro-Leave supporters may conclude that these are the \u2018elite\u2019 who have done terribly well out of the status quo, and are just fretting that their next bonus cheque is at risk. Also coming up today.... The economic calendar is very quiet, but at 3pm we do get the latest EU consumer confidence report. And the head of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, is testifying to Congress again. Yesterday she warned that the EU vote could trigger a wave of uncertainty across Europe. We\u2019ll also keep an eye on Spain, where voters return to the polls on Sunday in a general election. And also on Hanover, where Volkswagen is holding its AGM. Last year\u2019s emissions scandal should come up.....",

      "bodyText": "Financial shares have led the market higher despite a last minute sell off which saw the leading index come sharply off its best levels. Having climbed as high as 6315 and ahead around 70 points at the closing auction, the FTSE 100 finished the last day before the EU referendum with a 34.64 point rise to 6261.19. The close of the market coincided with a new poll showing a one point lead for the campaign for the UK to leave the EU. Overall it was a fairly uncertain day as investors who had driven the market higher as the Remain camp seemed to be gaining ground, paused for breath. Still, leading shares have recovered from their recent falls and now stand at a two week high. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: As the final day of campaigning goes on, with both sides looking to wring every last vote from the British public, markets have remained positive, with further solid gains for the FTSE 100 and European indices. London\u2019s leading index has enjoyed a round trip of around 800 points since 9 June, with the country\u2019s Brexit referendum the chief culprit for the move. Remarkably, the index finds itself within touching distance of its June high, a clear sign that investors at least are now relatively confident that the UK will vote to remain in the EU on Friday. And, in a further sign of confidence, financial stocks dominate the leader board in London, with those with a strong UK focus some of the biggest gainers. Hargreaves Lansdown was the leading riser, up 54p to \u00a313.81, while Old Mutual added 5.6p to 193.4p and Standard Life was 9.3p higher at 340.7p. But Primark owner Associated British Foods dropped 99p to \u00a328.02 as Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation from overweight to equal weight on concerns about the growth outlook for the discount fashion retailer. A disappointing update from Debenhams, down 4.55p to 69.70p, did not help matters. Commodity shares also came under pressure, as a lower than expected fall in US oil stockpiles sent Brent crude down 1.6% to $49.80. A profit warning from speciality chemicals group Elementis saw it plunge nearly 8% to 208.7p.",

The close of the market coincided with a new poll showing a one point lead for the campaign for the UK to leave the EU.</p> <p>Overall it was a fairly uncertain day as investors who had driven the market higher as the Remain camp seemed to be gaining ground, paused for breath. Still, leading shares have recovered from their recent falls and now stand at a two week high. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> As the final day of campaigning goes on, with both sides looking to wring every last vote from the British public, markets have remained positive, with further solid gains for the FTSE 100 and European indices. London\u2019s leading index has enjoyed a round trip of around 800 points since 9 June, with the country\u2019s Brexit referendum the chief culprit for the move. Remarkably, the index finds itself within touching distance of its June high, a clear sign that investors at least are now relatively confident that the UK will vote to remain in the EU on Friday. And, in a further sign of confidence, financial stocks dominate the leader board in London, with those with a strong UK focus some of the biggest gainers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> was the leading riser, up 54p to \u00a313.81, while <strong>Old Mutual </strong>added 5.6p to 193.4p and <strong>Standard Life</strong> was 9.3p higher at 340.7p.</p> <p>But Primark owner <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> dropped 99p to \u00a328.02 as Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation from overweight to equal weight on concerns about the growth outlook for the discount fashion retailer. A <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/22/debenhams-sales-hit-by-change-in-shopping-habits\">disappointing update </a></strong>from<strong> Debenhams</strong>, down 4.55p to 69.70p, did not help matters.</p> <p>Commodity shares also came under pressure, as a lower than expected fall in US oil stockpiles sent Brent crude down 1.6% to $49.80.</p> <p>A profit warning from speciality chemicals group <strong>Elementis</strong> saw it plunge nearly 8% to 208.7p.</p>",

With uncertainty about the precise moment the outcome of the EU referendum will be known, dealing rooms are opening across the City on Thursday night and into Friday morning to allow trades to be executed for customers needing to respond to the results of the 382 polling areas as they start to be announced. Unlike a general election, no exit polls have been commissioned by broadcasters and the first results are expected at 12.30am on Friday and then throughout the night. It is possible the result may not be known by the scheduled opening of the stock market at 8am on Friday morning. Some banks have told investors that they will only conduct trading by taking verbal orders rather than through computers, while other banks are ready to override their algorithmic trading systems by closely monitoring them over night on Thursday. Algorithmic trading dominates City trading rooms and uses computer programmes to follow patterns and execute trades faster than the human touch. They buy and sell at predetermined trading levels so the fear is that they could end up buying or selling too quickly in fast-moving and volatile markets. Andrew Formica, chief executive of the fund management group Henderson Global Investors, said banks were \u201cturning off algorithms\u201d because of the uncertain trading conditions that are expected. Banks are particularly alert to trading systems that respond to liquidity in markets, said Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at the currency dealer World First, and ready to override their algorithms. He said: \u201cPeople are deleveraging, making sure there are humans on the end.\u201d Some hedge funds are said to have commissioned their own private polls to enable them to take bets on the market. The Swiss bank UBS has already told clients that there could be an increase in volatility and an impact on trading volumes, which could make it difficult to complete all orders immediately. City sources say some investors are avoiding going into the vote with any large positions. Formica said: \u201cClients are nervous, worried and sitting back on their heels.\u201d Banks have also set up war rooms to ensure they can respond to any crisis in the markets \u2013 and to requests from regulators at the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 sparked by the referendum result. Bank bosses will be on hand through the night and have been instructed by regulators to ensure cash machines are well stocked to ensure that if there a sudden loss of customer confidence there will not be a shortage of cash in the system, avoiding a rerun of the queues that formed outside Northern Rock in September 2007. The banks are also avoiding any IT upgrades to ensure they do not accidentally create a situation where a failure of a credit card or debit card or cash machine could create the impression that the banking system does not have enough money to meet customer orders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The shopworkers\u2019 union has urged Marks &amp; Spencer to open talks as long-serving staff have been told new contract terms will be imposed if they do not voluntarily sign up to pay and pension changes that could leave them thousands of pounds out of pocket. M&amp;S has told staff that a one-off compensation payment would ensure they were not financially affected for the first two years of changes that involve cuts in premium pay for Sundays, bank holidays and antisocial hours for nearly 7,000 people. More than 2,500 workers will lose more than \u00a31,000 a year. Meanwhile, 11,000 workers will be affected by cuts to pension contributions by M&amp;S. Those who do not sign up could have their contract terminated and be automatically reissued with the new terms, according to consultation documents seen by the Guardian. David Gill, the national officer for Usdaw, said: \u201cWe have been contacted by many of our members in Marks &amp; Spencer who are very concerned about the proposed big changes to their pay and pension, along with the threat of autumn store closures. Particularly as the company is threatening to sack any staff who do not accept the contractual changes. \u201cWe urge the company to get round the table and engage with us. M&amp;S staff need a voice.\u201d Gill said it was inadequate for M&amp;S to rely on consulting via its company organised staff association. Under the M&amp;S pay proposals, 10% of store workers, most of whom were employed before 2002, are losing out because the premiums they enjoy for working outside normal hours are being slashed. Those affected currently receive double pay for Sundays, but that is being cut to the same as they earn during the week, while double time for bank holidays is being cut to time and a half. Some job titles which attract a premium are also being removed. M&amp;S has said only those who sign up to a new contract with lower rates of premium pay for Sundays, bank holidays, early mornings and late evenings will receive the compensation. \u201cI still love M&amp;S as a company but I don\u2019t agree with the way they are going about things,\u201d one staff member told the Guardian. Several workers who have spoken to the Guardian or contacted the MP Siobhain McDonagh say the one-off compensation offered falls short of the pay they will be losing. One worker said she would lose about \u00a32,000 a year in Sunday pay but had only been offered about \u00a3500 in compensation. Another said he would lose more than \u00a32,000 a year, including M&amp;S\u2019s former pension contributions, but had only been offered \u00a3800 in compensation. He told the Guardian: \u201cThey are saying they are offering two years of compensation [until April 2019] but the figures don\u2019t tally. This barely covers me to April 2018.\u201d The majority of the difference between the compensation and expected premium pay in the first two years will be made up in increased basic pay. As part of the proposals being discussed with staff, M&amp;S has increased basic pay by 15% from next April to \u00a38.50 an hour, helping 62,000 staff. However, affected workers point out that the compensation will not help them beyond 2019. One suggested the pay changes were being used as a way to push out more expensive staff and cull jobs. M&amp;S said it was sure all workers who lost out on premium pay would be fully compensated and any worker who was unsure about their payout could get a detailed breakdown of how their compensation had been calculated by calling the company\u2019s staff helpline. A spokesperson for Marks &amp; Spencer said: \u201cWe believe our proposed new approach to pay and pensions would reward our people in a fair and consistent way, simplify and modernise our business and help us attract and retain the best talent so we can continue to provide great service for our customers. \u201cThe proposals include one of the highest pay rates and one of the best benefit packages in UK retail. We will now consult with our colleagues and listen carefully to their feedback.\u201d But workers said changes in pension arrangements, under which M&amp;S is scaling back company payments and asking staff to put in more cash, mean they will also see their retirement income slashed if they do not pay up. One worker, whose partner also worked at the retailer, said they were worried they would no longer be able to pay their mortgage. \u201cIt\u2019s so devastating to go from secure employment to this uncertainty,\u201d she said. McDonagh, who met M&amp;S managers to discuss the issue on Tuesday, has pressed for staff to be fully compensated. She said: \u201cTwo years\u2019 compensation is not good enough. What happens after that? People have still got to pay their mortgage or rent and these people are unlikely to be able to move on.\u201d",

Albert Edwards, global strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said in a research note to the bank\u2019s clients that a reduction in the value of the currency would be as beneficial as it was during the period after Black Wednesday in September 1992, when Soros\u2019s speculative attack on sterling drove the UK out of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). Warning that the pound could fall whatever the outcome of the referendum on Thursday, Edwards said: \u201cThere is an argument that a Brexit might look similar to the aftermath of sterling\u0092\u2019s ignominious exit from the ERM. \u201cAfter this much-feared event, the UK economy actually recovered strongly and unemployment fell sharply.

The former speculator cited three reasons for his pessimism: the lack of scope for interest rates to be cut aggressively after Brexit; the risk of capital flight owing to the UK\u2019s big current account deficit; and the squeeze on living standards caused by higher import prices. Edwards said: \u201cI would have thought a 20% sterling devaluation is exactly the antidote needed in the current circumstances.

      "bodyText": "Bunnings will arrive in the UK in October when the Australian DIY chain will convert the first of the Homebase stores it bought for \u00a3340m this year. The company has hired British retail veteran Archie Norman and fellow former Kingfisher executive Matt Tyson to sit on an advisory board for the venture. Norman is credited with the 1990s rescue of Asda and previously worked for Kingfisher, the owner of Homebase\u2019s rival B&amp;Q. He is closely associated with Bunnings\u2019 parent company, Wesfarmers, after assisting with the turnaround of its Australian grocery business Coles. A pilot Bunnings store will open in October, potentially followed by another one or two before Christmas and a handful more early next year. These will be tested before Bunnings splashes out its planned \u00a3500m investment to convert the whole chain. \u201cWe are delighted to have access to such high-quality and strong-thinking people who will bring strategic rigour and real UK market insight to help with the turnaround,\u201d said John Gillam, Bunnings\u2019 chief executive. He said it was likely to take at least two years to convert all the Homebase stores, but it was important to run the chain more effectively before then. Gillam said Bunnings was already making changes to Homebase, bringing in new products including a wider range of barbecues, cutting prices and improving service. The changes follow the departure of Homebase\u2019s former management team, which has been replaced by Bunnings\u2019 staff \u2013 Peter Davis as managing director and Rodney Boys as finance director. \u201cWe had to do some pretty urgent work,\u201d said Gillam, who added that Bunnings had halted seven of 23 store closures planned by Homebase at the time of the sale, saving 200 jobs. It hopes to prevent the closure of 11 more, saving another 500 jobs, while five have closed with the loss of about 200 jobs. Gillam said it was clear the \u201cUK does have the attractive characteristics we found in due diligence\u201d before the Homebase acquisition, including a large number of old houses that needed work, keen gardeners and high home ownership. He said the company had its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d about the prospect of the UK exiting the EU and this would not affect its plans. \u201cWe are here for the long run and seeing nothing that doesn\u2019t tell us that home improvement retailing has good prospects,\u201d he said.",

Morrisons said in a statement: \u201cWe are saddened and disappointed to learn that My Local is about to enter administration. We want to help our former colleagues who now work for My Local. We can therefore confirm that if no buyer is found, and stores close, we will welcome our former colleagues back to a job at Morrisons.\u201d The accountancy firm KPMG, which has been working with My Local\u2019s management on considering options for the future of the 120-store chain, was lined up on Tuesday afternoon to handle an administration. It is not certain whether administrators will be appointed; the notice provides protection from creditors for 10 days before the company potentially tips into administration. Any appointment could mean a possible liability of up to \u00a320m for Morrisons, which sold the convenience store chain for \u00a325m in September 2015 to a group fronted by the retail veteran Mike Greene, who appeared on the Channel 4 show The Secret Millionaire. The My Local deal was backed by Greybull Capital, which was a co-investor, along with OpCapita, in Comet, the electrical retailer that collapsed in controversial circumstances in 2012. As part of the sale of its convenience stores, Morrisons retained a guarantee on a number of lease obligations, meaning that they will revert to the supermarket if My Local collapses. At the time of the sale, the leases on the stores were thought to have an average of about five years remaining. Morrisons sold 140 My Local stores, at which about 2,300 people were employed, but it is understood that 25 have already closed or been sold on, and about 600 jobs have gone as the chain has downsized amid disappointing sales. The chain has suffered because of the poor location of its stores, many of which were former Blockbuster sites bought when the video rental chain went bankrupt. The grocery market is in the middle of a price war prompted by the rise of the discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have been rapidly opening stores and winning over more customers. My Local is the latest retailer to come under pressure following the collapse of BHS and Austin Reed, both of which called in administrators in April. Brantano went into administration in January, but the majority of jobs were saved after the footwear chain was bought back by its owner Alteri a month later.",

The bank said: We believe our earnings forecasts are in line with consensus for 2015/16, although we appear to be ahead on cash generation. We forecast net sales of\u00a310.5bn and operating profit of \u00a33,078m (versus consensus of \u00a33,008m).

In the US, the \u201cactivation army\u201d initiative that commenced around a year ago and was directed at the US on-trade segment appears to have had an impact (National Alcohol Beverage Control Association \u2013 NABCA \u2013 data show a volume improvement in the US for Diageo to around 3.0% in recent months versus around 0.5% 12 months ago), although this improvement does not appear to be captured by Nielsen data (which focuses on off-premise data). In India, United Spirits\u2019 (of which Diageo is the majority shareholder) 2016 results to March 2016 were strong (sales were up by 13% year on year and EBIT margins increased by 300 basis point year on year). However, we expect Nigeria to have experienced a tough trading environment due to a) difficult macro generally b) high comps from last year\u2019s success of Orijin (a ready to drink) and c) currency weakness. In 2015/16, we expect an improving top line that delivers growth (Berenberg: +4.0%) more in line with what we believe is the company\u2019s potential. This will again combine with strong cash generation, leaving Diageo\u2019s valuation (a 2016/17 estimated free cash flow yield of 4.9%, enterprise value/EBITA of 14.9 times and a dividend yield of 3.3%) as the lowest across our spirits coverage.

      "bodyText": "Toymaker Hornby has warned its future is in doubt unless shareholders back an \u00a38m emergency fundraising plan. The company, which makes Scalextric and Corgi toy cars but is best known for model railways and train sets, urged investors to back the share placing or risk the demise of the century-old brand. Roger Canham, Hornby\u2019s executive chairman, said: \u201cI am highly confident that our shareholders will approve the placing but would draw to your attention the fact that if they are not approved there are serious concerns over the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. \u201cThe fact that the placing is yet to be approved by shareholders represents a material uncertainty.\u201d Hornby announced its turnaround plan following a year marred by a string of profit warnings, a plunging share price and the departure of its chief executive, Richard Ames, who left in February as the company\u2019s financial woes deepened. As part of the plan, the company said it would cut the number of products it sells but reassured customers that its most popular UK brands \u2013 which also include Airfix and Humbrol \u2013 would be retained. Hornby plans to slash the number of individual product lines by about 40% by the end of this year, focusing on those that generate higher margins. It will leave the company with about 1,400 products, and reduce Hornby\u2019s capital spending. The toymaker said on Wednesday it had signed a \u00a310m, three-and-a-half year facility with its bankers, dependent on the completion of the \u00a38m equity raising plan. Earlier this year, the company revealed it had come close to breaching a lending agreement with its bank. Hornby crashed \u00a313.5m into the red in the year to 31 March 2016. The previous year it lost \u00a3200,000. Revenue dropped to \u00a355.8m from \u00a358.1m. UK sales were hit last summer because of disruption caused by new computer systems while business in Europe was also affected by the revamp and the non-arrival of products from China. Sales in Britain recovered in December but then plunged after Christmas as retailers decided not to order new stocks. Steve Cooke, Hornby\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cLast year was difficult and disappointing as we faced significant challenges during the continued turnaround and improvement of the business. \u201cWe were pleased with the progress made in modernising many of our systems and processes, but much of the change last year resulted in substantial unplanned disruption which had a significant adverse impact on trading performance. \u201c[A] review [of the business] has identified areas that require fundamental change. The turnaround plan is intended to return the business to sustainable profitability and cash generation.\u201d Popular products in the last financial year included Hornby\u2019s \u201cFlying Scotsman\u201d set, sales of which were boosted by the Flying Scotsman\u2019s inaugural journey from London King\u2019s Cross to York in February. Hornby said it would not be paying a dividend to shareholders for the fourth year in a row, because of the \u201csignificant challenges\u201d facing the business. The company said it expected to see the business benefit from the implementation of the turnaround plans from early 2017. \u201cOnce we have completed the changes demanded by the new plan this year, the business will be in a position to grow and succeed into the medium term,\u201d Canham said. Shares in the company rose 1.3% to 30p after the results were published.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are edging lower with uncertainty growing as the day of the UK\u2019s vote on Europe approaches. With polls continuing to suggest a lead, albeit narrow, for remaining in the EU, housebuilders are gaining ground again. The sector is expected to suffer in the case of Brexit, so a vote to remain should benefit them. Taylor Wimpey is up 2.6p at 188.2p while Persimmon has put on 28p to \u00a320.74. But InterContinental Hotels has fallen 34p to \u00a326.16 as Goldman Sachs moved from buy to neutral and removed the group from its pan-European buy list. The bank pointed to increased competition from the likes of Airbnb and cut its earnings forecasts for the next three years by 3% to 9%. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 2.52 points to 6224.03. Mark Priest, head of market making at ETX Capital, said: A very muted opening on the FTSE today as investors seem to be waiting for the EU referendum. The recent poll-inspired surge looks like it has run its course and trading is going pretty sideways for now. Any last minute shifts in polls could radically change things but while the result is too close to call investors seem unwilling to take any big decisions until after the vote. A vote for Brexit would be a short-term shock for UK equities, while a win for Remain would likely see a wave of relief in the City and a rally for stocks. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the predicted slump in sterling if Britain votes to leave could be a boon for FTSE 100 companies, which derive about 80% of their earnings from abroad. Miners in particular could benefit. A 0.2% fall in third quarter like for like sales has seen Debenhams drop 4.05p to 70.20p, and also pushed peers lower. Marks &amp; Spencer is down 5.2p at 3589.8p, Next has fallen 45p to \u00a354.20 and Primark owner Associated British Foods has lost 87p to \u00a328.14. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation on ABF, moving from overweight to equal weight and saying: We take a fresh look at Primark and emerge with a more cautious view on valuation. We still think it a great business, but are very conscious that its like for likes have slowed markedly over the last around 18 months. Elsewhere a profit warning from speciality chemicals group Elementis has seen its shares plunge more than 8% to 207.2p. The company said sales and margins outside North America for its chromium business would be much lower than the previous year, so full year earnings per share would be below market expectations. N+1 Singer said: Elementis\u2019 first half pre-close update highlights further pressures within Chromium export markets. The relative strength of the US dollar has created a challenging competitive environment in Eastern Europe in particular and, as a result, Chromium sales and margins outside of North America are expected to be materially lower than the previous year. Despite good progress in Specialties and a steady performance from Chromium in North America, earnings per share for the year as a whole will fall below previous expectations. We reduce our pretax profit and earnings per share forecasts by 12% in all three forecast years, assuming no recovery in Chromium over the period. One strong positive in the announcement is confirmation that the net cash position at the end of the year is still expected to be ahead of the prior year (implying no change to dividend per share forecasts), which should provide support, given the implied 5% yield.",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams said sales in the third quarter were hit by a \u201cvolatile\u201d retail market, falling demand for clothes and uncertainty created by the EU referendum. The department store chain said the tough trading backdrop was partly the result of a longer-term shift in spending habits, as consumers choose to spend more money on holidays, new cars and eating out, and less on clothing. Shares fell almost 5% after Debenhams reported a 0.2% drop in like-for-like sales \u2013 excluding sales at stores open for less than a year \u2013 in the third quarter ending 11 June. Michael Sharp, the chief executive of Debenhams, said a number of factors had created a weaker trading backdrop since the beginning of a year. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be living on planet zog not to have seen there has been a period of uncertainty. The timing changes of Easter, Father\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day, a weaker clothing market and clearly the referendum have come together to create an uncertain trading environment.\u201d He said Debenhams was responding to a broader shift in shopping habits, with people spending more of their disposable income on \u201cexperiences\u201d, such as eating out. \u201cThis is why we want to grow our food business. We need to capitalise on that,\u201d he said. Debenhams said while clothing sales had fallen in recent weeks, sales of swimwear and luggage \u2013 and anything else linked with holidays \u2013 had risen. The retailer said it was rolling out its casual dining offer, so that by Christmas 2016 about 40% of Debenhams stores will have a new food offer. It is opening a third dining option, Italian restaurant Franco Manca, at its Westfield White City store in west London. Debenhams will also introduce the Claire\u2019s Accessories brand into 15 stores. The retailer said it expected zero gross margin growth in the full year, after previously guiding growth between zero and 0.5 percentage points. Profits however are still expected to come in within the range of market forecasts. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst, said the third-quarter fall in like-for-like sales was not as sharp as the City expected: \u201cThanks to good sales of beauty, like-for-like sales are only 0.2% down, which is a relief, and although gross margins have felt some impact from promotional activity in womenswear, overall full-year profits are in line to be within the range of expectations, thanks to good cost control. \u201cBy implication, profits won\u2019t be at the top of the range \u2026 so the shares have sagged first thing.\u201d This week is Sharp\u2019s final week as boss of Debenhams. He announced his decision to leave last autumn after shareholders pushed for a change at the top following a series of poor results and profit warnings. He will be replaced by Sergio Bucher, the vice-president of Amazon\u2019s European fashion business.",
