      "bodyText": "Hopes that Greece can resolve its financial crisis following Thursday\u2019s late night mini-summit gave markets a lift, while the US Federal Reserve\u2019s comments this week on interest rates also helped sentiment. The FTSE 100 finally breached the 7000 barrier, with European markets and Wall Street all moving higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 60.19 points or 0.86% higher at 7022.51 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.18% to 12,039.37 France\u2019s Cac was 1% higher at 5087.49 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 1.63% to 23,176.68 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.96% 11,419.6 The Athens market added 2.87% to 744.42 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 227 points or 1.26% higher. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Over in the US, Wall Street is now 180 points higher on hopes that any US interest rate rises will be gradual. The move higher in the US was the final push needed to see the FTSE 100 safely over 7000, with the UK index also helped by the more encouraging prospects for Greece after the summit. Meanwhile it appears the June, July and September Federal Reserve meetings are all under consideration for a US rate rise. That comment has come from Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart. He said the economy was still giving off mixed signals, and he expects slower growth than he did before, but mid-year is still a good time for an increase in borrowing costs. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the press conference given by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras after the Euro summit in Brussels: The prime minister underlined that the so-called fifth review does not exist anymore and that the Greek authorities will have the responsibility to draw up and implement the list of reforms. He also said that in the summit meeting it was reaffirmed, on the highest possible level, that Greece is faced with a humanitarian crisis that will have to be addressed jointly. The prime minister underlined that there is no problem of short-term liquidity for the Greek economy, adding that \u201cour obligations to the citizens and the European institutions will be met, while bank deposits are secure.\u201d He called on the Greek citizens to be calm and noted that \u201cwe will not be overcome by the atmosphere of insecurity,\u201d warning that those who want to play with the stability of the Greek economy and the banking system try in vain. The recession measures are over, Tsipras repeated. Meanwhile in the UK, the FTSE 100 has hit 7000 for the first time, 17 years after reaching 6000. Despite the positive aspects of last night\u2019s mini-summit, leaks out of Greece suggest the meeting was not all smiles, reports Helena Smith: Greek media are reporting that while prime minister Alexis Tsipras got to sit at high table with Europe\u2019s power brokers last night, he also came under immense pressure from the German chancellor Angela Merkel and EU commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. Both expressed their frustration with Athens\u2019 perceived foot-dragging with Merkel making clear that she wanted specifics on what reforms would be brought to parliament and what privitizations the government would proceed with. \u201cThe prime minister emphasised that he was not opposed to privatizations but on the condition that they were supported by international cooperation and would help spur jobs and growth,\u201d the well-briefed news portal Newsit reported. Juncker voiced his irritation at the way technical teams representing creditors had been treated in Athens in recent weeks. The EU commission chief also expressed displeasure with statements made by the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. \u201cNeither the scene nor the dialogue was laid with rose petals for the Greek prime minister,\u201d wrote Newsit.gr. And with that, it\u2019s over. On tax evasion, Tsipras said there was a total of \u20ac2bn worth of which he believed \u20ac800m was accessible. \u201cNext week we will welcome a minister from Switzerland to have a discussion about the Greek depositors and to get an agreement with [the Swiss]\u201d. He brushed off suggestions finance minister Varoufakis was a source of problems with its partners, and also said it was not a clash between Greece and Germany, but an EU situation. \u201cI cannot say to Chancellor Merkel you should change your ministers, it is a sovereign issue.\u201d On the summit he said he thought there was a common understanding, there was an opportunity to build up a relationship and restore confidence. But he criticised people trying to undermine the February 20 agrement: \u201cwe can\u2019t accept people trying to terrorise the Greek people.\u201d And he mentioned - unflateringly - the comments by Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem that capital controls like those used in Cyprus could be used in Greece. He admitted they were in uncharted waters. \u201cwith our own lack of experience.\u201d But \u201cwe have been negotiating effectively. We are open to receiving advice and so on, but we have our own opinions.\u201d Not sure Merkel has confirmed that yet... Alexis Tsipras has begun speaking: Heads-up. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is about to brief the press in Brussels. I think it will be streamed live here. European Council president Donald Tusk has been asked whether David Cameron might be able to renegotiate Britain\u2019s position in Europe if he wins May\u2019s general election. Tusk replies that achieving Treaty changes are almost like Mission Impossible -- a point he made to The Guardian in an interview a week ago. But he then explains that Mission Impossible is a film with a happy ending. Tusk wants to find a solution that addresses the UK\u2019s concerns, while keeping the \u201cfundamental values\u201d of the EU. [he doesn\u2019t elaborate, but I guess this includes movement of labour]. We need to find good solutions for the United Kingdom under current treaties...But if necessary we can talk about Mission Impossible with goodwill to win in the end. He\u2019s sure that David Cameron understood that. The Greek message has got through: Angela Merkel adds that she may discuss Greece\u2019s reform plans with Alexis Tsipras on Monday, when he visits Berlin. But she won\u2019t be drawn on Greece\u2019s demands for WW2 reparations: Angela Merkel is fielding questions on the Greek bailout talks now. She\u2019s insisted, several times, that Greece will only get its bailout funds if its lenders are satisfied that it has met the terms of its aid programme. Merkel also pledged that Athens will have \u2018ownership\u2019 of the reforms, and denied that she considered that Greece might leave the eurozone. Tom Nuttall of The Economist has won himself a bottle of Guardian whisky by tweeting the details: In the main press conference room, European Council president Donald Tusk says it was useful to have a \u2018reality check\u2019 on the Greek situation. Last night\u2019s talks were an important step towards rebuilding trust, he adds, before a technical gremlin strikes: If I\u2019m reelected, I\u2019ll have a powerful mandate to deliver change in our relationship with Europe, says David Cameron. David Cameron also touches on the issue of a referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership. The most important thing is to change Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe once and for all, he says. David Cameron is giving a press conference too - at what might possibly be his last European Council summit. With the general election looming, the PM declares Britain has made strong progress since his first EUCO in 2010. We have created more jobs than the rest of the eurozone and indeed Yorkshire has created more jobs than France (that\u2019s a reheated line from Wednesday\u2019s budget) Cameron also says that Eastern Ukraine was also on the agenda. He\u2019s pleased that leaders have agreed that Russian sanctions will not be eased until the Minsk agreements have been implemented in full. Angela Merkel is telling reporters that Mario Draghi urged Eurozone countries to continue with their economic reforms. They must not slacken, just because the low oil price is providing a stimulus. And she pointedly points out that Ireland, the austerity poster-boy, is now growing strongly. And she cites Middle Eastern terrorism as a major concern: Angela Merkel waits for no man, not even if he\u2019s struggling with his headphones... Angela Merkel will give a press conference soon too: But will foreign journalists know what she says? Brace yourselves; we\u2019re about to get a flurry of press conferences in Brussels. With any luck, the press pack will tweet the key points from the various briefings (thanks in advance!). Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker are going to speak to the press now; there\u2019s a live stream here. The Brussels summit is over. The EC\u2019s top spokesman tweets that that progress has been made on several issues. Not Greece? That\u2019s because its bailout wasn\u2019t officially on the EUCO agenda, despite last night\u2019s meeting on the \u2018sidelines\u2019 Finland\u2019s PM confirms that the lid is on. A quick recap, while we wait for EU leaders to finish their summit in Brussels An uneasy calm has descended on the eurozone, following last night\u2019s meeting on the Greek bailout in Brussels. Greek bonds are rallying, following reports that \u20ac1.9bn of bailout funds could be handed over to Athens soon, if it delivers an updated reform plan to its creditors. The Greek government is upbeat, vowing to work in a \u2018constructive spirit\u2019 with lenders. Greece hopes that it might receive much-needed funds once it has presented credible reforms. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis hopes it can be a watershed moment in eurozone relations, saying: Let us implement it immediately, as our leaders have urged in yesterday\u2019s informal Brussels meeting. Looking ahead, and beyond current tensions, our joint task is to re-design Europe so that Germans and Greeks, along with all Europeans, can re-imagine our monetary union as a realm of shared prosperity. There\u2019s talk that eurogroup finance ministers could meet again soon, possibly on Friday. That\u2019s pushing down the yield on Greek bonds: Analysts, though, warn that relations between Berlin and Athens remain poor. Germany has pointed out that nothing has fundamentally changed; Greece must still deliver concrete reforms. It\u2019s not clear what reforms Greece will now present; hard-line left-wingers in the Greek government could block new austerity measures. And don\u2019t forget that any deal only gets Greece to the end of June. A third bailout may still be needed: The word in Brussels is that Greece could (finally) receive \u20ac1.9bn from its bailout funds soon, if it pleases its creditors. That\u2019s the profit that creditors made on their holdings of Greek bonds which, not unreasonably, is due to be returned to Athens. As well as building bridges with Germany Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras must also handle his own Syriza party. As Helena Smith explains, diehard leftists will simply not accept new austerity measures: Any suggestion of a \u201cnew memorandum\u201d being passed by the government will almost certainly be rejected by Syriza\u2019s militant wing. The government\u2019s assertion in recent days of \u201ca lack of clarity\u201d surrounding the February 20 agreement extending Greece\u2019s bailout accord, has been dismissed as smoke and mirrors by opposition politicians who accuse the media-savvy administration of playing a \u201cgame of impressions.\u201d \u201cThere is, in contrast to the assertions of Varoufakis, nothing unclear about the 20 February deal,\u201d the political commentator Ioannis Pretenderis writes in Ta Nea today. \u201cIt is most clear \u2026 that in all processes, the \u201cinstitutions,\u201d that is to say the troika, have a central role. They [the government] understand very well what they agreed but now they are making out that they didn\u2019t understand \u2026 and that is how we have arrived where we are today, up against the wall. In a situation that Varoufakis would call in game theory a \u201close-lose situation.\u201d Because whether it clashes or compromises, there will be a huge cost for the government.\u201d The communication\u2019s strategy is aimed squarely at dampening dissent within Syriza, analysts say. \u201cTsipras desperately needs a face-saving deal and last night was all about him seeking one that he can sell to voters back home,\u201d the political scientist Dimitris Kerides tells Helena. \u201cThe Europeans clearly refused to give him one so now he is faced with a hard sell. On Monday he will plead with Merkel for flexibility but beyond a few consoling words she won\u2019t give him it because public opinion in Germany is now so against Greece.\u201d Speculation is growing in Greece that eurozone finance ministers could meet in a week\u2019s time. Greeks media are citing a EU commission source as saying the euro group will meet in urgent session next Friday, March 27, to debate whether to release funds from the \u20ac7.2bn still pending for Greece, Helena Smith adds. \u201cAll will depend on Greece delivering a detailed list of reforms,\u201d the source is quoted as saying. Hard to have a eurogroup meeting otherwise.... The good news for Alexis Tsipras is that Angela Merkel doesn\u2019t expect him to present his new reform plan on Monday, when he visits Berlin. That\u2019s according to government spokesperson Christiane Wirtz, at a press conference in Germany, who said: There is no date, not even Monday, on which this concrete reform list has to be presented but these reform suggestions must of course be presented relatively soon. Wirtz added that Germany still wants Greece to stay in the eurozone, but it must deliver those reforms. GERMAN GOV\u2019T SPOKESWOMAN SAYS ESSENTIALLY NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN THE PROCESS REGARDING GREEK BAILOUT GERMAN GOV\u2019T SPOKESWOMAN SAYS IT IS NOW UP TO GREECE TO COME UP WITH CONCRETE PROPOSALS (via Reuters) Despite the relief this morning, the bottom line is that Athens still has to satisfy its creditors: It will take more than a Yanis Varoufakis blogpost to rebuild relations between Greece and Germany. Joan Hoey, regional editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says last night\u2019s talks may have averted a complete meltdown in relations: The early-hours talks resulted in a commitment by Mr Tsipras to come up with a new reform package within days and provided a breathing space for the beleaguered Greek government. But the political goodwill needed to get a compromise has been eroded... The Syriza-IG government has antagonised the euro zone\u2019s most powerful member by focusing on Germany\u2019s brutal occupation of Greece during the second world war. Chancellor Merkel has invited Mr Tsipras to Berlin on Monday March 23rd, but it may be difficult now to repair the damage that has been done. German public opinion has turned decisively against Greece and senior members of the German government, notably the minister of finance, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appear to have lost patience with their counterparts in Athens. The EU\u2019s institutional bias toward compromise is very strong, but there is now so much bad blood between Germany and Greece that relations are becoming intractable. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has called for an end to the, err, finger-pointing that had hurt relations between Greece and Germany. In a new blogpost, Varoufakis argues that both countries must put the mistakes of the past behind them. We can\u2019t undo the Greek bailouts of 2010 and 2012 (which he opposed), but we can make Europe better. First, we should work towards ending the toxic \u2018blame game\u2019 and the moralising finger-pointing which benefit only the enemies of Europe. Secondly, we need to focus on our joint interest: On how to grow and to reform Greece rapidly, so that the Greek state can best repay debts it should never have taken on while looking after its citizens as a modern European state ought to do. In practical terms, the 20th February Eurogroup agreement offers an excellent opportunity to move forward. Let us implement it immediately, as our leaders have urged in yesterday\u2019s informal Brussels meeting. Looking ahead, and beyond current tensions, our joint task is to re-design Europe so that Germans and Greeks, along with all Europeans, can re-imagine our monetary union as a realm of shared prosperity. Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is also in focus today, with the leaders of Germany, France and the UK holding a meeting with Europe\u2019s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini this morning: According to Reuters, the 40 minute meeting focused on \u201cexchanging information on the state of negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear program\u201d. Journalists in Brussels have stopped squinting at the sun, to report that eurozone finance ministers might meet in a week\u2019s time to discuss Greece\u2019s new reform plans. Greek officials say that the famous list of reforms agreed to overnight will almost certainly be compiled before Easter. The big question, of course, says Helena is which Easter? Catholic Easter, celebrated by most Europeans, and certainly Germany, falls on April 5th this year. Greek Orthodox Easter falls on April 12. In the new spirit of being nice to one another the finance ministry has released a statement welcoming moves by technical teams representing creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports: Under the title \u201cdiscussions with the technical teams\u201d it describes the auditors\u2019 preparation of a list of requirements as a \u201cconstructive development\u201d which will bring clarity to further negotiations. \u201cWe have learned that the technical teams are preparing a detailed list of their requirements for fact-finding about the operations of the Greek government and plans for ongoing reforms. This is a constructive development, which the Ministry of Finance welcomes, as it will bring clarity to the Brussels Group deliberations and allow them to proceed in an orderly and effective way, consistent with the February 20th agreements. We look forward to receiving the document when it is ready, and will review and respond to it in the same constructive spirit.\u201d But seasoned crisis watchers in Athens are also signalling caution with many pointing out that last night\u2019s mini-summit has simply marked the \u201cend of the beginning.\u201d As one put it to Helena: \u201cIn many ways we are back where we started, promising a detailed list of reforms, in preparation of another emergency eurogroup meeting that might, or might not, release funds.\u201d However, analysts are also saying that Greece\u2019s liquidity problem has added a new element to the drama: one that could force Athens\u2019 new government to stop foot-dragging and finally implement reforms. Over in Brussels, European leaders have returned for the second day of the European Council summit. The main topics on the agenda are the EU\u2019s economic situation and the current happenings in Libya. I imagine leaders will also discuss last night\u2019s mini-summit meeting on Greece. Smaller nations, such as Belgium, were upset that they weren\u2019t also included. Last night\u2019s agreement has brought some cheer to Greece\u2019s financial markets. The Athens stock market has jumped by 3% in early trading, with bank shares surging by up to 7%. Greek government bonds are also recovering, a little, but remain at dangerous levels. The yields on Greece\u2019s two-year sovereign bond has dropped from 25% to 23.5% last night; encouraging, but still showing a high danger of default. And the 10-year bond yield has fallen too, from 12.28% to 12.02% yesterday. Leaders are gathering in Brussels for day 2 of the summit. Finland\u2019s prime minister Alexander Stubb told reporters outside that progress has been made on the Greek crisis : Greece\u2019s finance ministry says that progress has been made towards reaching a deal wiih its creditors: (the Brussels Group = technical officials from the IMF, the ECB, the EU and Greece) Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the start of trading in London, up 0.3% at 6987 points. A Greek government spokesman has said Athens expects to receive desperately needed funds once it presents a new list of detailed economic reforms. Gabriel Sakellaridis explained a few minutes ago that: \u201cWhat was discussed was that once the reforms are submitted, and in a detailed manner, to the Eurogroup when that happens ... then the funding will be unlocked towards the Greek economy.\u201d Sakellaridis added that Athens intended to progress fast with implementing such proposals (via Reuters). There was speculation overnight that the eurogroup (the gathering of eurozone finance ministers) could meet next week to discuss these new reforms, but nothing official yet: Here\u2019s the official statement issued after the meeting (for any readers who weren\u2019t awake at 2am): Statement by the Presidents of the European Council, the Commission and the Eurogroup on Greece We fully adhere to the agreement of the Eurogroup of 20 February 2015. In the spirit of mutual trust, we are all committed to speed up the work and conclude it as fast as possible. Within the framework of the Eurogroup agreement of 20 February 2015, the Greek authorities will have the ownership of the reforms and will present a full list of specific reforms in the next days. We reconfirmed the practical agreement on the process: The policy talks take place in Brussels. The fact-finding missions take place in Athens. The Eurogroup stands ready to reconvene as soon as possible. Good morning. Seasoned Eurozone crisis watchers got a taste of the old days last night, as key European leaders met in Brussels to discuss Greece\u2019s financial plight. And after talks that dragged on beyond 2am Brussels time, Greece\u2019s prime minister was urged to deliver detailed reforms very quickly in return for the aid needed to avoid defaulting on its debts. As we covered in our earlier live blog, bleary-eyed leaders emerged blinking from the talks after three hours to announce that, well, there wasn\u2019t a big breakthrough. But Greece has agreed to present \u201ca full list of specific reforms\u201d soon. There is hope that the talks between the main powerbrokers in the Eurozone can break the deadlock with creditors. As one official explained to the BBC: The message to Greece was simple - \u201cgive us a list fast, then you can get the money fast\u201d. And Athens needs the money. Fears of a liquidity crisis is growing, with Athens due to repay \u20ac350m to the International Monetary Fund today. After the meeting broke up, Angela Merkel told reporters that Alexis Tsipras had agreed to present reforms: The Greek prime minister declared he is willing to submit such a list and do so quickly....That is needed urgently, and it is needed to focus minds. An upbeat-looking Tsipras, though, told journalists that Greece is not caving in: As Reuters put it: \u201cIt is clear that Greece is not obliged to implement recessionary measures,\u201d the 40-year-old Greek premier told reporters, referring to previously agreed reforms. \u201cGreece will submit its own structural reforms, which it will implement.\u201d After a short sleep, leaders should be returning for the second day of the summit. Here\u2019s my colleague Ian Traynor\u2019s latest dispatch from Brussels: We\u2019ll be tracking the main events in Brussels, and across the world economy and financial markets, through the day......",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has soared through the 7,000 barrier for the first time in its history, with investors buoyed by the prospect of continuing low interest rates and growing hopes that a solution may finally be found to Greece\u2019s financial crisis. Seventeen years after the leading index hit 6,000, it finally added the next 1,000 points after a number of attempts, notably in 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom. Last year there were predictions that the index would reach new peaks, but after coming close a number of times, it always fell at the final hurdle as new risks \u2013 ebola, the Ukraine crisis, the eurozone \u2013 emerged. But on Friday, it closed 60.19 points higher at a record 7,022.51, a near-1% rise on the day. The initial impetus came after a late-night European summit on Thursday, when Greece\u2019s eurozone creditors agreed to provide more funding if the country drew up a list of reforms as soon as possible. The more positive tone eased fears that Greece would be forced out of the eurozone, causing a new financial crisis for the global economy. An opening rise on Wall Street as fears of a US interest rate rise eased gave the final push to UK shares. Markets have been supported for months by central banks\u2019 policy of low interest rates and pumping money into the financial system, with the European Central Bank starting its own quantitative easing programme earlier this month. But there had been some nervousness that with signs of the US economy improving, the Federal Reserve would soon begin raising interest rates. However, Fed chief Janet Yellen this week signalled a slower path for interest rate rises in the world\u2019s biggest economy. The Washington-based central bank indicated that while there might still be a rise in the cost of credit this year in response to some strong economic figures, interest rates would remain at modest levels for several years. Trevor Green, head of Institutional Equities at Aviva Investors, said: \u201cInvestors took comfort from the fact that interest rates in the US and UK look unlikely to rise any time soon. Lower oil prices in particular are helping to improve consumer discretionary income which should feed back into higher spending. The ECB may well have been late to start quantitative easing, but ironically its arrival coincides with improving eurozone economic data. As our primary trade partner, this is good news for earnings for those exposed to the region.\u201d George Osborne\u2019s budget on Wednesday was also well received by investors, with benefits for savers and help for businesses. The London market was helped by a revival in mining shares as commodity prices recovered some ground, lifted by a weaker dollar following the Fed meeting and news that Chinese inventories had fallen, a positive sign for the outlook for future demand. Risers included Irish cement firm CRH, which surged on expectations of a lucrative deal to pick up assets jettisoned from the Holcim-Lafarge merger. There was also takeover news, with TSB agreeing a \u00a31.7bn takeover by Spanish lender Banco Sabadell in one of the biggest cross-border banking deals since the financial crisis of 2007-09. But there was some uncertainty about the outlook for equities after their record breaking run. Fund manager Peter Cameron at Ecclesiastical Investment Management said: \u201cUnlike when the market was gripped by an irrational technology bubble, this new high should not cause alarm amongst investors. A backdrop of inflation tailwinds from declining food and fuel prices, falling unemployment and signs of wage growth finally returning, create a benign outlook for the UK economy in 2015. Improving economic activity within the eurozone, our largest trading partner, will also act as a tailwind, as should recent comments from the Bank of England which indicate interest rates may stay lower for even longer than investors expect. \u201c But Chris Williams, chief executive of Wealth Horizon, said: \u201cThe FTSE 100 finally breached 7,000 having already set numerous record highs in 2015. While this is great news for investors in UK equities, it presents a conundrum for what comes next. Certainly, no one can say equities look like a bargain at these levels, so the key for investors is to diversify their exposure and make sure they are not taking too much risk on any one market.\u201d The forthcoming general election in the UK could also cause some volatility in the coming weeks.",

      "bodyText": "From the street, Josh Tetrick\u2019s office in San Francisco\u2019s up-and-coming industrial South of Market district looks like a coffee shop with half a dozen young hipster-types drinking coffees while tapping away on MacBook Airs on a long wooden bench as a golden retriever, yorkshire terrier and poodle cross lounge at their feet. Once inside, the office turns out to be part-coffee shop, part-science lab. At the back, a team of scientists in lab coats are busy with titration kits and molecular formulas, while Michelin-starred chefs are cooking up some scrambled eggs \u2013 without cracking any eggs. Welcome to the headquarters of Hampton Creek: Tetrick\u2019s three-year-old startup which he hopes will disrupt the world food industry by replacing eggs (and other water-intensive foods) with plants. \u201cAlthough what we\u2019re doing may sound odd to outsiders, the neighbours were glad when we moved in,\u201d says Tetrick, a strapping 34-year-old former football linebacker from the deep south. \u201cThis used to be a Hell\u2019s Angels hangout and it was listed on Google Maps as having orgies.\u201d Now Tetrick is using the nondescript building by the corner of Sheridan and 10th Street as mission control to take on the world\u2019s biggest food companies and help save the planet. Tetrick says the motivation for starting Hampton Creek, which was born in his Los Angeles apartment in December 2011, was twofold. First, his noticing that the global food industry was \u201cfucking up the world\u201d and, second, as a way to encourage people who didn\u2019t really care what they were eating to eat slightly more healthily. Tetrick\u2019s father was the original inspiration. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t give a fuck what he was eating. It was all shitty, shitty food and I realised there were people eating like that all over the world,\u201d he says. Tetrick, who is from Alabama and read law at the University of Michigan Law School, came up with an idea. He admits it wasn\u2019t much of a business plan; it contained just 14 slides and didn\u2019t explain exactly how he planned to tackle the problems of the global food industry. Even so, it got him a $500,000 investment from Vinod Khosla, the billionaire venture capitalist and founder of Sun Microsystems. \u201cIt was a bet,\u201d says Tetrick. \u201cHe was betting on an idea. When you start explaining the [global food] system, people say \u2018you\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me\u2019.\u201d Tetrick has since convinced some of the world\u2019s most prominent investors to take a punt on him. Shareholders include Asia\u2019s richest man Li Ka-shing, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, former Yahoo boss Jerry Yang and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin. It has also been backed by Bill Gates as a company shaping the future of food. Tetrick has refused to take investment from other big names. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned a lot of folks down because they either don\u2019t think long-term enough or they would be too hands-on; we don\u2019t want hands-on \u2026 \u201cI mean you\u2019re investing in Hampton Creek \u2013 you\u2019re investing in fucking moonshot. You\u2019re not investing in Hampton Creek because you\u2019re going to make a little money. You\u2019re either going to make nothing or you\u2019re going to make a shit tonne.\u201d Tetrick says he\u2019s more concerned about changing the world than making money. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have an impact with water not being used, with land not being used, with carbon emissions not being pushed into the atmosphere, with to some extent chicken eggs not being used as much,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we will continue powering away for.\u201d At present, Hampton Creek\u2019s two main products are egg-free mayo and egg-free cookies (which the company bills as cookies that \u201ccan change the world\u201d). Instead of eggs, Hampton Creek\u2019s Just Mayo is made from Canadian yellow pea, a type of split pea. At first, Tetrick says, the company had no idea which plants could be used as substitutes for the proteins found in eggs, so they just tried a bunch of different ones. The key characteristic is high protein surface hydrophobicity, which allows emulsification. To make the mayo, the Canadian yellow peas are ground down into a powder and added to oil and other ingredients found in mayonnaise in place of egg. He says there\u2019s \u201ca certain rhythm to how we mix it\u201d, but that\u2019s about it. The mayo is on sale at Dollar Tree, Whole Foods and Costco (the latter two also sell the company\u2019s cookie dough) in the US and will go on sale at Tesco in the UK soon. Global catering company Compass Group, which supplies 4bn meals a year to school canteens and hospitals across the US and UK, has recently replaced all its mayonnaise and cookies with Hampton Creek products. According to the company\u2019s own calculations, for every dozen cookies eaten 294 quarts (278 litres) of water are saved. Tetrick, who has no scientific training, is pained by the suggestion that what his company is doing is unnatural and the \u201cFrankensteinisation of food\u201d. \u201cThese guys [his scientists] don\u2019t synthesise things, they\u2019re not splicing DNA together, they\u2019re not growing anything in a petri dish.\u201d Hampton Creek, which was named after his former roommate\u2019s deceased dog, has made some enemies \u2013 mostly among global food conglomerates. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch giant that owns Hellmann\u2019s, filed a lawsuit last year arguing that Hampton Creek shouldn\u2019t be allowed to market its product as \u201cmayo\u201d because it doesn\u2019t contain eggs, which mayonnaise must legally contain in the US. Tetrick said Hampton Creek\u2019s case was threefold. His product is called Just Mayo, not mayonnaise, and it was clearly labelled as egg-free. \u201cThe third thing was a little more controversial, but it\u2019s how we felt,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like \u2018fucking come on guys\u2019. Guys, you have done more than most companies to embed sustainability in your food chain. Your CEO Paul Polman has talked about transformative business models to make the world a better place. Come on, aren\u2019t there better things you can do with your time and your money. It\u2019s not exactly a legal analysis but that third element is what convinced Unilever to drop the case.\u201d After 34 days, Unilever withdrew its lawsuit. Tetrick says Unilever\u2019s lawsuit was a huge public relations win for Hampton Creek. \u201cIt gave us an opportunity to talk about what we are doing and why, and it got global recognition,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter the lawsuit people thought \u2018there\u2019s something about this brand, there\u2019s fight in it\u2019. [People thought] this is a brand that is OK with pissing people off. \u201cEveryone doesn\u2019t have to like what we\u2019re doing. In fact, if everyone likes what we\u2019re doing we\u2019re probably screwing up more than we otherwise would be.\u201d Next on Tetrick\u2019s agenda is scrambled eggs. His head chef, Ben Roche, previously executive pastry chef at Chicago\u2019s Michelin-starred Moto restaurant, is experimenting with various (top secret) plants to try to find one that will provide the same texture as scrambled egg. A sample the Guardian tasted was better than some hotel breakfast scrambled eggs. Tetrick plans to expand to 30 products within three years ranging from custard to pasta. \u201cIf mayo is more than 3% of our revenues in three years, like, we\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201d After that, he is planning on creating a cheap easily produced high-protein snack that could be used to help eliminate hunger in Africa. \u201cWhy does food not serve you, why does food not serve this country, why does food not serve the world? I mean what is the problem? \u201cWhat if there is a protein snack for the developing world, what if there\u2019s an interesting highly nutritious protein snack that potentially we could distribute through the World Food Programme? \u201cTwo and a half billion live in energy poverty without refrigerators. I don\u2019t even know what it means necessarily. [But] I do know that you\u2019re a dumb company if you\u2019re not thinking about serving them. \u201cPart of the meaningful impact we\u2019ll have is if people can see there\u2019s a shit tonne of money to be made riling people up and solving problems, whether that\u2019s a giant food company or some 12-year-old girl somewhere going \u2018fuck this, fuck school, I want to do something else\u2019.\u201d In December, Hampton Creek secured a further $95m of investment, which Tetrick says values the company \u201cin the neighbourhoods of half a billion\u201d. He refuses to say exactly how much of the company he still owns but confirmed he still holds \u201cquite a bit\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been valued as a company that really has the potential to do something. With that valuation I have been able to retain a bit more ownership.\u201d That means that Tetrick, raised in a working-class family in Birmingham, Alabama, is on paper at least a very rich man. \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t really \u2026 I literally do not give a fuck about money at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this makes my investors feel good or not, [but] I have a golden retriever, I have a company car, I have an apartment in [San Francisco\u2019s fancyish] Potrero Hills.\u201d Tetrick says he wouldn\u2019t sell out even if he was offered $1bn. \u201cI just want to get at this,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone could write a cheque right now for $2bn for Hampton Creek. The idea of accepting that \u2026 I would feel nothing but sadness. \u201cI was struggling in my life finding what I actually wanted to do. I had a dream of being a professional athlete, [but] I wasn\u2019t good enough. I spent a while trying to find my way in Africa. \u201cI have finally found what I want to do, what I am good at. I don\u2019t go to sleep at night thinking that I am bullshitting myself, and that feels good.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 March to correct a sentence that stated Compass Group serves prisons.

      "standfirst": "<p>Tesco has sold off control of so many of its Extra hypermarkets and superstores that it now only retains the freehold on 57% of its largest British stores</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Embattled supermarket chain Tesco still owns less than half its British retailing space - even after regaining control of 21 superstores on Friday, a Guardian analysis can reveal.<br></p> <p>The research, which illustrates how the retailerremains exposed to a multi-million-pound timebomb of increasing rents and falling sales, comes as Tesco <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/20/tesco-takes-full-ownership-of-21-superstores-in-deal-with-british-land\">announced a \u00a3733m property swap with British Land</a>, giving it sole ownership of 21 superstores it had previously offloaded into a joint venture with the property group. The partnership had required the supermarket to make rent payments to British Land.</p> <p>Our analysis of Tesco\u2019s British property portfolio \u2013 which drew information from Land Registry records, Tesco\u2019s own store database and documents issued to City investors \u2013 details how the grocer still pays rent on more than half of its British space, after aggressive moves during its boom years raised \u00a37bn by selling freeholds on 179 stores.<br></p> <p>The study shows that:</p> <ul> <li>Tesco has sold off control of so many of its Extra hypermarkets and superstores that it now only controls the freehold on 57% of its largest British stores \u2013 which translates to owning around just 49% of its total British space.<br></li> <li>The grocer has signed rental agreements on numerous Extras and Superstores that commit it to rising rents, even if the stores are losing money.<br></li> <li>The agreed rent rises are linked to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) of inflation, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10612209\">which currently stands at 1.1% and is 0.8 percentage points higher than the more widely used Consumer Prices Index (CPI)</a>, a measure likely to be more closely linked to any price rises achievable in Tesco stores. As a result, Tesco\u2019s rent bill is likely to rise faster than the price of a basket of goods. The grocer\u2019s new management already considers its \u00a31.4bn annual rent bill to be a \u201csignificant part\u201d of its total cash flow.<br></li> </ul> <p>The rent issue threatens to weigh on the efforts of new chief executive Dave Lewis to turnaround the struggling retailer - which saw its UK sales drop by some <a href=\"http://www.tescoplc.com/index.asp?pageid=188&amp;newsid=1074\">\u00a3600m in the first six months of its current financial year</a>, as the supermarket chain continued with competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/10/asda-shows-worst-its-sales-performance-in-20-years\">early signs of a recovery in Tesco sales have been suggested by recent data from industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel</a>. </p> <p>Jaime Vazquez, a retail analyst at JP Morgan, said: \u201cYes, [rent rises at Tesco stores] are linked to inflation. Tesco already spends more than \u00a31bn annually. Of course this is an issue when the top line falls.\u201d</p> <p>In October - during a conference call for investment analysts hosted by Lewis, finance director Alan Stewart and then chairman Sir Richard Broadbent - <a href=\"http://www.tescoplc.com/files/pdf/results/2014/interim/interim_2014-15_webcast.pdf\">Tesco revealed for the first time that it did not own 70% of its freeholds as previously assumed, instead stating that it controlled 53% of its space across the whole of the group</a>. Analysts on that call told the Guardian that the new figure implied an even lower level of freeholds in the UK, where the vast majority of Tesco\u2019s convenience stores are located in leasehold properties, but added that the grocer had been vague about giving details on its freehold properties.</p> <p>Tesco also declined to give detailed answers to the Guardian\u2019s questions about its freehold and leasehold stores. Instead, a spokesperson said: \u201cAs we have previously disclosed, around 53% of our property is owned [worldwide]. We have a mature leasehold portfolio developed over many years which includes varying terms, different start dates and time periods, meaning there are regular opportunities to review rental agreements.\u201d</p> <p>However, during the October conference call Lewis appeared to acknowledge a problem stemming from decisions taken by previous management, when he said: \u201cThere was, strategically and significantly, a very deliberate decision taken a long time ago on sale-and-leaseback.

      "bodyText": "Embattled supermarket chain Tesco still owns less than half its British retailing space - even after regaining control of 21 superstores on Friday, a Guardian analysis can reveal. The research, which illustrates how the retailerremains exposed to a multi-million-pound timebomb of increasing rents and falling sales, comes as Tesco announced a \u00a3733m property swap with British Land, giving it sole ownership of 21 superstores it had previously offloaded into a joint venture with the property group. The partnership had required the supermarket to make rent payments to British Land. Our analysis of Tesco\u2019s British property portfolio \u2013 which drew information from Land Registry records, Tesco\u2019s own store database and documents issued to City investors \u2013 details how the grocer still pays rent on more than half of its British space, after aggressive moves during its boom years raised \u00a37bn by selling freeholds on 179 stores. The study shows that: Tesco has sold off control of so many of its Extra hypermarkets and superstores that it now only controls the freehold on 57% of its largest British stores \u2013 which translates to owning around just 49% of its total British space. The grocer has signed rental agreements on numerous Extras and Superstores that commit it to rising rents, even if the stores are losing money. The agreed rent rises are linked to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) of inflation, which currently stands at 1.1% and is 0.8 percentage points higher than the more widely used Consumer Prices Index (CPI), a measure likely to be more closely linked to any price rises achievable in Tesco stores. As a result, Tesco\u2019s rent bill is likely to rise faster than the price of a basket of goods. The grocer\u2019s new management already considers its \u00a31.4bn annual rent bill to be a \u201csignificant part\u201d of its total cash flow. The rent issue threatens to weigh on the efforts of new chief executive Dave Lewis to turnaround the struggling retailer - which saw its UK sales drop by some \u00a3600m in the first six months of its current financial year, as the supermarket chain continued with competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. However, early signs of a recovery in Tesco sales have been suggested by recent data from industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. Jaime Vazquez, a retail analyst at JP Morgan, said: \u201cYes, [rent rises at Tesco stores] are linked to inflation. Tesco already spends more than \u00a31bn annually. Of course this is an issue when the top line falls.\u201d In October - during a conference call for investment analysts hosted by Lewis, finance director Alan Stewart and then chairman Sir Richard Broadbent - Tesco revealed for the first time that it did not own 70% of its freeholds as previously assumed, instead stating that it controlled 53% of its space across the whole of the group. Analysts on that call told the Guardian that the new figure implied an even lower level of freeholds in the UK, where the vast majority of Tesco\u2019s convenience stores are located in leasehold properties, but added that the grocer had been vague about giving details on its freehold properties. Tesco also declined to give detailed answers to the Guardian\u2019s questions about its freehold and leasehold stores. Instead, a spokesperson said: \u201cAs we have previously disclosed, around 53% of our property is owned [worldwide]. We have a mature leasehold portfolio developed over many years which includes varying terms, different start dates and time periods, meaning there are regular opportunities to review rental agreements.\u201d However, during the October conference call Lewis appeared to acknowledge a problem stemming from decisions taken by previous management, when he said: \u201cThere was, strategically and significantly, a very deliberate decision taken a long time ago on sale-and-leaseback. And it\u2019s been a very big funder of the growth of the group over the period, but we\u2019re now at a point where our freehold property is around 53%. And I have a rent bill - we have a rent bill of around \u00a31.4bn a year. Now when you look at the total cash flow of the company, that\u2019s a significant part.\u201d Examples of the tenancy agreements entered into by the company include the Tesco Extra on the Gateway retail park in Sunderland, which Tesco sold and leased-back two years ago.

British workers paid \u00a34.2bn in self-assessed income tax last month, \u00a31.8bn more than the same month last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. It helped to reduce overall government borrowing by \u00a33.5bn to \u00a36.9bn in February, lower than the \u00a38.5bn forecast by economists. George Osborne made it clear in his final budget before the election that his record on the deficit and credentials as a safe pair of hands to steer the economy forward will be a key battleground in the runup to the polls in May.

Alliance said in a statement on Friday: \u201cThe board considers that this type of action potentially threatens the very existence of the company, and rides roughshod over our long-term shareholders, our customers and our over 250 employees. \u201cThe Board considers that, having nominated directors to the company\u2019s board, Elliott would pursue a short-term agenda aimed at facilitating an exit from its shareholding in the company. Given the size of its position, this would involve disruptive actions which are not in the long-term interests of our shareholders.\u201d Alliance revealed on Monday that its activist shareholder was attempting to impose the appointment of Anthony Brooke, formerly of investment bank SG Warburg; Peter Chambers, former chief executive of Legal &amp; General Investment Management; and Rory Macnamara, formerly of investment bank Morgan Grenfell as independent directors on the board. Alliance Trust advised shareholders to reject the proposals at its annual general meeting on 29 April, arguing the candidates could not be judged independent and could result in Elliott seeking \u201cto exert undue influence\u201d. Shortly after Alliance\u2019s statement on Friday, Elliott issued its own. It said: \u201cWe believe that [Alliance\u2019s] decision is indicative of a board that is out of touch with the concerns of its shareholders, and which needs fresh perspectives.\u201d The US investor said the company had ignored a private invitation to hold discussions, accusing it of a \u201cpattern of non-engagement\u201d as it attempted to strengthen the board \u201cfor the benefit of all shareholders\u201d. Elliott dismissed Alliance\u2019s claims about its intentions as speculative. \u201cWe urge all shareholders who agree with Elliott\u2019s view that Alliance Trust requires fresh impetus at the board level to make their views known to the company,\u201d Elliott said. Karin Forseke, Alliance Trust\u2019s chair was defiant, branding Elliott\u2019s proposals \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. She added: \u201cWe pride ourselves on our transparency and honesty with all our shareholders, and as a board we will not lie down and allow one shareholder to dictate the future of Alliance Trust. \u201cWe do not consider their proposed directors to be independent and believe that Alliance Trust\u2019s current board is diverse, dynamic and more than fit for purpose. \u201cThe board is unanimous in strongly recommending that shareholders vote against all of the proposed resolutions.\u201d Shares in Alliance rose 0.2% to 525p.",

Analysts, though, questioned some of the risks associated with the deal, which needs shareholder and regulatory approval. The union that represents half of the bank\u2019s 8,700 staff, the TSBU, immediately sought assurances from management. \u201cIf there is one iron law when it comes to takeovers, it\u2019s that staff costs are the first costs that are put under microscope. Banco Sabadell will talk the talk about growth opportunities, value creation and enhanced revenue streams, but when you separate the wheat from the chaff, it will all come down to money,\u201d said Mark Brown, union general secretary. Paul Pester, the boss of TSB, who is remaining in the job following the takeover, said that no more than five roles \u2013 all in investor relations \u2013 would be affected at the bank, which has 631 branches and 4.6m customers. \u201cThe unions have nothing to worry about, this is about growing TSB, this is about using the extra firepower that Sabadell brings to TSB to expand not only our retail presence but potentially get us into the small business market,\u201d he said. The deal marks the latest chapter in the history of the former Trustee Savings Bank which was bought by Lloyds 20 years ago. It was revived as a separate brand after the EU demanded Lloyds Banking Group spin off 631 branches as a condition of its \u00a320bn bailout by taxpayers in 2008. Lloyds\u2019 plans to sell TSB to Co-op collapsed in 2013 and it resorted to a flotation last June, when the shares were sold at 260p. TSB\u2019s shares ended just below the offer price at 334p while shares Lloyds - just under 23% owned by taxpayers - rose 1% to 80p. Lloyds sold a near 10% stake in TSB to Sabadell and pledged to sell the remaining 40% shareholding to the Spanish bank which was created in 1881 by 127 families in Catalonia. It has grown rapidly since the banking crisis to become the fifth largest bank in Spain and has ambitions to expand further in the UK. Speaking to reporters in Barcelona, Sabadell chief executive Jaime Guardiola said: \u201cThe UK challenger market is unconsolidated. Clearly, we\u2019ll build our first platform, but it\u2019s clear that there is room for consolidation. We are in a position to grow.\u201d Josep Oliu, the chairman, who was in London to present the rare cross-border banking deal, said Sabadell had not been ready to bid for TSB three years ago because it was focusing on domestic growth. He did not rule out further deals in the UK but said they would be \u201cstep by step\u201d. \u201cOur story is not one of cost cutting, our story is one of enhancing revenue,\u201d said Oliu, who has launched a \u00a31.2bn cash call on Sabadell\u2019s investors to fund the cash offer. There had been \u201cno red flags\u201d from regulators in the UK and EU which must approve the deal. He acknowledged that Santander\u2019s presence in the UK had helped to motivate the deal, which he had personally put to the chairman of TSB Will Samuel on February 27. Santander bought Abbey National in November 2004 before taking over Alliance &amp; Leicester and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley although Oliu said Sabadell had no plans to match Santander\u2019s decision in 2010 to stamp its own brand on the UK\u2019s high street. Pester said the bank would \u201ccontinue to look at assets\u201d. George Osborne this week said mortgages the government still owns from the nationalisation of Northern Rock would be sold while a number of challenger banks - such as Aldermore - are often tipped as potential targets. Lloyds will have raised \u00a31.5bn as a result of the deal but it cost \u00a32.6bn to create TSB, including the \u00a3450m it must hand to Sabadell to fund a new IT system for TSB which currently pays Lloyds for its IT. Sabadell estimates \u00a3160m a year in IT savings. Lloyds will take a \u00a3600m charge in the first half to cover the costs. The government has hoped that banks such as TSB \u2013 which has 6% of the UK\u2019s branches but just 4.3% of current accounts \u2013 will be real challengers to the big four of Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC. Andrea Leadsom, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cWe particularly welcome Sabadell\u2019s focus on growing lending to smaller businesses and strengthening TSB\u2019s position as a strong and effective challenger in the UK banking sector\u201d. Even so, Richard Lloyd, executive director of the Which? consumer group, said: \u201cCurrent account switching rates remain depressingly low and the market is crying out for a fresh approach, so any takeover must not lead to a reduction in innovation and competition in the UK banking market, or hit customer service levels.\u201d Sabadell - founded in 1881, now Spain\u2019s fifth largest bank Banco Sabadell, the Catalan bank buying TSB, is one of the few banks to emerge stronger from a financial crisis that has redrawn Spain\u2019s banking sector. Unlike many of its Iberian rivals, the bank is in good shape. Sabadell, founded in 1881 with the aim of financing local industry, reported a 50% increase in annual profits at the end of 2014 to \u20ac371.7m (\u00a3263m). Since 2007, it has doubled in size and is now Spain\u2019s fifth largest bank. It achieved this mainly through an energetic programme of acquisitions in Spain and abroad. It has already acquired the Lloyds TSB network in Spain and Miami, as well as NatWest Spain and the private banking business of its larger Spanish competitor, BBVA, in the US. At the end of 2014, Banco Sabadell Group\u2019s assets were valued at \u20ac161.5bn. It has a network of 2,320 branches \u2013 53 of them outside Spain \u2013 and 6.4 million customers. Restructuring has changed the face of Spanish banking, with the majority of savings banks either being swallowed up by other entities or having disappeared altogether. The most notable was Caja Madrid, now Bankia, which carries a heavy burden of toxic property assets built up in the boom of the previous decade. However, in January the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s declared itself \u201crelatively optimistic\u201d about Spanish banking, which has reduced its debts and begun to recover profitability. The agency said most of the restructuring had been done and it didn\u2019t expect any major changes this year. The agency Fitch also predicted stability for the sector, although it said profitability would be low and there were risks due to the large quantity of \u201cproblematic assets\u201d. Profits rose by 25.7% at Spain\u2019s second-largest bank BBVA in 2014 while Banco Santander\u2019s were up 32%. Since the start of 2014 Banco Popular has been back in the black after finishing 2012 with debts of \u20ac2.4bn. Meanwhile, CaixaBank nearly doubled its profits last year to \u20ac620m.

    "webTitle": "IFS challenges George Osborne over \u00a312bn welfare spending cut plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is under pressure from the Institute for Fiscal Studies to specify how he planned to cut welfare spending by \u00a312bn in the next parliament, and warned the poor had lost most from the coalition\u2019s benefit changes of the past five years. Britain\u2019s leading experts on tax and spending also said the pickup in living standards hailed by the chancellor in his budget was the slowest in modern history and \u201cno cause for celebration\u201d \u2013 although the IFS did suggest living standards on current projections would be higher in 2015 than 2010, a finding that was hailed by Osborne. The IFS director, Paul Johnson, said Osborne\u2019s defence against claims that cuts in Whitehall departmental spending will be even bigger after the election than in the current parliament was that he would raise \u00a312bn from welfare savings and \u00a35bn from a fresh crackdown on tax avoidance. \u201cBut it is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by \u00a312bn. Since then the main announcement has been the plan not to cut anything from the main pensioner benefits,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe have been told about no more than \u00a32bn of the planned cuts to working-age benefits. And, remember, apparently the \u2018plan\u2019 is to have those \u00a312bn of cuts in place by 2017-18. It is time we knew more about what they might actually involve.\u201d Earlier in the day, a senior Conservative minister said the party would not spell out all its welfare cuts until after the general election. David Gauke, the Treasury secretary, was pressed repeatedly on the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics to explain if the Tories would detail their planned welfare cuts beyond the \u00a33bn previously specified. He replied: \u201cWe will set it out nearer the time which will be after the election.\u201d He said such cuts were normally agreed as part of a wider spending review. The current coalition plans would involve a cut of \u00a330bn in public spending in the first three years of the next parliament. Analysis by the IFS showed that this would mean a cumulative cut of 7.2% in departmental spending by 2017-18. But on the assumption that the NHS, overseas aid and schools would continue to be ringfenced, the cuts for unprotected departments, including the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, would be 15.7%. Johnson continued: \u201cThe chancellor argues that because he is committed to \u00a312bn of welfare cuts and \u00a35bn of anti-tax-avoidance measures the required cuts to public service spending are much more modest. But if he really wants us to believe that, then he needs to be more explicit about how he actually thinks he can cut welfare spending and raise substantial additional sums from clamping down on tax avoidance.\u201d Osborne will need unprecedented cuts in welfare to meet targets, said the IFS. After the three-year squeeze up until 2017-18, the plans published in the budget show a sharp increase in spending in the final year of the next parliament. This is a significant deviation from the blueprint in the autumn statement just three months ago, which saw the size of the state as a percentage of the economy in 2020 at its lowest level since the 1930s. Johnson said \u201cthe apparent change in economic philosophy in the three months since the autumn statement is pretty remarkable\u201d. The IFS also challenged Osborne\u2019s claim in the budget that \u201cwe are all in it together\u201d, in its assessment of winners and losers from the benefit changes introduced by the coalition. Johnson said that while those on middle- and upper-middle income benefits had been left \u201cremarkably insulated\u201d on average, benefit cuts had hit those at the bottom of the income distribution, while tax increases had hit hardest those at the top. Looking at the entire period of tax increases and spending cuts since deficit reduction began under the last Labour government in early 2010, the richest had been the biggest losers. \u201cLooking only at changes implemented by the coalition the poorest have seen the biggest proportionate losses,\u201d Johnson said. The IFS also adjudicated in the row between the Conservatives and Labour over whether living standards are higher or lower than they were in 2010. Johnson said Osborne and Ed Miliband were looking at different things, with the chancellor able to say that on his measure of household incomes, living standards should be higher by the end of this year than when the coalition came to power. The Labour leader was looking at earnings, he said. He added average household incomes had just about regained their pre-recession levels. \u201cThey are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010, and possibly higher than their 2009 peak. But that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history. Having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration.\u201d Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \u201cThis proves government\u2019s changes have hit the poorest hardest of all. If the Tories want to spend the election campaign telling people they\u2019ve never had it so good, they\u2019re even more out of touch than I thought.\u201d Conservative sources insisted \u201cthe steady-as-she-goes budget\u201d had struck the right note, and predicted Labour would now chase a fantasy that the cuts meant the NHS was under threat. \u201cIt is pure core vote stuff, and will not work because no one believes David Cameron wants to wreck the NHS,\u201d one government source said.",

But on the assumption that the NHS, overseas aid and schools would continue to be ringfenced, the cuts for unprotected departments, including the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, would be 15.7%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1426787302003/Budget_cuts2.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Johnson continued: \u201cThe chancellor argues that because he is committed to \u00a312bn of welfare cuts and \u00a35bn of anti-tax-avoidance measures the required cuts to public service spending are much more modest. But if he really wants us to believe that, then he needs to be more explicit about how he actually thinks he can cut welfare spending and raise substantial additional sums from clamping down on tax avoidance.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne will need unprecedented cuts in welfare to meet targets, said the IFS.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/18/osborne-unprecedented-cuts-welfare-meet-targets-ifs\">Osborne will need unprecedented cuts in welfare to meet targets, says IFS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the three-year squeeze up until 2017-18, the plans published in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/budget-2015\">the budget</a> show a sharp increase in spending in the final year of the next parliament. This is a significant deviation from the blueprint in the autumn statement just three months ago, which saw the size of the state as a percentage of the economy in 2020 at its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/03/autumn-statement-2014-george-osborne-spending-cuts\">lowest level since the 1930s</a>. Johnson said \u201cthe apparent change in economic philosophy in the three months since the autumn statement is pretty remarkable\u201d.</p> <p>The IFS also challenged Osborne\u2019s claim in the budget that \u201cwe are all in it together\u201d, in its assessment of winners and losers from the benefit changes introduced by the coalition. Johnson said that while those on middle- and upper-middle income benefits had been left \u201cremarkably insulated\u201d on average, benefit cuts had hit those at the bottom of the income distribution, while tax increases had hit hardest those at the top.</p> <p>Looking at the entire period of tax increases and spending cuts since deficit reduction began under the last Labour government in early 2010, the richest had been the biggest losers. \u201cLooking only at changes implemented by the coalition the poorest have seen the biggest proportionate losses,\u201d Johnson said.</p> <p>The IFS also adjudicated in the row between the Conservatives and Labour over whether living standards are higher or lower than they were in 2010. Johnson said Osborne and Ed Miliband were looking at different things, with the chancellor able to say that on his measure of household incomes, living standards should be higher by the end of this year than when the coalition came to power. The Labour leader was looking at earnings, he said.</p> <p>He added average household incomes had just about regained their pre-recession levels. \u201cThey are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010, and possibly higher than their 2009 peak. But that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history. Having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration.\u201d</p> <p>Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \u201cThis proves government\u2019s changes have hit the poorest hardest of all. If the Tories want to spend the election campaign telling people they\u2019ve never had it so good, they\u2019re even more out of touch than I thought.\u201d</p> <p>Conservative sources insisted \u201cthe steady-as-she-goes budget\u201d had struck the right note, and predicted Labour would now chase a fantasy that the cuts meant the NHS was under threat.</p> <p>\u201cIt is pure core vote stuff, and will not work because no one believes David Cameron wants to wreck the NHS,\u201d one government source said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So, in summary, Greece has promised to speed up the implementation of its extended bailout agreement and will send a full list of detailed reform proposals to its euro zone partners very soon. Not a big breakthough, but perhaps all Alexis Tsipras could hope for. It means Greece could yet unlock some of its bailout money, if it can satisfy its creditors with a credibly reform plan. Here\u2019s our latest story: And with that, leaders are heading off for some sleep before day 2 of the summit. The last word goes to Ian Traynor: I\u2019ll be back in a few hours with a new liveblog to cover the second day of the summit, and other developments. Good night. GW Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has told reporters that he\u2019s more optimistic after tonight\u2019s meeting, even though European leaders don\u2019t appear to have budged. French president Francois Hollande is briefing the press now (lifefeed here). He confirms that Greece must present new reform plans ASAP; there\u2019s no time to lose. And he also suggests that some aid could be forthcoming once Greece\u2019s progress has been evaluated. At a brief press conference, Angela Merkel has told reporters that there was \u201cdisappointment\u201d that more progress hasn\u2019t been made since Greece secured its bailout extension a month ago. And finally, the meeting is over. In a short statement, the European Council say that attendees at tonight\u2019s (last night\u2019s) meeting are sticking to the agreement made last month. Greece must present a \u201cfull and adequate\u201d list of reforms, fast, and all sides have agreed to work faster to make progress. Our europe editor Ian Traynor explains: Following three hours of talks that ended after 2 in the morning, German chancellor Angela Merkel made it plain that there would be no quick disbursement of emergency aid to Greece unless Tsipras delivered on unfulfilled pledges to supply a full menu of proposed structural reforms to the Greek economy. The credibility of Tsipras\u2019 proposals would need to be supported by eurozone governments before Greece, on the brink of insolvency, could obtain the financial support. You have to admire these leaders\u2019 stamina... If there are any press briefings in Brussels, they should be streamed online here.... Reporters in Brussels are hearing that Greece is being urged to implement some reforms immediately, to unlock the first slice of its outstanding bailout payment of over 7 billion euros. Greece has apparently been told to be more welcoming to officials representing its creditors in Athens: Those officials returned to Greece a week ago, but have been keeping a low profile. The Greek meeting hasn\u2019t finished yet - Suzanne Lynch of the Irish Times has heard that some common ground is emerging between the leaders: Another date for the diary, possibly.... An EU official has also suggested that another (!) meeting of eurogroup finance ministers may take place soon.... More details on the wires... Details of tonight\u2019s meeting are starting to emerge. An EU official has told Bloomberg that talks between Greece and its creditors were \u201cfrank\u201d at times (euphemism alert!) and that the Greek government has enough funds to last until next month. Tonight\u2019s meeting will set the scene for Monday, when Greece\u2019s prime minister visits Berlin. The Wall Street Journal reports tonight that Angela Merkel is poised to \u201cintervene directly in a deepening rift between Greece and its international creditors\u201d. However, she may not soften her line on austerity: The chancellor\u2019s message for Mr. Tsipras\u2014that Greece has no alternative to cooperating with finance officials\u2019 demands\u2014is likely to disappoint the Greek leader\u2019s hope for a lenient funding deal. Here\u2019s the story: Germany\u2019s Merkel Set to Intervene in Greek Rift With Creditors Reminder; we\u2019re not expecting much from this meeting. Hours ago, Angela Merkel said it would not deliver a breakthrough, and several other leaders have emphasised that they want to see Greece delivering on its commitments before bailout cash is handed over. But the gathering is overshadowed by fears that Greece could run out of money to meet debt repayments., which could spur leaders to find some common ground. Alexis Tsipras looked rather more cheerful than Mario Draghi at the start of tonight\u2019s mini-summit meeting on Greece: Heads-up: we might hear from Angela Merkel tonight: Update from Ian - that \u00a320m fund announced by David Cameron tonight is a UK-only affair: Ahha! European officials have just released a short video of the start of the meeting on Greece tonight: It\u2019s online here - unfortunately everyone is on their best behaviour, but you can see Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, Donald Tusk, Mario Draghi, Jean-Claude Juncker and Jeroen Dijsselbloem all in attendance. Update: the 8th member is the Secretary General of EU council Uwe Corsepius. Back in Greece, Mega TV\u2019s political analyst Nikos Evangelatos, citing senior government officials, has told the station\u2019s flagship news programme that the Greek side was attending the talks \u201cwith a goal, hope and fear.\u201d \u201cThe goal is to get a deal,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe fear is that a new card will be put on the table and that creditors demand Greece completes [the last] programme with an evaluation of public finances [a red line for a government that wants nothing to do with the previous bailout accord], and the hope is that more money is released because the 400 million euros in ELA funds disbursed [last night] from the European Central Bank are only enough to keep the country going for a couple of days.\u201d Europe editor Ian Traynor tweets news from the UK PM: The most important thing is Tsipras\u2019s intentions, not ours, Tusk adds..... European Council president Donald Tusk appears to have downplayed hopes of a breakthrough, by reminding reporters that the meeting tonight was Tsipras\u2019s idea.... The mini-summit about Greece is now underway, reporters on the ground in Brussels say. Hello again. Greek government sources say that Alexis Tsipras has been briefing fellow leaders about the humanitarian crisis in Greece tonight. He hopes to establish common ground during tonight\u2019s talks, and is unhappy that officials from Greece\u2019s creditors have drawn \u201cred lines\u201d, preventing Athens making progress on implementing last month\u2019s the bailout extension deal, adds our Helena Smith. Looks like Brussels is going to be quiet for some hours  . So here\u2019s Ian Traynor\u2019s latest dispatch from the summit: Europe\u2019s long-running drama over whether Greece will stay in the single currency returned to the centre of EU politics on Thursday evening when Alexis Tsipras, the country\u2019s prime minister, used his second Brussels summit for emergency talks with the political leaders of his key creditors. Despite the reluctance of other EU leaders to prioritise Greece in a summit scheduled to deal with issues including Ukraine and the Libya crisis, the prime minister was granted a special meeting with Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Donald Tusk of Poland, who chairs the summits, and Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who heads the Eurogroup of finance ministers. Both sides, Merkel and Draghi on the one hand and Tsipras on the other, went into the talks with little sign of a shift in their respective stances. A rapid breakthrough was not expected despite the sense that time is not on Athens\u2019 side and that it is running out of money, possibly within weeks. If there is to be any breakthrough, it is more likely to come on Monday when Tsipras goes to Berlin to see Merkel again, diplomats and officials said. Following an agreement to extend until June Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn (\u00a3173bn) bailout \u2013 brokered by the EU, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 on condition that Athens delivers on promised fiscal and structural reforms to it economy, things have gone from bad to worse in the relationship. Unsuccessful and bad-tempered meetings this week between the two sides in Athens have left Greece looking isolated. Tsipras pushed two bills through parliament on Wednesday granting relief in the form of food stamps and free electricity to those hardest hit by the savage austerity of the past five years. Eurozone officials complained that this should not have happened without their blessing, accusing Tsipras of \u201cunilateral\u201d action. He responded robustly, arguing that the days of Greece taking orders from its creditors were over and that he was asserting Greece\u2019s economic and political sovereignty. The decision to interrupt the summit to enable a smaller-format negotiation with Tsipras also ruffled feathers among eurozone creditors not taking part in the talks. \u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d said Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister. He was joined by the Dutch and Luxembourg leaders who held up the beginning of the summit by almost an hour because of an \u201cexchange of information\u201d on the row with Tusk. They also insisted that the rest of the summit be briefed on the Tsipras talks, probably on Friday...... I\u2019ll try to update the blog if there are major developments tonight..... Otherwise, back early tomorrow to catch-up. GW Here\u2019s tonight\u2019s official seating plan: Alas we don\u2019t get one for the informal meeting about Greece later -- will it be Tsipras on one side, and the other six on the other? Tonight\u2019s meeting on the Greek crisis will start after leaders have had dinner -- and Marco Zatterin of La Stampa suggests it could be a late one: European leaders got down to business tonight after holding the traditional family photo - once everyone turned up, that is... Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has set a new record closing high tonight, by a whisker, on expectations that central banks will leave interest rates at record lows for longer. The blue-chip index finished the day up 17 points at 6962.32, up 0.25%, beating the previous record of 6961 set on March 5th. Andy Haldane\u2019s suggestion today that UK interest rates are as likely to be cut as raised helped keep shares higher. Haldane\u2019s comments also pushed the pound down; it lost over two cents against the US dollar today, back down to $1.474. Back at the summit our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, is hearing that several smaller EU nations are unhappy about tonight\u2019s mini-summit on Greece. If you\u2019re just tuning in, that mini summit starts tonight, and will involve Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Mario Draghi and Jeroen Dijsselbloem (that\u2019s the leaders of Greece, France and Germany, plus the head of the European Commission, the European Council, the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup of finance ministers) So why has the Greek prime minister pressed for today\u2019s mini-summit on the sidelines of the Summit tonight? Insiders in his Syriza party are saying it is not only because he wants to get a lay of the land ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting with the German chancellor. Liquidity \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 is the main reason. Helena Smith, our Athens correspondent, reports: Greek sources say they are not surprised that Angela Merkel is not promising any breakthrough today. \u201cWe always expected her to take an uncompromising stance given [the views] of her constituency,\u201d said one referring to the frustration growing numbers of Germans have increasingly expressed with Greece. \u201cWhat we are doing is seizing the moment to press for a political solution before the four-month [bailout extension] period runs out. Liquidity has become a huge problem and if we don\u2019t resolve that how on earth will we be able to proceed with anything else?\u201d Athens faces \u20ac1.7bn euro in debt repayments this month alone. The lack of liquidity has begun to affect the real economy with officials blaming the Dutch finance minister and president of the Euro group Jeroen Dijsselbloem for massive withdrawals from banks yesterday. \u201cHis statements about a Cyprus-style bail-in were totally irresponsible,\u201d said one. \u201cThey are the sort of thing that could spark the accident everyone is talking about,\u201d he added. \u201cIf anything, an accident would take the form of a run on banks.\u201d The \u201chonourable compromise\u201d [see earlier report] that Greece\u2019s leftist- led government is said to be seeking could take the form of Athens promising to enact immediate privatisations and maintain unpopular property taxes, insiders said, in return for rescue funds being unlocked. Greece has yet to drawn down \u20ac7.2bn from its original bailout program. The selloff in Greek government bonds is accelerating this afternoon as the summit begins, as markets are gripped by fresh worries over its bailout. The yield on Greek 10-year debt has jumped to 12.2%, up from 11.2% last night. That\u2019s the highest level since April 2013, and suggests a higher risk of default. Greece\u2019s two-year debt has suffered a dramatic slide, pushing its yield up to almost 25%, from 21.8% yesterday. This follows the news that \u20ac300bn was withdrawn from banks yesterday after Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem suggested capital controls could be imposed. An FT report that the European Central Bank is considering banning Greek lenders from adding to their holdings of government debt has also alarmed traders. That would cut off an important potential source of funding. A sombre start to the summit: More signs of discord in Brussels: That\u2019s a reference to Panos Kammenos, the Greek defence minister, who warned this month that the Greek government might issue travel papers to illegal immigrants if its creditors didn\u2019t help it. Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Enda Kenny, has predicted it could be \u201cquite a difficult meeting\u2019, and that Greece must face its responsibilities: \u201cThe feeling among the political leaders is that Greece and Greek politicians have to live up to their responsibilities here. The ball is in their court. The prime minister asked for time and space and he has been given that to come forward with sustainable and workable proposals. Greece needs to reflect on that very quickly because time is running out.\u201d Here\u2019s what Alexis Tsipras told Brussels reporters as he arrived for the summit: \u201cThe European Union needs brave political initiatives, which respect both democracy and the treaties. \u201cLet us leave the crisis behind us and be led toward growth\u201d. Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, told reporters outside the summit that the rhetoric between Athens and Berlin does not belong in the EU. Greece\u2019s PM has urged his fellow leaders to be bold today: There must be an election soon: This is clearly ridiculous. The UK was not on the brink of losing access to the international money markets five years ago. It\u2019s true that Britain was running an alarmingly high deficit in 2010, at 11% of GDP (compared to 10% for Greece). But one crucial difference is that the Bank of England was able to rapidly adjust monetary policy and print electronic money to address the worst financial crisis in decades. That helped Britain to get away with deficits that would have been the envy of Keynesian politicians across the eurozone (a chunky 5% of GDP this year). Cameron can argue that his 2010 austerity programme calmed the markets and helped cut borrowing costs [although that\u2019s also due to global disinflation and weaker growth]. But, really, the same boat? Not even the same ocean. Greece must get its wealthiest citizens to pay their taxes, declares French president Francois Hollande as he arrives in Brussels. Angela Merkel has dashed any lingering hopes of a breakthrough -- telling reporters outside the summit that they shouldn\u2019t expect a solution to the Greek crisis tonight. That\u2019s a blow to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s hopes of a political deal to resolve the crisis, rather than through the technical talks with eurozone officials. Green party MEP Ska Keller isn\u2019t impressed: There\u2019s open rancour in Brussels before the summit even starts. Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Charles Michel, has blasted tonight\u2019s meeting between Greece, its creditors, and the leaders of Germany and France. Arriving at the summit, Michel told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad method.\u201d Any decision on Greece must also include smaller nations, Michel adds. And he\u2019s planning to voice his criticism of the procedure during the summit. UK interest rates are as likely to be cut to fresh record lows as they are to be raised. So says Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, in a speech in Rutland right now [online here]. Haldane is warning that Britain faces significant disinflationary pressure. He cites the relative strength of the pound, and lingering spare capacity in the labour market which may be responsible for poor wage growth. As such, the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee (which Haldane serves on) may well cut borrowing costs rather than raise them: Given the asymmetry of inflation risks, I think the chances of a rate rise or cut are broadly evenly balanced. And here\u2019s Haldane\u2019s conclusion: Inflation has dropped like a stone over the past year, to close to zero. This largely, but not wholly, reflects external forces. On the MPC\u2019s central view, inflation will remain close to zero in the near-term, before rising to reach the inflation target over a two-year horizon. The risks to inflation at that horizon are plainly two-sided. But my personal view is that these risks are skewed to the downside. In my view, that means policy needs to stand ready to move off either foot in the period ahead to meet the symmetric inflation target. Good to see Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras showing some thrift; he and his team were spotted in economy class heading to today\u2019s Summit. Hat-tip to Enikos. And he\u2019s now arrived in Brussels: Both the FT and Reuters are reporting that depositors withdrew at least \u20ac300m from Greek banks yesterday. That would be the biggest daily outflow since last month\u2019s bailout extension was agreed in February. The trigger, I fear, was Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem\u2019s not-so-helpful suggestion that that capital controls might be needed in Greece if it doesn\u2019t reach agreement with its creditors. Memories of the Cyprus crisis, when banks were shut for days, are still raw in Greece. One banker told the FT\u2019s Kerin Hope that: \u201cDepositors are nervous already and the suggestion that Greece could follow the example of Cyprus two years ago made them react.\u201d And here\u2019s a video clip of Donald Tusk talking about Greece: Here are European Council president Donald Tusk\u2019s comments on Greece at a news conference ahead of today\u2019s summit, via Reuters. On Greece\u2019s bailout. \u201cNobody wants a so-called Grexit. And everybody wants to avoid a so-called Grexident.\u201d On tonight\u2019s meeting between Alexis Tsipras, Angela Merkel, Mario Draghi et al. \u201cThis informal meeting will not be a decisive meeting, because we have a formal format to take decisions [ie the, Eurogroup of finance minister]\u201d. So why are they meeting at all? \u201cThis is something like consultations. (They are) needed because we try to avoid confrontational political discussions and my intuition is that today at the level of the European Council the discussion could be a little bit too hot.\u201d Tusk also explained that the two-day meeting will consider Europe\u2019s Energy Union, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, Libya, and economic growth. And he argued that the European economy is recovering, although obviously not yet fixed: Unemployment is still unacceptably high in some countries, and there is an urgent need for labour market reforms in the eurozone. However, the economic tide is turning. And by continuing with structural reforms, we are ensuring that this will be a long-term improvement, not a brief crack of light. Back to important issues, and the draft conclusions of the EU Summit have leaked, showing that leaders are planning a fightback against Russian \u2018disinformation\u2019 over Ukraine. Lord, give me strength.... European Council president Donald Tusk has played down the importance of tonight\u2019s talks, saying that it\u2019s not the last opportunity to resolve the Greek crisis. EU\u2019S TUSK SAYS: THURSDAY MEETING WITH TSIPRAS IS NOT LAST CHANCE FOR GREECE EU\u2019S TUSK SAYS: NOBODY WANTS A GREXIT OR A GREXIDENT EU\u2019S TUSK SAYS: INFORMAL MEETING WILL NOT BE A DECISIVE MEETING, WILL NOT TAKE DECISIONS Finland\u2019s prime minister, Alex Stubb, has warned that Athens can\u2019t expect another bailout extension. This is encouraging... European banks borrowed \u20ac97.8bn of cheap loans from the ECB, through its latest liquidity scheme. That\u2019s more than economists expected, and suggests that demand for credit from businesses and consumers is rising. Today\u2019s targeted loans, or TLTROs, were made at a lower rate than previous offers, making them particularly attractive to banks. In return, they have to use the funds to help the eurozone\u2019s \u2018real economy\u2019. Credit Agricole\u2019s Frederik Ducrozet believes the TLTRO programme should help the eurozone recovery, particularly in peripheral countries. He writes: The take-up at today\u2019s TLTRO exceeded expectations, with 143 banks borrowing an extra \u20ac97.8bn from the ECB. TLTRO will help expand the ECB\u2019s balance sheet at the margin but, more importantly, they will contribute towards improving monetary policy transmission and to lower borrowing costs even further. Greek bond yields are continuing to climb this morning, on fears that the deadlock won\u2019t be broken in time. Over in Athens, our correspondent says there is are hopes that an \u201chonourable\u201d deal could be being hammered out at tonight\u2019s mini-summit between the Greek PM and other leaders. Helena Smith writes: Greece will seek to strike an \u201chonourable compromise\u201d with creditors at tonight\u2019s euro summit. Dimitris Papadimoulis, an MEP with the governing Syriza party told Skai news: \u201cAn honourable compromise is what we want.\u201d Insiders said Athens\u2019 recent apparent hardening of its stance should be seen within the context of bargaining ahead of tonight\u2019s talks and Monday\u2019s make-or-break meeting between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his German counterpart Angela Merkel. The rhetoric is being ratcheted up on both sides. While the EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker insisted this morning that progress could only be made if Greece implemented reforms, the Greek defence minister Panos Kammenos vowed the leftist-led administration would continue enacting legislation no matter what creditors said. Kammenos who also heads the governing coalition\u2019s junior partner, the nationalist ANEL party, said: \u201cWe will go ahead with legislation and after we will tell them why we are doing it.\u201d At a time when the Greek people \u201cwere going hungry\u201d the government\u2019s moral obligation was to enact its anti-austerity agenda, Kammenos said. \u201cFrom the very first we have had an honourable approach [with creditors and voters] that we will change the policies of the memorandum,\u201d he said referring to the \u20ac240bn bailout accord propping up the debt-stricken Greek economy. \u201cThis country takes orders only from the people, we are a country that has regained its national sovereignty.\u201d European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has echoed Angela Merkel this morning, saying Athens must stick to its promises. Juncker told France\u2019s Europe 1 radio that he\u2019ll make this point to Tsipras in Brussels today: \u201cI will repeat to him what I\u2019ve already told him twice: Greece must undertake the necessary reforms, Greece must ensure that the commitments it made to the Eurogroup in 2012 and more recently are followed up on.\u201d (that\u2019s via Reuters) A new opinion poll this morning shows a majority of Greeks still favour sticking with the euro rather than returning to the drachma: The poll, by Marc for Alpha TV, also shows that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party holds a strong lead in the opinion polls: The government\u2019s early rush of popularity has faded a little, though: There\u2019s a good preview of today\u2019s European Council meeting on the BBC, explaining how leaders will try to resolve the Greek crisis on the margins of the summit. The aim is to break the deadlock that has developed between Greece and its creditors about the terms agreed last month for an extension of its huge financial bailout. As time has dragged on, concern has risen that Greece could soon run out of money. There is only a matter of weeks left before another \u201ccrunch\u201d comes. \u201cThings now need to move at pace,\u201d the EU diplomat said. \u201cThe risk of an accident has risen.\u201d More here: EU aims to solve its Greek \u2018elephant\u2019 My colleague Julia Kollewe has written about the FTSE 100 index hitting a fresh record high this morning: Fears that Greece might default are pushing down the value of its sovereign debt this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on its two-year Greek bonds has jumped to 23%, up from 21.6% last night. That\u2019s the highest since the bonds was issued in the middle of 2014. The 10-year bond yield has risen to a one-month high of 11.6%, up from 11.3%. Yields rise when prices fall, and these yields suggests a high danger of Greece\u2019s not repaying these loans in full. The cost of insuring Greek bonds against default has also risen this morning. GREECE 5-YEAR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS RISE TO 1,919 BPS, UP FROM 1,806 BPS ON WEDNESDAY - MARKIT Greece isn\u2019t officially on the agenda for today\u2019s EUCO Summit, but it will obviously be on the minds of leaders. One EU official has said the Greek bailout is the \u201celephant in the room\u201d, according to the AFP newswire. It\u2019s not Europe\u2019s only problem; leaders will also debate whether to extend economic sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine conflict. Angela Merkel has warned that Greece\u2019s debt crisis will only be resolved if it sticks to its agreements and remains on its \u201ctough path\u201d. Speaking in the German parliament this morning before heading to Brussels, the chancellor said that the eurozone debt crisis had not been completely overcome yet. So, no sign of Berlin giving ground ahead of tonight\u2019s crunch meeting with other eurozone figures. Merkel also amused MPs by joking that her meeting with Greece\u2019s prime minister on Monday could be combative. \u201cI have invited the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to Berlin on Monday and I\u2019m looking forward to his visit. We will have time to talk to each other in detail and perhaps also to argue.\u201d I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get on like a house on fire. It really has been a dramatic 15 hours in the international markets, since the Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly meeting. The dramatic selloff in the dollar is now unwinding this morning, as investors conclude that the reaction to the Fed\u2019s cautiousness was perhaps overdone. European Parliament President Martin Schulz has raised the stakes ahead of today\u2019s European Council Summit, warning that Greece desperately needs funds. Schlulz told German radio that Greece\u2019s financial situation was \u201cdangerous\u201d, with debt payments looming [including \u20ac300m of IMF repayments on Friday]. Reuters has the details: Time is short,\u201d Schulz told Deutschlandfunk radio just hours before European Union leaders discuss Greece\u2019s bailout at their summit. \u201cIn the short term, two to three billion (euros) are needed to keep to the existing obligations,\u201d he said. Schulz said Greece had to make further payments by the end of the month, its banks needed money and its central bank\u2019s ability to supply funds was almost exhausted. \u201cSo it would be good if Greece fulfils the obligations that it has agreed to - then further money will flow,\u201d said Schulz. \u201cThe willingness of the Greek government to cooperate must improve,\u201d he said, when asked about reports that Greece was holding back information from its euro zone peers on its progress with reforms. The row over Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s infamous \u2018finger\u2019 gesture has taken another twist overnight; a German humorist has now claimed to have faked the footage. UPDATE: Apparently it\u2019s all an elaborate joke. Lucky there\u2019s not a debt crisis to fix..... The euro is sliding back towards its recent lows this morning, after soaring against the US dollar last night following the Federal Reserve\u2019s cautious performance. The FTSE 100 has just hit a fresh record high this morning, as City traders begin the morning in an optimistic mood. London\u2019s blue chip index is up 32 points in early trading at 6977, led by mining companies. That follows yesterday\u2019s 107-point jump on the back of George Osborne\u2019s budget, which included tax relief for oil companies and new help for home buyers. Today\u2019s rally comes after the US Federal Reserve dampened expectations of an early rise in American interest rates. Cautious Fed policymakers want to see further improvement in the US employment market, and clear signs of inflation pressure, before hiking rates. And that means monetary policy could stay extremely loose for longer. That sent the dollar tumbling dramatically in the FX markets, but it\u2019s clawing its way back this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With tensions rising over Greece\u2019s bailout, European leaders are heading to Brussels for another summit dominated by Athens\u2019s financial problems. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has secured a meeting tonight, on the sidelines of the European Council meeting, to try to break the deadlock with its creditors over its financial programme. The meeting will be convened by European council president Donald Tusk, and involve German chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, and eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Tsipras\u2019s ambition is to persuade these key players to support his reform plans, and unlock bailout loans. Negotiations between the two sides seem to have floundered since Greece secured a four-month extension to its loans last month, and it faces new loan repayments on Friday. Last night, Tsipras told the Greek parliament he is committed to the anti-austerity programme which swept his Syria party to power two months ago. He declared: \u201cWe are not going back on what we have promised. We are not asking for special treatment but equal treatment.\u201d And MPs subsequently approved the first piece of humanitarian legislation brought forwards by the new government, giving free electricity and food stamps for thousands of poor Greek families. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day. Oh, and I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t run a eurozone liveblog yesterday; the UK Budget had my full attention.....",

A rapid breakthrough was not expected despite the sense that time is not on Athens\u2019 side and that it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/greek-saver-withdrew-euro-12bn-january-ecb-capital-flight-deal-eurozone-bailout\">running out of money</a>, possibly within weeks.</p> <p>If there is to be any breakthrough, it is more likely to come on Monday when Tsipras goes to Berlin to see Merkel again, diplomats and officials said.</p> <p>Following an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/24/greece-secures-eurozone-bailout-extension-for-four-months\">agreement to extend until June</a> Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn (\u00a3173bn) bailout \u2013 brokered by the EU, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 on condition that Athens delivers on promised fiscal and structural reforms to it economy, things have gone from bad to worse in the relationship.</p> <p>Unsuccessful and bad-tempered meetings this week between the two sides in Athens have left <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece\">Greece</a> looking isolated. Tsipras pushed two bills through parliament on Wednesday granting relief in the form of food stamps and free electricity to those hardest hit by the savage austerity of the past five years.</p> <p>Eurozone officials complained that this should not have happened without their blessing, accusing Tsipras of \u201cunilateral\u201d action. He responded robustly, arguing that the days of Greece taking orders from its creditors were over and that he was asserting Greece\u2019s economic and political sovereignty.<br></p> <p>The decision to interrupt the summit to enable a smaller-format negotiation with Tsipras also ruffled feathers among eurozone creditors not taking part in the talks. \u201cI\u2019m angry,\u201d said Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister. He was joined by the Dutch and Luxembourg leaders who held up the beginning of the summit by almost an hour because of an \u201cexchange of information\u201d on the row with Tusk. They also insisted that the rest of the summit be briefed on the Tsipras talks, probably on Friday......</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/19/talks-between-greece-and-key-eu-leaders-unlikely-to-bring-breakthrough\">Talks between Greece and key EU leaders unlikely to bring breakthrough</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ll try to update the blog if there are major developments tonight.....

This largely, but not wholly, reflects external forces. On the MPC\u2019s central view, inflation will remain close to zero in the near-term, before rising to reach the inflation target over a two-year horizon. The risks to inflation at that horizon are plainly two-sided. But my personal view is that these risks are skewed to the downside.
