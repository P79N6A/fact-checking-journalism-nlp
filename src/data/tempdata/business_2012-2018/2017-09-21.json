      "bodyText": "China\u2019s credit rating has been downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s amid fears rising debts are adding to economic and financial risks. The agency lowered China\u2019s sovereign rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, putting it in the same category as countries such as the US and Austria. This is the second downgrade from a major ratings agency for Beijing this year and comes at an awkward time before next month\u2019s Communist party congress. The Chinese government has been expanding the economy as it pushes to double its size between 2010 and 2020, and has allowed non-financial sector debt to rise rapidly. Total debt has quadrupled since the financial crisis to hit $28tn (\u00a322tn) at the end of last year. S&amp;P pointed to the \u201cprolonged period of strong credit growth\u201d raising the prospect of economic and financial risks to the country. \u201cAlthough this credit growth had contributed to strong real GDP growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent,\u201d it said. The Chinese government has moved to curb rising levels of debt among domestic companies, restricting firms from investing in foreign media and sport industries after a buying spree around the world. Chinese firms and wealthy business tycoons have taken control of assets including Legendary Entertainment, the US film producer behind Jurassic World and Warcraft, buildings such as the Cheesegrater in London, and English football clubs including Southampton and Aston Villa. S&amp;P said the recent government efforts to rein in borrowing by companies could help mitigate financial risks, although it still expects that Chinese corporate debts will continue to grow over the next two to three years at levels that increase financial risks gradually. However, some analysts said the outlook for China\u2019s economy improved in recent months, amid the government controls and improving corporate earnings. Tao Wang, China chief economist at Swiss bank UBS, said: \u201cWe think China\u2019s debt risk has actually declined over the past year. While China\u2019s credit growth continues to outpace nominal GDP growth, the gap has actually narrowed this year.\u201d The International Monetary Fund has warned of the dangers from China\u2019s credit-fuelled economic strategy, which it warned might risk financial turmoil. It said the country was forecast to expand by 6.7%, although stressed that this was as a result of Beijing pursuing growth targets at the expense of the quality of economic output. The IMF expects China\u2019s total non-financial sector debt as a proportion of gross domestic product to rise to almost 300% by 2022, up from 242% last year. S&amp;P said the government was working to cut corruption and to improve governance at state agencies, local governments, and state-owned enterprises. Over time, it said, this could improve the private sector business environment. Helena Huang, China economist at ICBC Standard Bank, said: \u201cThough without any near-term credit risks amid Beijing\u2019s recent regulatory tightening and deleveraging efforts, the key uncertainty still rests in the longer term on Beijing\u2019s capability to resolve its debt conundrum.\u201d The downgrade from S&amp;P brings its rating in line with assessments from Fitch and Moody\u2019s, which lowered its rating for the country in May. S&amp;P said it gave China a stable outlook for its credit rating, reflecting a view that the country would maintain its robust economic performance in the next three to four years.",

Even by his standards the Ryanair chief executive\u2019s belligerence was extraordinary. Pilots do not have a difficult job, shareholders were told. Some are \u201cprecious about themselves\u201d and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d. To manage Ryanair\u2019s crisis over cancelled flights, O\u2019Leary may force a few to re-arrange their own holidays. And, while he may have a few incentives in his back pocket, \u201cif pilots misbehave, that will be the end of the goodies\u201d. O\u2019Leary, one assumes, is confident the current storm will pass but you have to wonder whether his approach can possibly make long-term commercial sense. First, even if they enjoy a comfortable life, pilots are trained professionals in a regulated industry and probably don\u2019t like being addressed as overprivileged schoolchildren. Second, the planes can\u2019t take off without them. Third, even Willie Walsh, when he was in full cost-cutting mode at British Airways, knew better than to pick a fight with the pilots. O\u2019Leary, one senses, feels he will prevail because he isn\u2019t dealing with a union. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair,\u201d he said at the meeting. Yet that analysis skirts around the fact that some of the pilots would like to unionise, as they do at most other European airlines. At the very least, they may see this crisis as a one-off opportunity to secure permanently higher pay and better conditions. They may also to want to escalate matters by attracting regulators and politicians to the drama. A conventional chief executive would be looking to turn down the heat. That\u2019s not O\u2019Leary\u2019s style, which makes events unpredictable. The City\u2019s lack of concern, seen in a share price that has barely moved, remains baffling. Bloody-mindedness can be a great strategy until it isn\u2019t. Tech giants don\u2019t need to be afraid of tax reform \u2013 yet That the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook are undertaxed, at least in Europe, barely counts as news. But here\u2019s the European Commission\u2019s tally: digital businesses with international operations pay a 10.1% tax rate on average in the EU, compared with a 23.2% rate levied on traditional companies. What should be done? At that point, the report will sound considerably less scary for the US tech giants. It sets out three options but the preferred choice \u2013 a common corporate tax base across the EU \u2013 is clearly miles away from becoming a reality. It\u2019s hard to imagine Ireland, and many others, signing up. A French proposal to tax turnover, even if it could attract more support, requires a digital company to be defined. One fears commissioner Pierre Moscovici\u2019s call for \u201cconsensus\u201d was made more in hope than expectation. The EU\u2019s progress looks to be painfully slow, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is a bigger player in this debate, won\u2019t deliver its report until next year. This is important territory \u2013 but likely to remain unaddressed for a while. Compass chief executive served up some tasty numbers The success of Compass Group has been under-reported, spiky chief executive Richard Cousins has sometimes said. That view is probably fair. So, as he announces his departure next year after 11 years at the contract caterer, let\u2019s do him a favour and record the excellent numbers on his watch. The share price has risen nearly sevenfold and, when you add up dividends and share buy-backs on the way, the total shareholder return has been 833%. Impressive. That is especially so when you remember that Compass was a shambles back in 2006. It had to pay \u00a340m to settle two lawsuits brought against it for allegedly bribing a United Nations official to win contracts. Compass has kept its nose clean since then and risen to global leadership without flashy acquisitions. In the market for providing in-house catering for companies, schools, hospitals, and so on, only French group Sodexo gets close. It has been a classic turnaround tale, followed by years of steady growth and compounding returns. If the wider world was slow to notice, Compass\u2019s board definitely was not. Cousins has been paid \u00a343m over the past eight years. He can\u2019t grumble on that score.",

    "webTitle": "Deliveroo boss Will Shu gives himself 22.5% rise amid battle over riders' pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Will Shu, the boss of Deliveroo, handed himself a 22.5% pay rise last year at the same time as the company spent more than \u00a31.5m on legal fees, partly because of the food delivery firm\u2019s battle over pay and conditions for its thousands of couriers. Shu, a former investment banker who set up Deliveroo from his London flat in 2013, increased his salary to \u00a3124,999 and handed out close to \u00a34.5m in share bonuses to directors and hundreds of other head office staff, despite a 300%-plus widening in losses. The pay rise also comes as the Central Arbitration Committee investigates whether Deliveroo\u2019s drivers are independent contractors, as the company argues, or whether they should be classified as workers with rights to holiday pay, the national minimum wage and collective bargaining via a union. A group of 20 British riders is seeking compensation in a similar employment tribunal case. Deliveroo, which now works with 30,000 riders around the world, all of which are treated as self-employed set aside \u00a31.6m for legal costs as it battles workers\u2019 claims.. Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain which is leading the CAC challenge, said: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely absurd that while riders are consistently on low wage and without employment rights, Will Shu sees fit to give himself a \u00a325,000 a year raise. He should focus on the minimum wage and holiday pay first and reward himself later.\u201d Deliveroo\u2019s revenues soared sevenfold to \u00a3128.6m in the year to 31 December 2016 as it expanded operations in the UK and overseas to 25,000 restaurants in more than 140 cities and 12 countries. But pre-tax losses climbed to \u00a3129m from \u00a330.13m a year before. Deliveroo\u2019s UK business alone made a loss of just over \u00a346m. Deliveroo\u2019s cash resources stood at nearly \u00a3180m at the end of last year after the company raised \u00a3209m in new funding from the issue of shares. Accumulated losses at the food delivery firm, which is reportedly attempting to raise new funds in a deal that could value the business at as much as $1.5bn, have now hit nearly \u00a3163m. A spokesperson for Deliveroo said: \u201cDeliveroo is going from strength to strength, with revenue jumping by over 600% across our global markets in 2016. \u201cDeliveroo is investing heavily in new technology and our innovative delivery-only Editions kitchens across the world.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After their record breaking runs, US markets paused for breath following the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement it would begin winding down the stimulus programme which has been supporting the economy since the financial crisis. The reaction in Europe was fairly subdued, with most markets heading higher. But continuing strength in the pound - now up 0.6% at $1.3573 - saw the UK\u2019s leading index slip back slightly. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 slipped by 8.05 points or 0.11% to 7263.90 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.25% to 12,600.03 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.49% at 5267.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.61% better at 22,491.73 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.05% at 10,297.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.06% to 765.99 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 38 points or 0.17%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Riskier markets have shrugged off the US Federal Reserve\u2019s suggestion of another rate rise this year, but could fall sharply in time if the US economy shows signs of flagging, says Capital Economics. The consultancy\u2019s markets economist Oliver Jones said: Risky asset markets took the Fed\u2019s unexpectedly-hawkish tone on Wednesday in their stride. We think that they will remain resilient over the next year and a half or so, even though we forecast that the Fed will hike rates once a quarter between now and the early 2019. The US dollar and Treasury yields rose after the conclusion of the FOMC\u2019s meeting on Wednesday in response to the committee\u2019s signal that it is likely to raise the federal funds rate in December, despite the weakness of core inflation and the effects of the recent hurricanes. (The Fed also announced the start of balance sheet \u201cnormalisation\u201d, but this was widely expected.) In the event, there was little reaction in risky asset markets. The S&amp;P 500 was almost unchanged on the day, and movements in emerging market equities were small. This might be partly due to the fact that the Fed\u2019s tone was not a huge surprise. But a couple of other factors have probably helped risky assets to be resilient too \u2013 not just on Wednesday but throughout the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle so far. We think that these factors will continue to provide support this year and next, even if the Fed hikes rates as we expect. First, there has been little to suggest that higher rates are dragging on economic growth, and we expect this to remain the case in 2017 and 2018. The US economy has expanded at a healthy pace since the Fed started hiking and we forecast it will continue to do so this year and next... Second, the likelihood that interest rates will ultimately remain quite low, even if they rise in the coming quarters, has probably supported the valuations of risky assets. Despite their hawkish near-term signal on Wednesday, FOMC participants\u2019 median forecast for the level of the federal funds rate in the \u201clonger term\u201d fell by 25bp, to 2.75%, the lowest since these projections were first published in 2012... Taking this all into account, we think that risky asset prices will continue to hold up well as the Fed applies the brakes in the next eighteen months or so. However, we suspect that the lagged effects of higher rates will eventually begin to take their toll on the US economy as the Fed reaches the end of its tightening cycle in 2019. If the US economy did falter, risky asset prices globally would probably fall quite sharply. Bank shares have been boosted by the prospect of higher interest rates, in the wake of the US Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The prospect of higher rates in the key US market, and indeed even the possibility of a modest rate rise in the UK, has prompted investors to buy up financial services stocks in hope of better margins and improved profits and dividends. Europe has been bolstered by a weaker euro, as Janet Yellen manages to do what Mario Draghi could not or would not, with last night\u2019s arguably more hawkish statement putting some fight back into the US dollar. Today\u2019s speech from Draghi stayed off the topic of monetary policy, thus providing little for euro bulls to go on. The eurozone consumer confidence figures were at their highest level for about 16 years, says ING Bank. Its senior eurozone economist Bert Colijn said: The current economic environment in the Eurozone continues to be very favourable to the consumer, as job growth accelerates, wage growth has begun to improve, and inflation remains below the ECB\u2019s target. This helps the Eurozone economy as more confident consumers continue to boost household demand. While the breakdown of individual questions from the September survey has not been released yet, recent data shows expectations of major purchases in the coming year have jumped to levels last seen before the crisis, which is in line with an increasingly positive assessment of personal finances. Expectations of households\u2019 future financial situation have been improving too and there are few doubts related to the historically low expectations of unemployment in the coming 12 months. While expectations of economic growth in the coming years are modest, as the Eurozone is expected to revert to a weaker growth trend, buoyant consumers are helping GDP growth to remain above trend for a while. For the ECB, the euphoric consumer is another sign that cautious increases in upward price pressures are likely to continue. But consumer expectations of price trends have been falling since January, indicating that consumers are not expecting the Goldilocks economy to end anytime soon. In the eurozone, consumer confidence rose by more than expected in September. The European Commission\u2019s initial estimate showed confidence among consumers rise from -1.5 in August to -1.2, better than the unchanged reading that analysts had been forecasting. In the wider European Union consumer sentiment rose by 0.8 points to -1.5. After their recent record breaking runs, US markets have lost some ground in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting. News that the Fed was still considering another interest rate rise this year and would begin cutting its $4.5bn worth of bond holdings has seen investors take a more cautious tone. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 0.14% to 22,380 while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.18% and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 0.38%. Monetary policy cannot tackle local financial imbalances in the eurozone area, and individual governments need to rely on their own tools to solve these issues, says European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. In a speech in Frankfurt at the second annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board, he said: Financial and business cycles can potentially become de-synchronised, meaning that financial imbalances can grow in an environment characterised by relatively muted inflation. In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances. Draghi said European banks still had too many non-performing loans on their books: Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks\u2019 balance sheets remains high. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around \u20ac1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks\u2019 profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks. Draghi concluded: Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy. At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal. And legislators need to be mindful that authorities require a broad range of tools to be able to tackle risks beyond the banking sector. Trouble is brewing at UK outsourcing group Capita, as staff vote to hold a six-day strike in a dispute over pensions. Members of the Unite union will walk out from October 5 after voting heavily in favour of industrial action. Unite are protesting against plans to close the current defined benefit pension scheme and transfer staff to a defined contribution scheme. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said Capita\u2019s plans were \u201cdisgraceful\u201d, adding: \u201cCapita\u2019s pension proposals will have far-reaching consequences for the retirement of many Unite members. Some staff will lose a shocking 70% of their retirement income. Capita has once again put the interests of shareholders before those of its staff. The move comes as Capita reported that profits fell by 26% in the first half of 2017. That sent its shares slumping by 12% today, making it the worst-performing major share in London. Capita has its fingers in a lot of pies, from collecting TV licence money to assessing whether disabled people are entitled to personal independence payments. But the last few months have been tough; it fell out of the FTSE 100 after a grim profits warning, and it hasn\u2019t managed to replace its CEO..... The FT\u2019s Arthur Beesley has written about this morning\u2019s Ryanair AGM. Here\u2019s a flavour: At the AGM, a number of shareholders challenged Mr O\u2019Leary, who took personal responsibility for the cancellations. \u201cWe do have the sackcloth on. I have apologised personally to all of those passengers and to the ones we didn\u2019t disrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to back to gung-ho management.\u201d Shareholder Brian Graham, a retired mechanic, who questioned Mr O\u2019Leary during the meeting said it was clear that there was \u201cno goodwill\u201d between the chief executive and pilots. \u201cIf it happened anywhere else he\u2019d be asking for heads to roll,\u201d Mr Graham said. But Mr O\u2019Leary said there will be no dismissals as a result of the affair, saying the board was holding him to account by requiring him to resolve the matter. More here: Ryanair pilots face holiday threat Over in America, there\u2019s been a sharp fall in the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit. Around 259,000 Americans filed an \u201cinitial jobless\u201d claim last week, much better than the 302,000 which Wall Street expected. That\u2019s down from 282,000 the previous week, when people sought assistance after hurricane Harvey caused devastation in Texas and beyond. If you work for Ryanair, or have been affected by its flight cancellations, do please get in touch.... In other news, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has fired a warning shot at China by downgrading its credit rating. S&amp;P warned that China\u2019s build-up of debt is a growing concern, as it cuts its rating by one notch, to A+ from AA-. S&amp;P claimed that: \u201cChina\u2019s prolonged period of strong credit growth has increased its economic and financial risks. Although this credit growth had contributed to strong real gross domestic product growth and higher asset prices, we believe it has also diminished financial stability to some extent.\u201d Beijing may not appreciate the timing, just weeks before the Communist party holds its key five-yearly congress. But is S&amp;P right? It\u2019s true that Chinese companies have been borrowing at a worrying rate, and that its shadow banking sector conceals some dubious debts. This chart, from Bloomberg, shows how corporate debt has swelled -- and that bill could easily land back on the government. But this isn\u2019t new. And the Chinese government has been taking steps to avoid a financial crisis, without slowing growth too much, Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, argues that China is actually safer than before... Ryanair\u2019s share price has recovered some of its early losses, and is now down just 0.7% today. The news that the airline plans to hire 125 new pilots ASAP could be reassuring traders. But this still means the airline has lost almost 10% of its value this week. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: The flight cancellations and fraught negotiations with pilots have overshadowed what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill AGM for Ryanair. Ryanair shares dipped as Chief Executive Michael O\u2019Leary apologised to shareholders for the management failure. Here\u2019s my colleague Rob Davies\u2019s take on the Ryanair annual general meeting: Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has escalated the airline\u2019s dispute with pilots, saying they do not have a \u201cdifficult job\u201d and claiming he can force them to give up a week of leave. O\u2019Leary is scrambling to prevent more disruption to the no-frills airline\u2019s schedule after last week cancelling up to 50 flights a day due to a rota \u201cmess-up\u201d that left it short of pilots. Speaking at Ryanair\u2019s AGM in Dublin on Thursday, the famously outspoken airline chief admitted that further cancellations could follow but refused to back down in a dispute with pilots. A group of pilots on Wednesday turned down an offer of up to \u00a312,000 to keep flying during their scheduled leave, many of them putting their names to a letter demanding improved employment terms instead.... More here: Michael O\u2019Leary appears to be taking a carrot and stick approach with his pilots, warning that if they \u201cmisbehave there will be no goodies.\u201d He also downplayed the news that some pilots are planning to work to rule, saying: If you want and need to ask your staff to give up holidays no work to rule can alter that. I don\u2019t even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair. There isn\u2019t a union.\u201d O\u2019Leary has acknowledged that criticism of Ryanair\u2019s pay structure has merit, saying \u201cmaybe we have got it a bit on the low side\u201d. But he also denies that staff are up in arms, claiming there\u2019s been \u201chuge co-operation and support from pilots\u201d. And asked about the causes of the crisis that forced up to 50 flights to be cancelled each week, O\u2019Leary said: \u201cWe make mistakes. This time we made a major boo boo. \u201cA very big block of annual leave (for pilots) was over-allocated for September, October and November,\u201d (thanks to PA and Reuters for the quotes) Reuters have more details on Ryanair\u2019s pay offer to pilots: Ryanair will hand pilots at some of its largest bases a 10,000 euro annual pay rise on top of a 12,000 euro bonus offered this week to those who help the airline alleviate a pilot shortage, Chief Executive Michael O\u2019Leary said on Thursday. Pilots were offered the bonus in exchange for working an additional 10 days to plug a shortage that last week forced Ryanair to cancel more than 2,000 flights in September and October. Pilots at London Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin have now been offered an additional 10,000 euros per year, O\u2019Leary told a news conference. Similar offers may be made at other airports, but that will depend on whether those bases have a surplus of pilots, he said Back in London, the Treasury has welcomed the drop in UK borrowing in August to \u00a35.7bn, from almost \u00a37bn. A spokesperson says: \u2018We have made substantial progress in reducing the deficit, whilst taking a balanced approach that allows us to invest in our infrastructure and public services. This approach is working but the national debt is still too high, so we must continue to live within our means and start reducing our debt.\u201d Sky News\u2019s Darren McCaffrey has just tweeted a video clip of Michael O\u2019Leary denying that his pilots are overworked, or doing a \u201cdifficult job\u201d. The Ryanair boss says: If there are fatigue issues among pilots....on short-haul flying it is never as a result of flying. Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s take on Ryanair\u2019s AGM: Ryanair is planning to take back one week of its pilots\u2019 holidays to prevent any further flight cancellations, the airline\u2019s chief executive has said. Michael O\u2019Leary said pilots due to take a four-week block of holidays in the next few months because a change in annual leave rotas will be told to reduce that to three weeks. He said they will get the other week back in January. At a meeting with shareholders at the airline\u2019s AGM in Dublin, Mr O\u2019Leary said the airline does not need the agreement of pilots to take back a week of their leave. He told shareholders six weeks of cancellations, which he previously admitted was a \u2018mess\u2019, has cost the airline about \u20ac25m (\u00a322m). Mr O\u2019Leary again apologised for the disruption, which he said was down to mismanagement of the pilots\u2019 rostering system. He refused to discuss media reports that many pilots had turned down offers of a \u20ac12,000 (\u00a310,600) bonus and instead demanded improved contracts. Michael O\u2019Leary has revealed that Dublin-based pilots are getting a pay rise, and it will be offered to staff at some other bases too. But....the president of the Irish Airline Pilots\u2019 Association has said Ryanair needs a \u201cfundamental change\u201d to the way it deals with pilots. Evan Cullen, who heads the pilots group, outlined the extraordinary employment structure which leaves them at an arms length relationship. Instead of being employed as staff, they are grouped into mini-companies which provide service to a UK company which in turn provides Ryanair with its pilots, said Cullen in a BBC interview. \u201cOne of the main pillars in the grievance, is that many of the Ryanair pilots do not have a fixed permanent contract,\u201d he told Newsnight. The full interview starts here at around 27 minutes: \u201cThis means that pilots are grouped into companies, into Irish companies which have between five and eight pilot directors, those companies then subcontract into a UK labour provider of pilots and then that UK provider provides the pilot labour into Ryanair. This gives an extraordinary arms length distance between Ryanair and the pilot,\u201d Cullen explained. He added: \u201cThere has to be a fundamental change in how Ryanair deals with its pilots. Unfortunately the latest offers from Ryanair means it is a sticking plaster approach\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where the point of anger is with the pilots, that Ryanair don\u2019t seem to be taking seriously the fundamental grievance about the precarious nature of the employment.\u201d He predicted that some newly qualified Ryanair pilots were merely waiting for their start dates in order to quit. \u201cRyanair is not competing in the market place, there are many pilots that have left Ryanair such as the 140 to Norwegian Airlines but also many airlines throughout Europe have a holding pool of pilots and that holding pool is where the pilots have successfully competed the application process but awaiting a start date. \u201cWe know that many of the pilots in these holding pools are actually Ryanair pilots waiting for a start date and when they get that start date they will then issue Ryanair with their notice.\u201d Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Back in Dublin, Michael O\u2019Leary is continuing to answer questions over Ryanair\u2019s flight cancellations. He\u2019s told the AGM that Ryanair doesn\u2019t have enough pilots to cover September, October and November, which is why it may force pilots to delay some holidays. The budget airline boss also announced plans to hire an extra 125 pilots, soon, to handle the shortages which forced flights to be cut. O\u2019Leary also told investors that the situation is now \u2018under control\u2019, but warns that further cancellations can\u2019t be ruled out Chris Choi of ITV News is also at the AGM, and reports that some shareholders aren\u2019t happy: John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says Philip Hammond will welcome the drop in public borrowing in August. With the deficit below forecasts, Hawksworth believes chancellor Hammond could have some extra flexibility to boost spending in the budget. Back in March, the OBR forecast that the budget deficit would rise to around \u00a358 billion this year, but the latest data suggest that it may be similar to the \u00a346 billion outturn for 2016/17. This would imply a budget deficit of just over 2% of GDP this year, which is already close to the Chancellor\u2019s medium term target for the deficit in 2020. \u201cAll of this suggests that the Chancellor should have room for some easing of austerity in his Budget in November. This could involve extra money for priorities such as the NHS, social care, housing and infrastructure investment as well as some further relaxation of the public sector pay cap.\u201d Here\u2019s Howard Archer of EY Item Club on today\u2019s UK public finances: Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell MP, points out that the government has still failed to eliminate the UK deficit: \u201cThese figures are yet another reminder of the last seven years of failed Tory economic policy, following on from the OECD just yesterday predicting growth in our economy to continue to slow next year. \u201cAfter one year in the job Philip Hammond has continued the record of failure of his predecessor. The deficit has still not been eliminated, the national debt continues to rise, yet the Chancellor is carrying on with austerity cuts that are weakening our economy further, and hitting the incomes of working families. The big picture of today\u2019s public finances is that Britain now owes almost \u00a31.8 trillion, or 88% of annual economic output. August\u2019s public finances also suggest that Britain might borrow less than expected this financial year. The annual deficit had been forecast to rise to \u00a358.3bn, from \u00a351.7bn \u2013 but borrowing since April is actually below expectations. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s public finances were stronger than expected in August. Britain borrowed just \u00a35.56bn to balance the books last month, the ONS reports. That\u2019s the smallest deficit for any August since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. That\u2019s down from \u00a36.9bn a year ago, and below City forecasts. The public finances were boosted by higher-than-expected tax receipts, in another boost for chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of November\u2019s budget. This means that Britain\u2019s public borrowing this financial year is \u00a3200m lower than a year ago, at \u00a328.3bn. Crumbs! Michael O\u2019Leary is telling shareholders that he\u2019s considering \u201ctaking back\u201d a week\u2019s holiday from pilots, to fix the rota shortages that forced flight cancellations. If that happens, pilots would receive extra pay for that week, he promises. Newsflash: Ryanair\u2019s boss Michael O\u2019Leary has apologised to shareholders at today\u2019s AGM over the airline\u2019s flight cancellations. It also claims that it will have dealt with 95% of customers affected, by the end of the week. In a statement to the City, Ryanair says: Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary apologised to shareholders, and again to customers, for the cancellation of 2,100 of its over 103,000 flights over a 6 week period in September and October, due to a failure within its pilot rostering function. Ryanair expects by the end of this week to have re-accommodated (or authorised refund requests to) over 95% of the 315,000 customers affected by these cancellations. There\u2019s also a small revolt against the pay received by Ryanair\u2019s top brass, with only 88% of shareholders backing its renumeration report. But O\u2019Leary himself has been reelected with 99.3% of votes. Chairman David Bonderman also survived efforts to unseat him, with 89.1% of shareholders voting for his re-election. Ryanair\u2019s AGM is up and running: Shares in Ryanair have fallen by 1.5% in early trading, extending their recent losses. Our story revealing that pilot are now planning to \u2018work to rule\u2019 is fuelling concerns that Ryanair could be forced to cancel even more flights, hitting its profitability. ETX Capital\u2019s Neil Wilson explains: Shares in Ryanair have slipped 10% since it announced plans to cancel flights. The selloff this morning is all about mounting concern over rising cost pressures which are likely to hit margins and profits. Pilots\u2019 rejection of a one-off bonus to work extra hours \u2013 a move that management would have liked to pull off in order to lessen the damage being done \u2013 has investors worried that not only may more flights be cancelled, but also that Ryanair is walking into a protracted battle with pilots at the very worst moment. At the very least, getting pilots to work more hours might have resulted in the airline not having to cancel any more flights. At present there is a risk that Ryanair will be forced to cancel more flights over the coming weeks. Ryanair shareholders are gathering in Dublin for the budget airline\u2019s AGM, and it could be a very bumpy ride. Investors were already planning to revolt against executive pay at the airline, and vote against and the re-election of chairman David Bonderman. That was before this week\u2019s debacle over staff holidays, which means thousands of passengers are suffering flight cancellations. The FT\u2019s Matthew Vincent jokes: Ryanair could sell tickets for its AGM later today \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for the fact that it would probably have to cancel a whole load of them at very short notice owing to a mess-up with its boardroom holiday rota. Sky New\u2019s Darren McCaffrey has landed outside the meeting, but is having trouble getting through security..... Disappointingly, Janet Yellen didn\u2019t give us any new clues yesterday on whether she\u2019ll seek a second term when her current stint as Fed chair ends in February. Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed\u2019s actions has put Yellen\u2019s future in doubt. Potential replacements include veteran investment banker Gary Cohn (currently director of the National Economic Council), or former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. UBS\u2019s Paul Donovan has a more outlandish suggestion, though.... The Financial Times says the Fed\u2019s decision to start unwinding QE is \u201chistoric\u201d: The Times say it\u2019s the \u201cend of an era\u201d. The strength of the US dollar has pulled sterling back down to $1.348, away from last week\u2019s one-year high over $1.36. The euro has also taken a hit, down over one cent to below $1.19. Alex Lydall, Head of Dealing at Foenix Partners, says Janet Yellen\u2019s optimistic tone has helped to drive the dollar up. The greenback rallied overnight as Fed chair Yellen signalled the official end to QE and crucially kept the door ajar for rate hikes this year despite split opinions on inflation trajectory among members. Considering the catastrophes of late in the form of hurricanes, a sanguine approach from the Fed left markets aware a hike in December is still very much on the cards. Acknowledgment, not worry, was the general tone and optimism on the global outlook positions the Fed nicely coming into year-end with the process of balance sheet normalization set to kick-off in October. If you missed last night\u2019s Fed announcement, here\u2019s the latest Dot Plot (in yellow) showing how policymakers expect US interest rates to rise over the next few years. As you can see, they\u2019re a little more dovish about 2018 (as the yellow dots are a little lower than June\u2019s grey ones), and rather divided about where rates will be by 2020. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is rallying this morning after the Federal Reserve took the historic step to start unwinding its quantitative easing stimulus package. Investors around the globe are digesting the Fed\u2019s decision, which came alongside a commitment to keep raising interest rates if the US economy continues to strengthen. As we live-blogged last night, Fed chair Janet Yellen fired the starting pistol to unwind QE. From October, the central bank will slowly trim its holdings of US government debt, and mortgage-backed bonds. The decision to start normalising the Fed\u2019s $4.5 trillion balance sheet is another milestone in the recovery from the worst financial crisis in generations. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe explains: The move, announced after a two-day meeting by Fed officials, will start the gradual reduction of the central bank\u2019s $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other securities, bought to keep interest rates close to zero in an attempt to kickstart the economy. \u201cThe basic message here is that US economic performance has been good,\u201d Fed chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference. The Fed\u2019s decision had been made because \u201cwe feel the US economy is performing well\u201d but she added the Fed could reverse course if conditions changed. Yellen also said it was a \u201cmystery\u201d why inflation hasn\u2019t reached target, but the Fed remains confident that it will get there in the end. Markets have reacted by driving the US dollar up against other currencies. The greenback has hit a two-month high against the Japanese yen, at \u00a5112.645. It has also driven to a 10 week high against the Indian rupee. The stronger dollar has also sent gold down to a three-week low. Traders now reckon there is a 64% chance that the US Federal Reserve presses on and raises interest rates in December; potentially hurting American borrowers, and pulling capital out of emerging markets and back into US assets. Stock markets, though, seem to be taking the move in their stride... Also coming up today.... 9am: European Central Bank publishes its monthly bulletin. This may contain clues about how the ECB will slow its own stimulus programme 9.30am BST: The latest UK public finances, which will show how much Britain had to borrow to balance the books in August. Economists expect that borrowing hit \u00a37bn, up from a small surplus in July. 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures. Has the recent hurricane season hurt the labor market? We\u2019ll also be watching Ryanair, which faces a bruising encounter with shareholders at its AGM in Dublin this morning. The budget airline faces a deepening crisis over its decision to axe up to 50 flights per day, to allow staff to clear a backlog of holiday. We have learned that Ryanair customers face the threat of a fresh wave of flight cancellations as the airline\u2019s pilots prepare to reject an offer of a cash bonus if they give up days off. The Guardian has obtained a draft letter signed by Ryanair pilots from across Europe, rejecting the offer and warning they will now \u201cwork to rule\u201d - refusing to work beyond their basic contractual obligations. Ryanair had told pilots earlier this week that if they declined the \u00a312,000 payment more flights might have to be scrapped. Here\u2019s the full story:",

The consultancy\u2019s markets economist Oliver Jones said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Risky asset markets took the Fed\u2019s unexpectedly-hawkish tone on Wednesday in their stride. We think that they will remain resilient over the next year and a half or so, even though we forecast that the Fed will hike rates once a quarter between now and the early 2019.</p> <p>The US dollar and Treasury yields rose after the conclusion of the FOMC\u2019s meeting on Wednesday in response to the committee\u2019s signal that it is likely to raise the federal funds rate in December, despite the weakness of core inflation and the effects of the recent hurricanes. (The Fed also announced the start of balance sheet \u201cnormalisation\u201d, but this was widely expected.) </p> <p>In the event, there was little reaction in risky asset markets. The S&amp;P 500 was almost unchanged on the day, and movements in emerging market equities were small. This might be partly due to the fact that the Fed\u2019s tone was not a huge surprise. But a couple of other factors have probably helped risky assets to be resilient too \u2013 not just on Wednesday but throughout the Fed\u2019s tightening cycle so far. We think that these factors will continue to provide support this year and next, even if the Fed hikes rates as we expect. </p> <p>First, there has been little to suggest that higher rates are dragging on economic growth, and we expect this to remain the case in 2017 and 2018. The US economy has expanded at a healthy pace since the Fed started hiking and we forecast it will continue to do so this year and next...</p> <p>Second, the likelihood that interest rates will ultimately remain quite low, even if they rise in the coming quarters, has probably supported the valuations of risky assets. Despite their hawkish near-term signal on Wednesday, FOMC participants\u2019 median forecast for the level of the federal funds rate in the \u201clonger term\u201d fell by 25bp, to 2.75%, the lowest since these projections were first published in 2012...</p> <p>Taking this all into account, we think that risky asset prices will continue to hold up well as the Fed applies the brakes in the next eighteen months or so. However, we suspect that the lagged effects of higher rates will eventually begin to take their toll on the US economy as the Fed reaches the end of its tightening cycle in 2019. If the US economy did falter, risky asset prices globally would probably fall quite sharply. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59c3e22ce4b0c2f349fe2af0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-21T16:02:02.480Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bank shares have been boosted by the prospect of higher interest rates, in the wake of the US Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday.

This helps the Eurozone economy as more confident consumers continue to boost household demand.</p> <p>While the breakdown of individual questions from the September survey has not been released yet, recent data shows expectations of major purchases in the coming year have jumped to levels last seen before the crisis, which is in line with an increasingly positive assessment of personal finances. Expectations of households\u2019 future financial situation have been improving too and there are few doubts related to the historically low expectations of unemployment in the coming 12 months.</p> <p>While expectations of economic growth in the coming years are modest, as the Eurozone is expected to revert to a weaker growth trend, buoyant consumers are helping GDP growth to remain above trend for a while.</p> <p>For the ECB, the euphoric consumer is another sign that cautious increases in upward price pressures are likely to continue.

In such an environment, the use of monetary policy is not the right instrument to address financial imbalances, and may lead to substantial deviations of aggregate output and inflation from their desirable levels. This is particularly so in a currency union where monetary policy affects the entire region, but financial imbalances may be local in nature. Macroprudential policies, targeted at particular markets or countries, can play a key role in addressing such imbalances. </p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi said European banks still had too many non-performing loans on their books:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite recent progress, the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) on European banks\u2019 balance sheets remains high. At the end of 2016, the stock of gross NPLs in the EU banking sector was around \u20ac1 trillion. This number, however, does not take into account the fact that that collateralised lending plays an important role in Europe. For example, including collateral and provisioning, the coverage of NPLs is, on average, 82% in the euro area. Banks\u2019 profitability, however, is affected by the lower returns provided by the NPLs, given the weight of gross exposures in total assets: gross NPLs represent 4% of the total assets of euro area banks, against only 0.8% for US banks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much has been achieved since the global financial crisis. In particular, banks in Europe are more resilient and the banking union has advanced. Moreover, authorities have the mandates and tools to tackle risks in the banking sector and are using them. These improvements have created a financial system that poses fewer risks to the real economy.</p> <p>At the same time, work remains to be done. Authorities need to watch out for blind spots, where risks can build up unnoticed, and use the tools at their disposal.

      "bodyText": "Creditors of Lehman Brothers are on track for a turbocharged windfall after the collapsed bank announced it is selling its stake in Nasdaq-listed Formula One auto racing, giving it a payout of $1.5bn from a $300m investment. The offering also brings the chequered flag down on former F1 chief executive Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s time as a shareholder. The billionaire business magnate is offloading his remaining stake for $20m. Ecclestone first took over the wheel of F1 40 years ago and transformed it from being an amateur hobby into a race series which had revenue of $1.8bn last year. Together, Ecclestone and his Bambino family trust have made an estimated $4.9bn from dividends and the sale of their shares. For the past decade, F1 has been controlled by the private equity firm CVC but in January it sold up to Colorado-based Liberty Media Corp for $4.6bn. Liberty paid $3bn in cash and offered $1.2bn of shares in its Nasdaq tracking stock which has the ticker FWONK. The remaining $351m came in the form of a loan that can be converted into stock. F1\u2019s former owners got the shares at the pre-takeover price of $21.26 and have made a turbocharged return. The shares have risen 80% in value since Liberty handed them over and closed at $38.27 on Wednesday. The share sale is expected to close Friday and is being led by Goldman Sachs. The biggest beneficiary is CVC which has made a total of $6.4bn from F1. It has yielded a 563% return on investment as CVC put in just $965.6m when it acquired F1 in a leveraged buyout in 2006. A number of American investors later joined its consortium including fund manager Waddell &amp; Reed which has made a total of $1.7bn from the $1.6bn it invested in 2012 for a 20.9% stake. Lehman, which has been involved with F1 since 2002 when it gave a $300m loan to German media firm Kirch to finance its purchase of shares in the sport. The loan was secured on the shares so when Kirch went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the same year it left Lehman with a 14.2% stake in F1. Four years later, Lehman sold its stake to CVC for $209.3m which was less than the loan it provided to Kirch. However, this was only a loss on paper as Lehman made the smart decision to reinvest the money in F1 giving it a 15.1% stake. In 2008, Lehman itself went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and moved its F1 stake from its bankrupt arm, Lehman Commercial Paper, into LBI Group, a newly formed holding company containing the valuable assets in its portfolio. LBI\u2019s purpose is to generate cash from its assets which is then used to pay Lehman\u2019s creditors. This is an ongoing process and dissolving it completely depends on settling all the claims from creditors. F1 first contributed to its returns in May 2012 when it paid out an $850m dividend with $130.1m going to Lehman. Five months later, Lehman cashed in again when it sold a 3% stake in F1 to the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System of Texas (TRS) for an estimated $200m. Rounding off a bumper year, in December 2012, F1 paid another dividend, which this time came to $1.2bn and was fuelled with income from a recent debt refinancing. Lehman\u2019s share of this was $147.6m and it received a further $121.1m in dividends over the next three years. It brought Lehman\u2019s payout to $808.1m by the time that Liberty bought F1. In line with its 12.1% F1 stake, Lehman got $363.6m of the $3bn cash offered by Liberty and it is also due $42.5m from the loan, which can be converted into stock. The sale of Lehman\u2019s FWONK shares has netted $325m which gives it a total return of $1.5bn. Liberty\u2019s management too have taken advantage of the accelerating stock price. Its chief financial officer, Mark Carleton, has sold all of his FWONK shares and has made $2.5m from this since the acquisition. However, the road ahead may not be so smooth. In July, the organizers of F1\u2019s flagship race, the British Grand Prix, cancelled their contract seven years early due to soaring hosting fees. Likewise, the organizers of next weekend\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix have also put the brakes on their race early as this year\u2019s will be their last \u2013 even though their contract runs until the end of 2018. In the medium term, there is also the threat of an investigation by Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office. In May, it announced that it had begun a pre-investigation into whether there is evidence of corruption in F1\u2019s governance contract the Concorde Agreement, a claim which has been denied by F1, CVC and the sport\u2019s governing body the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (Fia). Further down, the line comes the hurdle that all of Liberty\u2019s contracts with F1\u2019s teams expire at the end of 2020 so, as things stand, it only has three and a half years of guaranteed income. Perhaps ominously the teams have steadfastly resisted opportunities to buy FWONK shares which would give them a long-term interest in F1.",

The loan was secured on the shares so when Kirch went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the same year it left Lehman with a 14.2% stake in F1. </p> <p>Four years later, Lehman sold its stake to CVC for $209.3m which was less than the loan it provided to Kirch. However, this was only a loss on paper as Lehman made the smart decision to reinvest the money in F1 giving it a 15.1% stake. In 2008, Lehman itself went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and moved its F1 stake from its bankrupt arm, Lehman Commercial Paper, into LBI Group, a newly formed holding company containing the valuable assets in its portfolio.</p> <p>LBI\u2019s purpose is to generate cash from its assets which is then used to pay Lehman\u2019s creditors. This is an ongoing process and dissolving it completely depends on settling all the claims from creditors.</p> <p>F1 first contributed to its returns in May 2012 when it paid out an $850m dividend with $130.1m going to Lehman. Five months later, Lehman cashed in again when it sold a 3% stake in F1 to the Teachers\u2019 Retirement System of Texas (TRS) for an estimated $200m.</p> <p>Rounding off a bumper year, in December 2012, F1 paid another dividend, which this time came to $1.2bn and was fuelled with income from a recent debt refinancing. Lehman\u2019s share of this was $147.6m and it received a further $121.1m in dividends over the next three years. It brought Lehman\u2019s payout to $808.1m by the time that Liberty bought F1.</p> <p>In line with its 12.1% F1 stake, Lehman got $363.6m of the $3bn cash offered by Liberty and it is also due $42.5m from the loan, which can be converted into stock. The sale of Lehman\u2019s FWONK shares has netted $325m which gives it a total return of $1.5bn.</p> <p>Liberty\u2019s management too have taken advantage of the accelerating stock price. Its chief financial officer, Mark Carleton, has sold all of his FWONK shares and has made $2.5m from this since the acquisition.</p> <p>However, the road ahead may not be so smooth. In July, the organizers of F1\u2019s flagship race, the British Grand Prix, cancelled their contract seven years early due to soaring hosting fees. </p> <p>Likewise, the organizers of next weekend\u2019s Malaysian Grand Prix have also put the brakes on their race early as this year\u2019s will be their last \u2013 even though their contract runs until the end of 2018.</p> <p>In the medium term, there is also the threat of an investigation by Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office. In May, it announced that it had begun a pre-investigation into whether there is evidence of corruption in F1\u2019s governance contract the Concorde Agreement, a claim which has been denied by F1, CVC and the sport\u2019s governing body the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (Fia).</p> <p>Further down, the line comes the hurdle that all of Liberty\u2019s contracts with F1\u2019s teams expire at the end of 2020 so, as things stand, it only has three and a half years of guaranteed income. Perhaps ominously the teams have steadfastly resisted opportunities to buy FWONK shares which would give them a long-term interest in F1.<br><br></p>",

Drax Group\u2019s Dorothy Thompson will be succeeded by Will Gardiner, currently the chief financial officer, who will take over in January at a time when the company is eyeing a mix of gas, biomass and battery power to replace coal. During her 12-year tenure, Thompson oversaw a period of major change, converting three of Drax\u2019s huge coal-fired units to biomass and using acquisitions to expand into retail energy and gas power. \u201cI retire knowing the group is in excellent shape: it has the right strategy, the right team and in Will, the right leader,\u201d said Thompson. She said the company\u2019s scale meant it was a strategic player in UK electricity generation. One of the few women at the top of one of the UK\u2019s biggest energy generation companies, Thompson was not always comfortable in the glare of press scrutiny, but was a well-regarded leader who reinvented a major power firm. Along the way, she secured what will amount to billions of pounds in public subsidies for its wood-burning units. The company says the biomass units provide a reliable form of renewable electricity but critics have said their carbon dioxide savings do not stack up. With Theresa May reiterating this week that the UK will phase out coal power by 2025, the company knows its must continue to switch away from the fossil fuel. Last week Drax said it had informed planners it would consult on 3.6GW of new gas generation \u2013 slightly more than the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station \u2013 and 0.2GW of battery storage. Gardiner, who joined the company two years ago, said he would build on Thompson\u2019s legacy. \u201cThe changes we are seeing in the UK energy sector are unprecedented and we have an opportunity to thrive while doing the right thing for the UK energy market,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s share price was down by 0.45% to 309p after the announcement, but analysts welcomed Gardiner\u2019s appointment.

    "webTitle": "Co-op profits fall as it offloads final stake in bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group has reported a fall in profits after handing out \u00a335m to members and community projects, and selling its final 1% stake in the Co-op Bank. The mutual, which runs grocery shops, funeral homes and an insurance business, said it made underlying pre-tax profits of \u00a314m in the six months to 1 July, down 48% on the same period a year before. The decline was largely the result of a \u00a329m payout in discounts to member shoppers and nearly \u00a36m to local communities under its revived membership rewards scheme. Excluding the member payouts, underlying pretax profits rose 59% to \u00a343m. Steve Murrells, the group chief executive of the Co-op, who took over from Richard Pennycook earlier this year, said the membership scheme had helped increase sales in the group\u2019s established grocery stores by 3.5%, during a difficult time in the grocery market. Traditional grocers have come under pressure from the fast-expanding discounters Aldi and Lidl as shoppers have looked to save money in the face of inflation fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. \u201cThe reward scheme is absolutely the right thing to do when people are strapped for cash because of Brexit,\u201d Murrells said. He said the scheme, which attracted 1.1 million more members in the past year, allowed them to save and spend money in a digital wallet \u201cin the same way they would have done with Co-op stamps in yesteryear\u201d. Murrells said he expected inflation in the grocery market to continue \u201cfor a while\u201d and it was likely to \u201cbite the squeezed middle\u201d \u2013 a term for working families. \u201cIt will be really important for the Co-op to really show its difference,\u201d he said. He said the Co-op was doing that by putting money into community causes and continuing to support Fairtrade products, unlike some rivals who are experimenting with alternatives. Sales of Fairtrade goods rose 5% in the half year as the group used its ethically sourced cocoa in more own-brand items. Murrells added that striking a wholesale deal, as the Co-op is hoping to do with the Nisa group, which supplies thousands of independently run convenience stores, could also help build efficiency and lower prices for customers. Murrells said exclusive talks with Nisa would continue until the Co-op had decided whether or not to go ahead with an offer to the wholesaler\u2019s member shopkeepers. Murrells said a return of the Co-op dividend, once a much-loved pre-Christmas bonus to people across the UK, would be reviewed in 18 months\u2019 time. The dividend was suspended in 2013 as the group struggled for survival after a crisis at its bank. The bank was eventually rescued by hedge funds and the Co-op eventually forced to cut its stake to 20% until June this year when it was cut again to 1% under a new rescue deal. The Co-op said it had now sold that final stake for \u00a35m and its relationship agreement, under which the bank\u2019s customers can become Co-op members and benefit from a range of special deals, would come to an end in 2020. The bank has been allowed to continue using the Co-op name despite being majority owned by hedge funds because it built an ethical policy into its articles of association. Its use of the Co-op name is governed by regulation and overseen by the government and the Co-operatives UK body. These parties keep its right to the name under review and could withdraw it at any time. The final exit from the bank comes after a string of sell-offs, including farms, pharmacies and travel agencies, as the Co-op tries to recover from its troubled past. Allan Leighton, the Cop-op chairman, said the remaining businesses were \u201cnow in pretty good shape, growing sales and delivering profits and delivering for customers\u201d. Revenues at the group\u2019s funeralcare business rose 1.2% to \u00a3166m and at its legal services business rose 9.1% to \u00a312m. Underlying profits at the funeral and grocery businesses remained steady at \u00a341m and \u00a365m, but profits at the group\u2019s legal services business slid to \u00a30.2m from \u00a30.6m a year before and the insurance business slid to an operating loss of \u00a311m from a \u00a34m loss. Sales at the insurance business slid 21% to \u00a3164m as the mutual said it had decided to increase reinsurance through third parties.",

Speaking at the airline\u2019s AGM in Dublin on Thursday, he dismissed suggestions of industrial action from disgruntled pilots seeking improved employment terms. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how there would be industrial action in Ryanair,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a union.\u201d He said the airline had \u201csome goodies\u201d to discuss with pilots, but warned: \u201cIf pilots misbehave, that will be the end of the goodies.\u201d On Wednesday, a group of pilots turned down an offer of up to \u00a312,000 to keep flying during their scheduled leave, many of them putting their names to a letter demanding full employment contracts instead. Ryanair said in an email to pilots earlier this week that it needs them to fly more hours to avoid more flights being scrapped. But it now says that any new cancellations would be due to unforeseen reasons such as bad weather and would not be related to its staffing issues. O\u2019Leary appeared unwilling to give any ground in the standoff, instead threatening to cancel pilots\u2019 time off and questioning the extent of their talents. He said any that were due a four-week break in the next few months could be forced under the terms of their contract to delay one of those weeks until January, in exchange for double pay during that week. He also accused some pilots of being \u201cprecious about themselves\u201d and \u201cfull of their own self-importance\u201d. \u201cOnce you are trained and skilled at doing it \u2026 I would challenge any pilot to explain how this is a difficult job or how it is they are overworked, or how anybody who by law can\u2019t fly more than 18 hours a week could possibly be suffering from fatigue,\u201d he said. Two pilots told the Guardian that they and many of their colleagues were angered by O\u2019Leary\u2019s claims about their employment conditions. One said the figure of 18 hours quoted by O\u2019Leary appeared to have been calculated by dividing the maximum permitted 900 hours flight time per year by 52 weeks. He said this did not reflect the number of flight hours in a normal working week and also omitted many hours of time before and after flights. \u201cDuring my time working at Ryanair I worked on more than a few occasions over 50 hours per week,\u201d said the pilot, who asked not to be named in case it affected his job. \u201cIt frustrates many of my colleagues and myself to see such incorrect statements being made,\u201d he added. Another pilot who left Ryanair recently after more than five years said: \u201cIt\u2019s very much in character for [O\u2019Leary] to denigrate the job of what is traditionally a highly respected profession.\u201d A letter from pilots to Ryanair had signatories from bases across Europe turning down the airline\u2019s offer of a tax-free cash bonus and warning that they are prepared to \u201cwork to rule\u201d. If pilots make good on the threat, they will refuse to do anything outside their contractual obligations, such as turning up early to avoid delays or answering phone calls on days off. O\u2019Leary said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a bad relationship between Ryanair and our pilots. We asked on Monday for volunteers to work days off ... We have had huge cooperation and support from pilots.\u201d Referring to pilots\u2019 pay, he said: \u201cMaybe we have got it a bit on the low side,\u201d adding that increases might be needed in areas where recruitment is harder, such as London Stansted, Dublin, Frankfurt and Berlin. He said the airline has hired 125 new pilots in the past fortnight to help solve its rota problem. The outspoken chief executive repeated apologies to about 315,000 passengers and admitted the airline had made a \u201cmajor boo boo\u201d. But his contrition did not appear to have appease all investors, some of whom voted against the company\u2019s remuneration report and the re-election of board members. While nearly 89% of the votes cast were in favour of its pay deal for directors, US pension funds Calstrs and Calpers voted against, while Calstrs also voted against the re-election of nearly the entire board, including O\u2019Leary. Their fellow shareholder NN Investment Partners said in a recent report that it had \u201cgrowing concern about how the airline pays its staff and interacts with unions\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The City of London\u2019s most senior official has told the government it must move fast with its Brexit negotiations or risk an exodus of jobs and damage to the UK\u2019s financial sector. Before Theresa May\u2019s much-anticipated Brexit speech in Florence on Friday, Catherine McGuinness said posturing over the so-called divorce bill was delaying negotiations over the much-needed transition deal that would prevent the financial sector facing a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d in March 2019, when the UK will leave the EU. A quick deal, she said, might be better than a perfect deal. McGuinness, who chairs the policy and resources committee at the City of London Corporation \u2013 the local authority for the heart of the capital\u2019s financial district \u2013 warned that this was a critical moment if major insurers, banks and fund managers were to avoid implementing their Brexit contingency plans. She said: \u201cWe have to have progress \u2026 We\u2019re talking about jobs and the economy and ordinary people.\u201d The corporation is keeping a tally of official announcements from City firms about their contingency arrangements. It currently puts 9,770 roles at risk, with Frankfurt receiving more business than any other EU financial centre. Before the speech, it has been reported that the UK will offer \u20ac20bn to fill the hole in the budget of the remaining 27 members. \u201cThey need to get on and agree, and in considering what they need to pay, to consider the fact that if you haggle out every last penny you might get the most perfect deal in the world but find you lose more because business has gone unnecessarily and your tax-take has gone down,\u201d she said. The prime minister\u2019s speech has been billed as an attempt \u201cto update on Brexit negotiations so far\u201d and to \u201cunderline the government\u2019s wish for a deep and special partnership with the European Union once the UK leaves the EU\u201d. City firms have been instructed by the Bank of England to plan for all eventualities, including a \u201chard Brexit\u201d where the UK leaves the EU without any transition arrangement. The Bank had demanded details of their plans by 14 July and firms have begun to reveal how they intend to cope. For instance, Amsterdam has been picked for expansion by Royal Bank of Scotland, Dublin by Bank of America and Barclays, and Frankfurt by Morgan Stanley. \u201cThis is a critical moment where transition needs to be agreed and if we don\u2019t agree transition \u2026 people will have to start making arrangements, implementing the arrangements they have been making,\u201d McGuinness said. Without a transition deal, McGuinness said there would an \u201cunravelling\u201d of the City \u2013 which others have described as eco-system of financiers, lawyers and fund managers. But, she said, EU financial centres would not be overall beneficiaries, with New York and Singapore more likely to benefit from London\u2019s loss of business. McGuinness said the transitional deal must maintain the current trading relationship with the EU \u2013 a sentiment reflected by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, when he told a House of Lords committee this month that the transitional deal that the government was seeking would \u201clook a lot like the status quo\u201d. She said the City was seeking a bespoke deal once it left the EU, rather than copying other countries\u2019 trading arrangements with the bloc. McGuinness also called for clarity as soon as possible about the status of EU nationals living in the UK. Recent research by the City of London shows that capital\u2019s finance and insurance sectors rely on foreign workers: while 78% of jobs are held by British workers, 13% are from the EU and 9% from elsewhere. \u201cThe simple issue [is] people ought to feel welcome in their jobs and we need clarity as soon as we can,\u201d she said, warning that financial firms had told her EU nationals were hesitating in applying for jobs, while those here might be \u201cfeeling unwanted and unwelcomed\u201d. There was a need to spell out the status of people living here, she said, because \u201cit\u2019s just not fair\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s public sector spending deficit dropped to its lowest August total since 2007 after an increase in VAT revenues and a squeeze on local authority borrowing. The deficit in August stood at \u00a35.7bn, down 18% compared with the same month last year, beating forecasts of \u00a37.1bn in a Reuters poll of economists. August\u2019s strong performance, after a better than expected July, is likely to be welcomed in the Treasury where the chancellor, Philip Hammond. has come under pressure to relax planned austerity measures and give ground to lobbying for higher public sector pay. Value-added tax receipts rose 5.6% on the year to \u00a311.6bn in August, the highest for that month on record, and stood 3.1% higher in the April to August period at \u00a356.5bn. But the boost from VAT made only a modest dent in the shortfall for the financial year since April, leaving the public debt still rising as a proportion of GDP. The government\u2019s spending deficit for the full financial year is unlikely to beat last year\u2019s drop to 2.3% of GDP. And with GDP growth struggling to get above 1% this year and next, the prospect is that the Treasury will see the overall debt-to-GDP level edge closer to 90%. Worryingly, the Treasury suffered a fall in its main source of income \u2013 income tax \u2013 which dropped by \u00a3100m in August. National insurance increased by \u00a3600m to more than offset the fall in income tax revenue. Debt interest payments are expected to rise, further narrowing Hammond\u2019s room to increase spending while bringing down the deficit. John Hawksworth, PwC\u2019s chief economist, said it was encouraging that the gap between government revenues and current spending had fallen relative to last year, as central government receipts increased by 4% compared to an increase in spending of around 3%. \u201cThis suggests that the chancellor should have room for some easing of austerity in his budget in November. This could involve extra money for priorities such as the NHS, social care, housing and infrastructure investment as well as some further relaxation of the public sector pay cap,\u201d he said. But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there was no sign of the chancellor easing his grip on government spending. \u201cWe doubt the chancellor will ease the fiscal consolidation significantly in the budget on November 22.\u201d He said the Treasury\u2019s official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, was likely to revise down its \u201coptimistic forecast\u201d for wage growth and revise up its forecast for debt interest payments in response to the recent jump in the interest bill on government bonds. \u201cIn addition, the chancellor likely will retain scope to ease the fiscal consolidation in the event of a damaging hard Brexit rather than ease policy now,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair customers face the threat of a fresh wave of flight cancellations as the airline\u2019s pilots prepare to reject an offer of a cash bonus if they give up days off. The Guardian has obtained a draft letter signed by Ryanair pilots from across Europe, rejecting the offer and warning they will now \u201cwork to rule\u201d - refusing to work beyond their basic contractual obligations. Ryanair had told pilots earlier this week that if they declined the \u00a312,000 payment more flights might have to be scrapped. The no-frills carrier is scrambling to cope with a public relations disaster after it announced plans to cancel up to 50 flights a day until 31 October, citing a \u201cmess-up\u201d in how it schedules time off for pilots. The move has affected 315,000 customers. The letter circulating at Ryanair bases across Europe states: \u201cWe would like to advise that with immediate effect the pilot workforce at the bases [airports] listed below rescind the goodwill that has been extended toward the company for many years,including working days off and turning up early. In short, we shall now \u2018work to rule\u2019.\u201d Working to rule would mean pilots refusing to help the airline by going beyond the terms of their contracts, which would involve working days off, arriving for shifts early or even answering company calls when they are not at work. The pilots have been spurred on by colleagues flying for rival European airlines, amid concern that Ryanair is leading a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d that has seen terms and conditions watered down across the industry. The draft letter is a response to Ryanair\u2019s chief operations officer, Michael Hickey, who this week offered a tax free bonus of up to \u00a312,000 to pilots willing to give up time off in an effort \u201cto avoid further cancellations\u201d. The letter takes issue with Hickey\u2019s offer on six separate grounds, including that pilots must have worked 800 flight hours in a year to be eligible for the tax-free bonus. \u201cPilots have checked their logbooks and many have never achieved 800 flight hours in a single 12-month period ever,\u201d it says. The pilots also object to \u201cambiguity\u201d surrounding the offer\u2019s conditions, including the number of days off they would be required to work to get the bonus and whether enough days would even be allocated by Ryanair. Ryanair pilots at the airline\u2019s bases across Europe are discussing whether to put their names to the letter, but several are understood to have done so already. The airline\u2019s 4,200 pilots \u2013 many of whom work as agency contractors \u2013 are not unionised, and could face the risk of being fired for taking such action. But one pilot familiar with the discussions said the airline, which has seen more than 700 pilots quit in the past year, is too short of experience to take such drastic action. \u201cThey are not in a position to fire pilots because it would exacerbate their problem,\u201d they said. The letter also makes reference to pilots\u2019 strong bargaining position, saying: \u201cThe company faces a pilot shortage and even if this is only for a short period of time, the reputational damage that could result [...] could be extremely long lasting both in terms of customer and shareholder confidence.\u201d Ryanair pilots are being encouraged and offered advice by their peers at airlines across Europe. \u201cThere has been a race to the bottom in terms and conditions which is led by Ryanair and it\u2019s having an impact throughout Europe,\u201d the pilot said. \u201cIt\u2019s sucking guys out of Europe to the Middle East and China where terms and pay are better.\u201d Pilots are expected to demand that Ryanair agree to offer them local contracts offering full employee rights under the employment law in the country where they are based. \u201cThe continued erosion of the pilots terms and conditions over the past 10 to 15 years has to be not only stopped but reversed,\u201d the letter says. Ryanair has not yet returned a request for comment. The airline said on Wednesday that it hoped to have made new arrangements for more than 175,00 customers on other Ryanair flights and processed 63,000 refunds, taking on extra customer service staff to deal with the problem. But consumer group Which? said the information it had offered to passengers about compensation \u201cfalls woefully short\u201d. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u201cIt [Ryanair] is legally required to spell out compensation rules when a flight is cancelled and, in our view, have so far failed to do that, leaving passengers hunting around for information. \u201cThis is another blow for the thousands of passengers who have already had to endure huge inconvenience as a result of this fiasco. \u201cThe airline must now automatically compensate eligible passengers without them having to go through the additional hassle of making a claim.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The EU is pushing ahead with plans to rewrite tax rules for technology companies, aimed at increasing governments\u2019 take from the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon. The European commission is looking at ways to capture tax from companies that may have no offices, shops or other physical presence in a country, but are accruing profits through large numbers of online users or customers. A report published by the commission on Thursday said technology companies paid less than half the tax of bricks-and-mortar businesses. A digital business with international operations typically pays a 10.1% tax rate in the EU, compared with a 23.2% rate levied on traditional companies, said the report. In reality, many technology companies pay far less than their high street rivals. Amazon\u2019s corporation tax bill in the UK is 11 times smaller than that of British bookstores, a recent study found. In Ireland, the European commission concluded that Apple paid 0.005% to Irish tax authorities in 2014, far below the corporation tax rate of 12.5%. Apple continues to fight the ruling. The commission published the report to shed light on the gap, with momentum building for action after France seized the initiative with a proposal to tax technology companies on turnover, rather than a conventional corporation tax on profits. The French plan has won support from 10 EU member states, including Germany, Italy and Spain, but commission policymakers are uneasy about departing from the convention of taxing profits. EU officials think taxing turnover may not work for all technology companies, although they are not ruling it out, especially as a stopgap measure. \u201cA tax on all untaxed or insufficiently taxed income generated from all internet-based business activities\u201d is listed as a possible short-term option in the paper. As a long-term answer, the commission is looking at revising the rules on permanent establishment, so businesses could be taxed in countries even if they have no offices, warehouses or shops there. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, said the commission\u2019s first choice was a common corporate tax base for companies. Aimed at introducing a common set of tax rules, but not rates, the CCTB is a longstanding tax harmonisation policy that has been blocked by hostile member states, including the UK, since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s the commission\u2019s preferred solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe digital presence of companies could be included to solve once and for all the question of digital taxation.\u201d Moscovici said all options were on the table and called on EU member states to find \u201ca consensus on the most fair, efficient and permanent solution\u201d. The UK\u2019s impending departure from the EU in 2019 could make it easier to agree common tax measures. However, Britain was never alone in its opposition, as Ireland also did not support the plans. Although the UK has a say on the legislative proposals on the table, Moscovici pointedly excluded Britain in his statement. \u201cThis is an issue on which we have to advance as 27 if we want to be effective,\u201d he said. \u201cAt all costs, we must avoid creating digital havens on one side where taxation is more attractive, and administrative nightmares on the other for European companies that want to grow in the single market.\u201d Taxing tech companies is on the agenda of an EU leaders\u2019 summit devoted to the digital economy in Tallinn on 29 September.

      "body": "<p>The EU is pushing ahead with plans to rewrite tax rules for technology companies, aimed at increasing governments\u2019 take from the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon.</p> <p>The European commission is looking at ways to capture tax from companies that may have no offices, shops or other physical presence in a country, but are accruing profits through large numbers of online users or customers.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/1_en_act_part1_v10_en.pdf\">report</a> published by the commission on Thursday said technology companies paid less than half the tax of bricks-and-mortar businesses.</p> <p>A digital business with international operations typically pays a 10.1% tax rate in the EU, compared with a 23.2% rate levied on traditional companies, said the report. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In reality, many technology companies pay far less than their high street rivals. Amazon\u2019s corporation tax bill in the UK is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/12/amazon-pays-11-times-less-corporation-tax-than-traditional-booksellers\">11 times smaller</a> than that of British bookstores, a recent study found. In Ireland, the European commission <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">concluded that Apple paid 0.005% to Irish tax authorities in 2014</a>, far below the corporation tax rate of 12.5%. Apple continues to fight the ruling.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/11/google-appeals-eu-fine-search-engine-results-shopping-service\">Google appeals against EU's \u20ac2.4bn fine over search engine results</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The commission published the report to shed light on the gap, with momentum building for action after France seized the initiative with a proposal to tax technology companies on turnover, rather than a conventional corporation tax on profits.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The French plan has won support from 10 EU member states, including Germany, Italy and Spain, but commission policymakers are uneasy about departing from the convention of taxing profits. EU officials think taxing turnover may not work for all technology companies, although they are not ruling it out, especially as a stopgap measure.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cA tax on all untaxed or insufficiently taxed income generated from all internet-based business activities\u201d is listed as a possible short-term option in the paper. As a long-term answer, the commission is looking at revising the rules on permanent establishment, so businesses could be taxed in countries even if they have no offices, warehouses or shops there.</p> <p>Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, said the commission\u2019s first choice was a common corporate tax base for companies. Aimed at introducing a common set of tax rules, but not rates, the CCTB is a longstanding tax harmonisation policy that has been blocked by hostile member states, including the UK, since 2007.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the commission\u2019s preferred solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe digital presence of companies could be included to solve once and for all the question of digital taxation.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Moscovici said all options were on the table and called on EU member states to find \u201ca consensus on the most fair, efficient and permanent solution\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The UK\u2019s impending departure from the EU in 2019 could make it easier to agree common tax measures. However, Britain was never alone in its opposition, as Ireland also did not support the plans.</p> <p>Although the UK has a say on the legislative proposals on the table, Moscovici pointedly excluded Britain in his statement. </p> <p>\u201cThis is an issue on which we have to advance as 27 if we want to be effective,\u201d he said. \u201cAt all costs, we must avoid creating digital havens on one side where taxation is more attractive, and administrative nightmares on the other for European companies that want to grow in the single market.\u201d</p> <p>Taxing tech companies is on the agenda of an EU leaders\u2019 summit devoted to the digital economy in Tallinn on 29 September.</p> <p>Before publishing legal proposals, the EU wants to see how far the rest of the world will go.
