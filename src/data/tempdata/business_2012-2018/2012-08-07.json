Other banks, such as the Dutch ING group and Wall Street's JP Morgan, have also had to pay big penalties.</p> <p>Gary Greenwood, banking analyst at Shore Capital, thought it was unlikely Standard Chartered would lose its US licence. \"A loss of its US banking licence would not only jeopardise part of this profit stream, but the associated reputational damage could also have a severely damaging impact to its operations within emerging markets \u2026 However, at this stage, we view this outcome to be unlikely.\"</p> <p>City analysts have been supporters of Standard Chartered shares throughout much of the financial crisis, which the bank survived without taxpayer bailouts.</p> <p>Even so Sandy Chen, at Cenkos Securities, who has recommended buying the shares for most of the past decade said he was downgrading to sell. \"We regard this as hugely damaging to its global franchise,\" he said.</p> <p>Mike Trippitt, an analyst at Oriel, cut his rating to \"reduce\" from \"buy\". He said: \"The tone and language of the report is quite shocking, but it was equally a very firm rebuttal from Standard Chartered to say it was acting lawfully and measuring what they think was outside the rules.\"</p> <p>There were also supporters. Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec, described the US regulators' move as \"unexpected and ferocious attack\".</p> <p>Gordon said: \"Standard Chartered is not an ordinary bank. It has a proud reputation, a management team of high integrity, and is known for its magnificent work with the charity Seeing is Believing. It is of grave concern to see its reputation sullied before the facts are known.\"</p> <p>Greenwood added: \"As is par for the course in these situations the spotlight will now fall on management, with the inevitable calls for heads to roll by politicians and the media alike. However, while not wishing to vindicate senior management in this issue, we believe a knee-jerk reaction of removing them is not the answer as it may only exacerbate the situation.</p> <p>\"We believe that the management team now needs to focus all of its efforts on mitigating the potential reputational damage.\"</p> <h2>Key players<br></h2> <p><strong>Peter Sands</strong></p> <p>Sands is one of the few bankers to remain at the top of their institution through the financial crisis after taking the top job in 2006. During his tenure, he more than doubled the number of employees from 28,000 to more than 80,00 and could seemingly do no wrong. He has been close to successive governments and used the bank's central London offices to host meetings with ministers and civil servants at the height of the downturn, creating the scheme for taxpayers to save RBS, HBOS and Lloyds. His reputation surged, helped by the decision to waive his \u00a32m bonus in 2010, and he had been mooted as the next governor of the Bank of England. More recently he was part of the review into university funding, which suggested fees rise to \u00a39,000-a-year, and is a non-executive director at the Department of Health.</p> <p><strong>Richard Meddings</strong></p> <p>The polite finance director had been one of the front-runners to replace Bob Diamond at the helm of Barclays. He worked there as group financial controller before joining Standard Chartered in 2002 and was finance director of Woolwich when it was bought by Barclays in 2000. At Standard Chartered the married father-of-three was group executive director responsible for risk, and is said to have been on a list of those warned by the bank's US chief executive about the potential problems in dealing with Iran in 2006. A month later he was named finance director. In 2008, amid the financial crisis he advised the government at the height of the financial crisis and more recently he has been fending off questions about whether the bank will move its HQ overseas.</p> <p><strong>Mervyn Davies</strong></p> <p>The fast-talking Welshman was a virtual unknown outside banking circles before he was named chief executive of Standard Chartered in 2001, having previously run the bank's Asian operation. The football and rugby fanatic, who started his career with the bank in 1993 after 10 years at Citibank, quickly built a solid reputation and impressed politicians. After five years as CEO, he was promoted to chairman in 2006 \u2013 in breach of corporate governance codes. Gordon Brown appointed him chairman of his Business Council for Britain in 2007 and at the height of the banking crisis Davies helped provide the outline to the bailout. He was given a life peerage and became trade minister under Lord Mandelson, although Brown was keen to make him RBS chairman. He is the government's board diversity czar and is calling for more women in boardrooms.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Lawsky</strong></p> <p>The superintendent of financial services in New York State is a newly created role which Lawsky has taken to with aplomb. Well known in political circles, he was chief of staff to New York state governor Andrew Cuomo and previously a deputy counsellor and special assistant when Cuomo was attorney general. With a ferocious work ethic and a talent for public relations, the 42-year-old grandson of refugees from Nazi Germany wanted to become an architect, but settled for law, prosecuting white collar crime, organised crime, and terrorism cases in New York. He says his objectives are \"keeping New York on the cutting edge as the financial capital of the world, protecting consumers better than ever before, and serving as a model of efficient government.\"</p> <p>Profiles by Simon Neville<strong> </strong></p>", 
      "bodyText": "The Labour MP John Mann, an outspoken member of the Treasury select committee, has called for a government inquiry into money laundering, and outlined fears that US regulators have British banks in their sights as they try to shift business from London to New York. The allegations against Standard Chartered, made on Monday by the little-known New York state department of financial services, also prompted calls by the investment advisory agency Pirc for discussions with top bankers about the industry's ethics. One large shareholder in banking stocks warned that it was considering ditching all its investments in the sector in the wake of the Libor scandal and the money laundering allegations at HSBC \u2013 which were compounded by the allegations against Standard Chartered. The damning criticism of Standard Chartered, which intends to contest the claims that it worked with Iran, is another blow to the reputation of UK banking businesses, and is thought to be feeding prejudice in the US that the UK's regulators have allowed a \"wild west\" culture to become established. Mann, the MP for Bassetlaw, said he would request a government review into money laundering and \"an increasing anti-British bias by US regulators and politicians aimed at shifting financial markets from London to New York\". He said: \"I have no truck whatsoever with British banks profiteering from Iran and Burma, nor with US banks profiteering from drug and illegal arms money or the private accounts of world dictators. The British parliament should instigate an unbiased and far-reaching investigation into money laundering in Britain, involving British banks and endangering the wellbeing of British interests and the British people.\" The sharp fall in Standard Chartered shares demonstrated that the accusations were being taken seriously by investors, who last week were celebrating the 10th successive year of record profits at the bank, which though based in London specialises in emerging markets. \"Shareholders should now be thinking about industry-wide engagement to sort out the reputational and ethical crisis that is engulfing the UK banking sector,\" said the agency Pirc. Standard Chartered's share price was hit particularly hard by fears that the hitherto top-rated management team might be forced out by the allegations and worries that the bank would be at risk of losing its licence in the US. Banking analysts at Credit Suisse said that licences had not been revoked from other banks for similar offences, but acknowledged: \"The market is already concerned about litigation risk and regulatory issues in the sector, especially given recent events at Barclays and HSBC, so this does not help sentiment at a time when it is fragile.\" More details were being sought by investors and analysts, although the Credit Suisse analysts noted that Standard Chartered was not the first bank to encounter the wrath of US regulators over sanctions breaches.

Gary Greenwood, banking analyst at Shore Capital, thought it was unlikely Standard Chartered would lose its US licence. \"A loss of its US banking licence would not only jeopardise part of this profit stream, but the associated reputational damage could also have a severely damaging impact to its operations within emerging markets \u2026 However, at this stage, we view this outcome to be unlikely.\" City analysts have been supporters of Standard Chartered shares throughout much of the financial crisis, which the bank survived without taxpayer bailouts. Even so Sandy Chen, at Cenkos Securities, who has recommended buying the shares for most of the past decade said he was downgrading to sell. \"We regard this as hugely damaging to its global franchise,\" he said. Mike Trippitt, an analyst at Oriel, cut his rating to \"reduce\" from \"buy\". He said: \"The tone and language of the report is quite shocking, but it was equally a very firm rebuttal from Standard Chartered to say it was acting lawfully and measuring what they think was outside the rules.\" There were also supporters. Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec, described the US regulators' move as \"unexpected and ferocious attack\". Gordon said: \"Standard Chartered is not an ordinary bank. It has a proud reputation, a management team of high integrity, and is known for its magnificent work with the charity Seeing is Believing. It is of grave concern to see its reputation sullied before the facts are known.\" Greenwood added: \"As is par for the course in these situations the spotlight will now fall on management, with the inevitable calls for heads to roll by politicians and the media alike. However, while not wishing to vindicate senior management in this issue, we believe a knee-jerk reaction of removing them is not the answer as it may only exacerbate the situation. \"We believe that the management team now needs to focus all of its efforts on mitigating the potential reputational damage.\" Key players Peter Sands Sands is one of the few bankers to remain at the top of their institution through the financial crisis after taking the top job in 2006. During his tenure, he more than doubled the number of employees from 28,000 to more than 80,00 and could seemingly do no wrong. He has been close to successive governments and used the bank's central London offices to host meetings with ministers and civil servants at the height of the downturn, creating the scheme for taxpayers to save RBS, HBOS and Lloyds. His reputation surged, helped by the decision to waive his \u00a32m bonus in 2010, and he had been mooted as the next governor of the Bank of England. More recently he was part of the review into university funding, which suggested fees rise to \u00a39,000-a-year, and is a non-executive director at the Department of Health. Richard Meddings The polite finance director had been one of the front-runners to replace Bob Diamond at the helm of Barclays. He worked there as group financial controller before joining Standard Chartered in 2002 and was finance director of Woolwich when it was bought by Barclays in 2000. At Standard Chartered the married father-of-three was group executive director responsible for risk, and is said to have been on a list of those warned by the bank's US chief executive about the potential problems in dealing with Iran in 2006. A month later he was named finance director. In 2008, amid the financial crisis he advised the government at the height of the financial crisis and more recently he has been fending off questions about whether the bank will move its HQ overseas. Mervyn Davies The fast-talking Welshman was a virtual unknown outside banking circles before he was named chief executive of Standard Chartered in 2001, having previously run the bank's Asian operation. The football and rugby fanatic, who started his career with the bank in 1993 after 10 years at Citibank, quickly built a solid reputation and impressed politicians. After five years as CEO, he was promoted to chairman in 2006 \u2013 in breach of corporate governance codes. Gordon Brown appointed him chairman of his Business Council for Britain in 2007 and at the height of the banking crisis Davies helped provide the outline to the bailout. He was given a life peerage and became trade minister under Lord Mandelson, although Brown was keen to make him RBS chairman. He is the government's board diversity czar and is calling for more women in boardrooms. Benjamin Lawsky The superintendent of financial services in New York State is a newly created role which Lawsky has taken to with aplomb. Well known in political circles, he was chief of staff to New York state governor Andrew Cuomo and previously a deputy counsellor and special assistant when Cuomo was attorney general. With a ferocious work ethic and a talent for public relations, the 42-year-old grandson of refugees from Nazi Germany wanted to become an architect, but settled for law, prosecuting white collar crime, organised crime, and terrorism cases in New York. He says his objectives are \"keeping New York on the cutting edge as the financial capital of the world, protecting consumers better than ever before, and serving as a model of efficient government.\" Profiles by Simon Neville",

He was the architect of the current strategy to ensure that we developed real scale in our key businesses.\" Marks will continue his role as a non-executive director of Thomas Cook and look for other boardroom positions. He joined Yorkshire Co-operatives in 1967 as a management trainee and rose to become chief executive in 2000. He then became chief executive of the enlarged Co-operative Group in 2007 when United Co-operatives merged with the Co-op Group.",

The Guardian understands that the group's private equity owners have received a bid from a consortium of Chinook Urban Mining, the London-based recycling specialist, private equity investor Clearbrook Capital and US bank JP Morgan. Biffa is under pressure to pay back \u00a31.1bn of loans and has contracts with local authorities including Portsmouth city council, East Hampshire district and Winchester city council, and the Isle of Anglesey county council.

The group exceeded market forecasts with underlying earnings of $4bn, in a performance that will have stiffened the resistance of its second largest shareholder \u2013 Qatar Holding \u2013 to Glencore's approach. Glencore, which is Xstrata's largest investor with a 34% stake, has offered 2.8 shares for each Xstrata share \u2013 an offer backed by the Xstrata board. The Qatari sovereign wealth fund, however, is demanding at least 3.25 Glencore shares for each Xstrata share. Qatar Holding owns 11.4% of Xstrata and its stance is an impediment to the deal. Mick Davis, Xstrata chief executive, remained bullish about the deal, saying that he expected it to close in the last three months of the year. \"The business model of the combined entity is a more powerful business model,\" he said, but declined to comment further on the deal. He added: \"The inherent capacity of Xstrata to generate value as a standalone company is very powerful indeed. We have no concerns on that front.\" A shareholder meeting on the Xstrata proposal is scheduled for 7 September. Because Glencore cannot vote its 34% stake, in order for the deal to fail it requires shareholders representing around 16.5% of the investor base to come out against the proposal. Glencore has until two weeks before the vote to amend the terms. Jason Fairclough, analyst at Bank of America, said Xstrata's shares are likely to be driven by the market view of the merger rather than earnings. He said: \"We think the rationale for the proposed merger is still compelling.\" Alison Turner, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the results would not hand an advantage to either camp.

But the 2.9% drop in production was smaller than had been feared by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), raising hopes of a small upward revision in growth estimates for the second quarter of 2012. City analysts had been braced for a much bigger impact from the double bank holiday following the 6% drop in output between May and June in 2002, when there was also an extra day off to celebrate the golden jubilee. They warned, however, that the outlook for UK industry remained challenging given the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the weakness of domestic demand. The ONS said it now believed industrial production \u2013 which includes North Sea output and electricity and gas supply in addition to manufacturing \u2013 contracted by 0.9% between the first and second quarters of this year, compared with the 1.3% fall that was used to calculate the growth figures. Official figures released last month showed that the economy remained in a double-dip recession after a third consecutive drop in gross domestic product. Chris Williamson, analyst at Markit, said: \"The shallower drop in production means GDP should be revised up from -0.7% to -0.6%, but that clearly still indicates a steep downturn. Stripping out the jubilee effect, thought to have depressed GDP by as much as 0.5%, leaves a slightly more encouraging picture of an economy broadly stagnating in the second quarter, which is much more in line with the modest growth signalled be the business surveys.\" Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: \"Our feedback suggests that confidence remains fragile, but there are still bright spots to be found in some export markets. The question is whether July's data will confirm that output was simply displaced or if this is the beginning of a more worrying downward trend.\"",

The Newcastle baker said like-for-like sales at its London stores jumped 10% in the first week of the games with its branch in the Westfield shopping centre \u2013 next to the Olympic Park in Stratford \u2013 reporting record takings. Its chief executive Ken McMeikan said the Olympics had provided some welcome relief after torrential rain resulted in a summer sales washout with like-for-like sales dropping 3.5% in the three months to 30 June. McMeikan said the \"extreme weather\" experienced in the second quarter was bad for business as it deterred Britons from visiting their local high streets with footfall down more than 7%. The dank start to the summer saw sales of winter favourites such as porridge and soup jump by 19% and 21% respectively. Trading conditions were so grim McMeikan said there \"was a point in the second quarter when it considered selling umbrellas\". Greggs' profit margins were squeezed partly because it ran more promotions \u2013 with profits falling 4.5% to \u00a316.5m in the six months to 30 June. Greggs has been experimenting with new store types including its fledgling coffee shop chain \"Greggs moment\". Its latest high-street incarnation is under the upmarket banner \"Greggs the Bakery\" which the company says offers a \"more traditional baker's shop experience\" with customers able to see freshly baked bread coming out of the oven. The new store, which debuted in Newcastle at the end of June, sees the no-frills baker serve up artisan loaves such as herb focaccia and green olive bread for the first time, as well exotic scone flavours such as chocolate and orange. McMeikan denied it was an attempt to pull in wealthier shoppers arguing Greggs was already a broad church. \"We don't see these as posher products,\" he said. \"Artisan bread is bought through supermarkets and other bakers and has become much more commonplace, it just wasn't present in Greggs stores, which have a more traditional bread and rolls range.\" McMeikan said the group's profile had been raised by the furore over the pasty tax, caused by George Osborne's decision to charge 20% VAT on hot pasties and sausage roll. MPs from Cornwall joined the campaign against the levy, which was strengthened by a 300,000-strong petition. Osborne backed down on the tax, and other ill-received budget measures, in May. \"There's no question that the profile of Greggs is significantly higher than it was before the pasty tax started,\" said McMeikan, who delivered the petition to Downing Street. \"But we were not able to see how much that has benefited sales; the chancellor announced the tax in March but in April it started raining and didn't stop.\" Greggs is on course to open a record 90 outlets this year with McMeikan, a Falklands veteran, seeing scope to expand the 1,600 strong chain to more than 2,000 outlets. The baker also plans to open 28 franchise stores in Moto service stations, creating 500 jobs.",

As for trading, the company said half year revenues rose 3% to $878m, with operating profit up 6% to $286m. It plans to increase the interim dividend by 31%. Chief executive Richard Solomons said: While the global economic environment remains uncertain, InterContinental continues to trade well and we are confident that our strategy will deliver high quality growth into the future. Simon French at Panmure Gordon raised his target price from \u00a315.45 to \u00a316.70 but kept a hold recommendation. He said: InterContinental has announced first half results in line with expectations. Current trading is slightly weaker with July revenue per available room growth of 3.8% [compared to 6.5% in the first half] and we expect full year consensus forecasts of $602m earnings before interest and tax to remain unchanged. This return of cash will help maintain an efficient balance sheet. At Investec, James Hollins said he was likely to raise his full year forecasts by around 2%, and raised his target price from \u00a317 to \u00a318.50 with a buy recommendation. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 10.77 points at 5798.00 after two days of gains. But without Standard Chartered's 23% fall after allegations of $250bn of illegal transactions with Iran - a decline which accounted for a 26 point fall in the FTSE - the index would have been higher. Elsewhere Xstrata has added 20.5p to 903.5p after it reported a better than expected 31% fall in first half profits. The miner, currently in the throes of a merger with Glencore, said cost cutting offset the impact of weaker prices and lower copper production.",

At the time, October 2006, this title was held by Richard Meddings, who was promoted to finance director the following month. The bank would not comment on individuals.</p> <p>Meddings and Peter Sands, who was promoted from finance director to chief executive in November 2006, are highly regarded and respectively regarded as potential candidates for top jobs at Barclays and as the next governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>Until November 2006 Mervyn Davies had been chief executive \u2013 a role he held since 2001 \u2013 until he was elevated to chairman. He later became Lord Davies when he joined the Labour government during the financial crisis and left the bank. Among others to have sat on the board are Lord Turner, who was a non-executive director for two years until he left in late 2008 to become chairman of the Financial Services Authority.</p> <p>While the US authorities said that $250bn had been hidden for nearly a decade, Standard Chartered conceded that \"under $14m\" had breached so-called U-turns, which were transactions that US authorities allowed to take place as long as the money did not end up in Iranian banks. The bank stopped dealing with Iran five years ago.</p> <p>\"As we have disclosed to the authorities, well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations. The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-turn was under $14m,\" Standard Chartered said.</p> <p>In 2010, 2011 and only last week when it published another rise in profits, the bank has admitted it was in discussions with US regulators about historic breaches of sanctions.</p> <p>But it appears to have been wrong footed by the New York regulator, which it had expected to co-ordinate with other US agencies. Standard Chartered is also in discussions with the department of justice, the office of foreign assets control, the Federal Reserve group of New York and the district attorney of New York.</p> <p>Standard Chartered said it had \"voluntarily approached all relevant US agencies\" in January 2010 and \"informed them that we had initiated a review of historical US dollar transactions and their compliance with US sanctions\".</p> <p>\"This review focused primarily on transactions relating to Iran in the period 2001-2007, and in particular, their compliance with the U-turn framework established by the US authorities to enable ongoing US dollar trade with Iran by other countries.\"</p> <p>Several thousands of pages of documents and interview notes, plus analysis of approximately 150m payment messages were handed over. The New York regulator accuses Standard Chartered of hiding the transactions by wiping out codes used in the payment system that would have identified Iranian clients.</p> <p>\"The group does not believe the order issued \u2026 presents a full and accurate picture of the facts. The analysis, that the group shared with all the US agencies, demonstrates that throughout the period the group acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply, with US sanctions and the regulations relating to U-turn payments,\" said the bank.</p> <p>Its review of its Iranian payments also did not identify a single payment on behalf of any party that was designated at the time by the US government as a terrorist entity or organisation,\" it said.</p> <p>\"The group takes its responsibilities very seriously, and seeks to comply at all times with the relevant laws and regulations. It is in this spirit we initiated this review and have engaged with the US agencies,\" the bank said.</p>",

At the time, October 2006, this title was held by Richard Meddings, who was promoted to finance director the following month. The bank would not comment on individuals. Meddings and Peter Sands, who was promoted from finance director to chief executive in November 2006, are highly regarded and respectively regarded as potential candidates for top jobs at Barclays and as the next governor of the Bank of England. Until November 2006 Mervyn Davies had been chief executive \u2013 a role he held since 2001 \u2013 until he was elevated to chairman. He later became Lord Davies when he joined the Labour government during the financial crisis and left the bank. Among others to have sat on the board are Lord Turner, who was a non-executive director for two years until he left in late 2008 to become chairman of the Financial Services Authority. While the US authorities said that $250bn had been hidden for nearly a decade, Standard Chartered conceded that \"under $14m\" had breached so-called U-turns, which were transactions that US authorities allowed to take place as long as the money did not end up in Iranian banks. The bank stopped dealing with Iran five years ago. \"As we have disclosed to the authorities, well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations. The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-turn was under $14m,\" Standard Chartered said. In 2010, 2011 and only last week when it published another rise in profits, the bank has admitted it was in discussions with US regulators about historic breaches of sanctions. But it appears to have been wrong footed by the New York regulator, which it had expected to co-ordinate with other US agencies. Standard Chartered is also in discussions with the department of justice, the office of foreign assets control, the Federal Reserve group of New York and the district attorney of New York. Standard Chartered said it had \"voluntarily approached all relevant US agencies\" in January 2010 and \"informed them that we had initiated a review of historical US dollar transactions and their compliance with US sanctions\". \"This review focused primarily on transactions relating to Iran in the period 2001-2007, and in particular, their compliance with the U-turn framework established by the US authorities to enable ongoing US dollar trade with Iran by other countries.\" Several thousands of pages of documents and interview notes, plus analysis of approximately 150m payment messages were handed over. The New York regulator accuses Standard Chartered of hiding the transactions by wiping out codes used in the payment system that would have identified Iranian clients. \"The group does not believe the order issued \u2026 presents a full and accurate picture of the facts. The analysis, that the group shared with all the US agencies, demonstrates that throughout the period the group acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply, with US sanctions and the regulations relating to U-turn payments,\" said the bank. Its review of its Iranian payments also did not identify a single payment on behalf of any party that was designated at the time by the US government as a terrorist entity or organisation,\" it said. \"The group takes its responsibilities very seriously, and seeks to comply at all times with the relevant laws and regulations. It is in this spirit we initiated this review and have engaged with the US agencies,\" the bank said.",
