The most recent in a flurry of aggressive statements from Argentina, seemingly timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the country's invasion of the Falklands, emerged this weekend. Argentina's embassy in London has sent a two-page letter to up to 15 banks, thought to include Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs, raising the threat of civil and criminal action if they continue working with the five London-listed companies. Casting a wide net, the diplomats targeted banks that advise the companies as well as City firms that provide stockbroking services or write research notes about the five, a list that includes Panmure Gordon and Oriel Securities. Wielding a mixture of legal and diplomatic brawn, the letter warned the institutions to \"bear in mind \u2026 the sovereignty dispute and \u2026 the consequences of any unlawful hydrocarbon exploration activities in the Argentine continenal shelf in proximity to the Malvinas [Falkland] islands\". The letter added: \"It should also be borne in mind that \u2026 participation in those activities will cause companies directly or indirectly involved in them to be subject to such administrative, civil and criminal actions as may be provided for in the Argentine laws governing such activities.\" The five explorers declined to comment, with one industry source admitting that none of them wants to be \"dragged into the political realm\".

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The human cost of the eurozone's prolonged debt crisis was laid bare on Monday as data showed unemployment had soared and manufacturing slumped, indicating the region has sunk back into recession. The figures showed that more than 17 million people in the eurozone were out of work in February, the highest level since 1997 \u2013 two years before the single currency was created in January 1999. Eurozone manufacturing figures for March were also poor, as problems in troubled states, such as Greece and Spain, infected the likes of France and Germany. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was now \"odds-on\" that the eurozone would slip into recession at the end of this quarter. Eurozone unemployment rose for the 10th month running, reaching 10.8% in February, although rates differed wildly between countries. Spain was hit hardest with 23.6% unemployment, compared with Austria at 4.2%. Unemployment rose in most of the member states, although the increase was muted in the north, and the number of jobless people actually fell in Germany. In the struggling southern states, it shot up. Archer expects eurozone unemployment to break through 11% this year, as companies grapple with high fuel costs which would squeeze margins, and strong competition. \"Furthermore, public-sector jobs are likely to be pared in a number of countries as part of the austerity measures that are increasingly being implemented,\" he said. That, in turn, will drag on growth. \"With unemployment rising sharply, it doesn't bode well for consumer spending, which is key to growth in most countries, particularly as consumers are generally facing muted wage growth and inflation has been high. The consumer is under a lot of pressure; high and rising unemployment is only going to make the situation worse.\" It is already \"miserable\" according to the Markit/Cips PMI index, which showed manufacturing in the eurozone contracted in March for the eighth month in a row. The index dropped to a three-month low of 47.7 in March. Any number above 50 shows the sector expanded, while a number below shows it is shrinking. Chris Williamson at Markit said: \"Eurozone manufacturers suffered a miserable March with a downturn in production wiping out gains from the first two months of the year.\" Williamson said the data did not bode well for the coming months. \"Prospects for April look poor, with companies reporting steeper rates of decline for both new orders and backlogs of work.\" At the same time, production costs rose sharply, as fuel costs escalated. There were further signs that troubles at the periphery of the eurozone were spreading to the core. Economists were most alarmed by data from France, where manufacturing activity shrank at the fastest rate in almost three years. Its PMI slumped to 46.7 in March, while Germany's manufacturing sector contracted for the first time this year, with a PMI reading of 48.4. The economies in the south continued to suffer. Archer said: \"While Italian manufacturing activity contracted at the slowest rate since last September, the contraction was appreciable.\" He said it \"deepened in Spain, and was still very deep in Greece\". The only bright spots were from Ireland and Austria, where manufacturing grew. Boosted by the strength of the US economy, Ireland's factory output rose for the first time since October, and at the fastest rate in almost a year. The Irish manufacturing PMI rose to 51.5 in March, from 49.7 in February. Employment in Irish factories also picked up. The news should help lift spirits after data out last month showed that Ireland sank back into recession at the end of last year.",

      "bodyText": "The backdrop could hardly have been gloomier. Europe is heading back into recession and consumer demand at home in the UK is weak. Oil prices have been rising, credit is tight, and confidence is low. In the circumstances, therefore, it was both surprising and heartening that manufacturing has continued to put in a relatively robust performance. The monthly snapshot of UK factories from Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply picked up in March and is now at its highest level since the spring of 2011. Caveats abound, inevitably. Industry suffered grievously in the deep downturn of 2008-09 and has much lost ground to make up. Monday's purchasing managers' index found that activity was above the 50 mark that divides an expanding from a contracting sector, but not by all that much. More importantly, the signs from the eurozone are not good. The recession in the single currency zone looks as if it will be deeper and longer than was expected in the euphoria of the Greek debt deal a month or so ago. A good part of the recent increase in output from UK firms has been stock building in anticipation that the demand will be there later this year. Those hopes could easily be disappointed, particularly if industry's costs continue to be ratcheted higher by the rising price of crude. All that said, there are some reasons to be cautiously cheerful about the results of the manufacturing PMI. Firstly, the fall in the value of the pound has made UK goods markedly more competitive in global markets, and led to British-made goods being substituted for dearer imported products in the home market. While Britain's trade remains in the red, the deficit in goods is smaller than it was and the surplus in services (where UK firms were competitive even before the 25% depreciation in sterling) has grown. A second factor detected by the Bank of England has been the on-shoring of production back to the UK. There are a number of reasons for this: higher oil prices have pushed up transport costs; higher inflation in Asia has made products from countries such as China more expensive; and the desire to have shorter production chains has meant manufacturers have started to source locally when possible rather than have parts take weeks to arrive in Britain from a plant on the other side of the world. Thirdly, it is clear that those UK companies that have survived \u2013 even if by the skin of their teeth \u2013 the repeated culls of the past 30 years are fighting fit. Manufacturing now accounts for barely 10% of the economy, and there is precious little fat left to cut. But in the handful of sectors where Britain retains a presence, much of what remains is actually top notch. Given a fair wind \u2013 the end of the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone, a falling oil price, the retention of the advantage provided by a cheap pound, and a domestic economy that was no longer flatlining \u2013 the outlook for industry would be relatively good. Realistically, though, it will take some time for that dream scenario to materialise.",
