The Lloyds Action Now activist group has spent years assembling the case, which argues that the true health of HBOS was deliberately concealed from investors when Lloyds was taking over the troubled bank. The enlarged bank later had to be bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayer money. No specific amount of compensation has been outlined in the claim, but it is argued that \u00a312bn of shareholder value was lost when HBOS was taken over.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has said it faces fresh fines from US authorities for breaching money laundering rules, as it reported a 20% fall in first-half profits. Two years ago, the Asia-focused bank was fined $667m (\u00a3396m) for scheming with Iran to hide billions of pounds of transactions from the US authorities. It said new issues had now arisen that could lead to fresh penalties from the New York State department of financial services (NYSDFS). The revelations about additional penalties and the possible extension of a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the US authority \u2013 which has installed a monitor in the bank \u2013 could put fresh pressure on the chief executive, Peter Sands, who said that the first-half results were \"clearly disappointing\". Difficult conditions in its Korean business and its financial markets operations were behind the 20% fall in profits to $3.2bn, which the once fast-growing bank flagged in June. The shares closed 0.7% down at \u00a312.08 as the bank, which came through the financial crisis relatively unscathed, attempted to reassure the market its capital position was strong. Referring to the latest regulatory setback, Sands said: \"This is a very different set of issues than we faced in 2012.\" Then, the bank was caught by surprise by NYSDFS accusations about breaches of sanctions to Iran. Now, Sands said, technical problems had been unearthed about computer systems put in place by the bank in 2007 to look for suspicious transactions. In legal warnings attached to its first-half results, the bank said: \"Certain issues have been identified with respect to the group's post-transaction surveillance system, which is part of its anti-money-laundering systems and controls and is separate from the group's sanctions screening systems.\" It added: \"The group believes that the resolution of these issues is likely to involve an enforcement action by the NYSDFS that would include an extension of the term of the monitor beyond the original two-year term, a monetary penalty and remedial actions.\" Last month, the Standard Chartered board issued a statement backing the management team after reports that shareholders wanted change at the top of a bank that had previously reported 10 years of rising profits. The long-standing finance director Richard Meddings left in June. Sands, when asked about his position, said: \"I have no other plans.\" Defending his role, he said: \"It is worth noting that, despite the disappointing first half of 2014, we delivered more profit for our shareholders during these six months than we did in the whole of 2006 at the peak of the pre-crisis banking boom. Not many banks can make that claim.\" Presenting the figures to City analysts, Sands sat alongside Sir John Peace, the chairman, whose position has also been questioned. Peace warned of the impact of fresh regulations hitting banking . \"The intensity of regulatory pressure and political risk, at a time of market weakness, is putting huge pressure on bank boards and management leadership generally.\"",

      "bodyText": "Two former Investec traders lost a three-year, \u00a36m battle over their bonuses on Wednesday in a case described by a London high court judge as fanciful and \"wholly incredible\". Andrew Brogden and Robert Reid, the former head and deputy head of the bank's structured equity derivatives desk, alleged that the firm failed to honour an unwritten bonus agreement for 2010-2011 made when they joined the bank in 2007. The pair claimed more than \u00a36m in bonuses despite their business having made losses. The bank said it paid bonuses of \u00a3150,000 to Brogden and \u00a3100,000 to Reid in June 2011, which the two men accepted. Both men left the bank a month later and launched their case shortly afterwards, an Investec spokesman said.

    "webTitle": "Tax inversion takes a hit as Walgreen Alliance Boots stays in US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US drugstore chain Walgreens has abandoned plans to shift its headquarters to Europe as part of its \u00a39bn takeover of the group that owns British high-street stalwart Boots the Chemist. The US group, which has more than 8,000 US outlets, was under intense political pressure to keep its tax domicile in the US as it pushed ahead with the deal to buy the 55% share of Alliance Boots it does not already own. The decision is a blow to other US companies with similar tax-cutting plans, such as the US drugmaker Abbvie, which has embarked on a \u00a331bn takeover of UK firm Shire, in pursuit of a UK domicile that will lower its tax bill. The deal spells a massive payday for Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire who bought Boots in a heavily debt-funded deal with hedge fund Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007. Pessina will get \u00a31.5bn in cash and \u00a32.95bn of shares, but the 73-year-old dealmaker has no plans to retire, and has been named as executive vice chairman of the combined company. Walgreens' decision to keep its headquarters in Chicago, rather than take advantage of Alliance Boots' tax domicile in Berne, Switzerland, came after the US Treasury threatened to restrict tax benefits for American firms that go abroad for tax purposes and president Barack Obama accused tax-shifting companies of lacking patriotism. Greg Wasson, chief executive of the combined company Walgreen Boots Alliance, said the risks of a \"significant potential consumer backlash\" from changing its tax domicile were too great. The decision will be a bitter disappointment to Walgreens' shareholders, especially Goldman Sachs and a group of hedge funds that had urged the pharmacy group to relocate to Europe to cut its tax bill. Wasson told investors that Walgreens had done an \"extensive study\" of an inversion - the process of moving its corporate headquarters out of the US to reduce taxes. But the company feared \"a protracted controversy\" with tax officials at the Internal Revenue Service that could see it bogged down in litigation for up to 10 years, as well as the potential loss of government contracts. \"The parties could not arrive at a structure \u2026 to ensure that the transaction could withstand almost certain intense protracted IRS scrutiny,\" Wasson told investors. \"While we fully understand the significant financial benefits of an inversion, when weighed against the risk, we determined that pursuing a structure that included an inversion was not the right structure for our future enterprise.\" On Tuesday the US Treasury secretary Jacob Lew said the Obama administration could act to reduce tax benefits for companies moving overseas for tax purposes without waiting for the approval of Congress. \"If Congress doesn't act, we can't wait for months or years to go by and just watch companies make decisions as if nothing will change,\" Lew told the New York Times. According to the paper, 22 US companies have announced an inversion deal since 2011, although the biggest potential deal so far, a hostile takeover of the UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca by its US rival Pfizer, fell through amid the political backlash in both countries. Obama has argued that US companies pursuing inversions do not deserve to call themselves American companies. \"I don't care if it's legal. It's wrong,\" he said in a speech last month. Walgreens is paying \u00a33.1bn in cash and \u00a35.9bn in shares to take full control of Alliance Boots, having taken a 45% stake in 2012. The pharmacy group hopes to create \"a new global leader in pharmacy-led health and wellbeing retail\" that will have 11,000 stores in 10 countries. Alliance Boots came under fire from tax campaigners, following the 2007 takeover. On Wednesday the union Unite said the company had lowered its UK tax bill by more than \u00a31bn since Pessina and KKR took charge, as it accused the company of \"shirking its responsibilities\". Alliance Boots maintains that it has complied with the law and filed transparent financial reports. A spokeswoman said the company paid \u00a390m in UK corporation tax in the most recent tax year, up from \u00a364m in 2012/13. Company sources said UK consumers would not see any immediate changes in Boots stores as a result of the deal. Boots will keep its headquarters in Nottingham and the company is not planning job losses or an overhaul of Boots stores. In the long run, the deal could see Boots expanding its vaccinations service and opening more pharmacies in health centres. Veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb said Pessina's involvement meant the deal seemed much more like a merger than a takeover. He added: \"Although there was a risk that Walgreens drags Boots downmarket, in practice the UK business is likely to be left to its own devices and I don't think the consumer will notice any difference.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain is growing at its slowest pace in a year, one of the country's leading think tanks said following news that the manufacturing sector is performing less strongly than the City expected. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said it believed the economy expanded by 0.6% in the three months to July, down from 0.8% in the three months to June. NIESR produced its estimate after the Office for National Statistics released figures showing manufacturing lagging well behind the service sector in its ability to recoup ground lost during the \"great recession\" of 2008-09. The ONS said that output from UK factories remained more than 7% below its pre-recession peak. Although the economy as a whole has made up the lost ground, UK factories are producing 7.4% less than they were at the time of the pre-recession peak in early 2008. City analysts blamed the 10% rise in the value of the pound \u2013 which makes exports dearer \u2013 and rising tension between Russia and Ukraine for industry's failure to bounce back from a drop in output of more than 1% in May. James Knightley, economist at ING bank, said there was a disparity between the official figures and survey evidence which suggested a much stronger performance by manufacturing. \"In general it is pretty disappointing stuff and highlights the lack of rebalancing away from services to more production-led growth. Nonetheless, given the near-universal strength seen in the manufacturing surveys the true picture remains unclear.\" The ONS said that manufacturing output in the second quarter of 2014 \u2013 considered a better guide to the trend than one month's figures \u2013 was 0.2% up on the first quarter but 7.4% below its position in the first quarter of 2008, after which the economy started to contract. Industrial production, which includes mining, water supply and electricity and gas output, was also up by 0.3% between May and June and also up by 0.3% on the quarter. With North Sea oil and gas output in long-term decline, industrial production is 11.4% below its pre-recession level. The ONS had pencilled in a quarterly rise of 0.4% in industrial production for its first stab at calculating growth in the second quarter of 2014, but said the slightly smaller increase would not result in a change to its 0.8% estimate. Tom Lawton, head of manufacturing at accountants and business advisors BDO said: \"Whilst we expect that manufacturing will continue a broadly positive trend for the rest of the year, the ONS figures clearly illustrate the significant economic and global headwinds that the sector faces. There continue to be concerns that the UK recovery is unbalanced, Europe remains significantly affected by the financial crisis, banks are not back to full strength and the expected boost in exports to the emerging economies has not gathered pace.\" NIESR said that its latest estimate implied an annual growth rate of 3%, with the economy operating well below its potential level of output. \"We expect the MPC to introduce the first interest rate hike in February 2015.\" Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Guardian",

      "bodyText": "Instant reaction on Wall Street said that Rupert Murdoch will be back for another go at buying Time Warner when tempers and share prices cool. Really? That script seems very unlikely. First, 21st Century Fox was in danger of squashing its own share price if it had tried to improve its plainly inadequate $80bn (\u00a347bn) bid. Second, Warner boss Jeff Bewkes had said he viewed non-voting shares in Fox as an unacceptable second-class currency; in effect, he was asking Murdoch to surrender family control of Fox, which was always going to be a deal-killer for the 83-year-old titan. On the first score, Murdoch's problem was that his reputation as an empire-builder who is not afraid of overpaying (exhibit A: Dow Jones) went before him. Share prices ran away from him on day one. Warner's stock immediately shot above the level of Fox's $80bn bid as the market guessed whether the serious offer would be $95bn or $100bn. Naturally, Fox's share price wobbled in anticipation. But then it kept falling. From $35.50 before the news of the adventure broke last month, Fox's stock had slipped to $31.50 before Tuesday's abandonment. That 11% tumble put Murdoch in the traditional bind facing all bidders offering part-payment in their own shares: the higher the bidding goes, the more cash the target shareholders will want. The traditional escape from such a squeeze is to whet shareholders' appetites by talking about cost savings. But here they were just $1bn \u2013 tiny in the context of the size of the deal. The strategic benefits were arguably superior since there is a plausible argument that content-led media companies should bulk up to protect their pricing power against merger-obsessed US cable companies. But the cable threat is hardly grave. Fox's shares had still managed to improve 60% since the demerger of the newspaper assets after the hacking scandal. As for Warner, its stock was on a roll. As Bewkes pointed out, the total shareholder return was 150% since 2008 amid the separation of the cable assets, AOL and Time Inc. The spin-offs had made Warner itself smaller, and thus an easier prey in theory, but the need for salvation in the arms of Murdoch was never obvious. Bewkes's real curve-ball was to question the value of the non-voting Fox 'A' shares being offered alongside the cash component. Quite right too. To British eyes, it is baffling that US investors tolerate unfair voting arrangements which too often go hand-in-hand with bad boardroom governance. In the case of Fox/Warner, the Murdoch clan would have emerged with 40% of the votes but just 9% of the economic interest. That would have been taking to extremes the belief that a swashbuckling boss with a free hand, gets the best results. Fox/Warner would, in effect, have been a new company. All non-Murdoch shareholders would surely have wanted the power to sack the boss \u2013 or his children \u2013 if things went wrong. It is (just about) conceivable that the stars could come into alignment to revive the deal. Warner's go-it-alone strategy would have to be seen to fail; Fox's shares would have to outperform; and the market would have to be happy to endorse Fox's unfair voting arrangements with James or Lachlan at the helm. It's hard to imagine all three happening. If Murdoch wants one last big deal, he may have to pay cash \u2013 that means smaller targets than Time Warner.",

Sam Bowman, research director of the Adam Smith Institute, has a couple of ideas. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An independent Scotland could flourish either by using the pound sterling without the permission of the rUK* (or by setting up a \u201cScotPound\u201d pegged to sterling through a currency board, which would achieve a similar end). <br></p> <p>(1) Because Scottish banks would not have access to a currency-printing lender of last resort, they would have to make their own provisions for illiquidity, and would necessarily act more prudently.</p> <p>Scotland actually had this system of \u2018free banking\u2019 during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, during which time its economy boomed relative to England\u2019s and its banks were remarkably secure.

Archer writes:<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> On balance, we take the view that house prices will keep on clearly rising over the coming months but there will be some moderation from the recent peak levels. More stretched house prices to earnings ratios, the prospect that interest rates will soon start to rise (albeit gradually) and tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders will likely have some dampening impact on buyer interest. Even so, with the economy seen holding up pretty well going forward, employment high and rising, consumer confidence elevated and earnings growth likely to improve, and with housing supply remaining tight in many areas, house price growth will probably slow gradually.</p> </blockquote> <p>Specifically, he expects house prices to increase by around 3% over the second half of 2014.

Shares in Walgreens, the US drugstore which just bought the rest of Boots that it didn\u2019t already own, opened 16% lower this afternoon, wiping around $10bn off its value. It seems investors are unimpressed with its decision not to move to a low-tax location. US markets have followed the rest of the world downwards, as fears about the crisis in Ukraine overshadowed better than expected trade data. Dow Jones down 0.1% Nasdaq down 0.6% FTSE 100 down 1.2%, or 82 points at 6601 France CAC 40 down 1.3% Spain IBEX down 1.4% Italy FTSE Mib down 2.6% Germany DAX down 1.3% Some reaction to the US trade deficit data. James Knightley of ING Bank said: The shale gas and oil revolution remains a key story with petroleum imports falling to a near four year low, but there was good news even excluding this category with the ex petroleum deficit narrowing by $2.5bn. Exports in total rose 0.1%MoM while total imports fell 1.2%MoM, led by the drop in energy imports. Given the trade deficit was smaller than anticipated within the first estimate of 2Q GDP it looks likely that GDP growth may be revised up a couple of tenths of a percentage point from the 4% rate initially reported. The improved US trade deficit (see below) should lift GDP. The US trade deficit narrowed more than expected in June, as the country further reduced its dependence on foreign oil. The Commerce Department said the trade gap dropped 7% to $41.5bn, the lowest reading since January. Imports fell 1.2%, helped by a decline in petroleum imports. Exports edged up 0.1% to a record high of $196bn, supported by a surge in automobiles, parts and engines. Excluding petroleum, the deficit is almost as large as it has ever been. It\u2019s all change at the Bank of England. The central bank\u2019s top insurance regulator, Julian Adams, is off to Prudential. Adams used to work for the FSA until its responsibilities were taken over by the Bank of England last year. Adams is the second senior director to quit the bank within a week, coming just two days after Spencer Dale, executive director for financial stabilitiy said he was going to join BP as chief economist. A number of senior members of the bank have quit since Mark Carney took over as governor in July 2013, including Paul Tucker, deputy Governor, and Nils Blythe, head of the Bank\u2019s communication division. More on the Boots deal. Walgreens has bought the 55% of Alliance Boots that it did not already own for \u00a33.1bn in cash and \u00a35.92bn in shares, making the deal worth \u00a39bn. Jennifer Rankin says the most interesting aspect of the deal is the fact that Walgreens backed out of shifting the company headquarters to a low-tax location (a so-called inversion) because of political and public pressure. It explained the decision in a statement. The company was mindful of the ongoing public reaction to a potential inversion and Walgreens unique role as an iconic American consumer retail company with a major portion of its revenues derived from government-funded reimbursement programs. Investors are flocking to safe havens as concerns over Ukraine escalate, pushing German bond yields to record lows on Wednesday. (Yields fall as bond prices rise). In the UK, polls handed Alistair Darling a resounding victory for his performance in the televised debate with Alex Salmond last night. Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks report: An ICM snap poll of more than 500 Scottish voters for the Guardian said Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign, won the live debate with Scotland\u2019s first minister by 56% to 44% \u2013 defying expectations that Salmond would be the victor. During the debate Salmond refused to name a \u2018Plan B\u2019 currency for Scotland if the chancellor continues to oppose a currency union. Sam Bowman, research director of the Adam Smith Institute, has a couple of ideas. An independent Scotland could flourish either by using the pound sterling without the permission of the rUK* (or by setting up a \u201cScotPound\u201d pegged to sterling through a currency board, which would achieve a similar end). (1) Because Scottish banks would not have access to a currency-printing lender of last resort, they would have to make their own provisions for illiquidity, and would necessarily act more prudently. Scotland actually had this system of \u2018free banking\u2019 during the 18th and 19th centuries, during which time its economy boomed relative to England\u2019s and its banks were remarkably secure. And Panama, which uses the US Dollar in this way, has the seventh most stable financial system in the world. (2) Everyone says Mr Salmond needs a Plan B if the rUK does not agree to a currency union with Scotland. But unilateral adoption should be Plan A, making Scotland\u2019s economy more stable and secure. The UK\u2019s obstinacy would be Scotland\u2019s opportunity. Markets continue to fall. The FTSE down 1.2%, or 82 points at 6600 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 1.3% Germany\u2019s DAX down 1.6% Spain\u2019s IBEX down 2.2% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB down 3.2% Larry Elliott writes: Growing fears of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine sent shares lower on Europe\u2019s bourses and pushed the euro to a nine-month low against the dollar. Market jitters increased markedly after the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, warned that the threat of direct intervention by Russia had increased in recent days and the announcement by the Kremlin that it would impose tit-for-tat sanctions against the west. More from Reuters on Ukraine... Russia has amassed around 20,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border and could use the excuse of an humanitarian or peacekeeping mission to send them into Ukraine, NATO said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to guess what\u2019s on Russia\u2019s mind, but we can see what Russia is doing on the ground \u2013 and that is of great concern. Russia has amassed around 20,000 combat-ready troops on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border,\u201d NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement. \u201cThe latest Russian military build-up further escalates the siutation and undermines efforts aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis. This is a dangerous situation.\u201d US drugstore chain Walgreens has confirmed its takeover of the group behind Boots the chemist. Crucially, Boots headquarters will remain in Nottingham, with the offices of Alliance healthcare staying in Europe. Walgreens is buying the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots that it doesn\u2019t own. The combined group will be called Walgreens Boots Alliance, with the group HQ in Chicago. Jennifer Rankin will have more on that story shortly. Plus \u00e7a change. There are protests in Greece this morning. Members of the armed forces and emergency services are protesting in central Athens against plans to merge their auxiliary pension funds with others. eKathimerini reports: The merger is part of a multi-bill that MPs are due to vote on later in the day. Greece needs to pass the legislation to receive its next bailout sub-tranche of \u20ac1 billion. Some reaction to the UK data. David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said: Despite encouraging progress seen by the manufacturing sector over the past year, its total output is still more than 7% below its pre-recession level in 2008 \u2013 in contrast to services that are now more than two percent higher. Manufacturing exporters are also trying to cope with a strong pound at a time when demand in the eurozone \u2013 our biggest trading partner \u2013 remains weak. There are a number of uncertainties still facing the economy, and we would urge the MPC not to jump the gun on interest rates. Our view remains that the risks to the economy of raising rates too early are much greater than the risks of waiting just that little bit longer. Factory output in the UK, however, was lower than expected in June. Larry Elliott writes: Output from Britain\u2019s factories rose by a smaller than expected 0.3% in June and remains more than 7% below its pre-recession peak, according to official figures. Although the economy as a whole has now made up the ground lost in the so-called Great Recession of 2008-09, data from the Office for National Statistics showed manufacturing still struggling. City analysts blamed the 10% increase in the value of the pound - which makes exports dearer - and rising tension between Russia and the Ukraine for the failure of industry to bounce back from a drop in output of more than 1% in May. James Knightley, economist at ING bank said there was a disparity between the official figures and survey evidence suggesting a much stronger performance by manufacturing. Back in the UK, the appetite for new cars continues apace, with sales accelerating for a 29th month in July, prompting a second upward revision to the 2014 forecast. Angela Monaghan writes: The number of new cars registered last month jumped 6.6% to 172,907, extending the longest run of growth for the industry since records began in 1959 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It compared with a 6.2% increase in June. Such high levels of demand for new cars have taken the trade body by surprise, prompting it to revise up its forecast for the full year for the second time this year. Jamie McGeever at Reuters points out that Italy\u2019s economy is a long way off regaining the level it reached before the financial crisis. Commentators suggest the news could dent the popularity of Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, who came to power in a party coup in February. Reuters reports: Renzi has announced ambitious labour and tax reforms to revive growth as well as a sweeping overhaul of the justice system, the bloated public administration and Italy\u2019s system of government. But beyond an \u20ac80 a month tax break for millions of low income workers, he has yet to translate his promises into action. Italy has slid back into recession in the second quarter as GDP shrank 0.2%. Economists polled by Reuters had been targeting a gain of 0.2%. Preliminary estimates show GDP down 0.3% compared with the same period last year. Russian shares hit a three month low after president Vladimir Putin ordered retaliatory measures against Western sanctions. Markets are dropping even lower. FTSE 100 down 67 points, or 1%, at 6616 France\u2019s CAC 40 down 0.8% Germany\u2019s DAX down 1.15% Spain\u2019s IBEX down 1.9% Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib down 2.3% (more on that shortly...) The Polish prime minister says the threat of a direct intervention by Russia\u2019s military in Ukraine has risen over the last couple of days, Reuters is reporting. Donald Tusk told a news conference: We have been receiving such information in the last several hours - that the risk of a direct intervention [by Russia\u2019s military in Ukraine] is for sure higher than it was several days ago. Reuters reports that Russia has been conducting exercises near the border with Ukraine, raising concerns on the ground and in a number of Western capitals. Moscow has also called an emergency meeting of the UN Security council over what it described as a \u201chumanitarian situation\u201d in Ukraine. Standard Chartered warned on Wednesday that if faced fresh fines from the US authorities for breaches of money laundering rules as it posted a 20% fall in first half profits, writes Jill Treanor. Fined $340m for scheming with Iran for hiding billions of pounds of transactions from the US authorities, the London-listed Asian focused bank said that new issues had now arisen which could lead to fresh penalties from the New York State Department of Financial Services. The revelations about the potential for fresh penalties and the possible extension of a two year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the US authorities - which have installed a monitor in the bank - could put fresh pressure on chief executive Peter Sands who admitted that the first half results were \u201cclearly disappointing\u201d. Brewer SABMiller has found a replacement for its former chairman Graham Mackay, who died last year. It announced this morning that Rio Tinto chairman Jan Du Plessis will take on the role, on top of his job at the mining group. Du Plessis, 60, will join the brewer\u2019s board as a non-executive director from September 1, and take over from interim chairman John Manser as SABMiller\u2019s chairman at the annual meeting in July next year. He said: Today\u2019s announcement does not in any way diminish my strong commitment to Rio Tinto. I am excited about the excellent work that Sam Walsh and his management team are doing to deliver greater value for shareholders. I have assured the board of Rio Tinto that I would like to serve as chairman for several more years, subject of course to the board and shareholders wishing me to do so. He is going to step down from the board of Marks &amp; Spencer, which he has been on since 2008. Standard Chartered bank\u2019s pre-tax profits dropped 20% last year, as expected. More from Jill Treanor soon... Italy\u2019s industrial output rose 0.9% in June, the largest increase in five months and beating analyst forecasts of a 0.7% rise. That is a big improvement on the 1.2% drop in May. But the country is expected to announce later today that it has fallen back into recession. Italian newspapers reported this morning that the statistics agency will post a 0.1% contraction in the second quarter, compared with economist forecasts of 0.2% growth. The dailies Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica and Il Messaggero all reported the figure without citing their sources although the Corriere said the figure was what was expected by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s office. More on UK house prices. The Halifax survey out this morning (see below) show house prices rising at their strongest rate since the three months to September 2007. Howard Archer points out that this reading contrasts with several other surveys reporting a recent moderation in house price growth which appears to be a consequence of a recent overall slowdown in housing market activity. The Nationwide reported a rise of just 0.1% month-on-month in July. Archer writes: On balance, we take the view that house prices will keep on clearly rising over the coming months but there will be some moderation from the recent peak levels. More stretched house prices to earnings ratios, the prospect that interest rates will soon start to rise (albeit gradually) and tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders will likely have some dampening impact on buyer interest. Even so, with the economy seen holding up pretty well going forward, employment high and rising, consumer confidence elevated and earnings growth likely to improve, and with housing supply remaining tight in many areas, house price growth will probably slow gradually. Specifically, he expects house prices to increase by around 3% over the second half of 2014. House prices are seen rising by some 6% in 2015. A couple of big bid stories fell apart last night. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox scrapped its $80bn bid to take over Time Warner. 21st Century Fox will buy back $6bn of its shares after Murdoch said Time Warner \u2018refused to engage\u2019 with them over offer. Dominic Rushe writes that the deal \u201cwould have created a media behemoth and was widely seen as the crowning deal of Murdoch\u2019s mogul career\u201d. Elsewhere, Japan\u2019s Sprint has dropped its bid to buy T-Mobile after regulatory resistance showed no signs of softening despite months of lobbying. Soyoung Kim of Reuters writes: The move is a rare setback for Sprint\u2019s Japanese parent SoftBank Corp, whose billionaire founder Masayoshi Son had seen the acquisition as key to taking on U.S. market leaders AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications. The UK housing market is looking perky. House prices in the three months to July were more than 10% higher than the same period last year, beating economist forecasts. Prices rose 1.4% in July after a 0.4% drop in June. Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, said: While supply remains low, housing demand continues to be supported by a continuing economic recovery, growth in employment, improving consumer confidence and low mortgage rates. However, earnings growth is still lagging behind consumer price inflation. The average house price was \u00a3186,322. In corporate news, US drugstore chain Walgreens is set to announce the takeover of the group behind high-street retailer Boots the Chemist. Zoe Wood writes: Walgreens bought a 45% stake in Alliance Boots for \u00a34.3bn in a 2012 deal that included the option to buy the remainder within three years. Confirmation of the decision to proceed is expected to come on Wednesday. The terms of the transaction are expected to follow the same formula as the original, with the 55% stake expected to be valued at around \u00a35bn. The New York Times reports that the deal will not include a move to relocate Walgreen\u2019s corporate citizenship to a lower-tax country. Michael J. De La Merced and Alexandra Stevenson write, citing an unnamed source: [This] would have required a renegotiation of an existing deal agreement with Alliance Boots, something the British retailer was unwilling to accommodate.

New orders placed at domestic factories plunged sharply in June, dropping by 3.2% from May. On the year, new orders are now down by 4.3%. Carsten Brzeski of ING Bank said monthly orders have been volatile, but the last two readings have given rise to some concerns that the industrial recovery in Germany is running out of fuel. While a stagnation of the German economy in the second quarter seems hard to avoid, the industrial engine is losing some fuel. Today\u2019s data shows that downside risks for the German economy do not only come from geopolitical tensions but also from longer-than-expected weak demand from Eurozone peers. Brzeski notes that there has been lots of speculation about the possible impact from the EU\u2019s Russia sanctions on the German economy. In our view, the direct impact from the sanctions on Germany will be rather limited. It is rather the possible reaction from Russia, which could affect German growth in the second half of this year. Up to now, however, all of this remains pure speculation. Asian markets dropped on Wednesday as investors took money off the table on signs of rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia. The Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said last night that Russia had gathered military forces at the border with Ukraine either to put pressure on its neighbouring country or to invade.

      "bodyText": "Stefano Pessina, a secretive Italian billionaire, is to become \u00a34.45bn richer as a result of the $15bn (\u00a39bn) Walgreens takeover of Alliance Boots. The deal is worth \u00a31.5bn in cash and a further \u00a32.95bn in shares to the executive chairman and largest shareholder of Boots, nicknamed the \"silver fox\" for his hair and deal-making ability, and who has already amassed a fortune worth $10.9bn (\u00a36.5bn), according to the the Forbes rich list. Born into a Milanese family in 1941, Pessina lives in the tax haven of Monaco alongside high rollers including Sir Philip Green. Unlike some of his neighbours, Pessina is not known for lavish parties and keeps a low profile. He prefers opera, art and boat design \u2013 his main extravagance is a yacht moored off Sardinia \u2013 and keeps fit with sailing, tennis and swimming. With 1,500 deals under his belt, it is not surprising that his declared passion is \"building businesses\". Following a degree and research jobs in nuclear engineering at university in Milan and a stint in marketing, Pessina got his first stab at this when his father asked him in 1974 to restructure the ailing family company, a pharmaceutical wholesaler. The business, enlarged by a spate of foreign takeovers, eventually merged with Britain's UniChem and became Alliance UniChem in 1997. By the time Pessina invited the Boots management for merger talks on his yacht off Sardinia, the company had gobbled up more than 500 companies and joined the FTSE 100 index. Having stalked the UK high street chemist for at least six years, he pulled off a \u00a37bn merger with Boots in 2006 to create Alliance Boots, a health and beauty group with 100,000 employees in 14 countries. A year later, Pessina and the private equity firm KKR surprised the City by taking the business private in Europe's largest leveraged buyout, a $22bn deal. The Switzerland-based company was targeted by protest groups including UK Uncut over its tax affairs. After Pessina engineered the sale of a 45% stake in Boots to Walgreens, he was criticised by investors for his \"undue influence\" over the US retailer. He is the single largest shareholder and has a seat on the board.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has lost its second senior regulator in three days, accelerating the brain drain at the 320-year-old institution. The Bank announced the resignation of Julian Adams, executive director for insurance supervision, who will leave Threadneedle Street following 28 years as a City regulator. Adams will take on a new role as group regulatory director at UK insurance company Prudential in 2015. It is the second high-profile resignation at the Bank this week, after the news on Monday that former chief economist Spencer Dale is leaving to join BP. Dale had been moved sideways as part of a reshuffle by Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, earlier this year. Under the shakeup Dale lost his place as a member of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, becoming executive director for financial stability, strategy and risk after a job swap with Andy Haldane. Adams and Dale leave at a time of great change for the Bank, which has inherited the powers of the now-defunct former City regulator the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Their departures also come just a year after Carney's succeeded Lord King as governor, at a crucial time for the UK economy as policymakers strive to put the recovery on a sustainable path. A month before Carney arrived in July last year, Paul Tucker announced his resignation as deputy governor. Tucker was widely expected to step down after failing to secure the governorship, but his five-year term was not due to end until February this year. Fellow Bank veteran and deputy governor Charlie Bean left Threadneedle Street at the end of June, after delaying his retirement by a year to help with the changes brought about by its new powers. Carney praised Adams' contribution as a longserving public servant on Wednesday. He said: \"Julian Adams has led a distinguished career in public service for over a quarter century, and I thank him for his significant contributions to this institution and the global regulatory community more broadly. \"He has been instrumental in leading the Bank of England's insurance division through the transition to the new regulatory regime and has tirelessly built links internationally, to great benefit for the Bank and the UK insurance sector.\" Adams was director of insurance at the FSA when it fined Prudential \u00a330m in 2013 for failing to be \"open\" and \"co-operative\" with the watchdog over its ill-fated bid for AIA in 2010. The FSA also personally censured the insurer's chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, after it only found out about the proposed \u00a321bn takeover through the media. Adams said on Wednesday he was looking for a \"fresh path\" in his career. He added: \"I have had the privilege of working in the public service to maintain and improve the resilience of insurance firms in the United Kingdom. It has been an immensely challenging, yet rewarding experience, and I am proud of the work my colleagues and I have done to reform and improve the regulatory framework, both domestically and internationally.\"",

      "bodyText": "Share prices in London closed at their lowest level in three months on Wednesday after fears of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine sent shudders through European financial markets. Warnings from NATO and from Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk that the Kremlin was massing troops on the border with Ukraine led to a nervous day's trading in which the euro hit a nine-month low against the dollar and investors sought out safe havens such as gold and German bonds. News that Italy had surprisingly fallen back into recession in the second quarter coupled with evidence that the faltering recovery in the eurozone was having a dampening impact on German industry contributed to a downbeat mood brightened only when shares on Wall Street rose in early trading. Gold rose by around 1.5% to more than $1,300 an ounce as Vladimir Putin's announcement of tit-fot-tat sanctions were seen as evidence of a deteriorating relationship between the west and Russia. \"We are getting closer to a situation where we really have an escalation of the conflict ... sanctions being stepped up, and things moving out of control,\" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.

Italy has been by far the worst performing economy in the G7 since the global recession began in 2008 and analysts fear that its descent into a third downturn in six years will make it harder to reduce a national debt already running at 130% of national output.

      "bodyText": "Britain's appetite for new cars was unwavering in July, with sales accelerating for a 29th month, prompting a second upward revision to the full-year forecast. The number of new cars registered last month jumped 6.6% to 172,907, extending the longest run of growth for the industry since records began in 1959, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It compared with a 6.2% increase in June. Persistently high demand for new cars has taken the trade body by surprise, prompting it to revise up its forecast for 2014 for the second time this year. The SMMT now expects sales of new cars to increase by 8.1% to 2.45m, underpinned by cheap finance deals and a better-than-expected economic backdrop, with unemployment falling faster and consumer confidence at higher levels. It last upgraded its forecast to 2.4m in May, and back in January it was forecasting new car sales of 2.29m, up 1.2% on 2013. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: \"July saw the new car market extend its record period of growth, as confident consumers took advantage of an array of new products and attractive finance deals on the latest fuel-efficient new cars.\" July's increase pushed new car sales up 10.1% in the year to date, to 1.46m vehicles. The top three best sellers in July, and in 2014 so far, were the Ford Fiesta, followed by the Ford Focus and the Vauxhall Corsa. Paul Hollingsworth, at Capital Economics, said that outlook for the UK's new car market looked good in the short term, as consumers who decided not to buy a car during the financial crisis were responsible for some of the demand. He said elevated consumer confidence and a strong pound \u2013 which makes car imports cheaper \u2013 were also likely to underpin demand in the short term. Hollingsworth cautioned, however, that the longer-term prospects were less rosy because of Britain's ageing population. \"Demographic trends are likely to dampen spending.

      "bodyText": "Retailers cut prices at the fastest rate on record in July as cash-strapped consumers looked for holiday bargains and price wars ruled the supermarkets. Shop prices fell for a 15th consecutive month, down by 1.9% compared with a year earlier after a 1.8% fall in June. It was the fastest rate of deflation since the British Retail Consortium/Nielsen series began in December 2006. Deflation of 3.3% in the non-food category, which includes clothing and footwear, furniture, electricals and gardening, joined with the weakest ever food price inflation, which halved from 0.6% in June to 0.3% in July. Helen Dickinson, director general at the BRC, said the trend was likely to persist, partly because retailers were passing on to customers the benefits of the stronger pound \u2013 which makes imports of foreign goods into the UK cheaper. \"Against a backdrop of stable commodity markets, stronger sterling making imports cheaper and wavering retail spending, current levels of deflation are expected to continue. While this is great news for consumers, trading conditions across the industry remain challenging.\" Dickinson said the lowest food-price inflation on record was particularly good news for households on the lowest incomes, where a third of spending goes on food. Household budgets have remained under pressure in the UK despite a backdrop of economic recovery, with real-terms wages falling for most of the past six years as price inflation has outpaced pay growth. The report said that price wars among the UK's supermarkets continued to play a role in lower food inflation: \"On the consumer front, recent announcements from key grocery players suggests that fierce competition on prices and promotions, particularly on essential items, is set to continue, ensuring shop price inflation remains at low levels in the coming months.\" July's fall in food inflation was mainly due to a slower rate of increase in prices of meat, fruit, vegetables and fresh convenience foods, with deflation in sugar, jam, honey and syrup, bread, cereals and non-alcoholic drinks. In a separate report, the accountancy firm BDO said that seasonal discounting contributed to a 0.7% fall in clothing sales in July on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of trading space opened in the past 12 months. Overall, like-for-like sales on the UK's high streets increased by 1.7% compared with a year earlier, pushed higher by strong sales of homewares and lifestyle products.",
