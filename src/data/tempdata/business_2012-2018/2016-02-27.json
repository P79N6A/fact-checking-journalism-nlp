      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s possible exit from the European Union could pose a risk to the world economy, the G20 finance ministers\u2019 summit in China has agreed, according to the chancellor, George Osborne. Osborne said fellow finance ministers and central bank chiefs had unanimously concluded that a vote to leave the EU by Britain would be one of the biggest economic dangers this year. According to a draft communique, the meeting in Shanghai also agreed to use all policy tools to lift sluggish global growth, despite German disquiet over fiscal and monetary stimulus. The G20 ministers were seeking policy solutions amid growing concern about the headwinds facing the global economy, principally concerns about growth in China and the US. After years of money printing and historic low interest rates across much of the developed world, the outlook for growth is still uncertain and the communique seen noted that monetary policy alone could not bring balanced growth, the reports said. \u201cThe global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,\u201d it said. \u201cMonetary policies will continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability ... but monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth.\u201d The draft suggested that markets\u2019 recent ructions have been overreactions to economic anxieties that do not reflect economic fundamentals, the reports said, not helped by threats such as Britain\u2019s possible exit from the EU and the European refugee crisis. The draft\u2019s noted \u201cthe shock of a potential UK exit from the European Union\u201d in the seventh line of its text. It added: \u201cWhile recognising these challenges, we nevertheless judge that the magnitude of recent market volatility has not reflected the underlying fundamentals of the global economy.\u201d It added that ministers pledged not to engage in beggar-thy-neighbour currency devaluations which could unleash a wave of dangerous deflation through the global economy. Osborne said in a statement that G20 finance ministers and officials were unanimous that a possible British exit from the European Union would be a shock to the global economy. \u201cHere at the G20, finance leaders and central bank governors of the world\u2019s biggest economies have raised serious concerns about the risks posed by a UK exit from the EU,\u201d Osborne said in a statement from Shanghai. \u201cThey have concluded unanimously today that what they call the shock of a potential UK vote to leave is among the biggest economic dangers this year.\u201d The G20 Brexit warning will be welcomed by the prime minister David Cameron as he tries to make the case for the UK to stay in the EU when the referendum is held on 23 June. His cause has been dealt a blow by the declaration of the London mayor Boris Johnson for the leave camp. But the G20 statement would come with the endorsement of not only Osborne but also Bank of England governor Mark Carney and would be the latest in a series of red flags from the business world. Others have included the The credit agency Moody\u2019s and IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Earlier, Osborne also warned in Shanghai that problems were brewing for the world economy and that could impact Britain\u2019s economy. He said: \u201cThe storm clouds are clearly gathering in the world economy and that has a consequence for lots of countries including Britain. Now we are weathering it better than most, but we\u2019ve just had confirmation that our own economy is not as big as we had hoped. \u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means and we have economic security.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "McVitie\u2019s ginger nuts are to return to the shelves after production was halted three months ago by flooding at a factory in Carlisle. United Biscuits, the owner of the McVitie\u2019s, Carr\u2019s and Jacob\u2019s brands, has told its retail clients, who include Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Asda, that stocks of ginger nuts would be available from mid-March. \u201cMcVitie\u2019s ginger nuts will start to appear on shelves from around 11-12 March, but there will be fluctuations dependent on the retailer,\u201d a spokeswoman for the company said. Most supermarkets have been out of stock of McVitie\u2019s ginger nuts and Carr\u2019s water biscuits since January and were running low on custard creams and bourbons after the firm\u2019s factory in Caldewgate was inundated with 5ft of floodwater on 5 December. The Carlisle-based facility is the second biggest biscuit factory in Europe, supplying the UK and other countries around the world. The company relaunched production of its McVitie\u2019s Gold bars, which were made on the upper floors of the factory, in January after five weeks of cleaning and repair work. Four of the factory\u2019s eight ovens are now up and running and ginger nuts will be the first of the main biscuit lines ready to hit shelves. The factory should soon be producing 7m ginger nuts a day to meet demand. Bourbons, custard creams and boasters should follow a couple of weeks later. The last biscuit back into production, most likely by the end of March, will be Carr\u2019s water biscuits, as their special brick ovens take longer to reheat. The water biscuits are only made in Carlisle because United Biscuits has said it needs to use the local spring water and the factory\u2019s brick ovens in order to get the right taste and texture. Mark Taylor, manufacturing director for United Biscuits, said production had resumed more quickly than expected. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted with progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe started slowly to iron out any niggles and we\u2019re not at full speed yet.\u201d About 400 staff, contractors and suppliers are now working at the factory, about half its usual workforce. United Biscuits caused a stir in January when it was forced to admit that it had been unable to find alternative production facilities after the flood and supplies of some popular biscuits were running out. It placed newspaper adverts in January headed: \u201cFlooding in water biscuit factory. Oh the irony.\u201d The ad said the factory had suffered significant damage and the heavy rain had \u201ctaken its toll on our community\u201d. The factory was also hit by flooding in 2005 and only reopened after a \u00a31m government grant. Taylor said United Biscuits was talking to other manufacturers as far afield as Thailand and Cockermouth, nearby in Cumbria, about ways to improve the Carlisle factory\u2019s flood defences.",
