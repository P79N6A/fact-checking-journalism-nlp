      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap up our live blog coverage of the Alibaba IPO. Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Alibaba stock closed the day up 38% to land at a market valuation of $231bn on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. That\u2019s currently 11th biggest in the United States, right behind Chevron and right ahead of JP Morgan Chase. Jack Ma, the founder and CEO of Alibaba, was confirmed as the richest person (on paper) in China, with an estimated net worth of $18.01bn. Ma and colleagues were all smiles on the exchange floor. It was the biggest initial public offering in US stock market history. The IPO raised $21.8bn. In 2012, Facebook raised $16bn. Initial trading was delayed for hours past the opening bell, but volume was high and the price held steady for much of the day after an early spike past $99. Analysts saw the IPO as having run smoothly. The question now, one told the Guardian, is \u201cwhat they are going to use the money for.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart of the first-day action for Alibaba stock on the NYSE, via Google Finance. Volume was 271,193,821. Market cap is $231.44bn. Dominic Rushe has been speaking to Rapid Ratings CEO James Gellert. Gellert has been impressed by the IPO which, despite the delay, has run very smoothly. Now he wants to know what happens next: \u201cThey haven\u2019t really said what they are going to use the money for,\u201d he said. What it has done is put China firmly on the map as a tech power. \u201cThis puts the US on notice that global tech is about more than Silicon Valley,\u201d he says. The stock closes at $93.89, up exactly 38.07% from the $68 IPO and up a sliver more than 1% from the first trade $92.70. About four minutes till the closing bell. The stock is hovering at $93.50. Volume is well above 260m. Marketwatch ranks Alibaba by size based on its introductory price of $92.70 a share (about 15 minutes before the close, the stock is at $92.86). The stock is trucking along at about $1.50 a share below its first trade, around $91.20. Have you visited Alibaba.com? Check it out. The Alibaba offering created a wave of thousands of Chinese nouveau riche, USA Today reports: With Friday\u2019s eye-popping, record-breaking $167 billion listing in New York, China\u2019s nouveau riche just swelled some more as more than 5,000 current and former Alibaba employees were selling their shares in this IPO. And they won\u2019t lack for places to splurge their new-found wealth. \u201cNeighbors, congratulations\u201d screamed a real estate billboard Friday at the Xixifengqing development a single street away from Alibaba\u2019s headquarters in east China\u2019s Hangzhou city. \u201cThis group of potential buyers is rich enough to buy the bigger townhouse, which is around $1.3 million for a 3,230 square foot house,\u201d salesman Wang Mengzhou said. \u201cI\u2019m confident our sales will soar in the near future.\u201d Read the full piece here. These people are not in line for an iPhone. Alibaba stunned investors on Friday by becoming the 18th-biggest company in the world by valuation, ahead of Facebook, Amazon and eBay, writes the Guardian\u2019s Rupert Neate (@rupertneate): Shares in the firm, founded by a Chinese English teacher-turned businessman, soared to $92.70 as trading began \u2013 a 36% premium above the offer price \u2013 on the New York stock exchange. At one point the shares came within a whisker of $100 before falling back. The share price surge valued the company at $230bn (\u00a3141bn) \u2013 more than Amazon and eBay combined, and more than JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US. It was one of the world\u2019s three biggest-ever flotations, and a record on Wall Street. Read the full piece here. \u201cThe rumour this week spread like wildfire: could it be possible that Jack Ma, one of China\u2019s greatest success stories, was planning to leave the mainland for good?\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Kaiman in Beijing profiles Ma: On Tuesday, Hong Kong\u2019s Economic Journal claimed that Alibaba founder Ma, planned to move to Hong Kong next year on an investment immigration scheme. Immediately, the news went viral on Chinese social media sites. Recent statistics show 47% of Chinese millionaires plan to leave, mainly to escape economic uncertainty and environmental decay, but Ma departing would be an extraordinary blow to China\u2019s self-image as an emerging global player \u2013 he is its greatest rags-to-riches hero, an inspiration to a generation of budding entrepreneurs. Earlier this week, Ma quickly put the rumour to rest. Speaking to reporters in Hong Kong, he appeared physically precarious \u2013 Ma is razor-thin and stands about five feet tall \u2013 yet animated and forceful, with bulging forehead and expressive, restless hands. His speech was both patriotic and diplomatic, colloquial yet clearly well-planned. He explained that he had no plans to emigrate. \u201cHangzhou is where I was born, went to school and started my business,\u201d he said, speaking of his coastal Chinese hometown. Read the full piece here. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) has filed a story on this morning\u2019s Alibaba offer: The biggest ever share sale in the US got off to a flying \u2013 if delayed \u2013 start on Friday as shares in Alibaba, the Chinese internet giant, started trading in the New York Stock Exchange at $92.70 \u2013 much higher than their initial $68 price. The sale of China\u2019s biggest online retailer has triggered a frenzy among investors clamouring to buy into the the world\u2019s fastest growing market and a new tech titan. Shares soared to $95 in early trading before drifting down to around $90, 32% above the start price and instantly making the company one of the most valuable in the world. Founded by Jack Ma, a former English teacher who started the site from his one-bedroom apartment in Hangzhou in 1998, Alibaba now controls 80% of online commerce in China. Read the full piece here. If you\u2019re following the Alibaba IPO today, there\u2019s another rollout you may be interested in: An early afternoon dip sent the stock below $90 a share, but it is currently trading at around $92. For a corrective view to today\u2019s stock frenzy, read the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Paul Vigna\u2019s three reasons to avoid Alibaba stock \u2013 and one reason not to worry: That\u2019s a reason not to worry about your investment. That said, there are other aspects of Alibaba and this IPO that should have investors on guard. Corporate Governance. This might be the biggest red flag for your average investor. It cannot possibly bolster investor confidence that Alibaba\u2019s ownership structure was labeled \u201cworst in class\u201d by MSCI. The problem is that the way the company is set up, a small sliver of shareholders, which included founder Jack Ma, will have control of the company, no matter that they own only about 13% of the shares outstanding, and no matter whether or not they sell their stakes in the future. Vigna also gets into the health of the Chinese economy and share pricing. Read the full thing here. Here\u2019s the Alibaba stock price chart so far today, via Google Finance: Alibaba\u2019s sale doesn\u2019t seem to be helping Yahoo today, Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) notes: Yahoo is Alibaba\u2019s largest shareholder and sold $5.1.bn worth of shares today. Yahoo still owns 401.8m additional BABA shares, valued around $37bn based on Alibaba\u2019s $92.70 opening price. But that\u2019s not helping. The company\u2019s shares have fallen more than 4% since trading began. Alibaba\u2019s trading volume is huge \u2013 but not quite as fast-paced as the Facebook trading was, the Wall Street Journal notes. On the day of its IPO, Facebook traded 216m shares in the first half hour and hit almost 574m in its first full day of trading. Since trading began at 11.53am, Alibaba has traded more than 152m shares. Alibaba volume so far \u2013 in the first 20 minutes or so \u2013 is huge, having surpassed 133m shares. The average daily trade volume of Yahoo stock is 27.8m shares/day. How big is Alibaba? At the daily high so far of close to $100 per share, the company would be among the top 10 biggest US companies, the Wall Street Journal reports: At $99.70, Alibaba had a $245.7 billion market capitalization, placing it among the top 10 biggest U.S. companies. If Alibaba were in the S&amp;P 500 it would rank as ninth biggest, just ahead of Wal-Mart, Chevron and P&amp;G, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ. Alibaba shares have now settled back to their initial trading price and a bit below, trading as low as $92.09. Tracking the wealth of China\u2019s newly minted richest man: A lot of excitement on the floor, which you can surveil via livestream here. Dominic Rushe blinks twice: Alibaba shares jump to $98, giving the stock a $241 billion market cap and sitting less than $5 billion away from Wal-Mart\u2019s market value. The initial trading price of Alibaba values the company at close to $230bn and puts Jack Ma\u2019s personal stake at somewhere north of $20bn. UPDATE: See our graphic, How much is Jack Ma worth, here. Trading begins at $92.70. You can follow the share price \u2013 near $96 now \u2013 at Google finance here. As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Trading of Alibaba shares had yet to begin as the Chinese e-commerce giant made its initial public offering. UPDATE: The stock began trading moments later at $92.70 per share. The delay in trading was said to stem from a likely large volume of small orders from retail investors to be sorted through, and a determination of market makers not to repeat the Nasdaq Facebook IPO fiasco of 2012. The stock appeared set to begin trading at a price significantly higher than the $68 per share it was offered at. Estimates of the opening trading price are now around $92 (and still climbing). It is set to be the biggest IPO in stock market history and to make Alibaba founder and CEO Jack Ma the richest person in China. Earlier Dominic Rushe wrote about how Yahoo is one of today\u2019s biggest winners, as Alibaba\u2019s biggest US shareholder. Yahoo volume today is huge: Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) has been speaking to Sam Hamadeh, founder of the analyst PrivCo. People had been expecting Alibaba to start trading at 10:30 and the delay is making everyone nervous: \u201cIt\u2019s unusual for there to be a delay this long, but this is an unusual IPO because it so large,\u201d he says. Hamadeh thinks there are probably a large number of small orders for shares from retail investors that the are now being sorted and which are probably slowing things down. \u201cThey clearly want to get this right. They don\u2019t want another Facebook. But they have to get this going eventually, even Facebook started trading at 11:40.\u201d \u201cNo firm ETA\u201d on first trades, CNBC reports. The Wall Street Journal has this analysis: Could the delay be potentially linked to the concentration of the book? We\u2019ve reportedthat 25 accounts got 50%, top 40 accounts got nearly 80%, and that retail only got a sliver. Usually IPO bankers like to give at least some of the stock to \u201cflippers\u201d like fast-money hedgies and quick-buck retail folks. Possibly they didn\u2019t give out enough here. The NYSE explains what\u2019s happening behind the scenes in advance of the first Alibaba trades: After last night, this joke speaks to us. (The full results of the Scottish referendum, with maps and percentages and bar graphs, are here.) It\u2019s an old-fashioned good time today on the New York Stock Exchange, where humans appear temporarily to have thrown off the rule of the machines: Post 8. Ma\u2019s lucky number? To capture the full luck of the 8, Alibaba initially had thought to roll out on August 8, Bloomberg reported. There\u2019s speculation that the 8-session could go even further: Still waiting for the shares to start trading, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe (@dominicru): The speculation is that they could start selling at $82 to $85 per share - 20.5% and 25% above the $68 initial price. It\u2019s not unusual in large IPOs how have a delay like this, but Alibaba will be hoping to avoid the fiasco that befell Facebook\u2019s share sale in 2012. Facebook listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and its systems failed to keep up with the massive interest in what was - until today - the largest tech IPO in history. Delays ensued, orders were messed up and lawsuits followed. The color of money: today it\u2019s orange. The Wall Street Journal adds context: At the high end of the range, it\u2019s still just below the average one-day pop for U.S. listed Tech or Internet IPOs this year, which is 26%, according to Dealogic. Yahoo is one of today\u2019s biggest winners, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe (@dominicru). The US tech firm is Alibaba\u2019s biggest US shareholder and stands to receive $5.1bn after selling 121.7m of its shares in the e-commerce giant and paying a capital-gains tax of about 38%: Yahoo will return at least half of the Alibaba proceeds to shareholders, finance chief Ken Goldman said in July. But the company has been very acquisitive under CEO Marrissa Mayer and all that money has already sparked speculation about a big deal. Yesterday shares in AOL spiked after an analyst note suggested it might be a takeover target (it has fallen again today). Two years into her tenure Mayer is under pressure to turn around the still struggling business, which is continuing to lose market share to Google and Facebook. Is this her chance to buy her way out of trouble? This number is higher than $68. At least 18% higher. Most orders filled for Alibaba shares as part of today\u2019s offering went to US investors, the Wall Street Journal reports \u2013 but half of the people who put in orders reportedly got no stock: Over 1,700 investors world-wide put in orders for Alibaba shares, according to people familiar with the matter. About half of them got no stock, the people said. A majority of the shares were sold to U.S. investors, they said. Meanwhile, 25 investment firms were sold about half of the stock in the IPO, people familiar with the deal said. That\u2019s unusually concentrated for a deal of this size, said a banker familiar with the process. Around 7:30 a.m. New York time Friday, bankers started confirming allocations with investors, a necessary step before the shares can open on the New York Stock Exchange, people familiar with the process said. In the CNBC interview, Ma said one of his heroes is Forrest Gump, the character played by Tom Hanks in the 1994 Best Picture winner. \u201cWhenever I get frustrated I watch that movie,\u201d Ma said. Volume: robust. Jack Ma is speaking with CNBC on the floor of the NYSE \u2013 watch it here. Alibaba comes bearing gifts: Here\u2019s what it looked like as the bell rang: There it goes! Lots of applause. You can follow the stock price here. The stock does not trade immediately. \u201cThe wait is on,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal puts it. Some controversy attends this morning\u2019s float, Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) reports, particularly with early investors avoiding the \u201clockup\u201d that usually keeps them selling off shares in big flotations: While Ma himself is set to sell 12.7m shares \u2013 worth $867m at $68 a share \u2013 other investors not identified by name in Alibaba\u2019s filings hold $8bn of shares that could also be sold at the IPO, which is expected to raise $22bn. The number of shares represents about a third of what could be sold in the deal and is highly unusual. When Facebook \u2013 the last record breaking tech IPO -went public in 2012 investors were not allowed to sell pre-IPO shares. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) reports on how a former university lecturer is poised this morning to be confirmed as China\u2019s richest man: Jack Ma, 50, still owns 9% of the online commerce giant he began 15 years ago, which announced it would sell shares at $68 last night, valuing the company at $16.6bn \u2013 bigger than Amazon and more than double the value of eBay. Alibaba controls nearly 80 percent of all e-commerce in China, although Ma, known for stunts such as dressing as Lady Gaga, already hinted last week at ambitions that go beyond the country\u2019s borders. \u201cSpeaking for Alibaba, we hope to become a global company, so after we go public in the US, we will expand strongly in Europe and America,\u201d he told reporters in Hong Kong during his global tour to meet investors. \u201cAt the same time we won\u2019t abandon Asia, because after all we\u2019re not a company from China, we are an Internet company that happens to be in China.\u201d People are pumped up for this one. Can\u2019t make it down to the floor of the NYSE to watch the opening bell ring? Watch it here! Good morning and welcome to our live blog coverage of what is likely to be the largest initial public offering of all time, as shares of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut, are offered on the New York Stock Exchange. Alibaba set the price of its shares (NYSE: BABA) on Thursday at $68, the top end of its planned range, and the company is expected to raise up to $22bn (\u00a313.5bn). At $68 a share, the company is valued at $167.6bn \u2013 bigger than Amazon and more than double the value of eBay. The stock sale includes $8bn in shares from early investors, who usually would be locked out of immediate trading. Today\u2019s rollout is so big that the stock exchange ran test runs of its systems over the summer, hoping to avoid the mess of the May 2012 Facebook rollout, when Nasdaq\u2019s system failed to keep up with demand. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) is covering today\u2019s IPO. Here\u2019s further reading as we wait for the market to open: Alibaba and the 40 Facts.",

The company's various websites account for more than 80% of all goods bought online in China and more than half of all parcels delivered throughout the country. Jack Ma, the company's founder who became an internet entrepreneur after twice failing his university entrance exams, cemented his position as China's richest man with his 9% stake valued at nearly $21bn. Thousands of employees from his home town, Hangzhou, also became paper millionaires as Ma had followed Silicon Valley startups by sharing stock among employees of all levels, from senior managers to receptionists. \"We have a dream,\" Ma said as he rang the opening bell to officially launch the flotation on the NYSE. \"We hope in the next 15 years the world changes because of us.

Ma became obsessed with the internet on a trip to the Seattle in 1995; the first thing he searched for was \"beer\". He came up with the name Alibaba in a San Francisco coffee shop; when he asked a waitress what she knew about Ali Baba, she replied: \"Open Sesame.\" Ma says the name reflects how the company opens up opportunities for small businesses to sell their goods across the world. Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell products to one another but quickly expanded into consumer sales and online payments. It is now a global hub for selling everything from electronics to stuffed animals. The offering of 320m shares raised more than $29bn. Online spending by Chinese shoppers is forecast to triple from its 2011 size by 2015, and Ma said the company would soon expand into emerging markets and eventually Europe and the US.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Well, we\u2019ve seen more impressive rallies, frankly. This was a day of mild relief in the City, rather than full-blown jubilation. Despite all the warnings from business leaders and economists before yesterday\u2019s vote, the stock rally largely fizzled out by the finish. The London stock market has just closed for the day, with the FTSE 100 index gaining a mere18 points to 6837. Scottish-based firms have performed well, with Royal Bank of Scotland jumping 2.5% after the risk that it would have to relocate its head office to London vanished. Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher\u2019s closing market report, explaining how the rally ran out of steam. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says that a no victory was priced in. Thus no big rally. Shares in Europe breathed a big sigh of relief on the news one of its member countries didn\u2019t split apart as the Scottish vote \u201cno\u201d to independence from the UK. The Scottish referendum was largely anticipated by stock markets and given the risks associated with a separation the argument could be made that investors were almost complacent. The pound has also lost its early gains, and is now down almost one cent against the US dollar since the polls closed, at $1.632. That\u2019s partly because the dollar is generally strong today, as Brenda Kelly of IG index explains: Sterling\u2019s relief rally against the US dollar was even more short-lived than the \u2018Yes\u2019 camp\u2019s hope of victory in Scotland last night. Having touched $1.65, the pound is now in retreat, dropping back down towards $1.63 as economic fundamentals reassert themselves. Investors also welcomed the fact that Britain doesn\u2019t face months of argument between Westminster and Holyrood ahead of a formal declaration of independence. But attention is now turning to other political uncertainties, especially with Alex Salmond resigning a few minutes ago. LIVE: Salmond to resign as first minister after Scotland rejects independence Many economists have warned today that political uncertainty is going to weigh on the UK economy. For example: Gregor Macintosh, of Swiss bank Lombard Odier believes investors will demand a higher risk premium for UK assets Jon Pryor of Investec has warned that next year\u2019s general election could cause market uncertainty. Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Services fears that new agreement on devolved powers will not be agreed easily, or quickly. And HSBC predicted that the pound could be hit if UK growth or trade figures disappoint. And the Scottish result dominated global politics as well as finance today. The was relief in Brussels, with EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso saying that it\u2019s good news for Europe. Barroso added: The European Commission welcomes the fact that during the debate over the past years, the Scottish Government and the Scottish people have repeatedly reaffirmed their European commitment. The European Commission will continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Scottish Government, in areas under its responsibility, that are important to Scotland\u2019s future, including jobs and growth, energy, climate change and the environment, and smarter regulation. Fitch and S&amp;P have both announced that the result has no impact on the UK credit rating. While in Scotland itself, financial workers told us they were relieved...but yes supporters were understandably disappointed. Angus Kirk, a director at wealth management company Bridge Investments Partners, summed up the mood in the no camp: \u201cNow it\u2019s as RBS said this morning, business as usual very much.\u201d \u201cA no result was always going to be the best result for Scotland because Scotland will get more powers, be stronger and not lose its identity.\u201d But at an Edinburgh job centre, Alex Clough explained why he voted for independence: \u201cIt was more just disillusionment with the people in government down in Westminster. It might end up the same up here but I felt like I would have been a hyprocrite to complain and not vote yes.\u201d The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based thinktank, has weighed in on the Scottish referendum - welcoming both the result and the huge turnout for a ballot that caught the eyes of the world. OECD secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda said: \u201cThe choice of the Scottish people to remain part of the United Kingdom is good news for Scotland, for the UK and for the world. The fact that the Scots came out to vote in such huge numbers is the sign of a thriving and healthy democracy.\u201d Katja Hall, deputy director-general of the business group CBI - which openly and vocally opposed Scottish independence - says the UK has its work cut out to restore trust from foreign investors and trade partners after the referendum. Speaking to my colleague Katie Allen, Hall warned: \u201cWe have got a job now to do to rebuild our international reputation. People have been looking at what is happening and have been worried. Lots of investment has been on pause so hopefully that can start to get going again.\u201d Hall says the group\u2019s members saw the referendum on Scottish independence as the biggest uncertainty they faced and will be generally pleased it is now over. \u201cI think businesses will be very relieved and breathe a collective sigh of relief at the outcome. We have always said staying together was the best thing to do for jobs, for growth and for living standards.\u201d As for what comes next, she adds: \u201cWe want a devolution settlement that is good for growth across he UK. We must not be kneejerk, we need considered and thought out proposals. It can\u2019t be a free for all.\u201d Hall, whose organisation supports \u201cstaying in a reformed European Union\u201d, was encouraged by the high turnout for this week\u2019s vote. \u201cIf we have a referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU we hope to see people as engaged as on Scotland.\u201d Garry Clark, at the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also emphasised the uncertainties that remain for businesses in Scotland. The SCC remained impartial during the campaign, recognising that the 11,000 businesses in its network had varying views. But canvassing showed they shared key concerns around Scotland\u2019s future currency, tax policy and EU membership. Clark points out only the first of those three was resolved as Scotland woke up to a no vote. \u201cThere remain issues over what the future tax environment in Scotland looks like\u2026 and also now there is perhaps slightly greater chance of an EU referendum in three years\u2019 time. Our members want to be in the EU.\u201d But generally, Scotland\u2019s economy is gaining momentum after faster growth than the rest of the UK as it went into this year, lower unemployment in the latest figures and strong inward investment, he says. \u201cWe are very optimistic,\u201d says Clark. And here\u2019s legal expert Joshua Rozenberg explaining why blocking Scottish MPs from voting on English issues is so controversial; a potential source of future market volatility perhaps. Next May\u2019s general election, and a possible referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, mean we could see further market turbulence. So reckons Jon Pryor, Head of FX Dealing, Investec Corporate and Institutional Treasury, who says: \u201cThis morning\u2019s relief rally for Sterling after Scotland voted to remain in the UK should see a conclusion to the recent high volatility environment in the short term. In the medium term there is more political event risk to come: the detail of meaningful constitutional change will be with us by January, just a few months before May\u2019s General Election. Should the Conservatives win a clear majority then, a referendum on UK membership of the European Union becomes inevitable based on Prime Minister Cameron\u2019s previous assertions, and this is before we consider the impact of a likely first rate hike in the coming months. The potential catalyst for the next currency move can be difficult to predict but, as recent weeks have shown, markets can react strongly to the political calendar.\u201d Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, also warns that the upbeat mood in the City could soon evaporate. He writes.. Relief rather than euphoria. That was the instant response in the financial markets to the Scottish referendum vote. Relief that they had been spared months, perhaps years, of wrangling about what currency Scotland might use. Relief that the risk of a bank run had been avoided. Relief that there was unlikely to be a flurry of announcements by companies that they were packing their bags. Relief, above all, that it was not going to be Black Friday. But now we need to see whether the referendum question is really off the table for a generation, whether Scotland\u2019s business community has been hurt, and whether the no vote is likely to lead to an earlier rise in interest rates. Here\u2019s the full piece: UK PLC breathes easy again after Scotland\u2019s no vote - but for how long? The pound may be down a little bit today, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the wild swings we\u2019d have seen if yesterday\u2019s poll had swung the other way. With the Scottish referendum decided, the markets are now turning their attention to Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which is floating on the US stock market today. It\u2019s a a genuinely huge deal, probably the biggest IPO ever. My US colleague Tom McCarthy is tracking the action: Alibaba IPO: trading to begin as shares priced at $68 \u2013 live updates Over in the Wall Street Journal, Simon Nixon argues that investors may not have woken up to the full impact of the shake-up in British politics: In particular, he cites the pledge for more devolution to Scotland, and David Cameron\u2019s promise this morning to tackle the \u201cWest Lothian Question\u201d and restrict voting on \u2018English issues\u2019 to English MPs. Nixon writes: Far from settling the debate over the U.K. constitution, the Scottish referendum has taken the debate to a whole new level. Mr. Cameron\u2019s commitment, hastily given without the agreement of his cabinet or his party, has already prompted an angry backlash from English and Welsh parliamentarians demanding new rights for their voters. The markets may have greeted the referendum result with relief, but they may be underestimating the risk of serious political instability in the U.K. in the months and years ahead. That would also help explain why the pound is now down on the day.... After that early rally, the pound is now down half a cent against the US dollar today at $1.635. That means all the referendum bounce has been wiped out, taking sterling back town to its level before the shock YouGov poll two weekends ago. This chart shows the pound vs the US dollar in September: Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Services reckons that the financial markets are recognising that the UK\u2019s political affairs remain fluid. It will be challenging for Westminster political leaders to meet the timetable for further Scottish devolution that Mr Gordon Brown advanced, with their endorsement, during the referendum campaign. With the best will in the world, they will be hard-pressed to comply with it. A major risk is that they will not be able to agree the terms of a settlement, especially as the exercise will offer opportunities for points to be scored ahead of a general election. The fallout of the referendum result is also unclear, Lewis adds: It might be disastrous if a significant proportion of yesterday\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 voters were subsequently to feel they had been misled by the promises the Westminster elite had made to them. Scottish firms continue to digest the implications of the referendum result, reports Katie Allen from Edinburgh. Callum Kerr, part-owner of kilts shop Edinburgh Gifts thinks a yes vote would have been bad for tourism. He says a majority of tourism in Edinburgh comes from England and many of the other visitors that buy scarves, kilts and tweed jackets from his store are often on tours that start south of the border. \u201cIf we were an independent country things like that might not be possible,\u201d he says, adding most shop owners he asked on his stretch of souvenir stores felt the same in the run up to the vote. \u201cThe tourism industry is still growing and to break away and not be part of that would be worrying.\u201d The FTSE 100 remains unspectacularly higher, up 38 points at 6857, led by Royal Bank of Scotland (+3%). But Gregor Macintosh, head of sovereign and emerging debt at Swiss private bank Lombard Odier, reckons that political uncertainty could hit UK financial markets soon: Crucially we still have to worry about the prospect of major constitutional upheaval. In these negotiations it is questionable whether cross-party co-ordination will be amicable. Particularly now that the referendum hurdle has passed and the glare of next year\u2019s general election is intensifying. This means that investors are still likely to demand a higher political risk premium in their valuation of UK assets. Guy Ellison, head of equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, says that the pound\u2019s rally petered out because of the \u201clack of clarity\u201d over the consequences of further devolution of powers to all UK regions. It\u2019s been a funny morning for the pound. Bleary-eyed traders drove sterling up once it became clear that Scotland would vote to remain in the UK, only to push it down again once the result was confirmed. City insiders are citing a few reasons. Profit taking is one factor, after a day\u2019s worth of sterling was traded between midnight and 2am. Another is the political uncertainty that remains, with PM David Cameron promising a devolution shake-up...after next May\u2019s election. Analysts at HSBC says that attention is turning back to the UK\u2019s economy: \u201cAny disappointment on growth, or renewed focus on the large current account deficit, could still weigh on the currency.\u201d And a fourth explanation is that the US dollar is strengthening generally, on predictions that American interest rates will rise quicker than expected in 2015 and 2016. Fathom Consultancy says: Since the beginning of last year, \u00a3/$ has been driven almost entirely by changing views about who would move first \u2013 the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England \u2013 and by how much. Back in the financial sector, Scottish-based businesses are outperforming the wider markets. City firm Banc De Binary reports that shares in the 30 largest Scottish firms are up 1.1%, while the wider FTSE 100 is only up 0.7% (46 points) now. But that doesn\u2019t make up for several months of underperformance during the independence campaign. This list includes major financial companies including RBS, energy firms such as Premier Oil, drinks firm AG Barr, and distribution chain John Menzies. Oren Laurent, founder of Banc De Binary, reckons Scottish shares have further to rally: \u201cThe destabilising possibilities of a Yes vote clearly made investors nervous, and this has affected the share price performance of Scottish businesses and impacted the Scottish economy.\u201d \u201cWith a No victory, the cloud that has been hanging over investors in businesses with a substantial Scottish exposure has begun to lift. However, it was never clear just how much independence would have actually affected performance of Scottish businesses in the medium to long term.\u201d Just off Edinburgh\u2019s grand St Andrew Square, Alex Clough is coming out of a job centre. He stayed up overnight with other friends who had voted yes until it became clear the no\u2019s had won around 5am. The 21-year-old graduated this summer from Aberdeen University and has moved back in with his parents while he looks for work. But his yes vote was not just down to the lack of jobs for graduates that he has discovered since leaving university. Clough tells Katie Allen: \u201cIt was more just disillusionment with the people in government down in Westminster. It might end up the same up here but I felt like I would have been a hyprocrite to complain and not vote yes.\u201d Clough has been looking for graduate trainee schemes in consultancy or something related to his degree in zoology. \u201cI am surprised there is not much for graduates,\u201d he says, adding he is now looking for non-graduate jobs in call centres and elsewhere. (scroll back to 9.21am onwards for Katie\u2019s reporting of the mood in Edinburgh) Back in Edinburgh\u2019s financial district, the mood is mixed with no supporters relieved and yes voters disappointed. Angus Kirk, a director at wealth management company Bridge Investments Partners, is in the former camp. \u201cI am quite a relieved man this morning,\u201d Kirk tells my colleague Katie Allen on his way into work through the drizzle. \u201cNow it\u2019s as RBS said this morning, business as usual very much.\u201d \u201cA no result was always going to be the best result for Scotland because Scotland will get more powers, be stronger and not lose its identity.\u201d But he does not want to see any animosity. \u201cNo-one should be gloating about this at all,\u201d says Kirk, who hails from Edinburgh. Now is a time for reflection, in his view. \u201cReflection for the country and on this historical event that hopefully won\u2019t happen again.\u201d But it\u2019s not all smiles of relief in St Andrew Square. \u201cI am a bit disappointed with the result,\u201d says John, a public sector worker who does not want to give his surname. \u201cI still think it is a lot of uncertainty with what happens next.\u201d While it is quieter on the City\u2019s trading floors than it would have been had the Yes campaign triumphed, it is still a busy day as investors attempt to make - or take - profits. From IG\u2019s offices, Simon Goodley reports: Hannah Sissons, an equity trader at IG whose job it is to cap the group\u2019s exposure if clients are betting heavily on a share price moving in one particular direction, says she is having a particularly busy morning. More shares than normal have required her to dip into the market to hedge the company\u2019s position. Meanwhile, her colleague Ben Critchley, a sales trader, reports that he has clients who warned him earlier this week that - in the event of a No vote - they wanted to have the \u201cfirst print\u201d [the first orders] to buy Lloyds Banking Group shares. The trades were placed this morning, meaning they got in at the day\u2019s low before trading momentum took the price higher. Critchley adds: \u201cWe also had a client who earlier this week - when the Lloyds price was trading below 73p - who bought about 10 million shares in the hope of a No vote. It was a punt, but it has worked out for him [the price is nearer 77p now] ... You can see from the screens that after the initial 10 minute surge in buy orders this morning, there are plenty of clients selling Lloyds as they take their profit from trades they placed earlier this week.\u201d And indeed, after jumping 2% at the start of trading, Lloyds shares are now up just over 1%. And here\u2019s the official quote from Fitch: \u201cScotland\u2019s small share of the overall UK economy, and the relatively conservative limits set on Scottish borrowing, mean that the fiscal risks posed by further Scottish devolution are not high in our opinion.\u201d Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, says the pound is coming under pressure because the US dollar is strong today. And also because traders had pushed sterling up overnight on anticipation that Scotland would not choose independence. The European Council president tweets: A second rating agency, Fitch has followed S&amp;P by declaring that it won\u2019t be rethinking Britain\u2019s credit rating on the back of Scottish developments. Importantly, Fitch also says that the uncertainties over handing Scotland more tax powers are \u201crelatively minor\u201d and not a key driver in its rating decision. Fitch downgraded the UK 18 months ago to AA+ (the second-highest rating), with a stable outlook. The prospect of Scotland declaring independence had sent shivers through the corridors of power in Brussels. Eurocrats feared that it would encourage more regions to seek autonomy, and raise the chances of Britain leaving the European Union. So it\u2019s no surprise that outgoing European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has welcomed the result. Barroso declared that the referendum result is good for Europe: Here\u2019s the full statement: \u201cI welcome the decision of the Scottish people to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom. This outcome is good for the united, open and stronger Europe that the European Commission stands for. The European Commission welcomes the fact that during the debate over the past years, the Scottish Government and the Scottish people have repeatedly reaffirmed their European commitment. The European Commission will continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Scottish Government, in areas under its responsibility, that are important to Scotland\u2019s future, including jobs and growth, energy, climate change and the environment, and smarter regulation.\u201d Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has said that the Scottish referendum will have no impact on the UK\u2019s AAA credit rating. S&amp;P is the only one of the Big Three rating firms to still give the UK a triple-A rating, with a stable outlook. Hmmmm, the relief rally may be petering out, at least in the foreign exchange markets where the pound has given up this morning\u2019s gains. The FTSE 100 is still up 50 points, though And here\u2019s proof that Edinburgh worker Jennifer Telfer and her colleagues at recruitment firm Eden Scott are in upbeat mood this morning: Edinburgh worker Jennifer Telfer is off to buy a celebratory coffee with colleagues who can\u2019t contain their excitement, even before Katie Allen can ask them what they make of the result. They all work for recruitment consultancy Eden Scott, which has clients in the financial sector as well as oil and gas. Telfer, 26, says: \u201cOur business is dependent on the economy doing well and we have clients in Scotland and England,\u201d She went home to the family farm in Fife to vote yesterday and says she was \u201cterrified\u201d about the outcome. \u201cMy dad is a farmer and sells most of his lamb and crops around the UK, into England and Northern Ireland. Why would we want to break that up.\u201d \u201cMy dad us not a landowner, he rents his farmland. He is not full of money... It would have been terrible for farmers.\u201d People are arriving for work in Edinburgh\u2019s St Andrew Square, where several fund managers and other financial businesses are based, Katie Allen reports. Gary, who works in currency markets and only wants to give his first name, is relieved at the result of the referendum. \u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly strong on either side. Now we can just get on with business as usual. The turmoil over the last two weeks, hopefully that will disappear now... I\u2019ve been a busy bee.\u201d He found the debate around the future currency of an independent Scotland \u201cfarcical\u201d: \u201cI really think Alex Salmond could have won the independence debate if he had had credible, detailed answers for the economic issues. But he didn\u2019t, so he didn\u2019t\u201d Back to Scotland. And all is very quiet in St. Andrew Square in Edinburgh where many of the city\u2019s financial institutions are based. My colleague Katie Allen reports: While looking for workers to talk to on their way into offices, I have been chatting to economist Ian Kernohan at fund manager Royal London Asset Management about what those new votes for English laws might mean for the UK government bond - or gilt - market. Kernohan tells me: Markets had begun to price out the chance of a yes vote, so any impact of the result should be relatively muted, at least when compared with the alternative. A move to English votes for English laws would introduce additional complexity into the UK political structure and might add an additional risk premium to gilt markets, given that the next government will still have to undertake a programme of fiscal consolidation. At this stage though, the details on these plans are sketchy. Breaking away from Scotland briefly, pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline is to pay \u00a3297m to the Chinese government over bribery charges. The fine was imposed by the Changsha Intermediate People\u2019s Court in Hunan Province, which ruled that GSK China Investment had offered money or property to non-government personnel in order to obtain improper commercial gains, and been found guilty of bribing non-government personnel. GSK chief executive officer, Sir Andrew Witty says: \u201cReaching a conclusion in the investigation of our Chinese business is important, but this has been a deeply disappointing matter for GSK. We have and will continue to learn from this. GSK has been in China for close to a hundred years and we remain fully committed to the country and its people. We will continue to expand access to innovative medicines and vaccines to improve their health and well-being. We will also continue to invest directly in the country to support the government\u2019s health care reform agenda and long-term plans for economic growth.\u201d Here\u2019s the full statement. And we have confirmation that the oil industry is relieved that the uncertainty - business\u2019s perennial bugbear - is over. Royal Dutch Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, says: \u201cShell welcomes the decision by the people of Scotland to remain within the UK, which reduces the operating uncertainty for businesses based in Scotland,\u201d \u201dShell will continue to work closely with both the UK and Scottish governments to help the industry deliver vital energy supplies through investment in the UK\u2019s oil and gas resources. We look forward to continuing our proud association with Scotland.\u201d Financial services group Alliance Trust has joined the ranks of Scottish-based firms pledging not to move south: ALLIANCE TRUST SAYS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS FROM OFFICES IN DUNDEE, EDINBURGH AND LONDON The FTSE 100 has disappointed those who expected an early surge following the no vote, up just 35 points or 0.5% at the moment. But it must be remembered the index is a global one, reflecting more than just UK concerns. To illustrate that, the leading fallers in the index are mining companies, hit by falling metal prices on concerns about the outlook for China and the prospect for US interest rate rises. Nick Fletcher has details here. David Cameron\u2019s pledge this morning for more devolution of powers across the UK, not just to Scotland, could have major implications for fiscal policy, suggests political editor, Patrick Wintour: Here\u2019s Patrick\u2019s story on the PM\u2019s statement this morning: David Cameron commits to devolution revolution in UK after Scotland vote Accountants at BDO are speculating that Britain could soon have differential tax rates, if more powers are handed to Scotland. With the referendum officially won by the no side, the City is relatively calm. My colleague Simon Goodley is on the trading floor of IG Group, and reports: It\u2019s far quieter here than it would have been if the Yes campaign had won - but there are still big movements in share prices after the London Stock Exchange opened at 8am. Royal Bank of Scotland is up 3.5%, while Lloyds Banking Group and Standard Life are both up 2% - as investors are relieved they won\u2019t have to relocate to London. Still, the City is all about zero sum gains. Alastair McCaig, IG\u2019s chief market strategist, says: \u201cGood news for RBS and Lloyds is bad news for Pickfords, which presumably won\u2019t be getting a large order to move executives from the banks south now.\u201d In a wider basket of Scottish-facing stocks, Diageo - which derives a decent proportion of its business from Scotch, is up 0.78%, pump maker Weir Group has gained 2.15%, while defence contractor BAE Systems, which is assembling aircraft carriers on the Clyde, added 1%. Also, AG Barr, the maker of Irn Bru, has edged up 0.24%, although apparently only around 40% of its business is in Scotland.... My colleagues in Scotland have launched a new liveblog covering all the developments following the independence referendum: Scotland votes no in independence referendum - live coverage We\u2019ll be tracking the financial, economic and business reaction here Business for Scotland, which has pushed for a yes vote, is understandable disappointed by the referendum result, but determined to press on. Chairman Tony Banks says: \u201cHuge credit due to the Scottish people who have, by and large, conducted the biggest political debate there is with good grace, good manners and some sparkling wit. \u201cThe legacy of this campaign is a thoroughly politically engaged and active population the likes of which Scotland hasn\u2019t seen in my lifetime. \u201cLike others who campaigned for a Yes vote, I\u2019ll continue campaigning for a better Scotland. \u201cWe won\u2019t have all the tools that we would have had after a Yes vote but we\u2019ll all do what we can to improve things as much as possible.\u201d Spain\u2019s stock market is also rallying this morning, as the Scottish result dents Catalonia\u2019s hopes of independence. The IBEX index of the 35 biggest companies on the Madrid stock market is up by 156 points, or 1.5%, to 11147. All but one share has gained ground. The interest rate, or yields, on Spanish bonds has also fallen this morning. That shows that investors see Spanish debt as less riskier, even though Catalonia\u2019s parliament is pushing for an independence referendum of its own. Here\u2019s Nick Fletcher\u2019s opening market report highlighting how Scottish=linked companies are leading the FTSE 100 higher, albeit not as high as first predicted. Here\u2019s the FTSE 100 early risers, led by RBS: Companies with Scottish links have moved sharply higher in early trading as the stock market gave the thumbs up to the outcome of the referendum vote, write Nick Fletcher. With the financial sector a key area for Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the way and has risen 12.7p or 3.5% to 369.9p, Lloyds Banking Group is up 1.33p to 77.20p or 1.8%, Standard Life has added 6.4p to 422.1p or 1.6%. SSE is 48p higher at \u00a315.69 while engineering group Weir is up 68p at \u00a326.98. Babcock International is 35p better at \u00a311. At the moment the FTSE 100 is up 41 points or so, having failed to meet some of the more optimistic predictions. The London stock market is open....and the FTSE 100 has jumped by 51 points, or 0.75%, to 6870 in very early trading. Full details to follow..... Clydesdale Bank has also announced that nothing\u2019s going to change: Many (but not all) business chiefs had warned that independence could have pushed up costs and created painful uncertainty, so there is a \u201ccollective sigh of relief across the business community\u201d this morning. That\u2019s the CBI\u2019s take, anyway. Here\u2019s John Cridland, their Director-General: \u201cBusiness has always believed that the Union is best for creating jobs, raising growth and improving living standards, and welcomes that the people of Scotland want to play an integral role in this internationally successful partnership. \u201cAs the debate now moves to the question of further devolution, it is important that it does not undermine the strength of the single internal market and it is in the best interests of citizens living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as those in Scotland. \u201cSuch a difficult campaign inevitably leaves scars which will take time to heal and we now need politicians, businesses and citizens to unite to achieve a better future for all in the UK. \u201cNow is also the time to rebuild relationships outside the UK to reassure international investors and other partners that we will emerge stronger and more confident in the months and years ahead.\u201d There will be a huge sense of relief around the North Sea oil and gas industry that Scotland have opted to remain part of the UK. Our energy editor Terry Macalister says: There is nothing companies fear more than political uncertainty given the average investment offshore is very large and the time scales very long. A \u201cyes\u201d vote could have led to a protracted row over where exactly the boundary lay offshore between England and Scotland  . It would have also led to worries about different tax systems and even safety regulations north and south. But the oil and gas industry may be a small winner out of the referendum. It has often felt its financial contribution to the UK economy has been overlooked. Not now. Its value to the Exchequor at least has been endlessly discussed and valued by politicians and economists. The word on the trading floors is that shares in Scottish-based firms like RBS will jump by at least 2% in a few minutes. Edinburgh-based Standard Life has issued a statement, saying it will \u201cconsider the implications of any changes for our customers and other stakeholders in our business\u201d of future constitutional changes, following the referendum. It has also pledged to keep building on its Scottish roots, suggesting that it will not be moving operations out of Scotland now. Standard Life has already set up \u201cEnglish subsidiaries\u201d in case of a yes victory. Here\u2019s the full statement: Update on Scottish referendum result We fully respect the decision of the Scottish people. We recognise that further constitutional change is very likely following the clear result of the referendum. We will consider the implications of any changes for our customers and other stakeholders in our business to ensure their interests are represented and protected. As a large company based in Scotland, Standard Life is ready to contribute to this process. It is now important that we all move forward with respect and work together constructively in the best interests of Scotland and the United Kingdom. Standard Life is a successful global company - we are proud of our Scottish heritage and will continue to build our success from these roots. The main impact of a no vote has probably already been factored into the stock market, according to Tom Stevenson of Fidelity Personal Investing,but UK shares still look attractive in comparative terms. He said: The ongoing uncertainty will provide something of a drag on the UK market in the weeks and months ahead but it comes against a relatively positive backdrop. The London market has materially underperformed the US, for example, since the financial crisis and it now enjoys a significant valuation advantage over Wall Street. In a low interest-rate environment, equity income will continue to be an attractive source of yield for investors. With the FTSE 100 yielding 3.5%, large UK shares are reasonably well underpinned. I would expect larger companies to outperform mid- and small-cap stocks in an uncertain environment, even if some of the more domestically-focused stocks enjoy a short-term bounce. Although bonds look less attractive than equities, due to their historically low yields, the increase in market uncertainty may increase the attraction of fixed income investments. It is worth remembering that markets are global, especially internationally-focused markets like London. They have shaken off massive geo-political uncertainty in Ukraine and the Middle East; they have taken in their stride an imminent reversal in the interest rate cycle and the threat of deflation in Europe; I suspect they will also shrug off a close-run independence vote. Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that it will certainly not be moving its head office out of Edinburgh. The contingency plan that was drawn up in case Scotland voted for independence has been thrown in the bin. RBS says: \u201cThe announcement we made about moving our registered head office to England was part of a contingency plan to ensure certainty and stability for our customers, staff and shareholders should there be a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote. That contingency plan is no longer required. Following the result it is business as usual for all our customers across the UK and RBS.\u201d Lloyds Banking Group has declared that it is committed to maintaining a \u201csignificant presence\u201d in Scotland. It says: \u201cThe group is proud of its strong Scottish heritage and is committed to having a significant presence in Scotland. We remain fully focused on supporting households and businesses in Scotland as well as right across the rest of the UK.\u201d Lloyds, like several other financial institutions based in Scotland, had previously said it would move its HQ to London if voters chose independence. We\u2019re still expecting shares to surge when the London stock market opens, in an hour\u2019s time. Spreadbetters are calling the FTSE 100 up over 1%, or 75 points. Capital Spreads dealer Jonathan Sudaria says shares are \u201cset to surge out of the starting blocks\u201d, even though many City investors concluded yesterday that the no side would win: \u201cClients had spent yesterday steadily building up long positions in sterling and the FTSE as they bet that cooler heads would prevail and the union would remain intact.\u201d David Cameron is trying to calm those fears over another vote in Scotland. He\u2019s giving an official statement now, saying the matter has been settled for a generation. Full coverage in our liveblog. Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, said UK investors would \u201cwelcome a reduction in the uncertainty of recent months\u201d, writes Nick Fletcher. The boss of Scotland\u2019s largest fund manager - who had tried to remain neutral during the campaign - said Scotland could look forward to a prosperous future now the vote was over. But both sides now needed to come together and move forward. He said in a statement: Scotland has long been a world leader in business sectors such as oil and gas, whisky and investment and the task now is to grow the rest of the economy with the strong support of politicians of all parties. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, isn\u2019t impressed by Westminster\u2019s handling of the independence vote. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: Our politicians have not been great poker players in a high-stakes game. Longworth also warns that businesses are anxious that the issue of Scotland\u2019s place in the UK, and the powers held by politicians in Holyrood, is resolved. The people of Scotland have spoken. Their historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom will be a relief to many businesspeople and a disappointment to others, but it was a decision for the Scottish people alone to make. \u201cThe companies I speak to are clear that this cannot simply be the first in a series of referenda, until one side or the other gets the result that it wants. Business and investment prospects across the UK would be deeply hurt by a Quebec-style \u2018neverendum\u2019 \u2013 a lesson that politicians must heed. \u201cYet businesspeople all across the UK have long known that the referendum would be the start, rather than the end, of a process of change. Businesses will now expect Westminster and Holyrood to reach a devolution settlement that is clear, fair to both sides, and swiftly executed Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank in London sends us his early reaction to the vote. He sees implications for rate hike bets in the UK and in the very short term relief in financial markets. Clarke says: All in all, the \u2018no\u2019 outcome comes as a relief to the market, though there will be some residual fine tuning left to run once the dust settles. The reduced uncertainty is likely to see the market bring forward the timing of the first BoE rate hike again, though within reason. Inflation has been far lower than expect since the August Inflation Report. Depending on how the pound exchange rate moves in the coming days, this could lead to another downward revision to the Bank\u2019s inflation projection. In turn that should prevent market expectations of a hike coming too far forward. We still expect the first move to come in February. On the longer-term, Clarke reckons a second referendum isn\u2019t likely for at least a decade (so get some sleep while you can). While there is likely to be speculation that since it was such a close outcome, another referendum can\u2019t be far away, it is worth stressing that the SNP pledged during the campaign not to have another poll for a generation. When pressed on timing, the Scottish First Minister suggested that this meant around 20 years. As a guide, there was a 15 year gap between the first Quebec referendum and the re-run. This removes a considerable amount of the uncertainty in the aftermath of the referendum, but there is plenty of unfinished business that will have to be hammered out in the coming weeks and months. Despite this morning\u2019s results, the issue of Scottish independence hasn\u2019t vanished for ever, says Bob Parker, senior advisor at Credit Suisse. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: One has to recognise that it is the mandate of the SNP to continue to argue for Scottish Independence...They\u2019re not going to change their spots. But the \u2018biggest risk\u2019 of the UK breaking up is off the table for \u201cat least two to three years\u201d, Parker added. With counting still going on, more than one and a half million votes have already been counted cast in favour of Scotland being an independent country, and 1.9 million against. Our main Scotland liveblog has all the details. David Bloom, head of foreign exchange strategy at HSBC, has been at his desk all night in Canary Wharf, my colleague Jill Treanor reports. \u201cSterling had nerves of steel through the night,\u201d he said, pointing to the moment just before 11pm when pollster Peter Kellner, who runs YouGov, said it was 99% certain that it was a victory for no. \u201cAsia was open and then people got in super early as well,\u201d Sterling could have slumped to $1.55 or even $1.50 if there had been a \u201cyes\u201d vote, Bloom said, but at $1.64 it is trading at around the right levels. Berenberg Bank\u2019s Rob Wood also warns that there are \u201ca lot of unknowns\u201d swirling around the UK now, including its membership of the European Union: That is the main point after a campaign in which London felt compelled to promise Scotland more powers at virtually the last minute to break the pro-independence momentum. What is certain is that the UK will change materially as a result of this referendum despite the \u201cno\u201d vote to independence. The uncertainty over Scotland\u2019s position and over the position of the UK in Europe will not go away. The risks are worth watching carefully indeed. The Bank of England is not planning to make a statement following the referendum result, a spokesman says. The Institute of Directors has struck a cautious note. With the immediate question of Scotland\u2019s future is resolved, attention turns to the new powers that Edinburgh was promised by Westminster leaders in the final days of the campaign. Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, says: \u201cThere can be no doubt that many businesses will breathe a sigh of relief that the prospect of a contentious currency debate and prolonged economic negotiations have been avoided, and yet we know that significant changes are still on the cards. \u201cThe main party leaders have made clear their intention to devolve further power to the Scottish Parliament, and over time this will give the people of Scotland more of a say over how to manage their economy. \u201cAs negotiations commence on a future settlement for Scotland, the focus must be on ensuring that any new powers are used to boost Scotland\u2019s economic competitiveness, unleash enterprise and attract further investment. \u201cWe are now at the beginning of a national debate about economic devolution. The Scots started that debate, and now it\u2019s time for all of us to contribute new ideas about how our nations, regions and cities are run for the benefit of the entire country.\u201d The lights have been burning all night at the Bank of England. The governor, Mark Carney, had flown back from the G20 meeting in Cairns, Australia, in time for the referendum result. He was in Threadneedle Street in the early hours of the morning in case a contingency plan was needed if there had been a yes vote. That wasn\u2019t needed, in the end, but it shows how the Bank was ready to attempt to calm a market panic. The pound has gained ground against all major currencies this morning, as this chart shows: Brenda Kelly of IG index confirms that \u201ca relief rally is in the making in UK markets\u201d, driven by companies who would have faced disruption if Scotland had chosen independence. Key areas to watch will be the banks such as RBS and Lloyds, as well as big Scottish firms like Standard Life, Aberdeen Asset Management and Weir Group. Investors in these firms will be relieved that management will be able to devote their time to business performance, rather than fretting about contract changes or headquarters moves. Meanwhile, the capital flight from the pound and Gilts should see a reversal too, thanks to the decision of Scotland to remain with the 307-year old union. Shares in London are going to jump when trading begins, in two hours time. The futures market suggests the FTSE 100 index will leap by 1.2%, or 80 points, to 6900. That would leave the blue-chip index just 50 points shy of its record high, set back in 1999. Many city workers came in especially early today, and some even worked all night, in case the referendum delivered a shock victory for the yes side. But as the results came in, they pushed the pound higher as it became clear that the union was safe. There was a surge of trading in the pound in the early hours of the morning, traders say. The pound first jumped shortly after the polls closed, when YouGov released a survey showing a win for the no side. It continued to surge as early results confirmed this view, hitting a high of $1.6524. That\u2019s a gain of more than one cent. Good morning. Relief is sweeping the financial markets after Scotland voted to remain within the United Kingdom. The pound is rallying in the foreign exchange markets, hitting fresh two-week highs against the US dollar and new two-year highs against the euro. Shares are also expected to jump when trading begins in London in a couple of hours time. After a nervy few weeks, and a dramatic night of results from Scotland, investors will be quietly relieved that Britain is staying together. Worries about currency unions, sterlingisation, and how Britain\u2019s national debt might be split can be put to one side. I\u2019ll be covering the financial reaction to a vote that has gripped the UK, and captured the attention of the world, and looking at the short and long-term consequences.

The London market has materially underperformed the US, for example, since the financial crisis and it now enjoys a significant valuation advantage over Wall Street.</p> <p>In a low interest-rate environment, equity income will continue to be an attractive source of yield for investors. With the FTSE 100 yielding 3.5%, large UK shares are reasonably well underpinned. I would expect larger companies to outperform mid- and small-cap stocks in an uncertain environment, even if some of the more domestically-focused stocks enjoy a short-term bounce. Although bonds look less attractive than equities, due to their historically low yields, the increase in market uncertainty may increase the attraction of fixed income investments.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that markets are global, especially internationally-focused markets like London. They have shaken off massive geo-political uncertainty in Ukraine and the Middle East; they have taken in their stride an imminent reversal in the interest rate cycle and the threat of deflation in Europe; I suspect they will also shrug off a close-run independence vote.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-541bcb58e4b0067bb440c19c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-09-19T06:26:08.182Z\">7.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">RBS: We won't be moving head office out of Scotland</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b9a74de-2239-4d7f-b03e-0299f486d734\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/19/1411107937760/b2632d3e-1d10-4380-986b-f72fda16ec38-460x352.jpeg\" alt=\"The Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters.\" width=\"460\" height=\"352\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has announced that it will certainly not be moving its head office out of Edinburgh.</p> <p>The contingency plan that was drawn up in case Scotland voted for independence has been thrown in the bin.</p> <p>RBS says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe announcement we made about moving our registered head office to England was part of a contingency plan to ensure certainty and stability for our customers, staff and shareholders should there be a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote. </p> <p>That contingency plan is no longer required.

The reduced uncertainty is likely to see the market bring forward the timing of the first BoE rate hike again, though within reason. Inflation has been far lower than expect since the August Inflation Report. Depending on how the pound exchange rate moves in the coming days, this could lead to another downward revision to the Bank\u2019s inflation projection. In turn that should prevent market expectations of a hike coming too far forward.

When pressed on timing, the Scottish First Minister suggested that this meant around 20 years. As a guide, there was a 15 year gap between the first Quebec referendum and the re-run.

      "bodyText": "BP is facing increased pressure over its sponsorship of the arts following protests this week over its patronage of the Royal Opera House and a legal row around its support for the Tate galleries. The oil giant gives \u00a32m a year to four of the country's top cultural institutions. Environmental groups say this is \"inappropriate\" given its involvement in fossil fuels, which intensify global warming. In recent months BP has also faced protests at the other two sites where it holds partnerships, the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery, but says it wants to continue with \"community\" engagement. It is expected to be one of many targets for criticism at a climate change rally in London on Sunday. Last Wednesday 14 dancers staged a protest against BP by performing a routine in front of a crowd of thousands in Trafalgar Square who were watching a live stream broadcast of the Royal Opera House's production of Verdi's Rigoletto. The dancers \u2013 calling themselves BP Out of Opera - were dressed in black with masquerade masks on their faces and green BP logos on their bodies. The following day, the Tate link with BP was in the spotlight at an information tribunal in London over the art institution's unwillingness to provide specific financial details of its commercial partnership with the oil group, whose reputation is still tarnished by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill four years ago. A group known as Request Initiative, working with the oil protest group Platform, made a legal challenge claiming the Tate was using information law to unfairly withhold information. \"There's a clear public interest in knowing exactly how much money Tate is getting from BP. Gallery-goers want to know if the amount of money involved justifies Tate's complicity with one of the companies most responsible for destroying a stable climate for generations to come,\" said Kevin Smith, an oil sponsorship campaigner from Platform.

Royal Bank of Scotland ended 3% higher although the FTSE 100 closed up just 18 points - 0.3% - in a rise that was more muted than expected. Sterling had touched a two-year high against the euro in Asian trading hours and was up half a cent against the dollar at $1.64 as the referendum result came in, but eventually ended down against the dollar. The rally was initially led by RBS and other companies with exposure to Scotland, including the rival bailed-out bank Lloyds Banking Group. Both banks had warned they would move their registered offices from Edinburgh in the event of a yes vote, while the insurer Standard Life had said it would set up English subsidiaries. RBS made clear that its contingency plan was no longer required, saying it was \"business as usual\", although Lloyds and Standard Life were more equivocal in their remarks. Lloyds said it remained \"fully focused on supporting households and businesses in Scotland as well as right across the UK\", while Standard Life said it would \"consider the implications\" of the referendum, which is expected to lead to changes right across the UK. Lloyds is expected to return to the question of where to base its registered office when implementing the restructuring required by the rules requiring a \"ringfence\" to be erected between high street and investment banking activities by 2019. A relief rally had been expected after Scotland voted against independence, though analysts cautioned that political uncertainty remained after David Cameron, the prime minister, promised more devolution for the UK.

The bank raised its pretax profit estimates for 2015 to 2017 by 6% and added: We expect Ashtead to deliver an earnings per share compound annual growth rate of around 25% over the next five years, driven by an end-market recovery in the US non-residential sector, a continued structural shift to rental, further market share gains, a clear depot roll-out programme and further fleet growth at existing stores. In addition, Ashtead's profitability and returns look set to improve even further... Ashtead's size and balance sheet strength provide a key competitive advantage, and further out we see record low levels of leverage providing scope for significant cash return to shareholders. Among the mid caps, Domino Printing closed 51.5p higher at 606p after the barcode printing specialist said sales in the ten months to the end of August had risen 9% on an underlying basis or by 4% at constant exchange rates. Analyst Michael Blogg at Investec said: Constant-currency sales growth of 9%...represents a faster rate than most Industrial companies are currently reporting. Orders and sales of digital colour label printers are building up as expected. Even with the prospect of price competition and additional investment flattening earnings next year, this remains an attractive story to us. We have not changed either our estimates or target price [of 650p] and remain positive on the shares. Russian steelmaker Evraz, controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, rose 4.6p to 145p after the company said it was considering a US flotation of its north American assets. It said: Any offering would commence after the SEC [regulator] completes its review process, which would be initiated by the filing of a registration document. Finally, a day with a major news event would not be the same without a couple of Aim warnings to keep it compa. Stepping up to the plate were Clean Air Power, down 34% at 3.125p, and Surgical Innovations, 31% lower at 3p.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's plans to balance the government's books will require additional tax increases, spending cuts or welfare cuts worth more than \u00a337bn in the first three years of the next parliament, according to Britain's leading experts on the public finances. In an assessment of the budget plans of the three biggest Westminster parties, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that austerity would continue under a Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat chancellor, but that Osborne had by far the toughest approach to fiscal policy. The IFS said the biggest difference was that the Conservatives planned to secure an overall budget surplus in the next parliament, with the Treasury's tax revenues sufficient to cover both the day-to-day running costs of the government and capital spending on infrastructure projects. Labour and the Lib Dems, by contrast, have made commitments to run a surplus on current spending but have said they would borrow in order to fund capital projects. The thinktank said the chancellor was on course to meet his objective by 2018-19, by which time a surplus on current spending of 1.5% of national output would be greater than investment spending of 1.4% of gross domestic product. \"However, the latest forecasts for the public finances imply further deep cuts to public service spending, which have not yet been set out in any detail,\" the IFS said. \"To achieve the currently forecast levels of borrowing, without any further tax increases or cuts to welfare spending, the government would need to cut spending by government departments by a further 10.6% in real terms (or \u00a337.6bn) between 2015\u201316 and 2018\u201319. This is on top of the \u00a38.7bn cut that has already been set out for 2015\u201316.\" The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has yet to specify when he would start to run a current budget surplus or how big the surplus would be, saying that his decisions would depend on the state of the economy. The IFS said the latest coalition government plans implied a current surplus of 0.5% of GDP by 2017-18, rising to 1.5% of GDP a year later. \"Unless Labour seek to deliver as large a surplus as this (or larger), their target potentially implies a looser fiscal position than current policy \u2013 that is, they may be able to cut taxes or increase spending relative to current policy by 1.5% of national income in 2018\u201319. \"For example, if Labour chose to achieve exactly a current budget balance in 2018\u201319 and allocated all the extra borrowing to easing the planned cuts to departmental spending (rather than to tax cuts or increases in benefit spending), then the cumulative cut required to departmental spending would be reduced from \u00a337.6bn to \u00a39.3bn between 2015-16 and 2018-19.\" The Lib Dems have said their aim would be to run a surplus on the current budget adjusted to take account of the state of the economy. \"The targets chosen by Labour and the Liberal Democrats would, in principle, allow them to have a higher level of spending and/or lower level of taxation than the Conservatives would require to meet their target for borrowing\", the IFS said. \"However, for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats this would, of course, come at the cost of debt declining less quickly as a share of national income than implied by either current government projections or the Conservatives' fiscal target.\"",

According to the Met Office, the country has enjoyed the driest start to September in more than 50 years. \"The first half of September has been exceptionally dry across much of the UK and temperatures for many areas have also been well above average,\" said a Met Office spokesman, Dan Williams. The warm spell has continued this week, with the mercury topping 26C in Wigginholt, West Sussex on Thursday, making it the hottest place in the UK according to the Met Office's website. Poor fashion sales weighed on John Lewis' overall performance, with sales down 3.5% in the week to last Saturday. There were bright spots, however, with the retailer reporting a 4% increase in sales of men's accessories \u2013 buoyed by demand for Calvin Klein underwear \u2013 and a 3.6% lift in its electricals departments, where tablets and Apple products were in demand. Home furnishings also did well, with sales of carpets and curtains up 11% despite the impact of cooler weather last year. \"Although customers are not planning for the cold winter nights just yet, they are still looking to treat themselves to a little something new,\" Marsh said. \"Despite the forecast for continuing mild weather, and with Christmas launching online, we are confident that our seasonal assortment will inspire customers to invest in products for the coming months.\"",
