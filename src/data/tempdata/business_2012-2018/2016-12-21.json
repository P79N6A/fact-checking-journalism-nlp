On Wednesday, the Swedish firm\u2019s spokeswoman Johanna Iritz said the firm takes the matter seriously, adding: \u201cwe can\u2019t guarantee safety\u201d. The trend reportedly started when two teenagers spent the night in an Ikea store in Belgium in August this year, then posted a video of their exploits online. According to the Associated Press, Iritz said Ikea has recorded about 10 such incidents in the past year in the United States, Canada, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Australia and Poland. The agency said it was unclear whether anyone had been prosecuted. In August, Florian Van Hecke and Bram Geirnaert hid in wardrobes in an Ikea store in Belgium \u2013 coming out once it had closed. They filmed themselves using the display furniture overnight and finally left the store without being caught. Their video on YouTube was subsequently viewed more than 1.7m times. The latest incident involved two 14-year-old girls trying to stay over in an Ikea branch in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden, last weekend. According to local media, the firm did not report the incident because of the girls\u2019 age. \u201cInstead, we have spoken with their parents \u2026 to resolve the situation. We hope that this trend will slow. We do not see what it is fun about it,\u201d an Ikea spokesman told Aftonbladet. Speaking on Wednesday, Iritz reiterated that the fun associated with sleeping over in an Ikea store after closing time was \u201coverrated\u201d. Her statement comes two years after Ikea invited people to stay over in one of its Australian stores as part of a joint publicity stunt with Airbnb. Ikea listed one of its Sydney stores on the homesharing website. At that time, the firm said the opportunity promised \u201cguests a truly unusual experience, where the Ikea bedroom displays will be transformed into a quirky accommodation option\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Monte dei Paschi di Siena\u2019s attempt to float itself off the rocks with private capital appears doomed and a state-sponsored bailout looks inevitable. The Italian government on Wednesday granted itself the funds for a rescue package. The deed will probably be done by Christmas, with losses imposed on junior bondholders. It is tempting to think this outcome was inevitable. The crisis at Italy\u2019s third-largest lender has bubbled away for most of 2016 and the bank has a long and grim record of disappointing its backers. Over the past five years, it has raised \u20ac8bn in capital but churned out losses of \u20ac15bn. But, turn the clock back just a few months, and there were realistic hopes that recapitalisation by the private sector would succeed. The Siena-based lender was bottom of the class in the eurozone\u2019s regulatory stress tests in the summer but a few Greek banks have proved it is possible to find brave investors willing to take a punt on recovery. MPS also seemed to have acquired two ingredients it had previously lacked \u2013 a credible chief executive and a serious cost-cutting plan. Marco Morelli, a former Bank of America executive, arrived in September and outlined his ambition to cut 2,500 jobs and a quarter of the branches. If recapitalisation could be achieved, said Morelli, MPS would emerge at the end of 2019 with one of the healthiest capital ratios among European banks. And why not? Italy is not Greece. Half the country is rich. It ought to be possible for a bank founded in 1472 to shuffle off its bad loans, even at depressed prices, overcome its foolish acquisitions from the boom years and regain a profitable niche. The critical sum at stake in the recapitalisation plan \u2013 \u20ac5bn \u2013 was not off the scale and JP Morgan, the Wall Street powerhouse advising MPS, was on hand to round up a few so-called anchor investors. It has not worked. The immediate reason is that the anchor investors, supposedly from Qatar and China, have got cold feet. Meanwhile, junior bondholders have squealed at being asked to turn their IOUs into equity. In other words, confidence drained away, not helped by MPS\u2019s warning that its levels of liquidity were falling fast. But the other trigger was the landslide defeat for prime minister Matteo Renzi in the referendum on constitutional reform. That reopened the debate about Italy\u2019s long-term future in the eurozone. Until the elections are held and the political picture clears, investors seem to have decided that Italy is not a place to take a high-risk bet. January\u2019s planned \u20ac13bn recapitalisation of Unicredit should still be safe. Unicredit is bigger, its bad debts are less severe and underwriters are already in place. But Italy\u2019s political class should be alarmed by MPS\u2019s failure to find private-sector friends. Bigger challenges have been overcome during the eurozone\u2019s many crises. This state bailout looks like investors\u2019 vote of little confidence in Italy. Lily-livered Deloitte\u2019s ridiculous apology The sins of Serco and G4S, circa 2013, were grave. The companies had been billing the government for placing electronic tags on offenders who were dead or in prison. They were told to engage in \u201ccorporate renewal\u201d \u2013 in other words, get their houses in order \u2013 and they would be banned from bidding for public sector work in the meantime. The response was reasonable and appeared to have the desired effect. The companies reformed their boards and audit committees to try to ensure that such a scandal could never happen again. Six months later, the bans were lifted, which also seemed roughly right. Outsourcing is designed to save money for the public purse and Serco and G4S, love them or loathe then, are two of the biggest operators in the country. So best to have the duo, in scrubbed-up form one hopes, in the market to keep the bidding competitive. Now Deloitte has similarly been banned from bidding for central government contracts for six months. Or, rather, the consultant has volunteered for punishment. Has it also ripped off taxpayers for millions through deceit or incompetence? Not at all. All that has happened is that one of its consultants wrote a two-page internal memo suggesting the government had no plan for Brexit, which is hardly a controversial opinion, and that civil servants are struggling to cope with the extra workload. But Deloitte thinks it needs to apologise for the \u201cunintended disruption ... caused to government\u201d by a leak to the Times. It wants \u201cto put this matter behind us\u201d. This affair is ridiculous. The partners of Deloitte come across as lily-livered. And Theresa May, in apparently endorsing the six-month ban, appears terrified of criticism. Outsiders will draw a simple conclusion from the colossal over-reaction: the memo was on the money.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers are set for a strong end to the year as shoppers from overseas seek out bargains and Brits snap up big electrical goods and furniture before expected price rises next year. Despite fears of a Brexit slowdown, retail sales growth picked up in the final quarter of the year, according to the latest Bank of England report on business conditions. A monthly survey by the Bank\u2019s network of regional agents found households were thought to be bringing forward purchases of larger items. Retailers have said prices are likely to rise because of the 15% fall in the value of the pound against the dollar since the EU referendum. Caroline Gulliver, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cWe believe Christmas trading for 2016 could be surprisingly robust compared to performances [so far this year] as a combination of weak comps [comparative figures], high disposable income and modestly helpful weather persuade consumers to spend. However, we do feel this will be a last hurrah ahead of a tougher 2017 as inflation accelerates.\u201d A monthly poll by market researchers GfK found that consumer confidence edged up in December, although it remains well below the levels seen before the vote to leave the EU. The barometer\u2019s main measure of consumer mood stood at -7 this month, up from -8 in November. People were marginally more upbeat about the prospects for their personal financial situation over the coming 12 months and they were more confident that now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture. But three other measures examined by GfK deteriorated: personal financial situation over the past 12 months, state of the economy over the past year and outlook for the economy over the coming 12 months. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, echoed economists in warning that the pound\u2019s fall since the referendum was stoking inflation and starting to affect consumer spending patterns. \u201cLooking ahead to 2017 against a backdrop of Brexit negotiations, the decline in the value of sterling and the prospect of higher inflation impacting purchasing power, we forecast that confidence will be tested by the storm and stress of the year to come,\u201d said Staton. The CBI said in a separate report that its indicators from the private sector pointed to a solid close to the year but it highlighted challenges in 2017. Its growth indicator, compiled from surveys of 788 respondents from manufacturing, the retail industry and the broader services sector, climbed to a balance of +17% in the three months to December, the highest in a year. The manufacturing sector saw a strong rise in activity, and although retail sector growth slowed from November\u2019s pace, the report said the rise in sales remained solid. Alpesh Paleja, the CBI\u2019s principal economist, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the economy end the year on the up, with growth strengthening across the private sector. However, economic growth is likely to soften next year, as heightened uncertainty hits business investment and higher inflation weighs on household spending.\u201d Retail analysts said high employment levels and low interest rates as well as higher levels of disposable income as wage rises outstripped inflation were likely to have a bigger influence on behaviour this Christmas than fears of inflation next year. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said people were yet to feel any financial pain from the approach of Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t think that inflation is a material driver in consumer behaviour at the moment. I struggle to see a lot of people sitting down and saying \u2018inflation is going to be 3.5% next year let\u2019s go and buy a sofa,\u2019\u201d he said. The fall in the value of the pound has helped luxury retailers, which are enjoying booming sales as foreign visitors buy up handbags, jewellery and other designer products. Meanwhile, fashion retailers \u2013 who account for one of the largest shares of spending at this time of year \u2013 are having a better season thanks to relatively normal winter weather after last year\u2019s prolonged warm spell. The Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents added that increased \u201cstaycationing\u201d, as higher costs deterred Brits from holidaying abroad, was supporting growth in consumer services.",

      "bodyText": "In quiet pre-Christmas trading, the banking sector came under pressure on concerns that Italian bank Monte dei Pashi\u2019s fundraising was in trouble, helping push European markets into negative territory. The moves were hardly dramatic however, ahead of the holiday period, and the German market managed to just about buck the trend. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has so far failed to test the 20,000 barrier. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.04% at 7041.42 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.03% to 11,468.64 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.33% lower at 4833.82 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.16% to 19,215.59 with Monte dei Paschi itself down 12% Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.38% at 9371.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.71% to 638.99 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 13 points at 19,961. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day, barring any late developments on Wall Street. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Worries about European banks are undermining stock markets, particularly in Italy and Spain. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Banking concerns have played across European markets once again today, as Monte dei Paschi looks set for a government takeover. The rescue plan has fallen apart, with Rome unable to find an anchor investor; for understandable reasons, no one wants to be first \u2018over the top\u2019 should the crisis worsen. Italy\u2019s debt will get bigger, but a major government stake should, paradoxically, boost risk appetite among investors, who will be glad to see the Italian government taking the tough decisions. Meanwhile, Spanish banks are under pressure after the ECJ ruled they would have to pay back funds to mortgage borrowers. 2016 saw plenty of concerns about European banks, but while it made sense for everyone to buy Deutsche shares at \u20ac10, it will be harder to find investors willing to take stakes in southern European firms. Still, the overall tone on markets is only slightly negative, although the patient watch for Dow 20,000 goes on. Here\u2019s Reuters on the Monte dei Paschi situation: Ailing Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena has been unable to find an anchor investor willing to put money in its privately funded rescue plan, less than 24 hours before the offer ends, two sources close to the matter said on Wednesday. The bank needs to raise 5 billion euros ($5.2 billion) by the end of this month to avert being wound down. The Italian government is expected to step in this week to bail it out. The Tuscan lender, Italy\u2019s third biggest bank and the world\u2019s oldest, had pinned its hopes on Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund investing 1 billion euros in its cash call, but that option is no longer on the table, the sources said. As a result, the bank entire share sale, which closes at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, has drawn very little interest from the wider investment community, they added. The bank declined to comment. Ratings agency DBRS is keeping an eye on Italy: Over in Italy, the rescue package for struggling bank Monte dei Paschi is looking in trouble, bringing the prospect of a state bailout closer: Which suggests that Qatar is unwilling to invest in the bank. But Italy could find out whether any bailout breaches EU rules, if taxpayers have to foot the bill but investors are left untouched. In the wake of its recent blog on Greece, the International Monetary Fund has responded to questions about its comments, mainly to do with tax and pensions. A tweet from the IMF\u2019s spokesperson explains: Oil prices have slipped slightly as the latest US figures show an unexpected rise in crude stocks. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is 0.15% lower at $53.22 a barrel while Brent crude is down 0.38% to $55.14. US crude stocks have defied expectations with a hefty jump last week. They rose by nearly 2.3m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, compared to forecasts of a fall of around 2.5m barrels. The figures go against Tuesday\u2019s news from the American Petroleum Institute of a much larger than expected 4.1m decline in crude. Analyst welcomed the improvement in European consumer confidence, but there was some caution over the future outlook. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: European consumers appear to have shrugged off concerns including Brexit, the Italian banking crisis and the upcoming inauguration of President Trump to post the year\u2019s strongest confidence figures for December, albeit still firmly in negative territory. While today\u2019s data will encourage ECB chief Mario Draghi, the Christmas cheer may not last long, especially if markets start to waver as Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. Draghi must be congratulated for steering Europe\u2019s economy through choppy waters during what has been a particularly testing 12 months. But now the real challenge begins: delivering substantive growth in 2017. Economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit said: An encouraging boost to Eurozone growth prospects as consumer confidence rose for a fourth month running in December to reach a 20-month high. Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation. This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017... While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer. Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u2013 particularly a decent increase \u2013 is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects... However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017. Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u2019s Brexit vote in June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform. Eurozone consumer confidence has improved so far in December. The provisional reading for the month from the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to expectations of a figure of -6. The Commission said: In December 2016, the...flash estimate of the consumer confidence indicator increased markedly in both the euro area (by 1.1 points to -5.1) and the EU (by 1.2 points to -4.6) compared to November. On the home sales, Lawrence Yun, the association\u2019s chief economist, said the last three months had been outstanding for the housing market. He said: The healthiest job market since the Great Recession and the anticipation of some buyers to close on a home before mortgage rates accurately rose from their historically low level have combined to drive sales higher in recent months. Furthermore, it\u2019s no coincidence that home shoppers in the Northeast \u2014 where price growth has been tame all year \u2014 had the most success last month. Existing housing supply at the beginning of the year was inadequate and is now even worse heading into 2017. Rental units are also seeing this shortage. As a result, both home prices and rents continue to far outstrip incomes in much of the country. US existing home sales unexpectedly jumped in November, hitting their highest level in nearly ten years. Sales rose 0.7% to an annualised 5.61m units, the best since February 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had been expecting a fall from October\u2019s figure of 5.57m units - itself revised down from 5.6m - to 5.5m. Well that didn\u2019t last. The Dow is now down 14 points as investors shy away from pushing it above 20,000. For the moment at least. After an initial dip, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is slightly higher, edging ever nearer to the 20,000 barrier. But the trend is not exactly certain in early trading. The Dow is currently at 19,982, up 8 points. Elsewhere the S&amp;P 500 opened down just 1.55 points while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.05%. Analysts have been waiting for a few days now for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to break the 20,000 barrier for the first time, and on Tuesday it came tantalisingly close at 19,987 before closing at 19.974. Could today be the day? The futures are indicating a slight rise, so it looks like edging ever closer. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: I have no insight into what happens once the Dow breaks 20,000 but some people see this as a major milestone. And until it is broken it acts as Pied Piper, or perhaps Rudolph\u2019s nose, lighting the way for the risk-hungry and those scared of being left behind. The Guardian\u2019s monthly Brexit Watch has just been published. It shows how the impact June\u2019s vote is now hitting the economy, with inflation up and retail sales growth slowing. Economists Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance both agree that growth is slowing: Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has just warned that public borrowing in the final four months of this financial year will be slightly higher than a year ago. In its official response to today\u2019s public finance data, the OBR warns that tax receipts may weaken in the December-March period, while government spending will pick up. The OBR says: \u201cConsiderable uncertainty remains over prospects for borrowing in the remaining third of the year, but we expect public sector net borrowing to rise slightly relative to the same period in 2015-16. This is due to: onshore corporation tax, where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year; stamp duty land tax, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and central government spending, where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u201d However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u2019s borrowing since April is down by \u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall. Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u2019s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors) Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u2019s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating. Monday\u2019s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u201cone off\u201d that will never be repeated. Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course. The leftist-led government insists that fiscal targets can be met because the supplementary help will be extracted from the primary surplus Athens, by dint of hard effort, has managed to achieve. The deputy prime minister Yiannis Dragasakis highlighted the tensions on Tuesday evening saying it was the country\u2019s \u201csovereign right\u201d to distribute the excess surplus as it felt fit. Finance ministry sources say with the handwringing still ongoing, Athens has yet to send the letter. Without it, euro zone partners have said the retaliatory decision to freeze short-term debt relief measures \u2013 a huge setback for Athens \u2013 cannot be lifted. One of Monte dei Paschi\u2019s riskier bonds has tumbled in value today, in another sign that investors believe its \u20ac5bn cash call will fail. That capital raising exercise ends tomorrow afternoon; if it hasn\u2019t attracted enough support, Italy\u2019s government might then step in and \u2018bail in\u2019 some bond holders, making them share the cost of a rescue. Back in Italy, shares in Monte dei Paschi bank have taken an almighty dive - only to bounce right back up again  . They initially slumped by 18% in a panicky selloff, as news broke that the bank might run out of liquidity within four months. BUT then they rallies sharply, after Italian MPs approved plans to borrow an extra \u20ac20bn to fund bank bailouts (potentially starting with Monte dei Paschi) It\u2019s not clear, though, that shareholders would be left with much if the Rome government is forced to intervene -- which is why shares are down 99.8% from their record high.... Britain\u2019t tax receipts have risen by 4.4% this financial year, or \u00a317.8bn, to \u00a3421.8bn. That helped to pull borrowing down since April -- but not by enough to prevent the national debt hitting record highs. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is concerned that the UK tax take isn\u2019t growing faster: \u201cGovernment borrowing in November, while higher than expected, was still marginally lower in annual terms. Despite the slight improvement, debt levels remain unsustainably high. \u201c2017 is likely to be a challenging period for the UK\u2019s public finances, with economic growth likely to soften, which will hamper the UK\u2019s ability to generate tax receipts. The more flexible approach to deficit reduction announced in the Autumn Statement is a sensible step given the broader uncertainty. However, the acid test for the Chancellor\u2019s new fiscal rules will be whether they are able to reverse the ongoing shortfall in tax revenue, which has persistently hampered previous attempts to reduce the deficit.\u201d Chancellor Philip Hammond may find some Christmas cheer in today\u2019s public finances. Even though the deficit was higher than expected, Britain seems to be on track to hit the (new) budget targets which were announced in November\u2019s autumn statement. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says its \u201cwelcome news\u201d for Hammond. Reassuring news for the Chancellor as the public finances saw modest improvement in November compared to a year earlier \u2013 thereby keeping the government on track to meet \u2013 or even slightly undershoot - its upwardly revised target for 2016/17 contained in November\u2019s Autumn Statement. It would have been somewhat embarrassing if the first set of public finance figures after the November Statement had immediately put question markets over his new fiscal targets. Howard has also crunched through today\u2019s data, and reports that: There was a slowdown in growth in tax receipts in November, primarily due to income tax related receipts dipping 1.1% year-on-year. ONS data show that employment growth has slowed recently, although it needs to be borne in mind that the tax data can be erratic from month to month, partly depending on when exactly the receipts come in. It is also notable that national insurance contributions were up 6.3% year-on-year. VAT receipts were up 4.4% year-on-year in November and corporation tax receipts were up 22.9% year-on-year, which points to still resilient economic activity. City experts aren\u2019t impressed that Britain\u2019s net borrowing spiked to \u00a312.6bn last month, up from just \u00a34.2bn in October. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, says: \u201cThe outlook for the UK heading into the new year is a rather bearish one and investors are unlikely to be flying in with both feet as uncertainty continues to swirl. And here\u2019s Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, \u201cThe gap between UK government spending and income has risen sharply in November, raising a number of red flags with investors who will interpret this as a sign that a significant economic slowdown is coming in the new year. \u201cChancellor Philip Hammond has announced the final spring budget for early March where he will attempt to plan for an uncertain future, with the triggering of Article 50 set for later that month. \u201cIf borrowing levels continues to rise at this rate, Hammond may not have too much room for manoeuvre when setting out his fiscal policy.\u201d This chart, from today\u2019s public finances, shows how Britain\u2019s national debt hit a new record high in November - up to \u00a31.655bn from \u00a31.641bn in October. And this chart shows how net borrowing this financial year has fallen by \u00a37.7bn, compared to 2015-2016. Newsflash: Britain borrowed more than \u00a312.6bn to balance the books in November. The public sector net borrowing requirement (excluding the impact of our state-owned banks) came in at \u00a312.647bn. That\u2019s around \u00a3400m ahead of City expectations but lower than the \u00a313.2bn borrowed in November 2015. And it pushes the national debt up to \u00a31.655 trillion, a new record high, equivalent to 84.5% of GDP. More to follow... If the public\u2019s inflation expectations are accurate, then pay packets are going to be eroded by rising prices in the next few years. This chart from the Resolution Foundation shows how real wages could start falling in 2017, as inflation overtakes nominal pay growth: Eek..... Now this is interesting.... three of the six policymakers at Sweden\u2019s Riksbank voted against extending its QE programme by six months. One deputy governor wanted a smaller QE boost, while two more opposed any extension. That forced governor Stefan Ingves to use his casting vote to get today\u2019s decision through. Shares in Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi (MPS) have just been temporarily suspended in Milan after plunging over 8%. The selloff was triggered, I think, by a Reuters report showing that MPS is burning through its \u20ac11bn cash reserves faster than expected. It is now on track to run out of funds in four months time, rather than having almost a year\u2019s worth of liquidity. Reuters said: Monte dei Paschi said it now expected its net liquidity position, currently standing at \u20ac10.6bn, to turn negative after four months. On Sunday the bank had forecast that a current net liquidity position, which was of \u20ac11bn, would turn negative after 11 months under a number of assumptions. Remember, MPS must find \u20ac5bn of fresh capital by the end of this month. Newsflash from Stockholm: Sweden\u2019s central bank has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of minus 0.5%. The Riksbank has also extended its asset-purchase scheme by another six months, to maintain its current expansionary monetary policy. The pound is dipping in early trading, down 0.25% against the US dollar to $1.2334, and 0.4% against the euro to \u20ac1.185. The US dollar itself is edging away from yesterday\u2019s 14-year high, but remains strong -- possibly too strong, given the political uncertainty in America. Jeremy Cook of World First says: Once again, we have to think that the market is irrationally exuberant heading into the New Year and while the economic side of the new politics is being fully priced in \u2013 US and Chinese stimulus \u2013 the political side of the economics \u2013 policy mistakes and antagonistic trade stances \u2013 are not. The dollar has made an impressive run but our minds keep circling back to the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th as a possible turning point. Markets like to \u2018buy the rumour and sell the fact\u2019 and the swelling of asset prices, the dollar and inflation expectations could be a monster version of this trading plan. We cannot be sure until Trump is in the White House and that is in a month\u2019s time. Have City traders clocked off for Christmas already? European stock markets have barely shifted in early trading, and are hovering close to their highest level in 11 months. In London, the FTSE 100 has risen by 4 points, or 0.07%. Some breaking news: Britons are expecting inflation to pick up speed over the next few years, according to a new survey. Reuters has the details: The British public\u2019s long-term expectation for inflation rose to 3% in December, a more than two year high, according to a closely watched survey by polling company YouGov. The survey for U.S. bank Citi showed that in December, people on average expected inflation in 5-10 years to reach 3%, the highest level since September 2014 and up from a November forecast of 2.8%. In the shorter term, respondents to the survey expect inflation in 12 months\u2019 time to be at 2.43% from an earlier forecast of 2.36%. Last month, inflation picked up to 1.2% - and economists expect it to keep rising in 2017. The survey comes after a series of Brexit-inflation stories, including the row between Unilever and Tesco over the price of marmite, and price hikes by US technology firms such as Apple. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Even though its unseasonably mild, this morning\u2019s economic data may send a shiver through the City. At 9.30am, we find out how much Britain had to borrow last month to balance the gap between government income and spending. It\u2019s likely to show that the deficit widened to \u00a312.2bn in November, up from just \u00a34.8bn in October. A poor reading may reignite concerns over the UK\u2019s public finances as we head towards 2017, and a likely economic slowdown. The data may put a few investors off their mince pies, with analysts at RBC Capital Markets saying: November is traditionally a seasonally difficult month for the public finances, and we see a deficit of \u00a312bn on the public sector net borrowing (ex-banking groups) measure. Also coming up.... Italy\u2019s government will be pushing on with a \u20ac20bn rescue package for its banks, with time running short. Monti dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s oldest lender, is making a last-ditch attempt to raise \u20ac5bn by selling shares to retail investors and investors. But this plan hit another roadblock last night, when the country\u2019s bank rescue fund expressed concerns about a \u20ac1.5bn loan that would underpin the deal. If the rescue plan fails, then the Italian state will have to step in. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning, after Wall Street hit record highs (again) last night, and the dollar hit a new 14-year high. Traders will be watching New York later, to see if the Dow Jones index can hit 20,000 for the first time (it rose to 19,974 yesterday).

Furthermore, consumer confidence is now at a very decent level compared to long-term norms. Consumers across the Eurozone are currently benefiting from pretty decent fundamentals overall, notably including higher employment and still limited inflation.</p> <p>This reinforces hopes that the Eurozone will have seen some pick-up in GDP growth in the fourth quarter and is set to see a decent start to 2017...</p> <p>While there are no details available, it seems reasonable suspect that the marked rise in Eurozone consumer confidence in December was due to improved perceptions on the economic situation and outlook. It is also likely that job concerns eased further across the Eurozone after a marked dip in November (following increased worries during August-October). Significantly, latest data showed that Eurozone unemployment dropped at an increased rate in October and September after labour markets had shown signs of losing momentum over the summer.</p> <p>Any improvement in Eurozone consumer confidence \u2013 particularly a decent increase \u2013 is to be welcomed as the consumer clearly is vital to Eurozone growth prospects...</p> <p>However, there is the danger that an increasingly uncertain political and economic environment could cause companies to become more cautious over employment during 2017.</p> <p>Furthermore, consumer confidence in the Eurozone could very well be pressurised by increasing political uncertainty over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u2019s Brexit vote in June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks in the Eurozone. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (around September), and may also well occur in Italy after the December referendum defeat on constitutional reform.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585a9b73e4b0d460757eb36a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-21T15:13:34.990Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence rises to 20 month high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eurozone consumer confidence has improved so far in December.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/index_en.htm\">provisional reading for the month </a></strong>from the European Commission shows a rise of 1.1 points to -5.1, compared to expectations of a figure of -6.

This is due to: </p> <ul> <li><strong>onshore corporation tax,</strong> where strength in October instalment payments that was factored into our November forecast is not expected to persist over the rest of the year;<br></li> <li><strong>stamp duty land tax</strong>, where we expect much weaker growth over the rest of the year. SDLT receipts in April 2016 were up 48 per cent on a year earlier, reflecting forestalling ahead of the introduction of an additional rate of stamp duty on additional properties (i.e. buy-to-let investments and second homes). We expect the weakness in receipts seen since the EU referendum to persist over the rest of the year; and <br></li> <li><strong>central government spending,</strong> where a number of factors are expected to boost growth later in the year. These include debt interest spending, which is expected to rise due to higher RPI inflation (with a lag of three to eight months) and higher planned investment spending.\u201d<br></li> </ul> <p>However (as flagged earlier), Britain\u2019s borrowing since April is down by \u00a37.7bn, so the annual deficit should still fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/811553699772432384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Data revisions improve public finances - read the latest commentary at <a href=\"https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW\">https://t.co/k0nGloBMMW</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gM3KrXEaaT\">pic.twitter.com/gM3KrXEaaT</a></p>&mdash; OBR (@OBR_UK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OBR_UK/status/811553699772432384\">December 21, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-585a6dc5e4b0d460757eb26e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-21T12:42:44.080Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"950f4124ed872729a0a5b855a48b145e9b41152c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/950f4124ed872729a0a5b855a48b145e9b41152c/0_0_1301_1345/967.jpg\" alt=\"A Greek flag\" width=\"967\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in Greece, relations with creditors remain awkward and tense following Monday\u2019s inconclusive euro working group (representing Greek creditors)<br></strong></p> <h2>Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The tensions stirred by the announcement of relief measures for those hardest hit by the country\u2019s seemingly relentless economic crisis show no sign of abating.</p> <p>Monday\u2019s euro group meeting was a test case in humiliation for the embattled Greek government with Athens being forced to accept in writing that the bonus proclaimed by prime minister Alexis Tsipras for pensioners is a \u201cone off\u201d that will never be repeated.</p> <p>Germany, the main contributor to the emergency bailouts keeping the debt-stricken economy afloat, apparently remains unconvinced that the pre-Christmas gifts (including exempting Aegean islands from a planned sales tax) will not throw the economy off-course.

Even Portugal, Spain, Slovakia and Poland marginally increased the proportion of national income they spend on welfare.

      "bodyText": "Restrictive practices by the trade body representing owners of fairground rides has left funfairs with fewer new attractions, the competition regulator has claimed. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday that the law may have been breached by rules enforced by a trade body in the travelling fair sector, the Showmen\u2019s Guild of Great Britain. Ann Pope, a senior antitrust director at the CMA, said: \u201cThese allegations concern the use of restrictive rules which could limit competition between funfairs and effectively prevent non-guild members from being able to compete. \u201cFair-goers may lose out if new fairs can\u2019t take place or if existing fairs are under less competitive pressure to provide different or new attractions.\u201d The CMA said guild members made up 90% of the travelling fairs sector in the UK, a market estimated to be worth \u00a3100m a year. The regulator claims that the body\u2019s rules and practices prevent competition in organising or attending fairs, and may also stop members from starting new fairs in competition with existing events. Fairs tend to be staged at the request of local authorities, who ask an organiser to arrange to supply the attractions. The organisers tend to be guild members, who then widely use guild members to provide the rides. The CMA alleges that even in cases where local authorities try to alter or improve a fair without the consent of the guild, \u201cits members can boycott the whole fair as a result of the rules as happened in Newcastle in 2013 which meant the Hoppings Fair did not go ahead, leading to around half a million fair-goers who usually attend missing out\u201d. The Showmen\u2019s Guild of Great Britain declined to comment on the CMA\u2019s statement or explain what it does to look after its members\u2019 interests. However, the body\u2019s website says it protects \u201cthe interests of its members ... by its code of rules for members and through the legal and constitutional processes of the land. \u201cThrough its parliamentary agent, the guild contests any proposed legislation that discriminates against its members; or seeks concessions when legislation threatens their ability to make a living. In matters involving local authorities a delegation of officers will usually be called upon to represent member\u2019s interests.\u201d The CMA added: \u201cThese are provisional findings only and no conclusion can be drawn at this stage that there has been a breach of competition law. We will carefully consider any representations before deciding whether the law has been broken.\u201d The 1998 Competition Act prohibits \u201cagreements, practices and conduct that may have a damaging effect on competition\u201d in the UK and covers \u201canti-competitive agreements, decisions by associations and concerted practices between businesses which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK and which may affect trade within the UK\u201d. Any business found to have infringed that section of the legislation can be fined up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover, the CMA said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Government borrowing was higher than expected at \u00a312.6bn in November as the growth in income tax receipts slowed on the previous month. Official figures showed that income tax receipts increased by only 1.1%, after several years of consistent 3%-plus growth, to prevent the UK\u2019s budget deficit falling at the pace forecast by City analysts. Economists polled by Reuters had expected borrowing of only \u00a312.1bn. But the November borrowing figure was lower than last year\u2019s \u00a313.2bn and put the Treasury on course to meet the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s revised target for borrowing by the end of the year. The OBR said in March it expected the budget deficit - the gap between government spending and tax income - to fall to \u00a355bn, or more than 20% on the previous year. But in the autumn statement it revised the figure to say the fall would be more like 10%, to \u00a368bn. The OBR made the revision to take account of the Brexit vote shock, which slowed economic growth and reduced the government\u2019s income. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the modest improvement on last year was \u201creassuring for the chancellor\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is welcome for Hammond as it would have been somewhat embarrassing if the first set of public finance figures after the November autumn statement had immediately put question marks over his new fiscal targets,\u201d he said. The Office for National Statistics said that excluding the publicly owned banks, figures for the financial year to date \u2013 April to November \u2013 showed the deficit fell by \u00a37.7bn to \u00a359.5bn, compared with the same eight months in 2015. A bigger interest bill on the government\u2019s debts was another burden on the exchequer, but was offset by lower public investment, which limited the outflow of funds from Whitehall. VAT receipts were up 4.4% year-on-year in November and corporation tax receipts were up 22.9% year-on-year, showing that economic activity remained robust. A spokesman for the Treasury said: \u201cThe government has made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, but our debt and deficit remain too high. \u201cThat is why the chancellor set out new fiscal rules to return the budget to balance, while creating the space to support the economy and raise productivity through a new \u00a323bn national productivity investment fund.\u201d Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cLooking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been on a slight upward trend since May \u2013 adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cMeanwhile, an acceleration in annual VAT receipts growth from 3.7% to 4.4% reinforces the recent surveys that imply that consumer spending has been fairly strong at the start of the festive season. \u201cAccordingly, we think borrowing should come in close to the OBR\u2019s current \u00a368bn forecast for the 2016-17 fiscal year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) from June 2006 to May 2009 On 27 November 2016 Michael Gove MP sent me a tweet saying that I had been \u201cconsistently mugged by reality\u201d. I don\u2019t think so. It is true that the data post the 23 June vote have perhaps been a little better than I had feared. In large part that was because the Bank of England acted, cutting rates and restarting the asset purchase programme. Also it takes a while for bad news to have a measured impact in the published data. Business confidence is low and there is evidence that optimism is falling among businesses and consumers. My suspicion is that the news is not going to get better. The consumer has held up pretty well and still seems to be spending and GDP growth at 0.5% is not to be sneezed at. But the fall in the pound and the steady rise in inflation because of the rise in import prices was always going to have an impact. Businesses continue to report that they are becoming reluctant to spend. Business investment is down 1.6% on a year earlier. Inflation hit a two-year high. The price paid by manufacturers for fuel and materials was up 12.9% on the year which suggests there are more price rises in the pipeline. I was struck by the news from two firms this last week that may be instructive. First Smiffys, the fancy dress maker, located in Lincolnshire decided to move to Amsterdam because of the uncertainties over Brexit. Second Rivington Biscuits, the maker of Pink Panther wafers, went into administration, blaming the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote. The company, based in Wigan, which voted to leave the EU by nearly 64% said it will cut 99 of its 123 staff, as a result. The hope is that this will not turn into a flood. The labour market does seem to have started to turn down and employers seem to have become more nervous about hiring. In the latest data release employment was down; unemployment was up; the claimant count was up; the number who were in part-time jobs but wanted full-time jobs was up. Plus there was a big fall in the number of full-time jobs. To this point wage growth has held up but shows no likelihood of getting anywhere near the 3.75% wage growth the MPC has predicted would soon happen at every one of its forecasts over the past three years. It never has and won\u2019t. Rising inflation will lower real wage growth. Despite the recent rise due to low inflation real wages are still 7% lower than they were at the start of the recession. Reality hurts, Michael. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The pattern of recent economic indicators suggests that the UK economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter at a similar rate to the third quarter, when GDP rose by 0.5%. Indicators of consumer spending remain strong, with retail sales up 6.5% in volume terms in October and November compared with a year ago. Internet sales are particularly buoyant, up by around 25% in value terms on a year ago. Meanwhile, the services sector PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 index) hit a 10-month high in November. Private sector services account for over 60% of UK GDP \u2013 so this is a very positive indicator for the economy as a whole. But if we dig down further into the economic data, there is a much more mixed picture. Employment has levelled out after a period of strong growth. Full-time employment has dropped back slightly while part-time jobs are still increasing. Business investment is about 1.5% down on a year ago so far this year. In the previous five years, business capital spending had grown by around 5% a year, so this is a big shift. Near-zero inflation has provided a powerful boost to consumer spending over the past couple of years, widening the positive gap between wage growth and price increases. That gap is now narrowing, with inflation up to 1.2%, and set to rise further in the new year as the impact of a weak pound comes through the prices pipeline. Inflation close to 3% at the end of 2017 is still on the cards. All this is still consistent with slower growth next year \u2013 driven by weaker investment and employment and a squeeze on consumer spending because of rising inflation. We should not be surprised that it is taking time for these economic effects to feed through after the Brexit vote in June, which is still less than six months ago. The extent of the UK slowdown next year will not just depend on what happens domestically, however. It also hinges on broader global prospects. Our economy is very open to international trade and the UK\u2019s two biggest overseas markets are the rest of the EU and the US, which together account for nearly two-thirds of exports. Growth in the rest of the EU has been improving in recent years, and European unemployment continues to fall. Meanwhile, the US is forecast to be the strongest growing G7 economy next year, and could be boosted by fiscal stimulus from the incoming Trump administration. Current forecasts suggest that Europe and the US will continue to grow reasonably well in 2017, which will help temper the UK slowdown. Next year may not be so bad for the UK after all, but we will need a reasonably healthy global economy to keep us moving forward.",

First Smiffys, the fancy dress maker, located in Lincolnshire <a href=\"http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/gainsborough-fancy-dress-firm-smiffy-s-moving-base-to-holland/story-29814816-detail/story.html\">decided to move to Amsterdam because of the uncertainties over Brexit</a>. Second Rivington Biscuits, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/15/pink-panther-wafer-rivington-brexit-biscuits-administration\">the maker of Pink Panther wafers, went into administration</a>, blaming the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote. The company, based in Wigan, which voted to leave the EU by nearly 64% said it will cut 99 of its 123 staff, as a result. The hope is that this will not turn into a flood.<br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/uk-jobs-market-ons-figures-brexit-employers-wait-and-see\">The labour market does seem to have started to turn down</a> and employers seem to have become more nervous about hiring. In the latest data release employment was down; unemployment was up; the claimant count was up; the number who were in part-time jobs but wanted full-time jobs was up. Plus there was a big fall in the number of full-time jobs. To this point wage growth has held up but shows no likelihood of getting anywhere near the 3.75% wage growth the MPC has predicted would soon happen at every one of its forecasts over the past three years. It never has and won\u2019t.</p> <p>Rising inflation will lower real wage growth. Despite the recent rise due to low inflation real wages are still 7% lower than they were at the start of the recession. Reality hurts, Michael. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/21/brexit-economy-referendum-inflation-uk-2017\">The Brexit economy: impact of vote is finally beginning to bite</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Andrew Sentance</strong></h2> <p><strong>Senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011</strong></p> <p>The pattern of recent economic indicators suggests that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/uk-economy-service-sector-smashes-forecasts\">the UK economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter at a similar rate to the third quarter</a>, when GDP rose by 0.5%. Indicators of consumer spending remain strong, with retail sales up 6.5% in volume terms in October and November compared with a year ago. Internet sales are particularly buoyant, up by around 25% in value terms on a year ago.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the services sector PMI (purchasing managers\u2019 index) hit a 10-month high in November. Private sector services account for over 60% of UK GDP \u2013 so this is a very positive indicator for the economy as a whole.</p> <p>But if we dig down further into the economic data, there is a much more mixed picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-rate-pay-growth-jobless-ons\">Employment has levelled out after a period of strong growth</a>. Full-time employment has dropped back slightly while part-time jobs are still increasing. Business investment is about 1.5% down on a year ago so far this year. In the previous five years, business capital spending had grown by around 5% a year, so this is a big shift.</p> <p>Near-zero inflation has provided a powerful boost to consumer spending over the past couple of years, widening the positive gap between wage growth and price increases. That gap is now narrowing, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/uk-inflation-november-petrol-clothing-ons\">inflation up to 1.2%</a>, and set to rise further in the new year as the impact of a weak pound comes through the prices pipeline. Inflation close to 3% at the end of 2017 is still on the cards.</p> <p>All this is still consistent with slower growth next year \u2013 driven by weaker investment and employment and a squeeze on consumer spending because of rising inflation. We should not be surprised that it is taking time for these economic effects to feed through after the Brexit vote in June, which is still less than six months ago.</p> <p>The extent of the UK slowdown next year will not just depend on what happens domestically, however. It also hinges on broader global prospects. Our economy is very open to international trade and the UK\u2019s two biggest overseas markets are the rest of the EU and the US, which together account for nearly two-thirds of exports. Growth in the rest of the EU has been improving in recent years, and European unemployment continues to fall. Meanwhile, the US is forecast to be the strongest growing G7 economy next year, and could be boosted by fiscal stimulus from the incoming Trump administration.</p> <p>Current forecasts suggest that Europe and the US will continue to grow reasonably well in 2017, which will help temper the UK slowdown. Next year may not be so bad for the UK after all, but we will need a reasonably healthy global economy to keep us moving forward. </p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU is finally feeding through to the UK economy, according to a Guardian analysis that shows rising inflation is offsetting brisk trade for businesses. Buoyant consumer spending, a low unemployment rate, rising house prices and continued growth for the country\u2019s dominant services sector point to a strong finish to the year, defying earlier forecasts from the Bank of England and others that the economy would grind to a standstill. But worries are growing over prospects for 2017 as signs emerge that the Brexit vote\u2019s blow to the pound is stoking inflation and hitting people\u2019s spending power. As the starting date for negotiations over leaving the EU approaches, the pound has come under fresh pressure in recent weeks and been prone to further downward lurches with every political mention of Brexit \u2013 most recently from Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon raising the prospect of a new independence vote for Scotland. To track the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for December shows a better than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were as expected, one was worse and inflation was higher than economists had forecast, fanning fears that household budgets will be squeezed by higher prices next year. Six months on from the vote to leave the EU, the latest batch of figures show wage growth remains solid, headline unemployment remains low, business activity continues to expand and house prices are still rising. The FTSE 100 leading share index is close to an all-time high hit in October and the more domestically focused FTSE midcap index is above its pre-referendum level. But the pace of hiring has slowed, retail sales growth has eased off and inflation is at a two-year high as the weak pound raises the cost of imports to the UK. The public finances were in a worse state than forecast in November and, looking ahead, they are expected to be in deficit for far longer than had been predicted before the referendum. Britain\u2019s trading position improved more than expected in the latest monthly figures but substantial revisions to earlier data show the trade gap with the rest of the world ballooned to a near three-year high in the three months following the referendum. Economists point to several indicators suggesting negative effects of the Brexit vote could be more keenly felt in 2017. Surveys and business investment figures suggest British-based firms are more reluctant to spend. Consumers have become more cautious and they expect inflation to quicken over the coming year. Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, David Blanchflower, said some of the data since the Brexit vote had come in better than he had feared but that there were signs this could be as good as it gets for the economy. \u201cBusiness confidence is low and there is evidence that optimism is falling among businesses and consumers. My suspicion is that the news is not going to get better,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. \u201cThe consumer has held up pretty well and still seems to be spending and GDP growth at 0.5% is not to be sneezed at. But the fall in the pound and the steady rise in inflation because of the rise in import prices was always going to have an impact,\u201d he added. A report from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents on Wednesday flagged the impact of higher import prices on inflation. But the agents \u2013 the Bank\u2019s eyes and ears on the ground \u2013 noted silver linings from the weaker pound. Tourist spending was rising and exports had also been helped by the currency\u2019s fall, which makes UK goods more competitive overseas. Since the last dashboard, the government\u2019s independent forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have published a new outlook for the the economy. They predict weaker business spending and a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation will dent the economy next year, but warnings for a post-referendum recession should prove unfounded. Publishing its forecasts alongside Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn statement of tax and spending measures, the OBR said the economy would likely expand by just 1.4% in 2017, compared with the 2.2% it had predicted before the referendum. Hammond, was quick to point out that even that lower growth would still leave Britain outperforming France and Italy next year and possibly Germany too. Andrew Sentance, also a former member of the MPC, said the signs of weaker investment and employment and a squeeze on consumer spending pointed to slower growth for the UK economy next year. But much depended on the country\u2019s key trading partners, the rest of the EU and the US, Sentance wrote in the Guardian. \u201cCurrent forecasts suggest that Europe and the US will continue to grow reasonably well in 2017, which will help temper the UK slowdown. Next year may not be so bad for the UK after all, but we will need a reasonably healthy global economy to keep us moving forward.\u201d Experts have warned that the potential Brexit blow to the economy, coupled with the government\u2019s continued push to bring down spending will leave many households struggling with lower incomes next year. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has warned that the UK is suffering its \u201cfirst lost decade since the 1860s\u201d and highlighted a squeeze on household budgets that predates the referendum. Respected thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said workers in Britain face the longest squeeze on their pay for 70 years. This week, the Resolution Foundation thinktank warned the UK faces the risk next year of a return to the squeeze in real pay suffered earlier in the decade. It said 2015-16 had been the fastest year of real wage growth since 2001 but said the combination of low inflation and strongly rising employment would not be repeated. For the housing market, forecasters expect a slowdown next year. A longstanding shortage of homes will mean prices keep rising but at a much more modest pace of 3%, predicts the the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Property firm Savills has suggested that prices will remain flat across the UK. The UK\u2019s largest building society, Nationwide, expects the UK average price to increase by 2% over the year, below the rate of growth it has reported in 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce sold equipment to Iran for decades, a confidential company memo reveals, exploiting a series of loopholes in US sanctions to avoid breaking the law. The Iranian government amassed the world\u2019s largest collection of the British engineering group\u2019s signature turbine and booked millions of pounds of orders each year, according to a briefing drafted in 2009 for the company\u2019s then chief executive, Sir John Rose. Trading in Iran appears to have carried on despite the enormous political risk of being seen to avoid US sanctions. A quarter of Rolls-Royce\u2019s entire \u00a314bn revenue is generated in the US, with much of that reliant on military contracts. The company signed orders worth $224m (\u00a3181m) from the Department of Defense in the first half of 2015 alone. The company appears never to have issued a statement on its decades-long Iranian operation. The only mentions of Iran on Rolls-Royce\u2019s website date from after the softening of US sanctions earlier this year. Zafar Khan, an aerospace and defence analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said he had never heard of Rolls-Royce trading with Iran. \u201cI am little bit surprised, given that it\u2019s under sanction and these guys have a pretty big exposure to the US both on the commercial [aerospace] side as well as defence,\u201d he said. Relations between Iran and the west deteriorated dramatically throughout the 2000s amid concerns the country was trying to develop a nuclear weapons programme, with the UN security council approving fresh sanctions on Iran in 2006. US sanctions were first imposed after the Iranian revolution in 1979. In 1995, the then US president, Bill Clinton, signed into law tough measures specifically banning companies from dealing with Iran\u2019s energy sector. A joint investigation by the Guardian and BBC Panorama has documented Rolls-Royce\u2019s widespread use of middlemen \u2013 commercial advisers or agents in industry parlance \u2013 in an effort to secure high-value contracts around the world. The company has been under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations it paid bribes through intermediaries since 2012. Rolls-Royce said it was fully cooperating with investigations into the allegations and could not comment in detail. Earlier this year, Australia\u2019s Fairfax Media published an investigation into the oil and gas services firm Unaoil after a leak of the company\u2019s emails. Police subsequently raided the firm\u2019s headquarters in Monaco as part of an investigation into \u201ca vast, international corruption scandal implicating numerous foreign oil industry firms\u201d, according to a statement released by the Mon\u00e9gasque government. Unaoil, which has denied carrying out corrupt practices on behalf of Rolls-Royce or any other company, is fighting a court case against the SFO over the legality of the Monaco raid. In 2008, Unaoil was provisionally appointed Rolls-Royce\u2019s Iranian agent after lobbying to replace an existing firm. However, the engineering company\u2019s new head of energy was \u201cconcerned with the exposure to Iran\u201d and \u201cwanted to get the OK from Sir John Rose to proceed\u201d, according to a Unaoil memo seen by the Guardian. A seven-page briefing was subsequently drafted for Rose to aid his decision. The document, which was shared with Unaoil by a senior Rolls-Royce executive, details the enormous success Rolls-Royce enjoyed in the country despite what the author described as \u201cthe poor investment climate\u201d. The document highlights the scale of sales of the company\u2019s signature Avon generator turbine \u2013 which can be used for a number of tasks. \u201cIran is the location of the largest fleet of industrial Avon packages in any country,\u201d said one paragraph. \u201cThe R-R Industrial Avon is the Iranian equipment of choice, but export controls and the political environment have resulted in an inability to trade complete new packages.\u201d Between 1975 and 1995, state-owned oil and gas firms in Iran procured almost 100 Rolls-Royce industrial turbines, according to the memo. By 2009, 69 Avon turbines had been acquired by the National Iranian Oil Company. However, after sanctions were toughened in 1995 the company decided it would no longer sell complete turbines to Iran. Instead, it would supply spare parts and assistance to maintain the operation of the existing Iranian turbines. \u201cThe USA &amp; the UK have strict export controls, that effectively stop R-R Energy from supplying new OEM [original equipment manufacturer] equipment but allow the supply of non USA source parts to support installed equipment,\u201d the document explained. \u201cEvery part shipped to Iran is \u2018rated\u2019 by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), and if required, the appropriate export licence is obtained. Technology requiring a licence is not supplied.\u201d The company generated \u00a369m of orders in the country between 2001 and 2009, according to the briefing, and also signed a \u201ctechnical assistance agreement\u201d to support a facility that carried out repairs and overhauls on about 10 turbines each year. Rolls-Royce adopted several measures that distanced its substantial American division from the Iran trades. Components destined for Iran were manufactured outside the US. Payments were made only in sterling and euros, rather than dollars. \u201cRRPE [Rolls-Royce Power Engineering] is compliant with all UK &amp; US export controls and does not have any US management. Standard practice within RRPE, for all exports of parts, is not to engage US management in the details,\u201d the briefing states. \u201cThis ensures compliance with the Iran Transactions Regulations, administered by the US Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\u201d The document also claimed \u201cRRPE do not have any US employees\u201d. By September 2009, Rose had decided to withdraw. According to an email between senior Unaoil staff, the company had \u201creceived feedback [...] that Sir John Rose has decided that RR will stop doing business in Iran. He feels the financial benefit of Iranian business is far outweighed by the potential risk to RR of there [sic] US customer base reacting to dealing with a company that support Iran.\u201d The email adds: \u201cThey agree there is nothing illegal in what they do, but he is concerned about a political reaction. RR\u2019s largest customer is the US defence industry.\u201d Rolls-Royce disputed that any aspect of its supply of equipment to Iran had been secret but declined to comment on the record as to what information it provided to US government officials or shareholders. A spokesperson said: \u201cRolls-Royce refutes any accusation that it has traded \u2018in secret\u2019 in Iran or that it circumvented US sanctions. \u201cWe work with regulators in the UK, US and elsewhere to ensure that we understand and comply with sanctions regimes. We have consistently taken extensive steps to ensure compliance with Iran-related sanctions.\u201d Rose did not respond to requests for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2016. An earlier version referred to the specific inclusion of the National Iranian Oil Company on the US sanctions list. To clarify: that happened in 2012, after Rolls-Royce had stopped working with the company. \u2022 If you would like to pass on any confidential information, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here and here).",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays are among banks hit with SFr99m (\u00a378m) of fines by the Swiss competition regulator for operating four separate cartels, as the international fallout from the Libor rate-rigging scandal spreads. The two British lenders were hit with a combined \u00a337m in fines, while HSBC, Lloyds and City of London brokers Icap, Tullett Prebon and RP Martin all remain under investigation by Switzerland\u2019s competition commission, Comco. Barclays was fined \u00a323.5m by Comco for colluding to influence interest rate derivatives by manipulating Euribor, used for euro loans between banks. The British lender was found to have participated in cartel behaviour over 32 months, while RBS was fined \u00a39.7m for eight months of participation. Proceedings against a slew of other banks including HSBC are ongoing, while Deutsche Bank received immunity for blowing the whistle on the cartel. \u201cThe cartel aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for interest rate derivatives in euro,\u201d said Comco. \u201cTraders of different banks occasionally discussed their bank\u2019s submissions for the calculation of the Euribor as well as their trading and pricing strategies.\u201d The probe also saw France\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale fined \u00a32.6m, while proceedings remain open against JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Rabobank. RBS was granted immunity in a separate probe into collusion with JP Morgan to influence the Swiss franc version of the Libor interest rate, after it told regulators of the activity. Comco fined JP Morgan \u00a327m after concluding that the two banks had operated a \u201cbilateral cartel\u201d between March 2008 and July 2009, with the aim of influencing the benchmark rate. RBS received full immunity for revealing the existence of the cartel to Comco, while JP Morgan had its fine reduced after cooperating with the regulator\u2019s inquiries. A third probe into yen Libor rates saw the regulator hand out \u00a311.3m of fines, including a \u00a33m penalty for RBS, for manipulation that took place between 2007 and 2010. The proceedings continue against banks including HSBC and Lloyds, while Icap, RP Martin and Tullett Prebon were also named as being subject to ongoing scrutiny, along with Rabobank and UBS. A final probe into the spread on Swiss franc interest rate derivatives resulted in \u00a34.25m of fines, including just \u00a3670,000 for RBS, after its penalty was reduced for cooperation with the regulator. The scale of the Swiss regulator\u2019s penalties pale in comparison to those dished out by European competition authorities earlier this month. Three major banks \u2013 including HSBC \u2013 were fined \u20ac485m (\u00a3412m) for colluding to manipulate the crucial Euribor benchmark rate, after a five-year investigation. The trio had chosen not to take part in an earlier settlement that included RBS and Barclays. The rate-rigging scandal has seen banks hit with hundreds of millions of pounds in fines from a variety of regulators, while bankers from Barclays and UBS have been jailed.",

      "bodyText": "Sales of Grandma\u2019s favourite Christmas tipple, sherry, have slumped in the past decade. Sherry and port have been losing out to more fashionable drinks such as sparkling wine and gin, both of which have seen booming sales this year. Sales of sherry fell to 10m bottles last year in the UK, less than half the 22m sold in 2005, and the pace of decline has stepped up in the past year, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA). Sales of fortified wine, which also includes port, vermouth and madeira, fell by 5% in the year to 5 November, to 315 hectolitres, and the pace of decline rose to 7% in the last three months of that period. Sales of fortified wine in restaurants and bars was also down in the three months to October, by 4% year on year, a turnaround from growth seen earlier in the year. Fine sherries, such as the drier fino and manzanilla styles popular in Spain, have seen strong growth in recent years, boosted by a trend for sherry bars and tapas. Sainsbury\u2019s said its sales of premium sherries were up 14% year on year. But sales of traditional cream sherries, which far outsell the other types \u2013 particularly at Christmas \u2013 have ebbed. A spokesman for market researcher Wine Intelligence said sherry sales were down as \u201cthe generation raised on cream sherry is growing smaller and fortified wines are relegated to bottom shelves hidden from view\u201d. Its research shows that just 10% of 25- to 34-year-olds drink sherry compared with 34% of over-65s. The WSTA blames falling sales on increasing taxation. It says that since 2007, fortified wine duty has increased by 53%, adding \u00a31 to a bottle of port or sherry. The industry is likely to come under further pressure from the fall in the value of the pound, which makes importing wine from Europe more expensive. Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, called on the government to cut back taxes on fortified wine: \u201cWhether it\u2019s the sherry shared as an aperitif or left out for Santa, a port to accompany the cheese course at the end of Christmas lunch or vermouth shaken or stirred in a classic martini \u2013 these drinks have been enjoyed by the British for centuries. It would be incredibly sad to see the British traditions associated with these drinks, which have been passed down through the generations, disappear.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK faces the risk next year of a return to the squeeze in real pay suffered earlier in the decade as higher prices and a stalling of jobs growth puts living standards under pressure, a thinktank has warned. The Resolution Foundation \u2013 which concentrates on the living standards of those on low to middle incomes \u2013 said 2015-16 had been the fastest year of real wage growth since 2001 but said the combination of low inflation and strongly rising employment would not be repeated. Torsten Bell, the foundation\u2019s director, said 2016 was \u201cgetting a bad press\u201d but added: \u201cWe may well come to look back at 2016 with fond nostalgia \u2013 not least given what 2017 looks set to have to offer. The issue is not that last year was awful, more that it risks being as good as it gets.\u201d The foundation\u2019s analysis of official ONS data shows that the 3% increase in non-pensioner household incomes in 2015-16 was evenly shared, with all parts of the income distribution seeing growth of over 2%. Bell said 2014-15 had also been a strong year for real income growth. \u201cVery rapid employment growth coupled with near zero inflation created a solid living standards recovery over the past few years, with the added bonus for low earners of the national living wage more recently.\u201d He added that the strong recent performance had to be set against the unprecedented squeeze on real incomes during the deep recession of 2008-09 and the years that followed. However, Bell said neither of the two factors that had caused living standards to rise over the past two years would be repeated in 2017. Employment growth had slowed to a trickle in recent months as the labour market entered a holding pattern in the spring. \u201cThe good news is that employment remains close to record highs at over 75% and firms are by and large not planning on shrinking their workforces,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThe bad news is that without further employment growth in 2017 one of the big boosts to household incomes of recent years (more people working and earning) will weaken. That leaves other determinants of income growth to pick up the slack. Unfortunately they look set to do the opposite.\u201d Bell said ultra-low inflation had been the other factor boosting living standards but that prices were now starting to rise rapidly, with the result that the UK was \u201con course for fast, significant and repeated falls in real earnings growth early in the new year. \u201cThis earnings freefall means we expect wage growth to fall to around 1% in the three months to January \u2013 the slowest real wage rises in over two years. With inflation forecast to continue rising we project real earnings growth hovering around, or even below, zero for the second half of the year. A return to the pay squeeze we thought we had left behind in 2014 is a real risk.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK house price growth will slow in 2017 but the legacy of insufficient housebuilding will mean that demand will outstrip supply and lead to a 3% rise over the year, surveyors have predicted. Although the most bullish housing market forecast for the new year released so far, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said it expected growth to be about half that in 2016. A year ago, it predicted price rises of 6% and official figures are on track to meet that, with October\u2019s annual growth rate at 6.9%. Rics said it expected supply issues to continue to drive prices upwards over the next 12 months. \u201cFollowing on from the 2016 forecast, the supply pipeline or lack of it is at the forefront of the analysis and dominates the residential market,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile there is an improvement, the legacy of building on an insufficient scale has left the average inventory on estate agents\u2019 books close to a historic low.\u201d Since June\u2019s referendum, Rics members around the UK have reported a fall in the number of homes coming on to the market, while would-be buyers have continued to register their interest. This has been backed up by figures from mortgage lenders, which showed a 20% fall in the number of loans to home movers in October. Rics said the number of sales was set to fall slightly from 2016\u2019s figure, from about 1.25m to between 1.15m and 1.2m, reflecting a downwards trend over recent months. The organisation said it expected East Anglia to have price rises above the national average, alongside the north-west of England and the West Midlands. Separate figures from the property website Zoopla showed that the east of England had seen prices rise by 12% in 2016, with the Norfolk town of Diss recording the biggest increase over the year. The West Midlands was the second-placed in its rankings, with growth of almost 9%. Prices in central London look set to stabilise after recent falls, Rics said, with the weak pound encouraging foreign buyers into the market. Meanwhile, across the UK rents are forecast to increase by between 2% and 3% and Rics said that they could rise more quickly than house prices over the next five years. In London, it said growth would be more modest in 2017, predicting rents could flatline or rise by up to 1% over the year. The Rics chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said: \u201cAlthough recent announcements by the government on housing are very welcome, the ongoing shortfall of stock across much of the sales and lettings markets is set to continue to underpin prices and rents. As a result, the affordability challenge will remain very much to the fore for many. \u201cMeanwhile, the lack of existing inventory in the market is impacting the ability of households to move and will contribute toward transaction activity over the whole of 2017 being a little lower that in the year just ending.\u201d Many of the biggest players in the property industry have now published their forecasts for 2017. Property firm Savills has suggested that prices will remain flat across the UK, and fall in the north of England, Wales and Scotland. In the east of England it expects 2.5% growth. On Monday, the UK\u2019s largest building society, Nationwide, said it expected the UK average price to increase by 2% over the year, below the rate of growth it has reported in 2016. It had forecast growth between 4% and 6% this year, and at the end of November said year-on-year growth had slowed to 4.4%. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cLike most forecasters, including the Bank of England, we expect the UK economy to slow modestly next year, which is likely to result in less robust labour market conditions and modestly slower house price growth. \u201cBut we continue to think a small gain (around 2%) is more likely than a decline over 2017 as a whole, since low interest rates are expected to help underpin demand while a shortage of homes on the market will continue to provide support for house prices.\u201d The government is due to publish its long-awaited housing white paper in January, which will address the shortfall in supply in all types of homes, including rental properties and social housing. The Rics head of policy, Jeremy Blackburn, said this would be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d. He said: \u201cWhilst the system based on large, private housing developers and homes for owner occupation has increased house building, it\u2019s not delivering. The UK needs a coordinated strategy for building across tenures, using all of the delivery and technology mechanisms at our disposal.\u201d Gardner said: \u201cThe major housebuilders appear to have capacity to expand output, with most reporting land banks that could support around five years\u2019 worth of construction at current rates of building activity. However, there is a risk that the uncertain economic outlook may weigh on activity in the period ahead.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Adani\u2019s coal infrastructure should not be given money from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund since it does not meet at least two of the mandatory criteria, according to analysis by Greenpeace. In addition, despite the NAIF granting \u201cconditional approval\u201d for $1bn of commonwealth financing for a rail link between Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine and its Abbot Point coal terminal and insisting it is \u201cready and able to make decisions\u201d about funding, the NAIF has told Greenpeace it had not yet finalised its policies and guidelines for considering the funding criteria. The Carmichael mine would be Australia\u2019s largest coalmine and among the largest in the world. For it to receive funding from the NAIF, it must meet seven \u201cmandatory eligibility criteria\u201d. According to a Greenpeace analysis, two of those criteria are not met by the project. One of those criteria is that the project must \u201cbe of public benefit\u201d. In terms of jobs, Adani\u2019s consultants have said the project would produce fewer than 1,500 full-time jobs. Greenpeace said the $1bn in financing amounted to paying $683,000 for each of those jobs. It is unclear exactly where that money would flow. Recent revelations show Adani has set up a complex network of companies and trusts, which are located in the Cayman Islands tax haven, which would minimise its tax burden and could make it harder to gain compensation in the case of an environmental disaster. \u201cThe prospects for any financial return from this project reaching the public coffers is further reduced by the fact that the Newman government promised the Carmichael mine a \u2018royalty holiday\u2019,\u201d the Greenpeace report notes. \u201cIt is unclear whether this commitment has been maintained by the current Queensland government.\u201d In addition, Greenpeace points out there are considerable costs to the public. The associated port expansion would result in dredging inside the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area; coalmining and transportation will impact on the health of nearby populations; the mining would use billions of litres of local groundwater each year; and the cost of mine rehabilitation is at risk of being left to the public purse. Greenpeace also argues the project might not meet a second mandatory criteria \u2013 that it will be able to repay the loan. It refers to modelling suggesting the mine would run at a loss, even with a high coal price. Greenpeace argues that given recent comments by Adani spokesman Ron Watson saying the financing was not critical, the project could fail a third criteria \u2013 that \u201cthe project is unlikely to proceed, or only at a much later date, or with limited scope, without NAIF financial assistance\u201d. \u201cBuilding the Carmichael coalmine is in itself a ludicrous proposition, let alone lending the company a billion dollars of taxpayer\u2019s money that we may never get back,\u201d Greenpeace campaigner Jonathan Moylan said. \u201cOur investigation shows the public how important it is to stop Carmichael right now, before we wreck a valuable part of Queensland.\u201d NAIF told Greenpeace in an email, seen by Guardian Australia, that it had not yet finalised its policies and guidelines, outlining how it would interpret the mandatory eligibility criteria, including the one related to public benefit. The Greenpeace report notes that five of the seven NAIF board members have what it calls \u201cstrong ties\u201d to the mining industry. Some have served on boards of mining companies while others have clients in the mining industry. \u201cThe Turnbull government has emphasised that the NAIF board is an \u2018independent\u2019 body,\u201d the report said. \u201cWhile the board may be independent from government, they have clear ties to the mining industry.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "There are two ways to look at Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s \u00a31.9bn purchase of the MBNA credit card book from Bank of America. The first is to applaud Lloyds\u2019 escape from the hell of restructuring and provisioning. The bank hadn\u2019t made an acquisition since the miserable crisis-era grab of HBOS, the deal that came with a state-sponsored bailout. Now its board can buy assets again, rather than obsess about detoxifying the balance sheet. This cheerful interpretation is not to be sniffed at. Lloyds has taken \u00a317bn in provisions for mis-sold payment protection insurance since 2011, sold most of its operations outside the UK, demerged TSB and cut costs. The exercise has been a success and the contrast with Royal Bank of Scotland is stark. The Treasury\u2019s stake in Lloyds has been cut to 7%, and could be zero within six months. At RBS, the state is stuck at 73%. Yet Lloyds\u2019 MBNA purchase should also provoke groans. It does nothing to promote competition in an industry that already looks too concentrated. Regulators tend not to fret about credit cards, a corner of the market in which customers genuinely shop around, but this deal will make Lloyds, the biggest banking beast in the land, even bigger. Biodiversity will be marginally reduced. Look at the shares Lloyds enjoys already: 25% in current accounts; 21% in mortgages; 22% in retail deposits; 19% in lending to small and medium-sized businesses; and 17%, and rising, in car loans. Credit cards were an outlier, relatively speaking, in that Lloyds\u2019 share was 15%. The MBNA purchase, however, will take the figure to 26%. Is this healthy? From Lloyds\u2019 point of view, the purchase is clearly beneficial. There are risks attached to buying a slug of unsecured UK consumer credit ahead of next year\u2019s likely squeeze on real incomes, but Lloyds can afford to take a punt others could not. The MBNA operation in the UK made post-tax profits of \u00a3250m last year and Lloyds can find \u00a3100m in savings (or \u00a380m after tax) by combining overheads. That is why it can forecast a 17% return on investment in the second year of ownership. That potential juicy prize is quite enough to justify the risk of a rise in defaults. Lloyds\u2019 shares improved 2%. But the lack of competition should concern us all. Lloyds won the auction for MBNA, one suspects, through sheer size. No other bank or private equity player could make the same cost savings, and almost none enjoyed the same funding advantages. From a competition perspective, it would have been better if MBNA had entered up with, say, Santander, a bank that causes occasional headaches for the big four lenders. In place of stiffer competition, we have Lloyds\u2019 cheeky promise to make MBNA its \u201cchallenger\u201d brand, the same label it slaps on Halifax in retail banking. It\u2019s a nonsense: when you are a quarter of the market, you are the establishment. Sadly, reform is hard to imagine. The woes of RBS have destroyed any political appetite for a structural shakeup of retail banking to promote greater competition. The disgracefully timid report from the Competition &amp; Markets Authority in the summer provided an excuse for inaction. One of these years, though, Lloyds\u2019 dominance will come to be seen as a real problem. Blood from BHS pension deficit not only on Green\u2019s hands Make no mistake: Sir Philip Green remains responsible for the deficit in the BHS pension funds, which stood at \u00a3571m at the last count. If a man with a supposedly keen eye for detail had addressed the deficit in his early years of ownership of BHS, when a relatively small increase in contributions could have made a meaningful difference, he would not now be the most despised business figure in the land. But it also true that Green\u2019s failure to take responsibility did not happen in a vacuum. The system of pensions regulation failed. In 2012, the BHS pension trustees inexplicably signed off an arrangement whereby the company would take a leisurely 23 years to close a deficit that then stood at \u00a3200m. The Pensions Regulator should have screamed foul. Instead, it woke up only when BHS was close to death. Frank Field\u2019s work and pensions select committee is therefore right to call for the Pensions Regulator to be reformed to become \u201ca nimbler, more proactive\u201d organisation that intervenes sooner when deficits appear. Recovery plans of more than 10 years should be \u201cexceptional\u201d. Quite right. And it is vital that the regulator should have powers to block takeovers when pension deficits are large. If such a rule had been in place, Green would surely not have been allowed to sell BHS to the thrice-bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Field\u2019s other idea is that Pensions Regulator should be armed with a \u201cnuclear deterrent\u201d in the form of punitive fines. That is more problematic. If the regulator does its job properly and makes fair and timely demands of corporate sponsors, is there really a legal basis for hefty fines on top? Such a system may just complicate legal wrangles, and give future Philip Greens more reasons to deploy delaying tactics. But the rest of the committee\u2019s recommendations hit the mark. The Pensions Regulator needs more powers to intervene earlier \u2013 and it should be told to pull its finger out and use them.",

Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the public accounts committee, said: \u201cI think this is absolutely an issue we need to look at. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been discussing VAT fraud in online retailing informally and I expect that it is something the committee will want to turn to.\u201d The National Audit Office could also be asked to examine the subject, and how well it has been addressed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. In recent years, overseas sellers, particularly from China, have come to dominate many popular goods categories on eBay and Amazon, illegally selling goods without VAT. As a result, many small British businesses have been left unable to compete. Parliament\u2019s public accounts committee has previously played a central role in shining a spotlight on other tax scandals involving the likes of Starbucks, Google and Amazon. Its work has helped trigger international tax reforms as well as generating important evidence for European commission inquiries into alleged sweetheart tax deals for multinational corporations. Now the MPs are expected to turn their attention to the issue of overseas traders committing VAT fraud on an industrial scale through well-known online shopping sites \u2013 a scandal first highlighted by a Guardian investigation last year. HMRC has since admitted VAT evasion in online shopping had become a \u201cvery big issue\u201d, estimating it cost up to \u00a31.5bn a year in lost tax. But officials have been frustrated by what is seen as the uncooperative approach taken by some big websites, including Amazon. In January, Lin Homer, then head of HMRC, told a parliamentary committee: \u201cWe do feel, just as with beer and alcohol, that those people who manage the supply chain should ensure enough diligence is built into it. Marketplace providers [such as Amazon and eBay] have responsibilities.\u201d Two months later, the Treasury announced new powers for HMRC to make large marketplace websites liable \u2013 in some circumstances \u2013 for VAT revenues lost to fraudulent overseas sellers. News of a likely parliamentary inquiry came as the Treasury minister Jane Ellison claimed HRMC\u2019s new measures, which came into force in September, were already proving successful. Latest figures show 7,185 overseas sellers have come forward to register for VAT since January, compared with just 695 in 2015 \u2013 a rush, she said, in anticipation of tough action from HMRC. But Ellison\u2019s claim that HMRC was now tackling online VAT fraud \u201cin time for Christmas\u201d was greeted with scepticism by Bacon and tax fairness campaigners. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit early to declare HMRC\u2019s actions an unbridled success,\u201d said Bacon, who added the public accounts committee would want to scrutinise such claims closely. Last month, a second Guardian investigation showed widespread evidence of ongoing VAT fraud by sellers on Amazon and eBay \u2013 despite the HMRC\u2019s new powers. HMRC insists action is being taken. \u201cWe are already using new powers granted from September to directly tackle these overseas businesses,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, Amazon and eBay have repeatedly said they cooperate with HMRC where required, but that they are not responsible for policing the VAT compliance of independent sellers. A spokesman for Ellison would not comment on whether HMRC had recovered back taxes and penalties from the influx of overseas traders now belatedly registering for VAT. A spokesperson for campaign group VATfraud.org said: \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good HMRC handed out 7,185 VAT numbers to internet retailers in the last year; it just proves this fraud is enormous. \u201cWhat HMRC failed to say is how much undeclared VAT they have recovered from these retailers.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green may have to pay \u00a31bn to resolve the problems facing the BHS pension scheme under proposals tabled by MPs. The work and pensions committee, which is chaired by Labour MP Frank Field, has called for the government to introduce a \u201cnuclear deterrent\u201d to stop companies or individuals trying to avoid their responsibilities to pension schemes. This deterrent would be a fine from The Pensions Regulator (TPR) worth three times the amount it believes a company or individual should contribute towards filling the deficit in a pension scheme. Given that the regulator is understood to be seeking \u00a3350m from Green for the BHS pensions scheme, this means it could threaten the billionaire tycoon with a charge of about \u00a31bn. The deterrent is part of a package of measures proposed by the parliamentary committee to avoid another BHS scandal. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a \u00a3571m deficit. The regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Dominic Chappell, the former owners of BHS, in an attempt to fill the deficit. They collected millions of pounds from the retailer. Field said: \u201cIt is difficult to imagine [TPR] would still be having to negotiate with Sir Philip Green if he had been facing a bill of \u00a31bn, rather than \u00a3350m. He would have sorted the pension scheme long ago.\u201d As well as threatening punitive fines, the MPs said TPR must become a \u201cnimbler, more proactive regulator\u201d. They said the regulator must consider recovery plans for pension schemes in deficit that last more than 10 years as \u201cexceptional\u201d and that it should approve every major corporate transaction. These powers would have allowed the regulator to block a 23-year plan drawn up by Green for the BHS pension scheme while he owned it in 2012, and stop the sale of the retailer to Chappell, a three-time bankrupt. In addition, the committee wants pension trustees to have the power to negotiate a restructuring of struggling schemes that could result in better outcomes than entering the Pension Protection Fund, where benefits are cut by at least 10%. The PPF, a government-backed lifeboat scheme, is funded by a levy on all defined benefit pension schemes. The MPs say that good corporate behaviour could be rewarded in future by paying less into the PPF. Field added: \u201cThe measures we set out in this report are intended to reduce the chance of another scheme going down the BHS route. We hope and expect that we will never again see a company like BHS be able to come up with a 23-year recovery plan for its pension fund, and certainly not that it would take the regulator two years to really begin to do anything about it. \u201cIt is further inconceivable that Sir Philip Green\u2019s deal to dispose of BHS and its giant pension deficit for \u00a31 to a dismally unqualified man, with no plan for the pension schemes and no means of financing one, would have evaded or passed any mandatory clearance scheme.\u201d Aside from the BHS scandal, the pension problems facing British companies are stark. By the standard measure used by the PPF, 4,272 defined benefit schemes are in deficit and the size of the black hole is \u00a3195bn. There are 5,794 defined benefit pension schemes in the UK. In response to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \u201cThe majority of employers are managing their pension schemes responsibly but a few recent examples have raised some important questions. In the coming months we\u2019ll be publishing a green paper on pension funding and as part of this we\u2019ll be looking at powers of [TPR].\u201d Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of TPR, said: \u201cWe welcome the committee\u2019s report which recognises the importance of robust and proportionate regulation for workplace defined benefit pension schemes and of ensuring that workplace pension savers and the Pension Protection Fund are well-protected. We note its recommendations and will consider them carefully. \u201cWe continue to discuss options with DWP for the legislative and regulatory framework for workplace pensions, and how this might be improved, ahead of the green paper, which will consider the future of pension funding, the regulatory framework and TPR\u2019s powers.\u201d",
