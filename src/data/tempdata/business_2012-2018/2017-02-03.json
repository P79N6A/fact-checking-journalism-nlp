      "bodyText": "Snapchat hopes its planned flotation in New York will value the five-year-old photo-sharing app company at up to $25bn (\u00a320bn) and turn its 26-year-old founder, Evan Spiegel, into the world\u2019s youngest billionaire with a $5.5bn fortune. It is the most eagerly anticipated technology initial public offering (IPO) since Facebook floated in 2012 turning its then 28-year-old founder, Mark Zuckerberg, into the world\u2019s richest man under 30. The similarities between Snap (the official name for the company that owns Snapchat) and Facebook are striking, and have got many financial analysts and advertising experts asking if Snapchat is the new Facebook. How did they start? Zuckerberg and Spiegel hit upon the ideas for their companies at university \u2013 and then dropped out. Zuckerberg, a computer science major, began knocking up a website called Facemash, loosely based on Hot or Not, in his Harvard dorm room. The site evolved intoFacebook but not without a legal challenge from the Winklevoss twins, who sued Zuckerberg claiming he stole their idea. Snapchat was born out of banter between Spiegel and his Stanford fraternity brothers Frank Reginald Brown and Bobby Murphy. In 2011 the trio were discussing sexting and the need for a way to send pictures that disappeared. As with Facebook, the genesis of the idea was disputed, and Brown sued Spiegel and the company. They settled out of court, with Spiegel, who was studying product design, and Murphy, a mathematics and computational science major, remaining majority shareholders with a 22.4% stake each. How many users do they have? Facebook had 900m users as it prepared for its 2012 flotation. Since then the social network has grown to 1.86bn monthly active users \u2013 more than half the world\u2019s population that has access to the internet. About 1.2bn check their Facebook accounts every day. Snapchat has far fewer users, but the company claims they are much more engaged than Facebook\u2019s. Snapchat had 158m daily users at the last count. Two-thirds of them check the app every day \u2013 and the average daily user visits the app 18 times a day, spending an average of 25-30 minutes a day sending snaps and watching snaps from their friends, celebrities and advertising brands. Snapchat is only accessible via mobile phone. Snapchat claims to reach 41% of all 18- to 34-year-olds in the US each day. How much are they worth? Facebook has a market value of $373bn \u2013 more than twice that of IBM. Facebook was valued at $104bn when it floated at $38 a share on the NYSE on 18 May 2012. Today the shares are changing hands at $131. Facebook tried to buy Snapchat several times, and Spiegel has said Zuckerberg tried to force him to sell up. \u201cIt was basically like, \u2018We\u2019re going to crush you\u2019,\u201d Spiegel told Forbes magazine. Spiegel rejected Zuckerberg\u2019s last $3bn takeover in November 2013. Facebook, which also owns Instagram, has since developed versions of 15 of Snapchat\u2019s features. Snap\u2019s IPO filings show the company is planning to float its shares at a level that would value the companyat $20-25bn. How much control do the founders have? Snapchat\u2019s flotation is unusual. The company is not selling any voting shares, so the founders will controversially keep total control of the firm even after raising public money. Facebook has a voting structure that gives the founders far more rights than other shareholders. How much money do they make? Facebook made a profit of $10.2bn in 2016, up 177% on 2015. Its total advertising income was almost $27bn. But Facebook only turned its first profit in 2009. Snap, which is spending a lot of money on expanding its user base, made a net loss of $515m in 2016 \u2013 up on the $373m it lost in 2015. Where does the income come from? Both companies make their money from advertising at the expense of traditional advertising markets such as newspapers and TV. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising company, has said his clients spent $1.7bn advertising on Facebook last year. That compares to $5bn WPP clients spent on Google ads, but is vastly more than the $90m spent on Snapchat. Neil Campling, head of global technology research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, told CNBC: \u201cSnapchat is likely on a faster growth path than either Google or Facebook. Their opportunity is enormous and just beginning.\u201d Snapchat has tried to differentiate itself from Facebook by not allowing adverts targeted directly at users\u2019 interests or browsing history. \u201cI got an ad this morning for something I was thinking about buying yesterday, and it\u2019s really annoying. We care about not being creepy,\u201d Spiegel said in 2015. Facebook\u2019s advertising is sold entirely by computer program. Advertisers can visit ads.facebook.com, plug in payment information and create an advert. Those ads can be targeted as narrowly or broadly as the advertiser desires, and can be billed in a variety of ways, from paying a flat fee for every thousand views to payments per click, per like and more. Where are they based? Facebook\u2019s huge headquarters in Silicon Valley\u2019s Menlo Park has a \u201cgreen roof\u201d the size of seven American football pitches. The company employs more than 17,000 people across the world. It is hiring an extra 500 workers in the UK in advance of the opening of a new HQ in London\u2019s Fitzrovia, where it will have 1,500 full-time staff when it opens. Snap has headquarters on Venice Beach, Los Angeles, where it has been based since it started in Spiegel\u2019s dad\u2019s house. From there, it has slowly eaten up available properties on Venice Beach, turning beachfront condos into offices and restaurants into cafeterias to service its growing army of staff. Last month Snap announced plans to set up its international \u201chub\u201d in the UK. The UK office, which has grown from six to 75 staff in the last year, will not only be the taxable base for Snap\u2019s British revenue, but also for all revenue made in third countries which do not (yet) have their own local establishment.",

      "bodyText": "The Resolution Foundation\u2019s prediction that inequalities are going to grow (UK faces return to inequality of Thatcher years, 1 February) makes gloomy reading. Sadly it is underestimated because it takes no account of cuts in what Barbara Castle, when she was secretary of state at the Department of Health and Social Security 40 years ago, called \u201cthe social wage\u201d. By this she meant \u201cthe publicly provided services which mean so much to family healthcare, education, housing and a good environment\u201d. She estimated that in 1975 the social wage added \u00a320 a week to the average working household. At the time the average full-time weekly wage of a male manual worker was \u00a352 and a female manual worker \u00a331. Every week you have reported cuts not only to health, education and social care but also to parks, museums, libraries, children\u2019s centres, buses and public lavatories. All these services are essential to a caring society and can only be provided collectively. They are part of our social fabric and the more threadbare this becomes the less autonomy children, people with disabilities and older, frail people enjoy. At the same time it becomes harder for their families to support them. Instead of insisting that families should do more (and they already do a great deal \u2013 there are five times as many family and friends caring for older people as there are paid carers), the government should reverse the massive cuts made to local authorities\u2019 budgets and increase the \u201csocial wage\u201d. Hilary Land Emerita professor of family policy, University of Bristol \u2022 So basic income has to be \u201can interesting idea whose time has not yet come\u201d (Editorial, 2 February). Britain is after all a conservative-thinking, backward country, and will be the last in the developed world to try basic income, because it looks expensive and people are lazy. We prefer to hand people a grudging, dead dole on condition that they work no more than 16 hours a week, and spend the rest of their time applying for jobs that simply do not exist. On the other hand, we could transform JSA etc into a useful stimulus to the green sector of the economy, the sector that protects and heals the condition of society and environment. The cost is negligible, and the benefit to society and economy will be significant. It could be done as a pilot in any willing local authority with very little delay. \u201cGreen wage subsidy\u201d (search it) will bring about a smooth transition from the clunking machinery of Beveridge to the calm simplicity of basic income. Dr Richard Lawson Churchill, Somerset \u2022 Your editorial makes some valid points. Yes, there are basic income schemes that would be expensive; and if a basic income were too high then it might disincentivise employment. However, there are also schemes that would not be expensive, and there are schemes that would be more likely to incentivise employment than to disincentivise it. Research for the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex (see An evaluation of a strictly revenue neutral Citizen\u2019s Income scheme, ISER, June 2016) shows that a basic income of \u00a360 a week could be paid for by reducing the income tax personal allowance, increasing the rate of income tax by just 3%, and revising national insurance contribution regulations, and would not need additional public expenditure. The scheme would take a lot of households off means-tested benefits, and every one of those households would experience lower deduction rates on additional earned income, so employment would be incentivised. The scheme would reduce poverty, reduce inequality, and, importantly, would not impose losses on low-income households at the point of implementation, which some other proposed schemes would do. It is the current benefits system that disincentivises employment, because a lot of households experience almost no additional disposable income if they earn more; and it is the current system of in-work benefits that function as a significant subsidy to wages, because tax credits and universal credit go up if wages go down. A basic income would not do that, so it would have less of a subsidy effect. It is of course important to hear differing views on whether basic income is an idea whose time has come: but those views \u2013 and especially those offered by the Guardian \u2013 should be based on the available evidence. Dr Malcolm Torry Director, Citizen\u2019s Income Trust \u2022 Your editorial is overhasty in kicking the universal basic income into the long grass. Can you suggest any alternative that can tackle the discontent in a world where job destruction through technology seems bound to outpace the creation of jobs, many of which will be very low-paid? If not, it would be wise to build on the successful pilots around the world to develop ways to make UBI a reality. Thomas Piketty\u2019s proposal of a wealth tax might be part of the increased revenue stream to which those whose quality of life has not been significantly affected by the 2008 crash, people like me, should contribute.

The scheme would reduce poverty, reduce inequality, and, importantly, would not impose losses on low-income households at the point of implementation, which some other proposed schemes would do.</p> <p>It is the current benefits system that disincentivises employment, because a lot of households experience almost no additional disposable income if they earn more; and it is the current system of in-work benefits that function as a significant subsidy to wages, because tax credits and universal credit go up if wages go down. A basic income would not do that, so it would have less of a subsidy effect.</p> <p>It is of course important to hear differing views on whether basic income is an idea whose time has come: but those views \u2013 and especially those offered by the Guardian \u2013 should be based on the available evidence.<br><strong>Dr Malcolm Torry</strong><br><em>Director, Citizen\u2019s Income Trust</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial is overhasty in kicking the universal basic income into the long grass.

      "bodyText": "Financial shares were boosted by the prospect of Donald Trump rowing back on regulation, while a rise in the oil price after new US sanctions on Iran lifted energy stocks. So markets moved sharply higher, with the FTSE 100 recording its best one day rise so far this year. Even a fall in mining shares as China raised interest rates could not undermine the positive mood. Better than expected US jobs figures also gave some support, pushing Wall Street higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average back through the 20,000 level. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 47.55 points or 0.67% at 7188.30 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.2% to 11,651.49 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.65% at 4825.42 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 1.2% higher at 19,116.04 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.6% at 9462.7 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.94% to 628.92 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.9% at 20,062, above the 20,000 barrier for the first time all week. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. President Trump\u2019s action on financial regulation is imminent it seems: Oil prices are higher as the US unveiled a number of new sanctions on various companies and individuals following a recent missile test. Reuters reports: The United States on Friday sanctioned 13 individuals and 12 entities under its Iran sanctions authority, days after the White House put Tehran \u201con notice\u201d over a ballistic missile test and other activities. In a statement on its website, the U.S. Treasury listed the sanctioned individuals and entities, some of which are based in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and China. The move is the first against Iran since U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The sanctions were similar to actions taken by the Obama administration targeting Iran\u2019s ballistic missile network. The new designations stuck to areas that remain under sanctions even with the 2015 nuclear deal in place, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. \u201cToday\u2019s action is part of Treasury\u2019s ongoing efforts to counterIranian malign activity abroad that is outside the scope of the JCPOA,\u201d Treasury said, a reference to the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Among those sanctioned on Friday were companies, individuals, and brokers the U.S. Treasury said support a trade network run by an Iranian businessman, Abdollah Asgharzadeh. The news has seen Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate climb around 1%. There is a fine line to tread when making changes to Dodd-Franks, said Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group: Reports that Donald Trump is preparing to scale back financial regulations in the US is a boon for multinational \u2018megabanks\u2019 which have seen profits drop since the heady days before the 2008 financial crisis. Shares of Visa, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were all atop the US benchmark. There was observable shareholder glee that an era of ever-expanding regulation could be coming to an end under Donald Trump. Since Dodd Frank was introduced, banks have devoted a lot more capital towards compliance and have had to decrease leverage, both of which are a direct hit to profitability. If Dodd Frank is watered down, that\u2019s a direct boost to the bottom line for banks. The changes to Dodd Frank are likely to be small to begin with but Trump is shifting the direction of travel from more regulation to less regulation. That\u2019s a good thing for the financial sector, and less red tape is good for corporate America as a whole. Trump turning his attention to deregulation could be just the boost Wall Street needs to send the Dow back above the 20,000 mark. Too much regulation favours the large institutions who can afford the extra compliance costs. Unwinding some of Dodd Frank is a good thing because it will enable smaller community banks to compete, offering competition to consumers. Repealing too much of Dodd Frank puts the entire system at risk of a repeat of 2008. The red line is the Volker rule; if the big banks can engage in proprietary trading, then depositors will be put at much greater risk. President Trump is meeting with business leaders and it appears the plans for the financial sector are on the agenda: Unlike the Markit survey, another report on the services sector has come in below expectations, although still showing a strong performance. The ISM non-manufactuing PMI was 56.5 in January, virtually flat on the 56.6 recorded the previous month and slightly below expectations of a figure of 57. Meanwhile factory orders in December rose by 1.3% compared to estimates of a 1% increase, and a 2.3% fall in November. Back with the Dow, and it is clear that the financial sector is on the rise thanks to the idea that Donald Trump will row back on regulation: The first of two surveys of the US service sector has shown a better than expected performance last month. The Markit service sector PMI for January came in at 55.6 compared to an initial estimate of 55.1 and December\u2019s figure of 53.9. This was the highest reading since November 2015. The Markit Composite index, which includes services and manufacturing, was 55.8, up from 54.1 in December. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The US economy has started 2017 on the front foot. Business activity across the economy is growing at the fastest rate for over a year and optimism about the business outlook has risen to the highest for a year and a half. The January surveys signal annualized GDP growth of approximately 2.5%, setting the scene for a solid first quarter. With January seeing the largest inflow of new business for 18 months, there\u2019s good reason to believe that firms will be even busier in coming months. Even more encouraging is the ongoing impressive rate of job creation, with the January PMI numbers comparable to around 200,000 jobs being added. A waning of price pressures takes some heat off the Fed, though the sustained strong output and jobs growth signalled by the surveys will fuel speculation that the next rate hike will be sooner rather than later, with June looking most likely. US markers are on the rise after the better than expected headline jobs figure, with financial companies also benefitting from the prospect of looser regulation if Donald Trump scraps the Dodd-Frank legislation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 96 points or 0.48% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.26% better. The mixed picture from the non-farm figures - positive jobs numbers, weaker than expected wages growth - also saw some volatility in the currency markets as traders tried to work out the implications for US interest rates. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: The dollar initially reacted positively, however, within minutes the dollar index backed off highs as the foreign exchange market took stock of some of the weaker elements of the report. US stock market futures moved higher and are predicting a stronger open for the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq. However, the bond market was less impressed, and US treasury yields fell across the curve, the two-year yield is currently down 5 basis points, which could weigh on the buck further on Friday. We don\u2019t think that today\u2019s non-farm payrolls report, on its own, will be a game changer for the Fed, and the market is still pricing in the prospect of another rate hike from the Fed by mid-year; after all wage growth at 2.5% is still above the Fed\u2019s target inflation rate. However, we will be watching the development of wages, which are a key metric for the Federal Reserve going forward. If they don\u2019t pick up again for February then Federal Reserve rate hike expectations may start to get pushed further out to the second half of 2017, which could limit dollar upside in the medium term. The yield, or interest rate, on US government bonds has fallen since the jobs report came out. Traders are betting that the weak wage growth last month means the Fed is even less likely to raise interest rates in March. Wall Street and City economists broadly agree that today\u2019s US jobs report shows America\u2019s economy remains robust, although the mediocre wage growth is a disappointment. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics: The 227,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in January suggests that the labour market started the year on a reasonably solid footing. However, the drop back in annual wage growth is another reason to think the Fed will hold off raising interest rates until June. Kully Samra, Charles Schwab U.K. Managing Director: \u201cToday\u2019s jobs numbers coupled with most other economic data points this week demonstrate the ongoing resilience and strength of the US economy. The figures also corroborate the findings of the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Tracker, which has generally continued on an upward trend over the last quarter. This is a further indicator of both momentum in the wider domestic economy and that a tighter job market is boosting job security and overall pay. \u201cWeekly jobless claims remain near a multi-decade low and appear healthy enough to keep the low unemployment rate intact. A strong job market, inflection points in the wider economic data and corporate earnings, alongside increased consumer and business confidence, should be a cause for optimism amongst investors in US equities.\u201d Naeem Aslam of Think Markets: The US NFP data has confirmed that the lavish party in the employment sector is still somewhat solid, especially if you look at the headline number. You can say that it was a super solid number because it was well ahead of expectations. This week we had a number disappointing news with respect to what traders were expecting, for instance, the Bank of England\u2019s event. It is not all good news when it comes to the US jobs number because if you peel the layers, it shows that the downside surprise is in the wage report and a lot of disappointment there. We still need to see more readings before we can see that there is a trend because this number is full with noise. There is no doubt that the hourly wage growth has gathered the most momentum recently and fuelled this concern among traders that the Fed is behind the curve, while inflation is picking up steam. Clearly, today\u2019s number has put cold water on that. Moreover, if you are interested in a rate hike, then clearly you need to know that the Fed cannot move until they have a clear idea what the fiscal spending will be and that is the reality which market needs to digest. Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan. Tanweer Akram of Thrivent Continued improvement in the labor market in the U.S. strengthens the case of the Fed remaining on course to gradually tighten monetary policy in the coming months. Even though last month\u2019s job growth was strong, the FOMC will be cautious in tightening monetary policy because of considerable uncertainty about economic policy and global conditions. A key challenge for the new administration will be to lift growth in both workers\u2019 compensation and labor productivity. Infrastructure spending, lower taxes, business friendly attitude, and more streamlined regulations would be beneficial to the economy. However, higher tariffs, restrictive immigration policies, protectionism, lack of action on global climate change, and various erratic policies would be harmful. Richard de Meo, Managing Director of Foenix Partners. Today\u2019s Non Farms print was as strong as last month\u2019s was disappointing, yet the reflex dollar rally was quickly given back as traders cast their eyes through the detail of an underwhelming overall jobs report. Seasonal challenges relating to January data should be taken into account, yet the fall in average earnings to 0.1% and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.8% might cause a slight stir across the FOMC, who just this week expressed their comfort with the labour sector. A binary assessment of upcoming Fed decisions would point to a minimal but negative impact to rate expectations, yet the stronger message to emerge is that US businesses confidence is on the rise and, in the process, already helping Trump towards his 4% GDP target. I\u2019ve grabbed some nice charts off Bloomberg TV, showing how today\u2019s jobs report compared to Wall Street\u2019s forecasts.... ...and also showing how wage growth dipped: Here\u2019s our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, on today\u2019s jobs report: The US added 227,000 new jobs in January, the last month of the Obama presidency and the first of Donald Trump\u2019s, the Department of Labor announced on Friday. The closely watched figure was the best since last June and comes after Trump won the election promising jobs growth and pushing US companies to employ American citizens, threatening to tax imports of goods made outside US borders. However, the report also highlights the struggle ahead for Trump and underlines Obama\u2019s record on job creation. January marked the 76th consecutive month of job gains, the best on record. And the unemployment rate, at 4.8%, is in line with the Federal Reserve\u2019s estimate for a normal job market. Trump was a harsh critic of the government\u2019s monthly job\u2019s report during the election campaign. He claimed that 5% unemployment was \u201cone of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\u201d In August 2015, Trump told Time magazine that the real unemployment rate was 42%, at the time the Labor Department reading was 5.1%. Here\u2019s the full story: Another reason to be worried about US earnings: Here\u2019s some instant reaction, first from bond trading magnate Bill Gross: This is from James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute: Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Weisenthal suggests there\u2019s little pressure on the US central bank to hike rates fast. Economist Shaun Richards points out that wage growth is still modest, even though the US economy is creating more jobs. America\u2019s labour force participation rate, which measures everyone working or available for work, has risen to 62.9% from 62.7%. That implies that some economically inactive people started looking for work again last month (and is one reason the jobless rate rose to 4.8%). The number of Americans who would like to work more hours went up last month. The U6 rate, which measure unemployment and underemployment, has risen to 9.4% from 9.2%. November\u2019s jobs report has been revised, to show that only 164,000 new jobs were created, not 204,000 as first thought. December\u2019s data has been revised up by 1,000, to 157,000. The wages figure is a disappointment! Average earnings only rose by 0.1% month-on-month in January, dashing hopes of a 0.3% gain. America\u2019s jobless rate has risen to 4.8%, from 4.7% in December. BREAKING: America\u2019s economy created 227,000 new jobs in January, as the Obama administration ended and the Trump administration began. That\u2019s more than economists had expected, and suggests that the US economy began 2017 in good health. More to follow! Tension is building, with just five minutes to go.... It\u2019s nearly time for the US jobs report.... the first Non-Farm Payroll on Donald Trump\u2019s watch. Of course, Trump only took office on January 20th, so he can\u2019t be credited or blamed for the state of America\u2019s labo(u)r market. Of course, some firms will have made hiring decisions since the election on 9th November, but the impact of Trump\u2019s policies will only be seen in NFP reports later this year and beyond. Today\u2019s report is effectively the starting point against which Trump will be judged. A reminder: economists are expecting today\u2019s report to be pretty decent, with around 180,000 new jobs created last month. The unemployment rate may also remain low, at 4.7%.... ...however, Trump has criticised these figures for not showing the true picture in the jobs market. His team favour another measure, called U5, which includes people who have given up looking for work. That rate is currently running at 5.7%. Economists will also be looking at the wage growth figures. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 0.3% during January, with the annual increase dipping to 2.8% from 2.9% in December. The Daily Telegraph have just published a handy explanation to the Dodd-Frank legislation. Here\u2019s a snippet: If Dodd-Frank made banks safer, why is it being reviewed? Scrapping legislation that stifles businesses was a central plank of Mr Trump\u2019s election campaign, playing to his image as a successful tycoon who made billions in the private sector. Last November, he described Dodd-Frank as \u201ca sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies\u201d. Mr Trump, who has also previously argued that Dodd-Frank \u201cmade it impossible for bankers to function\u201d, pledged to \u201cdismantle\u201d the law and replace it with \u201cnew policies to encourage economic growth and job creation\u201d. Last week, while signing an executive order aimed at reducing regulations, he described Dodd-Frank as a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Republicans have long been opposed to the law. More here: It\u2019s that time of the day when the US president wakes up, opens Twitter, and addresses the world.... However, that meeting won\u2019t include Travis Kalanick, the boss of Uber, who resigned from Trump\u2019s economic advisory council following heavy criticism -- and a campaign to delete Uber. In other banking news, Deutsche Bank is planning to cut 17% of its equities staff and 6% of its fixed-income staff globally, according to the Wall Street Journal. It would be the latest stage in CEO John Cryan\u2019s push to cut costs and return the company to profit (it reported a $2bn loss yesterday). Earlier today, China\u2019s government rejected claims from the Trump administration that it unfairly manipulates its currency. Government spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing that China hopes to resolve concerns over global trade through talks, not through tit-for-tat devaluations. Lu said: China has never and won\u2019t use a currency war to seek advantage in trade or to raise competitiveness in trade. We have no intention of fighting a currency war. From a long-term perspective this is not beneficial to China. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Earlier this week, the president\u2019s trade adviser caused a stir by claiming that Germany was getting an unfair advantage through the \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has now hit back, pointing out that Berlin doesn\u2019t actually control the euro.... Mining shares are falling after China\u2019s central bank raised short term interest rates overnight. That is holding back the FTSE 100, which is up 30 points thanks to the Trump-induced rally in bank shares. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: The mining sector has slipped back this morning after a disappointing Chinese manufacturing survey as well as slight tightening of money market rates by Chinese authorities. It\u2019s not immediately clear what prompted this action, though there is speculation about rising concerns about a property bubble, and this slight rise could well be an attempt to warn that tighter policy is on the way. Glencore, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Anglo-American PLC and Rio Tinto have all slipped lower at the open. On the upside banking shares have gained a lift on speculation that US President Trump may well sign a new executive order to roll back some of the Dodd Frank regulatory bill, helping push Barclays and RBS higher. Shares in banks and insurance groups are rallying in London, following the reports that president Trump will take steps to dismantle regulations brought in to prevent another financial crisis. The prospect of Trump blocking president Obama\u2019s fiduciary rules also seem to be boosting demand for financial stocks. They were due to come into force in April, compelling financial advisors to recommend the best product to clients, not simply a suitable one. Barclays are leading the FTSE risers, up 2.5%, followed by Prudential, and Royal Bank of Scotland. Chris Beauchamp of City trading firm IG says: UK bank stocks are higher across the board this morning, after the magic words \u2018Dodd-Frank\u2019 and \u2018repeal\u2019 flashed across screens last night; leaving aside the political implications, the news could provide a tonic for the sector. Trump cannot simply demolish the Dodd-Frank rules on his own, but his executive orders still carry weight. The FT has a good explanation: Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is now director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said Mr Trump would sign executive orders preparing the way to fulfil a campaign pledge to dismantle parts of Dodd-Frank. However, the president\u2019s ability to pull apart the sweeping reforms on his own is limited. Only Congress can make major revisions to the act it passed in 2010, but Mr Trump can use the orders to signal his priorities and instruct regulators enforcing the law. \u201cThis is a table setter for a bunch of stuff that is coming,\u201d said Mr Cohn, who stepped down as a top executive at Goldman Sachs to take the White House job. Economists are concerned that Britain\u2019s service sector slowed last month. Here\u2019s some early reaction: Dean Turner, UK Economist, UBS Wealth Management: \u201cThe most notable aspect of the Services PMI was the ongoing strength of the input prices index, which rose again and is now above 60 level for the fourth consecutive month. Higher input prices will, in time, shift into selling prices otherwise firms will see their profits shrink. In line with the Manufacturing and Construction PMI, this points to inflation continuing its recent surge in the months ahead. \u201cHeadline activity, although falling back slightly, suggests the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy pace, but one has to question its sustainability. Can the UK economy keep pace as inflation erodes the spending power of the consumer? We don\u2019t share the Bank of England\u2019s optimism that households will continue to whittle away their savings to support spending. Our conviction strengthened today with the softer outlook for employment highlighted in this survey.\u201d Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Services have been the key UK growth driver along with consumer spending and January survey evidence for both has been softer. While these are surveys rather than hard data and not too much should be read into one month\u2019s figures, it nevertheless fuels our suspicion that the UK economy will find life increasing difficult during 2017 and that growth will gradually lose buoyancy like a slow puncture. Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. \u201cThere are some helpful economic ingredients that are keeping the PMI in positive territory. Healthy levels of employment and low interest rates mean consumers continue to spend. Business confidence has also been buoyed by a stronger than expected economic performance in 2016, and is likely to be further boosted by yesterday\u2019s improved growth forecast from the Bank of England. \u201cHowever, some uncertainty remains and we\u2019re seeing a cautious approach towards making major investment decisions across the services sector.\u201d Newsflash: Britain\u2019s service sector grew slower than expected last month, as firms were hit by rising prices. The Services PMI, which tracks activity in the dominant part of the UK economy, dropped to 54.5 for January from 56.2 in December, a bigger slowdown than expected. Firms said that new business and employment also increased at slower rates, and their backlog of outstanding work fell a little. And there are also signs that raw material prices are ballooning ahead, due to the weaker pound. Bad news for UK energy customers... Npower has just announced it will raise the cost of its dual fuel package by almost 10%. The move will hurt around half of its customers, putting \u00a3100 on the average annual bill. And where one energy firm leads, the others tend to follow... Investors often flock to gold in time of nervousness. And Donald Trump\u2019s election win has helped to push demand for bullion up to its highest level since the eurozone debt crisis was raging. Good news! The Eurozone\u2019s service sector has kept growing at the fastest pace in five and a half years. Markit\u2019s service sector PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has just come in at 54.4 for January, matching December\u2019s reading - the highest since mid-2012. That shows robust growth, with job creation hitting its fastest rate since 2008. But...firms also warned that input costs are rising at the fastest rate in over five- and-a-half years That\u2019s due to higher global commodity prices, increased import costs due to the weak euro and supplier price hikes. Overall, the report suggests eurozone growth is gathering pace, according to Julien Lafargue, European Equities Strategist at JP Morgan. He says: Although Germany has decelerated somewhat in the recent months, today\u2019s PMIs are clearly pointing to accelerating GDP growth in the Eurozone in 2017. In addition, the rate of job creation - the fastest since February 2008 \u2013 indicates that this momentum could be sustained in the coming months. Going forward, it will be important to keep an eye on cost pressures which continue to intensify. The companies\u2019 ability to pass these higher costs onto consumers will be critical to support margins and the earnings recovery we anticipate. President Trump makes the front page of this week\u2019s Economist: And their leader column says that America\u2019s allies are right to be worried by the president\u2019s early moves: Here\u2019s a flavour: WASHINGTON is in the grip of a revolution. The bleak cadence of last month\u2019s inauguration was still in the air when Donald Trump lobbed the first Molotov cocktail of policies and executive orders against the capital\u2019s brilliant-white porticos. He has not stopped. Quitting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, demanding a renegotiation of NAFTA and a wall with Mexico, overhauling immigration, warming to Brexit-bound Britain and Russia, cooling to the European Union, defending torture, attacking the press: onward he and his people charged, leaving the wreckage of received opinion smouldering in their wake.... More here: An insurgent in the White House Donald Trump\u2019s shock election victory has been \u201cmarginally\u201d good for the UK economy, according to one of the Bank of England\u2019s top officials. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent argued that Britain has benefitted from the jump in financial confidence following Trump\u2019s win last November. Speaking to BBC Breakfast TV, Broadbent said: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen business confidence rise particularly in the United States. You\u2019ve seen financial markets get more optimistic and I think that has had some impact on us. \u201cSo far, at the margin, yes, it\u2019s been positive for global sentiment, and for that reason, and to that extent, for us as well.\u201d Broadbent also cautioned, though, that we don\u2019t know exactly what Trump will do: \u201cAnd I should say overall that... there\u2019s a lot we have yet to see about the detailed plans, including those for fiscal policy, for government spending and taxes and so forth, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d Yesterday the Bank of England hiked its growth forecasts for the UK economy this year, prompting criticism that it was too gloomy after the EU referendum result. Laurie Macfarlane of the New Economics Foundation is concerned that removing financial regulations could lead to trouble: The FT\u2019s Jeremy Grant also has concerns: But the move could drive stock markets higher, argues Neil Wilson of ETX Capital, especially if today\u2019s US jobs report is a zinger. President Trump will meet with the bosses of some of America\u2019s largest financial firms today, before signing executive orders to review Dodd-Frank and stall the Obama fiduciary rule. He\u2019s expected to see Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Blackrock boss Laurence Fink and JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, among others That may not dispel concerns that the new administration is batting for the banking sector, rather than the public. For example, Obama\u2019s fiduciary rules are means to protect millions of retired Americans from being missold investments by brokers, to get bumper profits. However, the White House line is that removing regulations is good for investors, which is why they want the rule rescinded. As Bloomberg puts it: The two executive actions are designed to lay out the Trump administration\u2019s approach to financial markets, with an emphasis on removing regulatory burdens and opening up investor options, said the White House official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Some breaking news from America.... US president Donald Trump is expected to start unpicking some of the rules created after the 2008 crisis to to rein in the financial sector. US media are reporting that Trump will order a review of the Dodd-Frank rules, which are designed to stop banks being too reckless. He\u2019s also apparently planning to sign another executive action that could halt President Obama\u2019s Fiduciary Rules. This regulation forces retirement advisers to work in the best interests of their clients; Trump will ask the US labor secretary to consider rescinding it, reports say. The Dodd-Frank rules were a major attempt to avoid a repeat of the crisis that brought down Lehman Brothers. They force banks to be more transparent, provide extra consumer protection, and are meant to prevent the kind of risks that led to the meltdown of the sector nine years ago. But they\u2019re also unpopular with banks, who argue that they restrict business. Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, has told the Wall Street Journal that unravelling these safeguards will be good for consumers (as well as the banks, of course!). Cohn (a former president of Goldman Sachs) argued: \u201cAmericans are going to have better choices and Americans are going to have better products because we\u2019re not going to burden the banks with literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year. \u201cThe banks are going to be able to price product more efficiently and more effectively to consumers.\u201d More here: Donald Trump Plans to Undo Dodd-Frank Law, Fiduciary Rule Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Donald Trump once promised to be \u201cthe greatest jobs president God ever created\u201d. And today we\u2019ll find out whether his rise to the White House has had any impact on the US labour market yet. The latest US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP), due at 1.30pm GMT (8.30am East Coast), will show how many new jobs were created across America last month, whether wages rose, and whether more people were lured back to the jobs market. Economists expect a fairly solid report. The payroll is expected to rise by around 180,000 jobs leaving the unemployment rate at a healthy-looking 4.7%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suggests we could get an even stronger report: This would suggest that the 180k estimate being predicted is probably too low, with a figure in excess of 200k not being beyond the realms of possibility. Such a high number given an unemployment rate of 4.7%, would suggest that there is probably still a fair degree of slack in the jobs market. Wages are also likely to be closely watched with a rise of 0.3% expected, with an annualised rise of 2.8%, down slightly from December\u2019s 2.9%. The report could easily move the markets, as the strength of the US jobs market will determine how quickly the Federal Reserve can raise interest rates this year. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest healthcheck on the world\u2019s service sector companies today. These Purchasing Managers Index (PMIs) reports are expected to show decent growth last month, suggesting the world economy began 2017 in good spirits despite the political uncertainty. Here\u2019s the timings: 9am GMT: Eurozone (with a breakdown for each country) 9.30am GMT: UK 2.45pm GMT: US The financial markets are expected to be calm, as traders wait for the NFP numbers: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

There was observable shareholder glee that an era of ever-expanding regulation could be coming to an end under Donald Trump.</p> <p>Since Dodd Frank was introduced, banks have devoted a lot more capital towards compliance and have had to decrease leverage, both of which are a direct hit to profitability. If Dodd Frank is watered down, that\u2019s a direct boost to the bottom line for banks.</p> <p>The changes to Dodd Frank are likely to be small to begin with but Trump is shifting the direction of travel from more regulation to less regulation. That\u2019s a good thing for the financial sector, and less red tape is good for corporate America as a whole. Trump turning his attention to deregulation could be just the boost Wall Street needs to send the Dow back above the 20,000 mark.</p> <p>Too much regulation favours the large institutions who can afford the extra compliance costs.</p> <p>Unwinding some of Dodd Frank is a good thing because it will enable smaller community banks to compete, offering competition to consumers.</p> <p>Repealing too much of Dodd Frank puts the entire system at risk of a repeat of 2008.

This week we had a number disappointing news with respect to what traders were expecting, for instance, the Bank of England\u2019s event.</p> <p>It is not all good news when it comes to the US jobs number because if you peel the layers, it shows that the downside surprise is in the wage report and a lot of disappointment there. We still need to see more readings before we can see that there is a trend because this number is full with noise.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the hourly wage growth has gathered the most momentum recently and fuelled this concern among traders that the Fed is behind the curve, while inflation is picking up steam. Clearly, today\u2019s number has put cold water on that. Moreover, if you are interested in a rate hike, then clearly you need to know that the Fed cannot move until they have a clear idea what the fiscal spending will be and that is the reality which market needs to digest. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan.</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515497449074688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bottom line: Jobs numbers confirm the US economy is still motoring along nicely at a good clip\u2014fast enough to keep pushing unemployment down</p>&mdash; Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515497449074688\">February 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515844297003009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The big question remains how much slack remains in the labor market, and how many folks we can pull back into the labor force.</p>&mdash; Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/827515844297003009\">February 3, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Tanweer Akram of Thrivent</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Continued improvement in the labor market in the U.S. strengthens the case of the Fed remaining on course to gradually tighten monetary policy in the coming months</strong>.

Here\u2019s some early reaction:</p> <h2><strong>Dean Turner, UK Economist, UBS Wealth Management:</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe most notable aspect of the Services PMI was the ongoing strength of the input prices index, which rose again and is now above 60 level for the fourth consecutive month. Higher input prices will, in time, shift into selling prices otherwise firms will see their profits shrink. In line with the Manufacturing and Construction PMI, this points to inflation continuing its recent surge in the months ahead.</p> <p>\u201cHeadline activity, although falling back slightly, suggests the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy pace, but one has to question its sustainability. Can the UK economy keep pace as inflation erodes the spending power of the consumer? We don\u2019t share the Bank of England\u2019s optimism that households will continue to whittle away their savings to support spending. Our conviction strengthened today with the softer outlook for employment highlighted in this survey.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Services have been the key UK growth driver along with consumer spending and January survey evidence for both has been softer. While these are surveys rather than hard data and not too much should be read into one month\u2019s figures, it nevertheless fuels our suspicion that the UK economy will find life increasing difficult during 2017 and that growth will gradually lose buoyancy like a slow puncture.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Chris Sood-Nicholls, managing director and head of global services at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere are some helpful economic ingredients that are keeping the PMI in positive territory. Healthy levels of employment and low interest rates mean consumers continue to spend. Business confidence has also been buoyed by a stronger than expected economic performance in 2016, and is likely to be further boosted by yesterday\u2019s improved growth forecast from the Bank of England.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, some uncertainty remains and we\u2019re seeing a cautious approach towards making major investment decisions across the services sector.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58944df6e4b0c64fe7016ce1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-03T09:40:39.883Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK service sector growth slows</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Britain\u2019s service sector grew slower than expected last month, as firms were hit by rising prices.</strong></p> <p>The Services PMI, which tracks activity in the dominant part of the UK economy, dropped to 54.5 for January from 56.2 in December, a bigger slowdown than expected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ReutersJamie/status/827451714986979329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK service sector growth slows more than expected in January.

      "bodyText": "Lettuce rationing has proved to be just the tip of the iceberg: the UK\u2019s third largest supermarket has introduced a ban on bulk purchases of aubergines, broccoli, loose courgettes and cabbage. Asda said it was limiting bulk purchases to six items on iceberg lettuce and each of the other vegetables as an almost unprecedented cold and wet weather in southern Spain has hit supplies. Asda\u2019s rationing comes after Tesco introduced a three-lettuce limit on icebergs, while rival Morrisons has imposed a two-lettuce limit and banned shoppers from buying more than three heads of broccoli. The shortages are also hitting restaurant chains. Sandwich chain Pret a Manger said it had been using alternative varieties of leaf in its salads, such as Lollo Rosso and Frisse. Meanwhile, one extremely hopeful seller put a box of lettuces up for sale on Gumtree for \u00a350 in a bid to cash in while eBay had listings for iceberg lettuces for between 99p and \u00a34.99. Industry suppliers said fresh herbs such as coriander, parsley, mint and thyme were also affected by shortages. A spokesman for Global Fruit &amp; Veg, a Birmingham-based importer which suppliers local retailers, markets and wholesalers, said it had begun flying in herbs from Egypt and Jordan for the first time because it could not get sufficient supplies from Spain. Wholesale prices have shot up by about 70% because of the supply squeeze. Supermarket shelves have been left empty and prices soared to as much as three times their usual price as supplies from Murcia, where more than 80% of many salad and vegetable crops sold in the UK usually come from over the winter, have slumped. Iceberg lettuce supplies to the UK have been particularly affected as it is extremely sensitive to temperature. More than90% of icebergs sold in the UK during the winter are grown in Spain. Growers began warning of shortages in December when the normally dry region was hit by flooding which washed away entire crops of some vegetables. The situation worsened when the heaviest snow in more than 30 years fell on the region. Shortages of courgettes, aubergines, salad and celery are expected to continue until April when UK production kicks in, and shoppers can expect to pay substantially higher prices for the stock that is available until then. Few lettuces or other tender crops are grown in the UK over the winter because it is neither economic nor environmentally sustainable because they would require heated greenhouses or polytunnels. An Asda spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to support our growers and get back up to full supply as quickly as possible, but we apologise if we\u2019re running a bit low on some products in the short term.\u201d Like all the other supermarkets, Asda is also flying in lettuces from the US to boost availability. Traders at the New Covent Garden wholesale market in London, which supplies restaurants, markets and retailers all around the country, said trade was tough. Gareth Lewis of Harwood\u2019s of London said: \u201cBasically it\u2019s everything coming from Spain and for some people here that\u2019s as much as 60% of their produce. It means that on aubergines, iceberg lettuce, cucumbers \u2013 we\u2019re either not making any profit or losing money. It\u2019s very stressful, it\u2019s a big headache to be honest.\u201d Lewis said that normally iceberg lettuce would cost him about \u00a36 a box, but he is having to import American lettuce for \u00a314. Aubergines have leapt from \u00a36-8 a box to \u00a324 while boxes of courgettes that usually cost \u00a34-6 now cost \u00a322. He described getting all attempts to source spinach as \u201ca challenge\u201d. While his staff boxed up bright rainbow chard, plump vine tomatoes and a few prized iceberg lettuces for restaurant clients, including those of star chef Yotam Ottolenghi, wholesaler Dan McCullough explained that he is taking some of the financial hit rather than pass on the full cost to clients. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d says the wholesaler, who set up First Choice Produce 40 years ago. McCullough said import prices had already risen by 10%, before the weather problems, as a result of the fall in the pound caused by the Brexit vote. \u201cOccasionally you get a problem with one product, but this many for this amount of time is unheard of.\u201d But there could be a silver lining says Vernon Mascarenhas, head of sales and marketing at First Choice Produce. His company is advising clients to buy alternative seasonal crops, such as savoy cabbage and purple sprouting broccoli grown in the UK. \u201cWe have plenty of vegetables in the UK, so rather than rely on foreign produce we could see people moving to homegrown produce. Maybe it\u2019s a blessing in disguise.\u201d Meanwhile Jos\u00e9 Ugarrio, a technical expert at Asaja, Spain\u2019s largest farming association, said that the worst of the cold, wet weather that hit vegetable producers in the country had now passed. \u201cProduction is gradually recovering,\u201d he said, \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take a bit longer for broccoli and lettuce to get back into production.\u201d",

It means that on aubergines, iceberg lettuce, cucumbers \u2013 we\u2019re either not making any profit or losing money. It\u2019s very stressful, it\u2019s a big headache to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said that normally iceberg lettuce would cost him about \u00a36 a box, but he is having to import American lettuce for \u00a314. Aubergines have leapt from \u00a36-8 a box to \u00a324 while boxes of courgettes that usually cost \u00a34-6 now cost \u00a322. He described getting all attempts to source spinach as \u201ca challenge\u201d.</p> <p>While his staff boxed up bright rainbow chard, plump vine tomatoes and a few prized iceberg lettuces for restaurant clients, including those of star chef Yotam Ottolenghi, wholesaler Dan McCullough explained that he is taking some of the financial hit rather than pass on the full cost to clients. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d says the wholesaler, who set up First Choice Produce 40 years ago.</p> <p>McCullough said import prices had already risen by 10%, before the weather problems, as a result of the fall in the pound caused by the Brexit vote. \u201cOccasionally you get a problem with one product, but this many for this amount of time is unheard of.\u201d </p> <p>But there could be a silver lining says Vernon Mascarenhas, head of sales and marketing at First Choice Produce. His company is advising clients to buy alternative seasonal crops, such as savoy cabbage and purple sprouting broccoli grown in the UK. \u201cWe have plenty of vegetables in the UK, so rather than rely on foreign produce we could see people moving to homegrown produce. Maybe it\u2019s a blessing in disguise.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Jos\u00e9 Ugarrio, a technical expert at Asaja, Spain\u2019s largest farming association, said that the worst of the cold, wet weather that hit vegetable producers in the country had now passed. \u201cProduction is gradually recovering,\u201d he said, \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take a bit longer for broccoli and lettuce to get back into production.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Plans for a new nuclear power station in Cumbria are likely to be scrapped after a key backer pulled out, creating a major hole in the government\u2019s nuclear strategy. Two industry sources close to the process said Toshiba had privately decided to quit the consortium behind the planned Moorside plant, echoing sources who told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that the Japanese company was withdrawing from new nuclear projects in the UK. Toshiba said last month it was reviewing all its nuclear business abroad after suffering a multibillion-dollar writedown on its US business. It has promised to provide more details about its intentions when it publishes results on 14 February. The French energy firm Engie, which is Toshiba\u2019s partner in the NuGen consortium, has long been seen as wanting to get out of the project. Its chief executive said last year the future did not lie in nuclear power. The company said that, along with Toshiba, it was seeking new investors to finance the Moorside plant, which are reported to include Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco). Senior figures in the industry urged the government to start discussions with the South Koreans immediately to safeguard the power station if Toshiba left NuGen. \u201cAny potential investor in that project is going to need to have very direct reassurance from the government; even if they are just starting an exploratory period, they are welcomed,\u201d said Tim Yeo, the chairman of the pro-nuclear group New Nuclear Watch Europe. The former Conservative MP said ministers should even consider taking a direct stake in the Moorside plant. Such an interventionist approach would have been anathema in recent years but appears more credible after recent leaks revealed the government was considering taking a stake in another new nuclear plant, at Wylfa in Wales. Unions also called for the government to step in with funding to save the plant if Toshiba pulled out. \u201cIt looks increasingly like bad business investments may have busted Toshiba\u2019s role in a new nuclear facility at Moorside in Cumbria,\u201d said Justin Bowden, the GMB\u2019s national secretary for energy. Moorside, near Sellafield, is a key part of the government\u2019s hopes for a new fleet of power stations to fill the UK\u2019s energy gap in the next decade as coal plants and ageing atomic plants close. The only one to be approved so far is EDF\u2019s \u00a318bn Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, which was made financially possible through subsidies to be levied on household bills. The government hopes new plants will be built at Wylffa, Sizewell, Bradwell and Oldbury. Of Moorside\u2019s three mooted reactors, Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London said: \u201cThese are really big pieces of kit. If and when plans for Moorside fail, this leaves an existential gap in UK energy policy.\u201d Toshiba\u2019s chief executive, Satoshi Tsunakawa, signalled last week that new nuclear projects would be reviewed in response to the anticipated multibillion-dollar writedown related to the purchase of a nuclear construction and services business by its US subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric. No official decision has been made on NuGen. \u201cAt this moment, we can only say that we are reviewing the future of our nuclear power business outside Japan, but nothing has been decided at this time,\u201d the company told the Guardian. A spokesman for Engie said the company \u201ccontinues to evaluate the site and design of the NuGen Moorside facility\u201d. Theresa May told parliament earlier this week that the government was committed to new nuclear plants. A spokesman for the government said it was \u201cworking closely with a number of developers\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump drove global demand for gold to a four-year high in 2016, as pension funds and other institutional investors piled into the precious metal while higher prices put consumers off jewellery purchases. Global gold demand rose 2% last year to reach 4,309 tonnes, the highest level since 2013, according to a report from the World Gold Council, which represents gold miners. This was largely driven by inflows of 532 tonnes into gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which track the spot price of gold \u2013 marking the best year for ETFs since 2009. Gold is seen as a safe haven in times of turmoil, and there was plenty of that last year. Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, pointed to the shock Brexit vote and the election of Trump as US president, along with the upcoming Dutch, French and German elections. The weaker yuan and low or negative interest rates also made gold more attractive, helping push up investment demand by 70%. Hewitt said that \u201c2016 saw an unprecedented degree of political upheaval, which underpinned huge institutional investor flows into gold. ETFs are easy ways for people to access gold.\u201d However, jewellery demand hit a seven-year low of 2,041.6 tonnes in 2016 due to rising gold prices for much of the year, while central bank purchases were the lowest since 2010, due in part to increased pressure on foreign exchange reserves. Consumers in China and India, the world\u2019s two biggest gold markets, bought less jewellery as the price of gold rose 25% between January and September. Prices then fell between October and December, which meant they were 8% higher over the year as a whole, ending 2016 at $1,145.90 an ounce. In India, the nationwide jewellers\u2019 strike in effect shut down the gold industry at the beginning of the year, and in November rural communities were hit hard by the cash crunch caused by the withdrawal of high-denomination banknotes. But the effect is likely to to be temporary, the report said \u2013 the good monsoon has boosted farmer\u2019s incomes, making it likely they will return to buying gold in coming months (Indians tend to save in gold when they have spare cash). The price dip in November, when Trump\u2019s \u201cpositive growth rhetoric\u201d led to the dollar and equity markets strengthening, contributed to a strong recovery in the bar and coin market in the final quarter, Hewitt said. China\u2019s retail investors in particular snapped up gold bars and coins (until 2004 they were banned from doing so). Europe remains the second largest bar and coin market in the world. Hewitt highlighted changing tastes, with younger people in China preferring lower grade, branded jewellery to the top grade gold favoured by their parents\u2019 generation \u2013 design over quality. Younger Chinese also prefer to spend their money on travel rather than material things. In the US, yellow and rose gold have gained in popularity. Gold teeth continue to go out of fashion. For the first time in years, miners started exploring for gold again, spurred on by the rise in prices, and are looking to strike gold on the periphery of existing mines. But any discoveries would take several years to feed through into increased gold production.",

      "bodyText": "Warnings that Britain is heading for a sharp increase in inflation have intensified after a key business survey showed companies in the services sector are grappling with their biggest rise in costs for almost six years. The report into the UK economy\u2019s biggest sector, which spans banks to hotels and hairdressers, showed firms suffered their first slowdown for four months in January. This suggests the economy lost momentum at the start of 2017. Companies reported higher fuel and labour costs and said they had to pay more for imports because of the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum. There were also further signs that companies were passing on some of that cost burden to customers in higher prices. That will add to concerns that rising inflation is eroding household budgets and will hit consumer spending, a key driver of the UK economy. Living costs have started to rise at a faster pace in recent months on the back of rising energy prices and the pound\u2019s weakness. Inflation hit its highest level for more than two years in December at 1.6%, and some forecasters see it going above 3% this year. Food companies have blamed higher costs for imported ingredients as they raise prices in the shops on goods such as Marmite, Cadbury\u2019s Freddo bars and Weetabix. Prices at the pump have also risen and clothing prices are also expected to increase. High street retailer Next has warned the devaluation of the pound will hike the price of clothing by up to 5% in the coming months. In the latest sign living costs are rising, Npower said on Friday it was raising prices for more than a million customers, pushing up dual fuel bills rise by an average of 9.8% or \u00a3109 a year. Despite costs pressures, services firms polled in the latest Markit/Cips UK services PMI report (pdf) indicated that they remained optimistic about the year ahead and they continued hiring workers, albeit at a slower pace. The headline index on the report dipped to 54.5 in January from 56.5 the month before. January marks the first time the main activity reading has declined for four months and it was below forecasts for 55.8 in a Reuters poll of economists. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the survey\u2019s compilers, IHS Markit, said the January slowdown followed a strong finish to 2016. The services report and similar surveys out earlier this week on manufacturing and construction still indicated a \u201cbuoyant start\u201d to 2017 for the UK economy, he added. \u201cThe PMI surveys are collectively signalling that GDP will increase by a robust 0.5% in the first quarter, if current growth is sustained in coming months,\u201d said Williamson. That would compare with an official estimate that GDP expanded 0.6% in the final quarter of 2016. The report follows the Bank of England\u2019s move on Thursday to revise its growth forecast for the UK economy sharply higher, to 2% from the 1.4% it had predicted in November. The Bank also surprised financial markets by edging down its forecast for inflation. The PMI report, which covers firms making up about 50% of the economy, suggested that companies\u2019 costs were rising at the fastest rate since March 2011 with pressure from more expensive imports, higher fuel and freight prices and bigger wage bills. \u201cSupply chain managers reported that cost burdens were weighing down more heavily and impacting on their business for the seventh time in eight months,\u201d said David Noble, group chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which co-publishes the report. \u201cThe triple whammy of rising fuel costs, salaries and higher import prices were keenly felt, and these rising costs may have also had an effect on the number of new jobs on offer, reflected in the rate of job creation which was at a five-month low.\u201d Strong pressure on costs led firms to increase their charges in January, at a pace unchanged from December\u2019s 68-month record, the PMI report said. \u201cInflationary pressures are becoming increasingly concerning,\u201d said Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the forecasters EY Item Club, commenting on the poll. \u201cIt looks increasingly likely that we will not escape a steep pickup in consumer price inflation through 2017.\u201d The PMI report polls private sector companies but does not cover retailers or government services. It therefore covers about half the economy, whereas official data on services published with more of a lag covers almost 80%.",

      "bodyText": "The US added 227,000 new jobs in January, the last month of the Obama presidency and the first of Donald Trump\u2019s, the Department of Labor announced on Friday. The closely watched figure was the best since last September and comes after Trump won the election promising jobs growth and pushing US companies to employ American citizens, threatening to tax imports of goods made outside US borders. However, the report also highlights the struggle ahead for Trump and underlines Obama\u2019s record on job creation. January marked the 76th consecutive month of job gains, the best on record. And the unemployment rate, at 4.8%, is in line with the Federal Reserve\u2019s estimate for a normal job market. Trump was a harsh critic of the government\u2019s monthly jobs report during the election campaign. He claimed that 5% unemployment was \u201cone of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\u201d In August 2015, Trump told Time magazine that the real unemployment rate was 42%, at the time the Labor Department reading was 5.1%. The latest report highlighted continued weakness in wage growth, which slowed to an annualized rate of 2.5% in January, down from 2.9% the month earlier. Wages have lagged behind as unemployment has fallen in part because service sector and other less well paid jobs have dominated jobs growth. Retail was the fastest growing sector in January, adding 46,000 positions and ahead of construction which added 36,0000. PNC Bank\u2019s deputy chief economist Gus Faucher said the slight rise in the unemployment rate from 4.7% to 4.8% was triggered by more people looking for work. The labor force participation rate - which measures the percentage of the population employed or actively looking for work - rose marginally in January to 62.9%. Faucher said it would be months before the jobs figures reflected the impact of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say what impact the Trump administration has had on the job market. The survey was taken before the presidential inauguration, and the numbers are volatile and subject to revision. We will have a better sense of how the job market has responded to President Trump by the middle of 2017,\u201d he said. The latest government statistics follow a strong report from payroll processor ADP. The company said on Wednesday that private businesses had added 246,000 jobs last month, up from 151,000 in December and the highest number of new jobs since June last year. ADP reported widespread hiring, with the construction, manufacturing, healthcare and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. Both reports are likely to add to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates again when it meets in March. The Fed declined to raise rates this week at its first meeting since Trump took office, but published an upbeat assessment of the US economy. The Fed chair, Janet Yellen, warned last month that the US economy could be in for a \u201cnasty surprise\u201d on inflation if it is too slow with rate hikes. In December, the last full month of the Obama administration, the US added a slightly disappointing 156,000 new jobs. However, wages, which have lagged behind job growth, grew at a solid 2.9%, the best pace since 2009. This article was amended on 3 February 2017. A previous version of the headline and the article incorrectly identified the January report as the best since June 2016.",
