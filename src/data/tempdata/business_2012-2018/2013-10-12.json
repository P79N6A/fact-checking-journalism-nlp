      "bodyText": "With investors clamouring for a blockbuster privatisation, Fleetwood Mac on tour and rolled-up jacket sleeves back in vogue, the stock market is starting to party like it's 1986. Royal Mail's flotation was 20 times oversubscribed by fund managers, outstripping the frenzy drummed up by the \"Tell Sid\" British Gas campaign 27 years ago. Royal Mail shares soared as soon as they started trading, and closed up 38% at 455p. The Royal Mail sale is the most visible sign of the revival in the market for initial public offerings (IPOs), taking the total in the UK so far this year to \u00a35.2bn \u2013 the highest since a record \u00a36.5bn for the same period in 2007, according to figures from Thomson Reuters. IPOs this year have included estate agent Foxtons, builder Crest Nicholson, and insurer Esure. And a lengthening pipeline of offerings includes Madam Tussauds owner Merlin, online property site Zoopla and furniture retailer DFS. Private equity firms are helping fuel the frenzy by selling companies they bought in the boom. Foxtons \u2013 floated at 230p last month, now selling at 291p \u2013 was majority owned by buyout firm BC Partners, and Merlin is backed by Blackstone and fellow private equity outfit CVC. The Saga cruises-to-insurance group, owned by a trio of private equity firms, is also tipped for a float next year, with a possible valuation of about \u00a33bn. Just two years ago, things were very different. The total raised in UK IPOs fell from the 2007 peak of \u00a311.5bn to just \u00a3750m. Though share prices were rising, the wider environment was viewed as too risky for flotations. The economy was close to recession, the Middle East was in turmoil and Europe was in crisis. Nigel Boardman, a partner at the law firm Slaughter and May, says the mood has now changed: \"The low interest rate environment has been benign for businesses and many have enjoyed a successful few years. It is not surprising that some owners wish to realise their gain. The relative decline in private equity's appetite for acquisitions coupled with the caution of trade buyers in what remains a still-insecure economic recovery leaves IPOs as a natural exit route.\" Share prices were boosted as central banks drove down interest rates to support their economies. Investors put their money in shares because they couldn't make a good return from cash or bonds. They were cautious at first, buying \"defensive\" companies with solid cash flows and dividends. But with the UK economy now growing again and the eurozone finally out of recession, investors are starting to look beyond stalwart stocks for slightly better, if riskier, prospects \u2013 hence the interest in Foxtons, Crest Nicholson and Zoopla, all linked to the housing market. Gareth McCartney of UBS says the market is still in recovery mode but adds:\"Investor appetite is broadening out, with more sectors and regions becoming investable.\" But it was never just external forces that caused the IPO market to shrivel: investors were also burnt by a series of offers that left them nursing losses. Ocado's shares fell 7% on flotation day in summer 2010, despite the online grocer cutting its offer price at the last minute. Later that year Betfair rose on its first day of trading but plunged to three-quarters of the offer price when it missed forecasts seven weeks later. Robert Talbut of Royal London Asset Management says issuers and their advisers were pushing valuations to the limit to squeeze every last penny from an IPO with little regard for the long term: \"It isn't a sign of success if the price goes to a discount on the first day. It's a good thing if people want to buy more shares in the aftermarket. As a buyer there is now less of a feeling that you are being vehemently encouraged to up the price you are prepared to pay. But I still think if we had a memorable failure that would make people concerned that the process hasn't significantly improved.\" Direct Line's flotation last autumn was the turning point. The company and its advisers took a pragmatic line and priced the offer \"to go\" as bankers say. Promising a healthy dividend, the deal went through and the shares ticked up a healthy 7.3% on the first day. The market is set for further growth: a recent Capita report predict IPOs hitting \u00a312bn next year. The success of the Royal Mail float will encourage buyers and potential issuers. So with the economy on the up and more privatisations on the cards, does the IPO revival mark a return to the go-go days of the 1980s for the City? Talbut remains cautious: \"To call it a resurgence is a bit strong. I still think it's a fragile environment. Animal spirits are stirring but they're not rampant.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Women have had a good week. Fresh from cheering President Obama's nomination of Janet Yellen as the new head of the Federal Reserve (though more because of her wisdom than her gender), I woke up on Thursday to a pleasantly discombobulating auditory experience. The Today programme has started my day for more years than I can remember, and on every one of those mornings at least one, and very often both, of the anchors were men. Not that I don't enjoy Evan Davis monstering Danny Alexander or John Humphrys needling the PM; but Thursday's all-female presenting team was a refreshing sign of the times. Should her nomination be confirmed by the Senate, as Washington-watchers expect, Yellen will join Angela Merkel, Dilma Rousseff and Christine Lagarde among a small but growing sisterhood at the peak of world politics and economics. They may be ultra-bright pioneers, but their presence at the summit is encouraging, nevertheless. Before we declare victory in the gender wars, though, we should acknowledge the formidable barriers that still face millions of women worldwide. Just one quirky but important example emerged in a recent academic paper, which \u2013 seeing the world through the super-rational eyes of the economist \u2013 asked whether the continued existence of cows in India disproves the central tenets of capitalism. Many rural Indian families keep a cow, using its milk and selling any surplus. But the authors, Santosh Anagol et al, use an extraordinarily detailed database, plus more information than you ever needed about bovine husbandry, to show that, far from contributing to the family coffers, these cows almost invariably result in a large loss to their owners compared with the wages they could theoretically earn in the local economy. \"If cows and buffaloes earn such low, even negative, economic returns, why would rural Indian households continue to invest in them?\" the economists ask. They consider several explanations, but one very plausible candidate is that because there are in fact so few opportunities for women to earn a few rupees outside the family homestead, their labour is valued by the household as worthless. \"In many locations, the formal labour market for women is essentially non-existent,\" the authors say. If the thousands of hours of backbreaking work put in, mostly by women, in raising, nurturing and milking the cows, doesn't count \u2013 and if there is no alternative outside the home \u2013 then the economically questionable decision to press on with cow ownership suddenly appears perfectly rational. Now this whole area of whether, and how, what women do is valued, is a fraught one even in advanced countries, throwing up imponderables such as why traditionally female \"caring\" jobs such as working in an old people's home tend to command lower wages than, say, fixing a car. But a growing number of countries are keen to benefit from the untapped potential of the female half of their population. Japanese premier Shinzo Abe told the United Nations last month that \"womenomics\" (not an elegant word, but we won't quibble) was one of the keys to his country's long-hoped-for economic renaissance. \"Creating an environment in which women find it comfortable to work and enhancing opportunities for women to work and to be active in society is no longer a matter of choice for Japan. It is instead a matter of the greatest urgency,\" he said. He's not kidding: with Japan's working-age population set to decline rapidly over the next 30 years, it must make sense not to assume that half the workforce will be staying at home \u2013 and Japan has a lot to do to catch up, even with its Asian neighbours. More than 20% of managers are women in Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam; in Japan, it's less than a tenth. An IMF report from last year suggested that Japan could boost its GDP per head by as much as 5% over the next two decades by raising the proportion of women who work (the \"participation rate\") from 62% to 70% \u2013 the average for the G7 excluding Italy, whose women face their own struggles, not least against the pervasiveness of \"bunga bunga\" culture. In developed countries, the solutions are tried and tested: Japan could focus on expanding the availability of parental leave, encouraging flexible working and spending more taxpayers' cash on supporting childcare, for example. Once it's become practical for mothers to work, cultural change should eventually follow, though perhaps with a long time-lag. Back on the farms of rural India \u2013 a country in which the female participation rate is just 29%, and has actually fallen in recent years \u2013 the challenges are more complex. The International Labour Organisation has suggested one key explanation for low female participation is so-called \"occupational segregation\": women are concentrated in a few industries, including agriculture, handicrafts and basic manufacturing, that, as well as being poorly paid, have created few new jobs in recent years. Had Indian women been able to take up roles in the same range of industries as their male counterparts, the ILO reckons, twice as many could have found a job between 1994 and 2010. Here, part of the answer must lie in girls' education; but it must also relate to deep-seated attitudes to women that have surfaced in an extreme way in a series of appalling recent cases of violence, and may take many years of tenacious campaigning to shift. Yellen, Merkel and Lagarde are inspiring trailblazers: powerful women doing fiendishly difficult jobs in what remain the predominantly male fields of politics and economics. But \"womenomics\" is not just about those who have fought their way to the top, but also those who remains trapped at the bottom.",

      "body": "<p>Women have had a good week. Fresh from cheering President Obama's nomination of Janet Yellen as the new head of the Federal Reserve (though more because of her wisdom than her gender), I woke up on Thursday to a pleasantly discombobulating auditory experience. The <em>Today</em> programme has started my day for more years than I can remember, and on every one of those mornings at least one, and very often both, of the anchors were men. Not that I don't enjoy Evan Davis monstering Danny Alexander or John Humphrys needling the PM; but Thursday's all-female presenting team was a refreshing sign of the times.</p> <p>Should her nomination be confirmed by the Senate, as Washington-watchers expect, Yellen will join Angela Merkel, Dilma Rousseff and Christine Lagarde among a small but growing sisterhood at the peak of world politics and economics. They may be ultra-bright pioneers, but their presence at the summit is encouraging, nevertheless.</p> <p>Before we declare victory in the gender wars, though, we should acknowledge the formidable barriers that still face millions of women worldwide. Just one quirky but important example emerged in <a href=\"http://www.cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=9639#\" title=\"\">a recent academic paper</a>, which \u2013 seeing the world through the super-rational eyes of the economist \u2013 asked whether the continued existence of cows in India disproves the central tenets of capitalism.</p> <p>Many rural Indian families keep a cow, using its milk and selling any surplus. But the authors, Santosh Anagol et al, use an extraordinarily detailed database, plus more information than you ever needed about bovine husbandry, to show that, far from contributing to the family coffers, these cows almost invariably result in a large loss to their owners compared with the wages they could theoretically earn in the local economy.</p> <p>\"If cows and buffaloes earn such low, even negative, economic returns, why would rural Indian households continue to invest in them?\" the economists ask. They consider several explanations, but one very plausible candidate is that because there are in fact so few opportunities for women to earn a few rupees outside the family homestead, their labour is valued by the household as worthless.</p> <p>\"In many locations, the formal labour market for women is essentially non-existent,\" the authors say.

      "bodyText": "Price \u00a324,500 MPG 60.1 Top speed 143mph There were a lot of duvets on the M4 last Sunday. Every other car seemed to have one marshmallowing up the back window alongside the stereo, the half-dead pot plant, the Ikea bag full of clothes\u2026 And squeezed in amongst the baggage you could glimpse the wide eyes and pale face of a first-year student being driven to start the next big chapter of their lives. We had one in the back of our car, too \u2013 all at once nervous, excited, chatty, quiet, laughing, tearful. Earlier that morning we'd left home with neighbours, siblings and a boyfriend waving on the pavement, and now here we were off to university \u2013 18 years gone in a flash. It's a clich\u00e9 to say parenting is all about letting go, but this really felt like it, as if we were on a trapeze, chalk dust glinting in the dark, empty fingers stretched wide\u2026 On the return leg, the tarmac slipping silently under the wheels, I thought about how many of life's defining journeys start, and finish, in a car. Holidays and hospitals, births, weddings, funerals\u2026 the car is always there, playing its supporting role. The car that had witnessed this particular milestone was BMW's 320d Touring \u2013 the posh word for an estate. It's a car that can be all things. It is versatile, innovative, sexy and practical. Over the years it is a car that has eagerly made itself one of the gang in a host of very diverse families, bearing silent witness to all their life dramas. If cars could talk, the 3 Series would\u2026 well, have a series to itself. For my money, the Touring is the most complete car on the road. It's a family car that handles like a sports car; an estate that drives like a saloon; it has a beautiful performance engine that is also incredibly economical. It proves that mutually exclusive concepts can sometimes coexist. BMW makes two estate cars: a larger version for its 5 Series range and this neater, more compact model for the 3 Series line-up. This sixth-generation model is more spacious, more powerful and more economical than the outgoing one. From the front you wouldn't notice much of a difference, but from the waist back BMW has been very clever. It has added a long crease running the length of the body, a huge swoosh, and raked the rear screen. This somehow creates the impression you are sitting in a grand family wagon, yet the car still only has the daintiest of footprints. This makes it brilliant for ducking and diving in the city as well as stretching out on a long run. As a premium motor, it has all kinds of goodies and gadgets to make you feel special. Take the boot, for example. It can be opened by hand, by pressing the fob or by waving your foot under the valance. The glass is also separately hinged and can be opened on its own. Or the headlights \u2013 these are self-activating, self-dipping and directional. They will smartly illuminate the entire road ahead yet somehow cast a shadow only over the car in front so as not to dazzle them. With so much thought going into the lights alone, it's reassuring to imagine the endeavour and ambition applied to the rest of the car's workings. Several engines are available. I drove the one that will be the bestseller \u2013 a 184bhp, 2-litre turbodiesel giving a top speed of 143mph, 0-62mph in 7.7 seconds, fuel consumption of 60.1 mpg and CO2 emissions of just 124g/km. To drive it's smooth, grown-up, embracing, responsive \u2013 a total joy. Motoring home last Sunday night, feeling \u2013 admittedly \u2013 a little emotional, the car almost felt caring, solicitous, a rock in a changing world. And here's the thing about that trapeze: it soon swings them back. BMW roadsters: 1929-2013 BMW entered the world of cars in 1929 and quickly became known as one of the best manufacturers of luxury motor vehicles. Some of its most notable early cars were the roadsters, exciting and attractive roofless toys that tore up the European roads and racetracks. XCAR explores the earliest roadsters from BMW, from the 315/1 and 319/1 to the amazing 328 and look at the post war beauty that was the 507 as well as leaping forward in time to the latest generation of roadsters, the Z series. Nuts about cars In its annual survey of the top motors that premiership footballers are driving, Nuts magazine has revealed that the Range Rover Sport is the car most likely to be seen parked at the training ground. Second and third on the list are the Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7. Here's the full list: 1. Range Rover Sport This year has seen universal love for the daddy of all SUVs. It's fast, it's full of tricks, it looks awesome \u2013 and it was made here in Blighty. A worthy winner! Drivers include: Darren Bent (Aston Villa); Jon Obi Mikel, John Terry (both Chelsea); Scott Parker (Fulham); Luis Suarez (Liverpool); Ryan Giggs, Javier Hernandez, Wayne Rooney (all Man United); Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City); Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur) 2. Porsche Cayenne For the second year, the surly SUV pips its road-hogging rival to second spot. Could it be the speed of the turbo that the prem stars love? Whatever it is, it's still the most popular Porsche ever! Drivers include: Scott Parker (Fulham); Steven Gerrard, Kolo Tour\u00e9 (both Liverpool); Yaya Tour\u00e9 (Man City); Tom Cleverley, Patrice Evra, Robin van Persie, Chris Smalling (all Man United); Younes Kaboul (Tottenham Hotspur); Carlos Cu\u00e9llar (Sunderland) 3 Audi Q7 The sporty R8 got a sound showing further up the top 10, but if it's German muscle the prem's finest are after, the Q7 wins it. Drivers include: Kieran Gibbs, Bacary Sagna (both Arsenal); Fernando Torres (Chelsea); Luis Nani, Rio Ferdinand (both Man United); Steve Nzonzi (Stoke City); Phil Bardsley (Sunderland); Mousa Dembele, Emmanuel Adebayor (both Tottenham Hotspur) Chris Brunt (West Brom) 4. Aston Martin DB9 Since its inception in 2004, this British beast has become a bona fide favourite with the famous football-playing folk. Very cool, very fast, very nice all round! Drivers include: Darren Bent (Aston Villa); Frank Lampard, Juan Mata, Fernando Torres (all Chelsea); Gareth Barry (Everton); Glen Johnson (Liverpool); James Milner (Man City); Peter Crouch, Matthew Etherington (both Stoke City); Jake Livermore (Tottenham Hotspur) 5. Bentley Continental No round-up of top-flight players' preferred wheels would be complete without the GT \u2013 the Downton Abbey of the nation's training ground car parks. Drivers include: Samuel Eto'o, (Chelsea); Glen Johnson, Victor Moses, Martin Skrtel (all Liverpool); Gael Clichy, David Silva (both Man City); Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young (both Man United); Wes Brown (Sunderland); Jermain Defoe (Tottenham Hotspur) 6. Porsche Panamera All the flash of a rubber-burning motor, but with the added bonus of a couple of rear doors. Handy for a queue-busting impromptu outing to Nando's after training. Drivers include: Thomas Vermaelen (Arsenal); Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea); Steven Pienaar (Everton); Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool); Edin Dzeko, Vincent Kompany, Samir Nasri (both Man City); Guly Do Prado (Southampton); Robert Huth (Stoke City) 7. Ferrari 458 It's a warm welcome to this Italian bad-boy \u2013 new to 2013's top 10. The boffins at Ferrari have worked their stylish behinds off to create their most aero efficient motor ever with the 458 Speciale. Drivers include: Mathieu Flamini, Mesut \u00f6zil, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshire (all Arsenal); Frank Lampard, John Terry (both Chelsea); Micah Richards (Man City); Luis Nani (Man United) 8. Lamborghini Gallardo A slightly better showing for the Italian stallion this year, grunting its way two places up the lead-footed league in style. Nice! Drivers include:Gabriel Agbonlahor (Aston Villa); Ashley Cole (Chelsea); Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, David de Gea, Luis Nani, Wayne Rooney (all Man United); Stephen Ireland (Stoke City) 9. Audi R8 The slick style and super six-speed gearbox means it still makes all the right (gleefully grunty) noises for the boys. Drivers include: Petr Cech (Chelsea); Tom Cleverley (Man United); Jos\u00e9 Fonte (Southampton); Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott (both Arsenal); Micah Richards, David Silva (both Man City); Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur) 10. Chevrolet Camaro The General Motors-built beast brings a touch of the NFL to the English Prem. Drivers include: Joe Allen (Liverpool); Alex Buttner, Luis Nani (both Man United); Petr Cech (Chelsea); Tom Huddlestone (Hull City); Cheick Tiot\u00e9 (Newcastle) From the GT40 to the Veyron And finally, a brilliant infographic of the evolution of the supercar.

      "bodyText": "Police officers across the country supplied information on workers to a blacklist operation run by Britain's biggest construction companies, the police watchdog has told lawyers representing victims. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has informed those affected that a Scotland Yard inquiry into police collusion has identified that it is \"likely that all special branches were involved in providing information\" that kept certain individuals out of work. The IPCC's disclosure confirms suspicions voiced by the information commissioner's office last year that the police had been involved in providing some of the information held on the files, as revealed by this newspaper. The admission has been welcomed by campaigners for the 3,200 workers whose names were on the blacklist that was run for construction companies as \"absolute evidence\" of a conspiracy between the state and industry that lasted for decades. Dave Smith, an engineer who had a 36-page file under his name and was repeatedly victimised for highlighting safety hazards on sites, including the presence of asbestos, said he was delighted that the IPCC had revealed \"the truth\". He added: \"For the past five years, when we have been saying the police were involved, we were told we were talking nonsense and it was a conspiracy theory. They wanted it to go away. Now we have the absolute evidence and this is no longer about industrial relations but is a major human rights scandal involving a conspiracy between the police and the industry.\" The blacklist, run by a company called the Consulting Association, funded by 40 major firms in the construction industry including Balfour Beatty and Sir Robert McAlpine, was discovered in 2009 after a raid by the information commissioner's office. Since then, the victims have fought to find out who was providing information against them. The IPCC's correspondence is regarded as a major breakthrough. However, the watchdog's disclosure has been disputed by a subsequent letter to the victims' solicitors. This was sent by a recently appointed senior investigating officer for the inquiry into the activities of undercover police officers, known as Operation Herne. In a letter, seen by the Observer, detective inspector Steve Craddock insists that the IPCC's statement is incorrect and that he has seen \"no conclusive evidence\" that Scotland Yard shared information with the blacklisters. The IPCC is standing by its correspondence, which it says was informed by discussions with the Metropolitan Police and that \"developments since that ... are a matter for the Metropolitan Police\". In response, a spokesman for Craddock said Operation Herne's investigating officer was \"aware of the apparent contradiction and is looking into how that may have arisen\". She added: \"Operation Herne will report on the 'blacklisting' matter to the Metropolitan Police commissioner in due course.\" The developments come as the group fighting for justice for the blacklisted workers has received confirmation of a meeting between undercover police officers and those running the blacklist in November 2008. The information commissioner's officers have confirmed in a freedom of information response that they hold notes from a meeting between the Consulting Association and officers from the police national extremism tactical co-ordination unit, which runs undercover officers. The notes of the 2008 meeting are part of a haul of documents seized by the information commissioner's office when it discovered the existence of the secret blacklist during a raid on an office in Droitwich, Worcestershire. Sir Robert McAlpine, which was allegedly a major player in the establishment and funding of the blacklist, is currently being sued in the high court over an unlawful conspiracy to amass a database of information against thousands of people. Last week, in a dramatic twist, eight major construction companies, including Sir Robert McAlpine, announced that they would compensate some of the 3,213 workers whose names had been on a blacklist. A statement said: \"The companies \u2013 Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O'Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci \u2013 all apologise for their involvement with the Consulting Association and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker.\" Sean Curran, a solicitor representing 69 victims in the high court, said he cautiously welcomed the announcement but raised concerns over the involvement of the unions, which are also suspected of providing information to the blacklist operation in some cases. He said: \"We note that there has been reference to the consultation of Ucatt and Unite in the formulation of the proposed compensation scheme. We express serious concern about the involvement of those organisations. \"We have seen evidence that implicates Amicus (which evolved into Unite) and Ucatt officials in the supply of negative commentary about the suitability of their members for employment. That commentary frequently made its way onto the Consulting Association database and was no doubt one of the factors that led to denials of employment. \"It is also worthy of note that those unions refused to support their members in bringing a High Court claim so that they could seek redress for the hardship that they suffered. Many of those that we represent are firm that they object to Unite or Ucatt playing any part in negotiations with the relevant companies for these reasons.\" Claire Windsor, solicitor for the victims in regard to the complaint over police collusion, said her clients had lost any faith in the ability of the police to investigate themselves and that the blacklist support group was now calling for a judge-led independent inquiry into blacklisting.",
