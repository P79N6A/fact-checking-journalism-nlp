      "bodyText": "Leicester city council yesterday revealed it was preparing to move \u00a36m out of Barclays in protest at the Libor rate-fixing scandal as fresh speculation emerged about the candidates to replace the former chief executive Bob Diamond. As bookmakers Paddy Power stopped taking bets on who would be the new boss after a flurry of wagers backing the head of Barclays' investment bank, Rich Ricci, details of the scandal's potential impact on the bank and the wider industry began to emerge. The row is expected to extend beyond Barclays, and analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon that the 11 or so banks involved in setting the Libor level could be forced to take a combined \u00a314bn hit from litigation and penalties. There is also mounting political anger in the US, with a group of Democratic senators calling on the attorney general, Eric Holder, and financial regulators to step up investigations into the Libor abuses. In the UK, the repercussions have already begun. Rory Palmer, Leicester's deputy city mayor and a Labour councillor, said he would move the council's money. \"People are outraged. I share that anger. Institutional investors have the opportunity to vote with their feet.\" The council, whose intentions were first reported in the Leicester Mercury, has \u00a320m in fixed-term investments with banks, \u00a36m of which are with Barclays and due to expire shortly. Barclays said it never commented on clients. American investor Warren Buffett told CNBC that Diamond had no choice but to resign and said the Libor scandal was a \"big deal\" and a \"can of worms\" that \"shakes your faith in certain institutions\". While Barclays is the first major bank to be hit, Morgan Stanley analysts believe Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank of Germany could be among those at risk of losing the most \u2013 around \u00a3600m \u2013 in litigation. Nine banks have disclosed that they are involved in the industry-wide Libor investigation. The Barclays board, still being chaired by Marcus Agius, met on Thursday amid speculation about the candidates to replace Diamond and Agius himself. Former top accountant Sir Michael Rake is regarded as the most likely board member to replace the chairman, although an external search for the role is also being conducted. In a move that Barclays hopes will undo some of its reputational damage, the bank has extended its sponsorship of Premier League football to 2016 in a three-year deal worth \u00a340m a year, the Premier League said yesterday.

Thirty-six bets were placed on Thursday morning, largely staking between \u00a320 and \u00a340, but there was one for \u00a3500, taking the total amount bet on Ricci to \u00a32,000.

    "webTitle": "UK austerity set to last decades as cost of ageing population rises", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's age of austerity will last much longer than first thought if the UK is to keep up with the escalating costs of an ageing population, the government's independent economic forecaster has said. In its annual check, the Office for Budget Responsibility said Britain's public finances were \"clearly unsustainable\" over the next 50 years, despite George Osborne's round of spending cuts. Even if the government succeeded in saving \u00a3123bn over the next seven years, the OBR said it would need to impose permanent tax increases or reduce spending by 1.1% of GDP \u2013 about \u00a317bn in today's terms \u2013 to return the national debt to pre-crisis levels. If the government continued with current policies, and if those policies succeeded, the OBR said public finances would improve until the mid-2020s. But there would still be a long-term deterioration in the decades that follow. Net public-sector debt is forecast to fall from 74% of GDP in 2016-17 to a low of 57% in the mid-2020s, before rising increasingly fast to reach 89% of GDP in 2061-62. That is an improvement on last year's forecast that debt would reach 107% of GDP by 2061, but the OBR said more still needed to be done. \"On current policy, we would expect the budget deficit to widen sufficiently over the long term to put public-sector net debt on a continuously rising trajectory as a share of national income,\" the report said. \"This is clearly unsustainable.\" The stark report by the OBR shows that the spending cuts will last far longer than the chancellor had planned. In his emergency budget in June 2010 Osborne said he hoped to eliminate the structural budget deficit by the time of the next general election. In his autumn statement last November he announced that, in light of the economy's poor performance, the cuts would have to continue for an extra two years. Labour said the OBR report highlighted the significance of the chancellor's failure to stimulate the economy after speeding up the Treasury's deficit-cutting plans. Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The OBR's report sets out some of the huge challenges facing policymakers over the coming decades, including issues like the rising cost of social care, which this government has so far failed to grasp. \"But the failure of George Osborne's economic plan will make things worse. We are already seeing how the double-dip recession is causing borrowing to go up and an extra \u00a3150bn added to the debt. And Britain will pay a very heavy economic and social price if we continue to have years of slow growth and high long-term unemployment. That is why urgent action is needed now to get the economy moving again.\" The OBR report highlighted the impact of an ageing population by noting that the over-65s are expected to make up 26% of the UK's population by 2061, compared with 17% now. The OBR put the cost of paying for health, pensions and long-term care at an extra \u00a380bn a year in today's money. Recent reforms to public-sector pensions had cut costs by \u00a3175bn, it added. The bulk of those savings, about \u00a3126bn, came from the 2010 decision to make pensions rise in line with the consumer prices index, rather than the retail prices index. As well as the growing burden of paying for elderly people, the OBR noted that falling North Sea oil production was likely to put pressure on revenues over the next 50 years. \"This suggests governments are likely to need to find replacement streams of revenue just to hold the tax burden constant, let alone to meet the upward pressures on spending,\" it said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the OBR report provided a reminder of the challenge of an ageing population and falling tax receipts in key areas of the economy. The IFS said: \"The OBR's second fiscal sustainability report, published today, reminds us of the significant challenges which we face as a result of the spending pressures created by population ageing and a likely loss of tax revenues from motoring and north sea oil and gas companies. We need to respond to this analysis by planning now for the changes to spending and taxes that will be required.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Cable &amp; Wireless Communications</strong> has been on the slide for some time.</p> <p>As its demerged partner Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide saw its value boosted by a successful bid from Vodafone, CWC has fallen close to an all time low. But now the City believes it could be turning the corner. Not only is trading expected to improve, but it has the potential to sell businesses for more than its current beaten-down market capitalisation. Long term bear of the shares, analyst Wilton Fry of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, has now become more optimistic, moving his recommendation from underperform to buy with a 40p price target. He said:</p> <blockquote> We have been long-term bears of CWC based on our view of the underlying trading performance, particularly in the Caribbean. However, we believe the outlook is stabilising. With the share price near its all-time low, and expectations similarly depressed, we believe it is time to revisit the equity story. <br> </blockquote> <p>He said after several years of poor performance in Jamaica, the company could now start to recover market share, while its Bahamas acquisition was settling in well.</p> <p>Crucially, he believes it could sell its assets in Monaco and Macau for more than its total current value:</p> <blockquote> Management has said the future of the group lies in the Panama/Caribbean region. We estimate Monaco is worth around $400m while Macau (using the transaction multiple from the recent sale of a minority stake) is worth around $525m. Together these two assets appear to us to be worth more than 115% of the entire market cap of CWC. <br> </blockquote> <p>The positive analysis helped CWC climb 1.21p to 31.58p - a rise of nearly 4% - on another downbeat day for the market.</p> <p>With disappointment that the US Federal Reserve had not hinted in its latest minutes at more aggressive action to boost the world's largest economy, an unexpected rate cut in South Korea and worries about the outlook for Spain and Italy, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished down 56.23 points at 5608.25. Even reasonable US weekly jobless claims could not improve sentiment. And there was also nervousness ahead of Friday's Chinese GDP figure.</p> <p>David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said:</p> <blockquote> The usual safe havens are in demand once again, as investors opt to abandon equity markets, commodities and some currencies due to fears about slowing global growth. The general downbeat tone is unlikely to end any time soon. EU finance ministers might have opted to wait until September before embarking on real work on a banking union, but if progress is not made soon, the July-August period of 2012 could perhaps be as volatile as its equivalent in 2011. <br> </blockquote> <p>The day's biggest faller in the leading index was <strong>Ashmore</strong>, the emerging markets fund manager. It dropped 22.2p to 307.8p after fourth quarter assets under management fell by 3.3% to $63.7bn - compared with $64.9bn forecast by Numis - with equities dropping by more than a fifth. Sarah Ing at Singer Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> Consensus estimates have been trimmed as weak performance has reduced performance fee potential, but the shares lack any positive catalyst in the near term and we believe the shares could see further weakness as we see consensus for 2013 still too high with [our] estimates 8% lower. </blockquote> <p>Mining shares subsided on worries about a poor GDP number from China, with <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> down 17.3p at 393.6p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> down 107p at \u00a329.26.</p> <p>But <strong>BSkyB</strong> rose 4p to 688p after a boost from analysts at Nomura.</p> <p>Ahead of the satellite broadcaster's fourth quarter results due at the end of the month, the bank's analyst Matthew Walker issued a buy note despite forecasting a dip in quarterly revenues compared to last year. He pointed out there was an extra week in 2011 as well as a David Haye pay per view boxing match, which together added an extra \u00a3110m in sales. He said:</p> <blockquote> Sky provides a good balance of organic growth and cash returns. We would expect the company to indicate it will commence another sizeable buyback when the current one is finished given leverage is still not far from 1 times. While the 40% increase in football rights cost was unexpected and influences thinking about future auctions, we are confident Sky can contain TV competition from BT, many of whose Vision customers don't have much more than Freeview (or for a few Youview). </blockquote> <p>Media shares were already in focus after Japan's Dentsu agreed to buy UK marketing group <strong>Aegis</strong> - up 73.1p at 235/3p - for \u00a33.2bn, with the news lifting advertising giant <strong>WPP</strong> 1p to 785.5p.</p> <p>Security group <strong>G4S</strong> fell 7.4p to 283p after the Guardian revealed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/11/army-reinforcements-olympics\" title=\"\">it may not be able to deliver the number of staff it promised to guard the London Olympics</a>.</p> <p><strong>Intercontinental Hotels</strong> lost 47p to \u00a315.03 following downbeat comments about international markets from US peer Marriott. Numis cut its recommendation on Intercontinental from buy to add, but Investec said the company should report good half year figures in August:</p> <blockquote> Despite some recent concerns over the US economy wavering and continued European weakness, industry data supports our view that the global hotels industry is recovering strongly, with almost no exceptions by territory. Despite second half headwinds in the form of economic uncertainty and tough comparisons, we think upside pressure on our IHG forecasts is hardening and we reiterate our buy stance. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>SuperGroup</strong>, the fashion retailer behind the Superdry brand, for once managed to avoid a profit warning alongside a trading update, and its shares jumped 50.5p to 385p.</p> <p>Its full year results showed a 15% fall in underlying profits to \u00a342.8m, in line with its most recent guidance. This is after three profit warnings in a year, however. It has suffered stock availability, problems with its new warehouse IT system and - the latest setback - \"arithmetic errors.\" All of this has prompted a management shake-up and promises to communicate better with the City and investors. Chief executive officer Julian Dunkerton said:</p> <blockquote> Despite the backdrop, the Superdry brand remains strong and I am encouraged by the potential for our 2013 ranges. We are now committed to growing the group in a controlled and measured way. </blockquote> <p>Finally online gaming group <strong>888</strong> added 9p to 74p after an upbeat trading statement for the second quarter, with growth driven by its casino and poker businesses. It said earnings for the first half would be significantly higher than current expectations. The second half was expected to be hit slightly by the marketing costs of building up its Spanish poker offering and the rival attraction of the London Olympics. But the full year figures would still be higher than previously forecast. Simon Davies at Canaccord Genuity said:</p> <blockquote> Momentum in both poker and casino has remained strong in the second quarter, with a strong poker launch in Spain (where it is number two) and casino boosted by the impact of the platform relaunch. Our 93p target price represents 43% potential upside. We stick at buy. </blockquote>",

Not only is trading expected to improve, but it has the potential to sell businesses for more than its current beaten-down market capitalisation. Long term bear of the shares, analyst Wilton Fry of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, has now become more optimistic, moving his recommendation from underperform to buy with a 40p price target. He said: We have been long-term bears of CWC based on our view of the underlying trading performance, particularly in the Caribbean. However, we believe the outlook is stabilising. With the share price near its all-time low, and expectations similarly depressed, we believe it is time to revisit the equity story. He said after several years of poor performance in Jamaica, the company could now start to recover market share, while its Bahamas acquisition was settling in well. Crucially, he believes it could sell its assets in Monaco and Macau for more than its total current value: Management has said the future of the group lies in the Panama/Caribbean region. We estimate Monaco is worth around $400m while Macau (using the transaction multiple from the recent sale of a minority stake) is worth around $525m. Together these two assets appear to us to be worth more than 115% of the entire market cap of CWC. The positive analysis helped CWC climb 1.21p to 31.58p - a rise of nearly 4% - on another downbeat day for the market. With disappointment that the US Federal Reserve had not hinted in its latest minutes at more aggressive action to boost the world's largest economy, an unexpected rate cut in South Korea and worries about the outlook for Spain and Italy, the FTSE 100 finished down 56.23 points at 5608.25. Even reasonable US weekly jobless claims could not improve sentiment. And there was also nervousness ahead of Friday's Chinese GDP figure. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said: The usual safe havens are in demand once again, as investors opt to abandon equity markets, commodities and some currencies due to fears about slowing global growth. The general downbeat tone is unlikely to end any time soon. EU finance ministers might have opted to wait until September before embarking on real work on a banking union, but if progress is not made soon, the July-August period of 2012 could perhaps be as volatile as its equivalent in 2011. The day's biggest faller in the leading index was Ashmore, the emerging markets fund manager. It dropped 22.2p to 307.8p after fourth quarter assets under management fell by 3.3% to $63.7bn - compared with $64.9bn forecast by Numis - with equities dropping by more than a fifth. Sarah Ing at Singer Capital Markets said: Consensus estimates have been trimmed as weak performance has reduced performance fee potential, but the shares lack any positive catalyst in the near term and we believe the shares could see further weakness as we see consensus for 2013 still too high with [our] estimates 8% lower. Mining shares subsided on worries about a poor GDP number from China, with Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation down 17.3p at 393.6p and Rio Tinto down 107p at \u00a329.26. But BSkyB rose 4p to 688p after a boost from analysts at Nomura. Ahead of the satellite broadcaster's fourth quarter results due at the end of the month, the bank's analyst Matthew Walker issued a buy note despite forecasting a dip in quarterly revenues compared to last year. He pointed out there was an extra week in 2011 as well as a David Haye pay per view boxing match, which together added an extra \u00a3110m in sales. He said: Sky provides a good balance of organic growth and cash returns. We would expect the company to indicate it will commence another sizeable buyback when the current one is finished given leverage is still not far from 1 times. While the 40% increase in football rights cost was unexpected and influences thinking about future auctions, we are confident Sky can contain TV competition from BT, many of whose Vision customers don't have much more than Freeview (or for a few Youview). Media shares were already in focus after Japan's Dentsu agreed to buy UK marketing group Aegis - up 73.1p at 235/3p - for \u00a33.2bn, with the news lifting advertising giant WPP 1p to 785.5p. Security group G4S fell 7.4p to 283p after the Guardian revealed it may not be able to deliver the number of staff it promised to guard the London Olympics. Intercontinental Hotels lost 47p to \u00a315.03 following downbeat comments about international markets from US peer Marriott. Numis cut its recommendation on Intercontinental from buy to add, but Investec said the company should report good half year figures in August: Despite some recent concerns over the US economy wavering and continued European weakness, industry data supports our view that the global hotels industry is recovering strongly, with almost no exceptions by territory. Despite second half headwinds in the form of economic uncertainty and tough comparisons, we think upside pressure on our IHG forecasts is hardening and we reiterate our buy stance. Elsewhere SuperGroup, the fashion retailer behind the Superdry brand, for once managed to avoid a profit warning alongside a trading update, and its shares jumped 50.5p to 385p. Its full year results showed a 15% fall in underlying profits to \u00a342.8m, in line with its most recent guidance. This is after three profit warnings in a year, however. It has suffered stock availability, problems with its new warehouse IT system and - the latest setback - \"arithmetic errors.\" All of this has prompted a management shake-up and promises to communicate better with the City and investors. Chief executive officer Julian Dunkerton said: Despite the backdrop, the Superdry brand remains strong and I am encouraged by the potential for our 2013 ranges. We are now committed to growing the group in a controlled and measured way. Finally online gaming group 888 added 9p to 74p after an upbeat trading statement for the second quarter, with growth driven by its casino and poker businesses. It said earnings for the first half would be significantly higher than current expectations. The second half was expected to be hit slightly by the marketing costs of building up its Spanish poker offering and the rival attraction of the London Olympics. But the full year figures would still be higher than previously forecast. Simon Davies at Canaccord Genuity said: Momentum in both poker and casino has remained strong in the second quarter, with a strong poker launch in Spain (where it is number two) and casino boosted by the impact of the platform relaunch. Our 93p target price represents 43% potential upside. We stick at buy.",

      "body": "<p>The July 4 holiday week provided a surprising boost to America's job market as the number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits fell to a four-year low.</p> <p>About 350,000 people filed for initial jobless claims in the week ended July 7, down 26,000 from the previous week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure marks the lowest level of claims since March 2008.

      "bodyText": "The July 4 holiday week provided a surprising boost to America's job market as the number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits fell to a four-year low. About 350,000 people filed for initial jobless claims in the week ended July 7, down 26,000 from the previous week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure marks the lowest level of claims since March 2008. Economists had been expecting 375,000 claims last week. The news comes after last week's disappointing monthly non-farm payroll jobs report and at a time when the government jobs statistics have emerged as a key battleground for the 2012 election. The US economy added just 80,000 new jobs in June, according to the latest non-farm report. The figure is well below the 100,000 that economists calculate the economy needs to stand still and less than half the 200,000-plus the jobs market was adding each month in the winter. Jobless claims are a closely watched economic indicator, correlated with layoffs, and while the latest weekly figures were better than expected, analysts cautioned that factors including the July 4 holiday for example, could have distorted the figures. BTIG chief global strategist Dan Greenhaus also pointed out that seasonal shutdowns in the auto-industry may also have played a part in boosting the number. This year fewer car plants closed, in part to keep up with growing order. \"We absolutely do not believe this is a 'real' number,\" he wrote in a note to clients. The jobless claims numbers have, however, fallen for three weeks in a row and the four-week moving average of claims, seen as a more-reliable measure, fell by 9,750 to 376,500 \u2013 its lowest level since late May. Last week's monthly figures were a blow to President Barack Obama who said the pace of recovery needed to pick up. \"It's still tough out there,\" he told reporters after the numbers were released. Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican challenger, called them a \"kick in the gut\".",

The revelation of the unexpected \"restructuring plan\" from one of the pillars of French industry prompted an instant response from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's Socialist government. Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he was \"extremely concerned by the unprecedented scale\" of the company's reorganisation which he added was a \"real shock\" for staff, the communities affected and \"for the entire car industry\". \"Given the social consequences of the proposed plan, we need to have a good look at causes of company's current situation that have led to this plan, the consequences to the regions and to the automobile sector, as well as the guarantees the group can offer regarding the long term industrial activity of the group's [other] sites,\" said the PM's office in a statement. \"PSA has specifically promised to find an employment solution for every member of staff.

Ayrault instructed the company to begin immediate talks with workers' unions and called company and union leaders to meet with Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for re-industrialisation before the end of July.

Of the 8,000 job losses, 6,500 are expected to be voluntary redundancies and 1,500 workers will be redeployed elsewhere in the company, PSA said. Three thousand jobs will go at the company's Aulnay production line and research and development centre outside Paris, along with 1,400 posts at Rennes and 3,600 non-production jobs \u2013 including 1,407 in research and development, 1,325 jobs in industrial management, 570 jobs from brand management and 284 other managers.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Britain's biggest business lobby group has attacked the government for failing to boost the economy after a series of delays to infrastructure projects. John Cridland, the director general of the CBI, said ministers were in many cases too busy infighting to agree funding for projects that needed government support. He warned that essential upgrades to roads and funding for renewable energy were being held up while the economy continued to suffer. \"I think it is really disappointing how long it is taking to get momentum and urgency into the growth plan,\" he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Worries that the eurozone crisis will continue to drag down UK growth have been fuelled in recent weeks by figures showing that the double-dip recession may prove longer than expected. \"The risks that the eurozone headwinds can really flatten the economy are still pretty considerable,\" he said. Cridland has become increasingly frustrated with the coalition government after months of delays to infrastructure projects put forward by industry with civil servant support. The CBI published its own wish list last year for a series of projects around the country it said would get the wheels of the economy moving and create vital jobs. He criticised Justine Greening's transport department for stalling on the construction of a possible toll road to unblock the congested A14 route, which carries container traffic to the port of Felixstowe in Suffolk. \"On Justine Greening's desk is an options report from officials following a call for evidence,\" he said, adding that practical results were need quickly: \"I was talking about diggers on the ground.\" He said officials seemed \"dazzled in the headlights\" \u2013 a reference to the apparent paralysis he sees in Whitehall ministries covering a range of policy areas. Green energy initiatives have become a battleground between the chancellor, George Osborne, and energy minister, Ed Davey, over future subsidy levels for renewable energy and wind. Cridland said it was creating uncertainty in a sector which needed to think in the long term. \"It's got stuck in a political row,\" he said. \"The economics of it are blindingly obvious.\" The CBI is in favour of a revamped private finance initiative which it expects the Treasury to unveil in the budget next March. Last year Osborne signalled his eagerness to get pension funds and other big investors to back large infrastructure projects. But without a coherent policy in place, institutional investors had proved reluctant. Cridland said he supports the chancellor's austerity measures, but argued they needed to be matched by a more energetic approach to infrastructure investment.",
