An announcement by Qatar Holding, the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund, that it would abstain on the key vote on pay deals worth \u00a3140m for Xstrata staff was seen as a major embarrassment for City grandee Sir John Bond who is to chair the enlarged mining and trading conglomerate. He is currently the chairman of Xstrata but shareholders were questioning his future on Thursday night. One investor said: \"He'll be gone by the end of the football season [in May].\" While the tie-up is expected to go ahead, Xstrata's outgoing chief executive Mick Davis, who met Qatar's senior officers on Monday in Doha, was said to be deeply disappointed and baffled by their decision not to vote on the retention deals, which were to be handed to 70 key staff. Qatar owns 13% of the shares in Xstrata and has already helped force up the price Glencore is paying to consume the mining company. Until the announcement at 7am, Xstrata was confident Qatar regarded the \u00a3140m package as irrelevant given the size of the deal, which will create a global powerhouse in the commodities sector. The deal is to go to a shareholder vote on 20 November \u2013 a previous attempt to put the deal to investors had to be abandoned after Qatar demanded a higher price. The Xstrata board had recommended that shareholders support the deal together with the retention packages, even though they are unpopular with many investors because of the multi-million pay awards for individuals whose names have never been revealed. Shareholders pointed out that the possibility that the deal will go through \u2013 but not the pay deals \u2013 would present a major difficulty for the Xstrata board after next week's vote. \"It raises questions about the credibility of the whole board. They will look ridiculous,\" another investor said. Glencore, which trades commodities around the world from its base in Zug, Switzerland, already owns 34% of Xstrata and has been trying to merge with the mining company since February.

So we can expect to have higher incomes over the longer term to pay for what we need. As people live longer and with better healthcare there will be pressures on our higher incomes.

      "bodyText": "It's now firmly odds-on that Xstrata and Glencore will combine. That's the effect of the statement from Qatar Holding, owner of 13% of Xstrata, that it will vote in favour of the deal. The only loose piece of the jigsaw is regulatory approval, notably in the EU; there is a chance of serious interference but it's not the way to bet. But, given the tortuous passage of this \"merger of equals\", there had to be a twist. Sure enough, it came: the Qataris said they will abstain on the vote on the \u00a3140m post-deal retention package for Xstrata's top 70 managers. That's significant. First, it undermines the authority of Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond. The recommendation to shareholders from Bond and the Xstrata board was crystal clear: only back the deal with the supposed \"safety\" element of the \u00a3140m package. The argument was that the \"value proposition\" would be \"at risk\" if the executives didn't get their giant carrots; rivals would swoop in pursuit of their supposedly rare talents. Without the support of Qatar, the retention payments will probably be rejected. In that circumstance, it's hard to imagine Bond being able to carry on as chairman of the combined business. He has had two cracks at designing an acceptable package \u2013 the first didn't contain performance conditions and the second, after an outcry, did. If the revised version is shot down, Bond's investors will have ignored his advice on a resolution he promoted as critical. His time is up. The second conclusion is that \u2013 farcically \u2013 the bulk of the \u00a3140m may be paid anyway. Glencore, with its business heavily skewed towards trading, may not wish to risk the departure of too many Xstrata managers of mines. Away from the heated atmosphere of a bid, including the heightened disclosure requirements, it ought to be a simple matter for Glencore to pay whatever it wants. And Glencore, we know, pays well. The third point is that Qatar Holding is an odd beast. Abstaining on the retention package looks like a cop-out. On one hand, the fund argued that \"retaining Xstrata staff is of critical importance to the successful and stable integration of the two companies\"; on the other, it said it is \"conscious of the sensitivities concerning governance issues in the UK\" and so does not wish to influence the outcome. Come on, Qatar, you played a blinder in forcing Glencore to increase its terms from 2.8 shares to 3.05. Why come over all shy at the 11th hour? One way to square Qatar's statement is this: the fund has no problem with retention payments but it does have a problem with being seen as supportive. Disingenuous? Tactically wise? Take your pick. Alternatively, Qatar regards elements of the package as obscene. But if so, just say so, you're the kingmaker here. Either way, Doha should know this: if you own 13% of a large FTSE 100 company you're part of the governance debate whether you like it or not.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the European Central Bank has warned that time is running out to resolve the crisis in the eurozone as the latest figures showed the 17 nations of the single currency have slid into a double-dip recession. With financial markets convinced that even worse data will emerge over the winter, Mario Draghi urged policy makers to take full advantage of the breathing space won by the ECB when it announced in the summer it would buy unlimited amounts of government bonds from troubled euro zone countries. \"With the ECB unconventional measures, we have been able to steady the course ... We have gained precious time, but this is not infinite\", Draghi said in a speech in Milan. Shares fell on all the major European bourses after officials in Brussels announced that the euro zone was officially back in recession after a 0.1% fall in output in the third quarter. The decline followed a 0.2% drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund announced that she was cutting short a visit to Asia in order to hold more talks with European policy makers about how to end the crisis. Lagarde has been urging swifter action to reduce Greece's debts to a sustainable level, but Angela Merkel ruled out the possibility that European governments would accept losses on their holdings of Greek bonds. \"I hope the time is near when we can reach the solution that is needed\", Merkel said after a meeting with the French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. \"Of course we did not talk about debt haircuts, you know our view and that has not changed, nor should it.\" Greece, where the economy shrank at an annual rate of almost 8% in the third quarter, is pressing George Osborne for details of Greek citizens who have moved funds into HSBC accounts in the tax haven of Jersey. Greece's finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, has written to the chancellor after the names of Greek citizens turned up on the list of HSBC account holders. \"We had no idea about their existence and were surprised when their names were included on the list recently made public by HSBC,\" said a senior finance ministry official. \"The minister sent the letter because he wants to get to the bottom of it. Tax evasion is one of our biggest problems.\" Germany and France - the two biggest economies in the eurozone - posted modest growth of 0.2% in the third quarter, but this was more than offset by the recession spreading northwards from the countries on the single currency's southern periphery. Germany's growth rate has slowed since the start of 2012, when it was expanding at a quarterly rate of 0.5%. France's growth was a surprise to the markets amid fears that it was heading back into recession. The growth followed data revisions which turned a flat economy in the second quarter into a 0.1% contraction. As expected, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus all saw their economies contract in the third quarter, but the biggest surprise was the sharp 1.1% quarterly fall in Netherlands GDP, which was more than five times as large as the expected 0.2% drop. Austria posted a 0.1% decline in output. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said: \"The business surveys point to far worse to come throughout the region in the fourth quarter. With austerity starting to hit French households and German unemployment beginning to rise, the outlook for domestic spending is bleak even in the core.\" She expects eurozone GDP to shrink by up to 0.7% this year, and another 2.5% in 2013. Economists said the data could prompt the European Central Bank to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.5% sooner rather than later. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: \"Indeed, an interest rate cut in December is very possible.\" Michael Taylor of Lombard Street Research, said: Weak growth in Germany and France in Q3 did not prevent another quarterly fall in real GDP in the euro area as a whole. This tips the EA economy back into recession, where it is likely to stay well into 2013. Fiscal retrenchment, low confidence levels and a weak economy all point to ongoing contraction in the euro.\" Dutch decline The big surprise in the eurozone GDP figures was the triple-A rated Netherlands, whose economy shrank by a dramatic 1.1% in the third quarter, far worse than expected, with economists having forecast a fall in output of just 0.2%. Business and consumer confidence remain low and economists now warn that the Netherlands faces the prospect of another quarter of decline and its third recession in three years. So, what went wrong? First, the Netherlands processes a lot of trade into and out of Europe. Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank said: \"If we look at the Netherlands as a big harbour, it reacts very sensitively to the gyrations of global trade. Just as London is disproportionately affected by the ups and downs of the global financial market, the Netherlands is disproportionately affected by the ups and downs of trade.\" Then there is the stinging Dutch austerity programme. The new coalition government recently announced \u20ac16bn of new austerity measures on top of already significant cuts. Economists say the rise in VAT from 19% to 21%, in particular, is punishing already stretched household budgets. Wages fell 1% in real terms last year, while unemployment has been rising since the middle of last year and is at a 15-year high. That combined with the ongoing eurozone crisis have battered consumer and business morale, in turn hitting investment. Last quarter's GDP was dragged lower by shrinking investment across the board. Business investment has dropped by almost 6% since the third quarter last year, while government investment shrank by 8.4%.",

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed, and with the eurozone in recession it's not surprise that it's been another down day. Worries about the US fiscal cliff and tension in the Middle East have also combined to unsettle investors. \u2022 The FTSE 100 is down 0.77% or 44.26 points to 5677.75 \u2022 Germany's Dax has fallen 0.82% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.52% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has finished down 0.59% \u2022 The Athens market is 0.84% lower \u2022 But Spain's Ibex has bucked the downward trend, up 0.29% On that note, it's time to draw things to a close. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece there appears to be movement on the tax evasion front, reports our correspondent Helena Smith With Greek baying eor punishment to be meted out to tax cheats, the country's finance minister Yiannis Stournaras has today written to George Osborne asking for further information on Greek citizens who were recently revealed to hold offshore accounts with HSBC in the channel isle of Jersey. \"We had no idea about their existence and were surprised when their names were included on the list recently made public by HSBC,\" said a senior finance ministry official. \"The minister sent the letter because he wants to get to the bottom of it. Tax evasion is one of our biggest problems.\" An estimated 57,000 Greeks are believed to have transferred banks deposits abroad since the debt crisis' oubtreak in Athens in late 2009. In a separate development, the finance minister announced that the country was also poised to dispatch letters to some 15,000 Greeks who moved a \u20ac5bn abroad without declaring it to tax authorities. \"More than \u20ac2bn of that amount could be recouped in taxes,\" said the finance ministry official. \"Ordinary Greeks who are suffering from so much austeirty want to see some action.\" German chancellor Angela Merkel has once again rejected the idea that governments should take a loss on their loans to Greece. While calling on European finance ministers to find a quick solution to Greece's financial problems she told reporters at a joint press conference with French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault: I hope the time is near when we can reach the solution that is needed. Of course we did not talk about debt haircuts, you know our view and that has not changed, nor should it. According to Reuters, Ayrault added: The moment of decision regarding Greece is approaching. The important thing is to do everything to keep Greece in the eurozone, there is a consensus on this essential point. Not everything surely, if debt haircuts have been ruled out. More downbeat news from the US. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of business confidence fell by 10.7 points in November, compared to a 5.7 point rise in October, the worst result since July. Could there be a breakthrough with Greece? A spokesman for the IMF has said it has done what it could to help the country reach debt sustainability. According to Reuters, IMF spokesman William Murray told reporters: Clearly there have to be other actions taken to reach debt sustainability. That seems to mean Greece's European lenders need to do more but he would not spell out what actions were necessary. The IMF wants lenders to write-down some of their debt, something Germany for one is not happy with. Then came this: Update It seems the extended debt maturity refers to past rule changes, not a new development. Oh well, we could hope... Back with recession watch, Denmark is likely to join those reporting an economic downturn, according to its finance minister. In an interview with Reuters, Bjarne Corydon said the third quarter could see a second successive fall in output, following a 0.4% decline in the previous three months. This meets the technical definition of a recession. He said economic growth for the whole year could fall short of the government's forecast of 0.9%, but he expected a rebound to 1.7% in 2013. He said: Our general view is that 2012 is going to be a disappointing year, mostly just because of the developments in Europe... and sustained uncertainty over the eurozone. Mario Draghi's speech which we referred to earlier has been published in full on the ECB website. More on Spain's decision to help people struggling with their mortgage payments. Martin Roberts in Madrid writes: Spain\u2019s cabinet has just passed a decree freezing the final stage of seizing homes for two years for the most needy following public outrage over recent suicides of people who were about to be evicted. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said families earning up to \u20ac1,597 a month will be eligible, as will large families, or those with children aged under three or disabled dependants. Unemployed debtors or those not eligible for unemployment benefit will also be covered. \u201cThe overdue rate on mortgages is above 3%. There are many people who punctually meet their mortgage payments,\u201d de Guindos told a news conference after the cabinet meeting. \u201cThe decree is for especially vulnerable members of society. The government thinks it is urgent to defend them.\u201d De Guindos also gave details of the \u201cbad bank\u201d due to be set up this month to pick up toxic assets from Spain\u2019s ailing banks, a pre-condition for receiving funds from a European bailout worth up to \u20ac100 bn. \u201cThe company (bad bank) will have a m\u00e1ximum limit of \u20ac90 bn although the amount is expected to be around \u20ac60 bn,\u201d de Guindos said. \u201cThe average price adjustment at which assets will be transferred from Banks to the holding company will be 50%.\u201d. Disappointing data from the US, although Hurricane Sandy can shoulder some of the blame. The number of people making new claims for jobless benefits rose to an 18 month high last week, up by 78.000 to 439,000, well above the forecast of 375,000. Meanwhile consumer prices rose 0.1% in October - partly due to a rise in rent charges - and manufacturing activity in New York state slowed in November for the fourth month in a row. US futures - showing a 14 point decline before the figures - are now down 26 points. Back with Spain, and the government has just approved a plan to suspend forced evictions for two years for the most needy who are no longer able to pay their mortgages. More soon. With the eurozone in recession, here's a graphic showing GDP growth (or lack of it) among a number of major economies, including the US as well as Europe. IMF head Christine Lagarde will have to pass up the joys of Cambodia for (yet another) meeting in Brussels next week. She is currently on a visit to Asia but has cut this short to head back for more talks about tackling the eurozone crisis. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice, quoted on Reuters, said: The managing director will participate in the eurogroup meeting on 20 November as she usually does and that will mean shortening her current trip to Asia. She was due to attend a meeting of ASEAN nations early next week, but she may face a more fractious get-together instead. At a news conference in Brussels earlier this week, disagreements between the IMF and the eurogroup flared up. Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said Greece should be given extra time to lower its debt-to-GDP target, while Lagarde wanted the country to meet its original target. The latest hope is that Tuesday's meeting will finally give the go-ahead for Greece's aid package, which would at least be something. But the disagreements are nowhere near resolved. According to Belgian paper De Standaard ECB governing council member Luc Coene said today that part of Greece's debt would probably have to be writen down to help solve the country's problems. This is anathema to the likes of Germany, of course, which has repeatedly rejected the idea. Coene also reportedly said Spain urgently needed a bailout. Earlier there were reports that Spain could be seeking help directly from the IMF rather than a bailout, but this appears to have been denied by the country's economy secretary Fernando Jimenez. It appears that a German diplomat was involved in an incident with irate citizens in Greece today, as anger against Berlin boiled over. The BBC has the story: Protesters in Greece's second city, Thessaloniki, have hurled coffee at a German diplomat amid resentment over austerity measures advocated by Berlin. They broke into a conference centre where mayors of Greek and German cities were due to meet. It was not immediately known if the diplomat had been hurt. The incident was provoked, I think, by comments made by German deputy labour minister Hans-Joachim Fuchtel. He claimed that studies had found that 1,000 German local civil servants could do the work of 3,000 Greeks. This video clip appears to show German Consul Wolfgang Hoelscher-Obermaier being targeted today That's via Keep Talking Greece which has more details. And on that note, I've got to dash so Nick Fletcher has the controls.... Thanks all. GW While we were digesting the news of the eurozone recession, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi was making another attempt to urge policymakers to resolve the crisis. Speaking at Bocconi University in Milan, Draghi warned that the current market calm will not last for ever. Leaders must take advantage of the lull to dispel once and for all the uncertainties that hang over the single European currency, he added. Here's Draghi's key quote: With the ECB unconventional measures, we have been able to steady the course...We have gained precious time, but this is not infinite. It's now almost four months since Draghi declared that the euro was irreversible. He must be frustrated that little has been achieved since. We still don't even have a decision on Greece's aid package - although I see that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has just announced that this will definitely happen next Tuesday.... Greece has definitely dodged the risk of defaulting tomorrow. This morning Athens raised nearly \u20ac940m in short term bonds. Added to the \u20ac4.1bn of bills sold on Tuesday, and it has the resources to cover the \u20ac5bn debt that matures on Friday. Panic over As RobertSchuman pointed out in the comments below, new data has shown rising immigration in Germany, with another half a million people arriving in Europe's biggest economy in the first half of 2012. My colleague Nadine Schimroszik has looked into it, and notes that the number of people that moved to Germany from recession-hit Greece, Spain and Portugal rose more than 50% compared to a year earlier. Nadine adds: According to provisional results from the Federal Statistical Office today, the number of Greeks that immigrated jumped by 78%. The immigration from Spain to Europe\u2019s biggest economy increased by 53%, exactly the same with Portugal. All three countries are struggling with massive austerity measures and very high unemployment rates. Overall, 501.000 people moved to Germany from January to June, and the majority were EU citizens. That is an increase of 15% compared to 2011. Many thanks again to everyone who has shared their photos from yesterday's pan-European protests -- more have been arriving today. My colleague Hannah Waldram has now created a handy gallery to let you browse them: Here's a round-up of today's quarterly GDP data by country (it's not exhaustive as several countries haven't released data yet). Belgium: 0.0% Bulgaria: + 0.1% Czech Republic: - 0.3% Germany: + 0.2% Estonia: +1.7% Spain: - 0.3% France: + 0.2% Italy: - 0.2% Cyprus: - 0.5% Latvia: + 1.7% Lithuania: + 1.3% Hungary: - 0.2% Netherlands: -1.1% Austria: -0.1% Portugal: - 0.8% Romania: - 0.5% Slovakia: +0.6% Finland: + 0.3% United Kingdom: +1.0% Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, warns that the eurozone is likely to keep contracting in the fourth quarter of 2012, perhaps by as much as 0.5%. He writes: Clearly, parts of the Euro Zone are suffering grievously from slow growth, frighteningly high levels of unemployment and falling living standards. The fact that euro zone GDP still fell even when Germany and France were growing indicates that activity was falling quite fast in some of the smaller economies. The problems of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy have been well documented: the worry in today\u2019s numbers was that \u201ccore\u201d countries like Austria and the Netherlands saw their economies shrink in the third quarter. For Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande, the worrying message from the data is that the contagion is spreading from the periphery to the core. Larry points out that the prospects not much brighter for next year. Greece has just signed up to another batch of spending cuts, the Spanish economy is in freefall and Germany will continue to struggle all the while world trade remains weak. European banks remain in a parlous state and would go under without life support from the European Central Bank and national governments. The first half of 2013 will be grim. My colleague @nickvanmead had swiftly created an interactive map showing today's GDP data for the whole EU. It lets you see which countries are back in recession, and which are still managing to grow. Click here to see it: Eurozone falls back into recession Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight points out that the eurozone has effectively been in recession for some time, even if GDP data only confirmed it this morning. Unemployment, for example, has been hitting new double-digit record highs for months. Archer adds: Latest data and survey evidence remain generally weak, and the odds currently strongly favour the Eurozone suffering further GDP contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012. Significantly, Germany looks to be in severe danger of contracting in the fourth quarter, as does France. And Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said: The business surveys point to far worse to come throughout the region in the fourth quarter. With austerity starting to hit French households and German unemployment beginning to rise, the outlook for domestic spending is bleak even in the core. Eurostat's official statement announcing that the eurozone is in recession is online here. The news of the eurozone recession hasn't spooked the markets, although there had been some optimism this morning that the growth in Germany and France might help the region dodge a second contraction. Here's some early reaction from economists and analysts: This is the second time that the eurozone has tumbled into recession since the financial crisis began in 2008. It has been inching towards a slump since the euro crisis flared up a year ago, as this quarterly GDP data shows: Q3 2012: -0.1% (just released) Q2 2012: -0.2% Q1 2012: 0% Q4 2011: -0.3% On a year-on-year basis, the eurozone economy is now 0.6% smaller than a year ago, driven by the slump in peripheral economies. The wider European Union managed growth of +0.1% during the last three months, so has shrunk by 0.4% over the last 12 months. The eurozone is officially in recession! Eurostat has just reported that GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter of the year. That follows the 0.2% contraction in the previous three months - and means the eurozone is in its second recession since the financial crisis began in 2008. More to follow Yesterday's strikes mass and protests may have been dramatic, but the Wall Street Journal questions whether it will force a change of direction in Europe: The WSJ reckons that leaders are \"inured to protests\" after four years of economic distress, adding: Protest fatigue, declining levels of unionization and factionalism within the labor movement have combined to take much of the bite out of strikes as tools for changing government policy, analysts said. More here: Big Europe Strikes Have Little Effect UK retail sales took a nasty fall in October, down 0.8%. The data, just released, suggests Britain is weakening. The Office for National Statistics said consumers cut back on clothing, food and fuel \u2013 all signs of people hunkering down. We'll have a full story shortly. This morning's dire GDP data from the Netherlands (a 1.1% contraction in just three months), appears to be clear evidence that the eurocrisis has now struck deep at the previously-secure North: Another twist - Italy's GDP has beaten expectations. The Italian economy shrank by 0.2% in the third quarter -- a much smaller decline than the 0.8% slump suffered in Q2. That's an encouraging sign - and may suggest that the euro area manages to dodge recession (we'll find out in an hour) Some alarming data from the Netherlands -- its GDP tumbled by 1.1% in Q3, compared to the previous quarter. Economists had only expected a decline of 0.2%. The Dutch economy has already been in, and out, of recession twice since the crisis began. It appears to be heading into another slump: Bad news for Austria - it's GDP fell by 0.1% in the last quarter; its first quarterly contraction since the financial crisis began in 2008. Austria had appeared immune from the worst effects of the euro crisis, with unemployment rates below 5% - but it's another sign that Europe's core is now being hit. Spain's economy shrunk by 0.3% in the last quarter, officials confirmed this morning. That's in line with the provisional data released earlier this month. Finland's statistics office has reported that the country has shrunk by 1% over the last 12 months, based on September's GDP. Full quarterly data wasn't released. Economists had expected that today's data would show that the eurozone shrank by -0.1% in the last quarter, following the 0.2% contraction in the previous three months. That would mean recession. However, the better-than-expected data from France and Germany has prompted some rethinking. We'll find out at 10am GMT. The UK actually grew five times faster than France or Germany in the third quarter (The Olympics helped Britain expand by 1% between July and September). But before local readers dig out the Jubilee bunting, we should note that Moody's warned late last night that it will revisit the UK's AAA rating early next year. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, explains that Moody's will probably strip Britain of its prized triple-A if the country sinks back into recession. In its annual health check on Britain, Moody's served notice to the chancellor that it would be carefully monitoring how he managed the difficult balancing act between growth and deficit reduction over the coming months. The ratings firm said it had not yet decided whether to cut Britain's credit rating but said it could act in the new year either if growth prospects worsened or if Osborne failed to stick to a demanding timetable for reducing national debt. Europe's biggest economy is clearly feeling the effects of the eurozone crisis, but it's refusing to buckle. Germany's growth of 0.2% in the last quarter is weaker than Q2's +0.3%, or the 0.5% in the first three months of the year. But it's also stronger than the meagre 0.1% growth economists had expected. Germany's statistical office said foreign demand made \"positive contributions\" to gross domestic product in the third quarter, with private consumption also higher. Carsten Brzeski, ING economist, said Germany's strong labor market, wage increases and exports were all keeping it afloat. City experts had predicted another quarter of flat GDP for France, but actually its economy posted rare growth - 0.2% in the last quarter. It's not all good news - GDP for the second three months of 2012 was revised down to -0.1%. But still no recession. It's a much-needed tonic for president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, whose attempts to implement spending cuts and labour reforms have killed his post-election honeymoon. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other major events across the world economy. After Wednesday's public protests, today is much more about economics -- has the eurozone fallen into recession? GDP data for the third quarter of 2012 is being released this morning \u2013 and the early numbers are surprisingly positive. France's economy expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter, defying predictions that it would finally slide into recession. And in the last few minutes, Germany has also reported 0.2% GDP growth between July and September. That's a slowdown on earlier in the year, but still growth. So it's possible that the eurozone may be in better shape than economists feared. We'll be tracking the data all morning, along with full reaction to yesterday's protests (if you missed them or want to relive the drama, yesterday's live blog covers the full story - from pre-dawn protests to the final rally in Madrid). There's also a meeting between Mario Draghi and Mario Monti in Milan today.",

IMF spokesman Gerry Rice, quoted on Reuters, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The managing director will participate in the eurogroup meeting on 20 November as she usually does and that will mean shortening her current trip to Asia.</p> </blockquote> <p>She was due to attend a meeting of ASEAN nations early next week, but she may face a more fractious get-together instead. At a news conference in Brussels earlier this week, disagreements between the IMF and the eurogroup flared up. Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said Greece should be given extra time to lower its debt-to-GDP target, while Lagarde wanted the country to meet its original target.</p> <p>The latest hope is that Tuesday's meeting will finally give the go-ahead for Greece's aid package, which would at least be something.</p> <p>But the disagreements are nowhere near resolved. According to Belgian paper De Standaard ECB governing council member Luc Coene said today that part of Greece's debt would probably have to be writen down to help solve the country's problems. This is anathema to the likes of Germany, of course, which has repeatedly rejected the idea.</p> <p>Coene also reportedly said Spain urgently needed a bailout.</p> <p>Earlier there were reports that Spain could be seeking help directly from the IMF rather than a bailout, but this appears to have been denied by the country's economy secretary Fernando Jimenez.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-15T13:30:32.112Z\">at 1.30pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50a4e66eb579ba9bb5261d2d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-15T12:56:14.871Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Protests against German diplomat in Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It appears that a German diplomat was involved in an incident with irate citizens in Greece today, as anger against Berlin boiled over.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20338529\">The BBC has the story</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Protesters in Greece's second city, Thessaloniki, have hurled coffee at a German diplomat amid resentment over austerity measures advocated by Berlin.</p> <p>They broke into a conference centre where mayors of Greek and German cities were due to meet.</p> <p>It was not immediately known if the diplomat had been hurt.</p> </blockquote> <p>The incident was provoked, I think, by comments made by German deputy labour minister Hans-Joachim Fuchtel.

It said half year profits at Viridor would be 30% lower than the same time last year:</p> <blockquote> Analyst forecasts for the full year currently assume a recovery in recyclates prices in the second half of the year. However we have not seen an improvement in prices to date in the third quarter and are therefore cautious on the prospects for recyclate prices. </blockquote> <p>Despite this it expected group profits to rise 3% to \u00a3111m for the year. Pennon's shares closed 41.5p lower at 628.5p, the biggest faller in the leading index.</p> <p>Overall, leading shares came under pressure again after the eurozone went into recession, a day after anti-austerity protests swept the continent. Investors also had the US fiscal cliff, and growing tensions in the Middle East to worry about, not to mention weak UK retail sales and some disappointing US jobless and confidence figures. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 44.26 points lower at 5677.75. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> From a technical point of view...we broke below the 5715 level which until this morning's gap lower on the open had held the index aloft. Both fundamentally and technically there's not much out there for the bulls and so it looks for now that indices could remain under pressure. </blockquote> <p><strong>Resolution</strong>, set up to buy underperforming life businesses, lost 9.5p to 230p after it revealed some \u00a365m of costs related to updating its IT systems and outsourcing some of its administrative functions. Around \u00a335m is related to adapting computer systems at businesses it bought from Axa, with another charge \"in the low tens of millions\" expected after a review of other IT programmes. On top of that comes an additional \u00a330m charge for cancelling and transferring existing outsourcing contracts.</p> <p>It said the extra costs would not affect its ability to meet its financial targets or have an impact on its dividends.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a number of companies were affected by talk they could be deleted from the MSCI global standard indices this month, which are used by tracker funds and other investors.</p> <p><strong>Wood Group</strong>, the oil services business, lost 49.5p to 790.5p on speculation it may not join the index as had been anticipated, while hedge fund group <strong>Man</strong> fell 4.45p to 73.75p in the expectation it would be deleted.

      "bodyText": "In another downbeat day on the markets, Pennon sprung a leak after an afternoon trading update showed continuing problems with its waste management business. The company, which owns South West Water, said full year profits at its Viridor division would be below market expectations because of falling prices for recycled materials. It said half year profits at Viridor would be 30% lower than the same time last year: Analyst forecasts for the full year currently assume a recovery in recyclates prices in the second half of the year. However we have not seen an improvement in prices to date in the third quarter and are therefore cautious on the prospects for recyclate prices. Despite this it expected group profits to rise 3% to \u00a3111m for the year. Pennon's shares closed 41.5p lower at 628.5p, the biggest faller in the leading index. Overall, leading shares came under pressure again after the eurozone went into recession, a day after anti-austerity protests swept the continent. Investors also had the US fiscal cliff, and growing tensions in the Middle East to worry about, not to mention weak UK retail sales and some disappointing US jobless and confidence figures. So the FTSE 100 finished 44.26 points lower at 5677.75. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: From a technical point of view...we broke below the 5715 level which until this morning's gap lower on the open had held the index aloft. Both fundamentally and technically there's not much out there for the bulls and so it looks for now that indices could remain under pressure. Resolution, set up to buy underperforming life businesses, lost 9.5p to 230p after it revealed some \u00a365m of costs related to updating its IT systems and outsourcing some of its administrative functions. Around \u00a335m is related to adapting computer systems at businesses it bought from Axa, with another charge \"in the low tens of millions\" expected after a review of other IT programmes. On top of that comes an additional \u00a330m charge for cancelling and transferring existing outsourcing contracts. It said the extra costs would not affect its ability to meet its financial targets or have an impact on its dividends. Elsewhere, a number of companies were affected by talk they could be deleted from the MSCI global standard indices this month, which are used by tracker funds and other investors. Wood Group, the oil services business, lost 49.5p to 790.5p on speculation it may not join the index as had been anticipated, while hedge fund group Man fell 4.45p to 73.75p in the expectation it would be deleted. Analysts at Societe Generale estimated selling pressure on Man of 86.5m shares, according to Reuters, equivalent to 5.5 days trading volume.

      "bodyText": "Shoppers cut back on food and clothing last month, prompting a surprise fall in UK retail sales and stoking fears that Britain is headed for a triple-dip recession. Retail sales volumes, including fuel, dropped 0.8% in October, a dramatic reversal after the revised 0.5% rise in September. Analysts were expecting a much smaller decline of just 0.1%. Britons have suffered the worst squeeze in income for more than 30 years, as pay increases fail to keep up with soaring food and fuel prices. Economists fear they are now cutting back on spending, reducing the chances they can help drive the economy forward in the last quarter. The UK emerged from a double-dip recession in the third quarter, when the economy grew by 1%, but there are growing signs that it will contract again in the last three months of the year. Another quarter of contraction early next year would push the UK into a triple-dip recession. This is just the latest piece of gloomy economic news, after the UK's triple-A rating came under threat, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose unexpectedly last month and inflation jumped to a surprise five-month high. The Office for National Statistics said food sales had dropped by 0.6%, while clothing and footwear sales fell 2.3%. The quirky fashion retailer Ted Baker bucked the downward trend, posting a 25% rise in retail sales for the period between August and November, compared with the same period last year. Ray Kelvin, the founder and chief executive, said: \"Whilst we are pleased with our performance to date, full year results will as always be dependent on trading over the key Christmas period.\" The company said it was pleased with its performance in Europe and had opened new concessions in department stores in crisis-hit Ireland and Spain, as well as in the Netherlands and Germany. It continues to push into Asia, and opened its first store in Beijing last month. David Tinsley at BNP Paribas said: \"[These] numbers aren't terribly positive as far as fourth quarter GDP goes. As highlighted in yesterday's inflation report there is a reasonable chance that the fourth quarter release will show the economy slipping backwards. That will raise the political heat for the government amidst talk of the economy triple dipping.\" \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 16 November 2012 to make clear that September 2012's retail sales rise had been revised down to 0.5%",

The penalty rises to \u00a314.5m when redress to customers is included, with CPP also paying the cost of the FSA's probe.</p> <p>The bill for compensation is expected to rise further still as banks and other firms which sold CPP products will compensate those customers and a special fund is being created for this purpose.</p> <p>CPP, which has suffered a collapse in its share price since its flotation at 235p in 2010, will pay the fine in instalments. Paul Stobart, the new chief executive, said: \"We are deeply sorry for the errors and wrongdoings of the past and are paying a heavy penalty through what is a large fine.</p> <p>\"Today marks the end of the long-running investigation into historic practices at CPP in the UK.\"</p> <p>Shares in CPP were down 6% in early trading, to 25p.</p> <p>The company has also entered into a rare voluntary variation of permissions (\"VVOP\") with the FSA which has now put bans on the sales of some products by its regulated entities, Card Protection Plan Limited and Homecare Insurance Limited. CPP must also appoint an external \"skilled person\" \u2013 which has been demanded by the FSA \u2013 to monitor and report on its claims and complaints handling.</p> <p>The FSA highlighted two problem areas: CPP sold its card insurance for \u00a335 a year saying customers would get up to \u00a3100,000 worth of insurance cover that was not necessary as banks provide this cover; and CPP overstated the risks and consequences of identity theft during sales of identity protection, sold for \u00a384.</p> <p>\"While CPP's products were relatively inexpensive, they were sold widely and CPP encouraged its sales agents to be overly persistent. This exposed a very large number of customers to the unacceptable risk of buying products they did not want or need,\" said Tracey McDermott, the FSA's director of enforcement and financial crime. \"Further, we had already warned the firm that it might be misleading customers about a feature of card protection from which customers were unlikely to benefit, but insufficient action was taken to rectify this,\" she said.</p> <p>The FSA said it found that CPP's sales process focused on sales, revenue and commercial objectives at the expense of treating customers fairly as sales agents were encouraged to be overly persistent in persuading potential customers to purchase the products. Agents were paid for discouraging customers not to cancel products and did not always have addresses for customers.</p> <p>CPP, which received a bid last month from US rival Affinion, agreed to settle at an early stage entitling it to a 30% discount on its fine. Without the discount, the fine would have been \u00a315m.</p> <p>CPP sold the insurance to bank customers and Santander has taken an unspecified provision towards the cost of compensating CPP customers. The firm said RBS has \"recently indicated\" it was unlikely to renew a contract for mobile phone insurance which will \"result in significantly lower revenue and profit for the group in 2013 and beyond\".</p> <p>The fine is on a par with one slapped on HSBC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/05/hsbc-fined-selling-bonds-to-elderly\" title=\"\">last December</a>.</p>",

Paul Stobart, the new chief executive, said: \"We are deeply sorry for the errors and wrongdoings of the past and are paying a heavy penalty through what is a large fine. \"Today marks the end of the long-running investigation into historic practices at CPP in the UK.\" Shares in CPP were down 6% in early trading, to 25p. The company has also entered into a rare voluntary variation of permissions (\"VVOP\") with the FSA which has now put bans on the sales of some products by its regulated entities, Card Protection Plan Limited and Homecare Insurance Limited. CPP must also appoint an external \"skilled person\" \u2013 which has been demanded by the FSA \u2013 to monitor and report on its claims and complaints handling. The FSA highlighted two problem areas: CPP sold its card insurance for \u00a335 a year saying customers would get up to \u00a3100,000 worth of insurance cover that was not necessary as banks provide this cover; and CPP overstated the risks and consequences of identity theft during sales of identity protection, sold for \u00a384. \"While CPP's products were relatively inexpensive, they were sold widely and CPP encouraged its sales agents to be overly persistent. This exposed a very large number of customers to the unacceptable risk of buying products they did not want or need,\" said Tracey McDermott, the FSA's director of enforcement and financial crime. \"Further, we had already warned the firm that it might be misleading customers about a feature of card protection from which customers were unlikely to benefit, but insufficient action was taken to rectify this,\" she said. The FSA said it found that CPP's sales process focused on sales, revenue and commercial objectives at the expense of treating customers fairly as sales agents were encouraged to be overly persistent in persuading potential customers to purchase the products. Agents were paid for discouraging customers not to cancel products and did not always have addresses for customers. CPP, which received a bid last month from US rival Affinion, agreed to settle at an early stage entitling it to a 30% discount on its fine. Without the discount, the fine would have been \u00a315m. CPP sold the insurance to bank customers and Santander has taken an unspecified provision towards the cost of compensating CPP customers. The firm said RBS has \"recently indicated\" it was unlikely to renew a contract for mobile phone insurance which will \"result in significantly lower revenue and profit for the group in 2013 and beyond\". The fine is on a par with one slapped on HSBC last December.",

Andy Street warned that multinationals involved in overseas tax havens will \"outinvest and ultimately out-trade\" businesses paying full taxes in the UK, risking driving them out of business. He called on the Treasury to look into the \"principle\" that underpins where earnings are taxed and suggested that customers wanted to see companies compete on a level playing field. Street said overseas companies had an unfair advantage over their British-based rivals because of their low tax bills. \"You have got less money to invest if you're giving 27% of your profits to the exchequer than, clearly, if you're domiciled in a tax haven and you've got much more,\" he said in an interview with Jeff Randall on Sky News. \"So they will outinvest and ultimately out-trade us and that means there will not be the tax base in the UK.

The comments by Street and Myners come two days after senior executives from Amazon, Starbucks and Google were accused of diverting hundreds of millions of pounds in UK profits to secretive tax havens during a fraught exchange with a committee of MPs. Members of the public accounts committee described a director of Amazon as being \"deliberately evasive\" and displaying \"outrageous\" ignorance after he failed to say how much profit is generated in Britain or who owns the online retailer's Luxembourg-based holding company. All three repeatedly denied the accusation that they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance but were met with derision from members of the committee. A senior figure from Starbucks, which employs more than 7,000 staff in more than 800 outlets in the UK, was told he was not believed when he claimed the coffee chain did not make profits in Britain. An executive from Google admitted that the internet company operates in Ireland because of a low corporation tax rate there of 12.5% and was later accused by the committee chair, Margaret Hodge, of \"immoral\" behaviour. Hodge told the executives that UK taxpayers are increasingly frustrated by the use of tax havens and creative accounting by large firms trading in Britain. \"People want to know why companies which benefit from an infrastructure paid for by them and are paying people low wages who receive taxpayer-funded tax credits from the exchequer are not paying their fair share,\" she said.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne was warned by one of the world's three biggest rating agencies on Wednesday night that the UK will lose its prized AAA credit status if the UK sinks into a triple-dip recession this winter. In its annual health check on Britain, Moody's served notice to the chancellor that it would be carefully monitoring how he managed the difficult balancing act between growth and deficit reduction over the coming months. The ratings firm said it had not yet decided whether to cut Britain's credit rating but said it could act in the new year either if growth prospects worsened or if Osborne failed to stick to a demanding timetable for reducing national debt. The move came on the day that the Bank of England said the boost that accompanied the Olympics in the summer would be a one-off and halved its growth forecast for 2013 to 1%. Moody's said: \"The UK government's most significant policy challenge is balancing the need for fiscal consolidation against the need for economic stimulus.\" The rating agency added that it would consider whether the UK should lose its AAA status in the new year once it had assessed how Osborne coped with its growth-deficit reduction dilemma in the Autumn Statement. It said the coalition's attempts to reduce Britain's record peacetime budget deficit were being hampered by \"weaker economic prospects as well as by the risks posed by the ongoing euro area sovereign debt crisis.\" Moody's put the UK on negative watch \u2013 the threat of a downgrade in February this year. It said last night three factors would govern its assessment: the likely speed of deficit reduction, the growth outlook and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the likelihood that debt as a share of national income would not stabilise and start to come down over the next 3-4 years. Speculation has been mounting in recent weeks that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will force Osborne to admit in his autumn statement that slow growth will mean he can no longer meet his original aim of bringing down the debt to GDP ratio by 2015-16 without further austerity measures that would cut the economy's already sluggish growth rate.",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs appointed 70 of its high-flying directors to the coveted status of partner on Wednesday \u2013 the lowest number since the Wall Street firm became a public company in 1999. Partners command a salary of just under $1m (\u00a3630,000) \u2013 before any multimillion-dollar bonuses \u2013 and the title is handed out only every two years, after a vigorous internal vetting procedure known as \"cross-ruffing\". Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, said he \"congratulated all those selected on this important achievement\" after telephoning each one. The cross-ruffing process began in the summer and involved existing members of the 400-strong partnership interviewing each other about potential new partners, who are not interviewed directly themselves. The firm did not give any information as to why it selected only 70 new partners, when it had been expected to appoint between 75 and 100, but the lower count is thought to reflect the challenges facing the investment banking industry at a time when there are few deals to advise on and new regulations are forcing changes. The number of staff at the firm has fallen by 2,000 to 32,000 in the past 12 months as revenue has fallen. This month Goldman revealed it had dropped 33 partners to leave 407 members in a club that is regarded as the most elite in the financial world. As well as the salary, partners gain access to a special bonus pool that in good years can pay out multi-million-dollar bonuses, largely in shares. Some 110 new partners were named in 2010 and 94 in 2008, the year of the financial crisis. About 115 were named in 2006, the big boom year before the credit crunch hit and Lehman Brothers collapsed. Partners tend to stay in their roles for eight years and often quit the firm in their late 40s or early 50s, going on to other high-profile roles in government and other parts of the financial services industry. Those selected to be partners have often worked their way through the rigid hierarchical structure of the firm. Nine of the new appointments are women, including Heather Bellini, a software analyst expert in technology stocks such as Google, who has been elevated unusually quickly after joining in 2011. The partnership selection process was led this year by London-based partner Michael Sherwood, who chaired the committee which will on Thursday also promote staff to managing directors, the foothold to becoming a partner. Managing directors are named annually and those currently at managing director level who were not selected for partner this year may decide to leave in the coming months. The list of new partners included Blankfein's chief of staff, Russell Horwitz. In London, Huw Pill, Goldman's chief European economist, Anthony Gutman, a London-based investment banker, and Francesco Garzarelli are among those listed. Yann Samuelides, who was in the spotlight three years ago over a divorce case involving allegations that he offered a woman money to leave her marriage, is also included. Others include the banker David Schwimmer, hedge fund manager Kent Clark, and Gerald Ouderkirk III, an expert in collateralised loan obligations \u2013 the financial instruments that were at heart of the credit crunch. Of the partners, 60% are based in the Americas, 30% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the rest are in Asia. Although 70 is the lowest number of partners appointed since the company's flotation in 1999 \u2013 when there were just 221 partners, compared with 480 now \u2013 it is large compared with the years before the flotation, when the firm was much smaller. About 58 partners were named in 1996, for instance, up from 35 in 1992. Bonuses are not decided until early next year, but in the nine months to September Goldman has already set aside $11bn to pay staff. That is slightly less than 2008, even though the $15bn revenue is higher than at the same time four years ago. In a speech on Tuesday, Blankfein said: \"We have taken a disciplined approach to expenses and capital management to ensure that the firm is positioned to benefit when a stronger operating environment returns. \"However, to generate stronger returns during the upturn, we have to support and invest in our client franchise during the downturn.
