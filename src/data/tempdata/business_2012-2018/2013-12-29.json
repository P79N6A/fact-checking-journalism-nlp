    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For a supposedly quiet plane, there has always been a lot of noise around the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. From the unveiling of its pioneering design in 2004 to the first delivery in 2011, there was an industry buzz. Then mutterings of concern grew into a chorus of alarm in January, when safety authorities grounded the fleet after a spate of incidents, including a burning battery. But after a few relatively trouble-free months, Boeing's insistence that these were just teething troubles has been accepted and orders have grown. Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president for marketing, landed on a lot of tarmac during 2013, selling the plane and restating its merits to customers anxiously reviewing their purchases. \"It wasn't a great start,\" he admits. \"We clearly had challenges early in the year \u2026 and the disruption that presented.\" The most alarming challenge was a battery that caught fire on a Japan Airlines plane, fortunately on the ground at Boston airport. Other 787s suffered fuel leaks and one was forced to make an emergency landing. By mid-January the US federal aviation authority had grounded the worldwide fleet. \"As you can imagine it was a very difficult situation. It's very rare when you have to \u2026 take planes out of service. We had an unprecedented response inside the company to identify the work we had to do with the testing, and to incorporate the fix for those in service and those in production.\" The 787 returned to the skies in April and glitches have been rare. The last high-profile incident was a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines plane at Heathrow in July. \"The airlines are telling us it's delivering,\" Tinseth says. The feedback from passengers has been amazing.\" Boeing's marketing boss would say that, but people at the sharp end seem to agree. British Airways pilot Mitch Preston flew the first 787 in BA livery and is managing the model's entry into service. He says passengers consistently say they arrive feeling better. \"It's not marketing fluff, it really isn't.\" Low fuel consumption and reduced noise have been the big selling points, but a key part of the 787's appeal to passengers is the increased cabin pressure said to alleviate the ill-effects of flying. Preston says: \"Typically I get off a 787 flight feeling less tired and dehydrated.\" He also likes the lighter cabin and the views from its bigger windows. BA waited decades for a pioneering new plane, then two turned up at once. The Dreamliner arrived in the same week as BA's first Airbus A380. Both had been ordered years earlier, but the 787 was delayed in production hell and A380 was deferred by BA itself as recession made it wary of the doubledecker superjumbo. Captain James Basnett is Preston's counterpart for the A380. \"Everybody who flies the A380 loves it. It's very impressive, efficient, reliable. We did all the flying without a hitch and crews love it,\" he says. As with the 787, the plane may be dramatically different but the cockpit is designed for continuity for pilots, albeit with a host of technological improvements. \"The flightdeck is slightly more complex, but with more tools to help us \u2013 cameras, electronic flight displays and an electronic flight bag.\" The latter, which the 787 also offers, aims to reduce the headaches and weight of paperwork. Passenger feedback has been effusive, Bassnett says. \"You notice the width and height in the cabin. It's noticeably quieter.\" One downside of which is that \"you can hear people snore\". But not the co-pilot, he adds. The A380 has \"the best of a small aircaft on a big aircraft and a lot of technology you don't see elsewhere\", he says. There wouldn't be a pilot on the fleet who wouldn't prefer it. They'd say it was the most enjoyable plane they'd ever flown\". Preston, however, says: \"There are very few pilots in the world who'll not say the plane he's flying is the best thing. I don't begrudge James what he's flying, but on this issue he's wrong.\" Size isn't everything? \"Indeed.\" The earlier problems with the 787, he says, never enter his mind. A more important endorsement came this month from his employers, who booked 18 more Dreamliners \u2013 the pending \"double-stretched\" 787-10 model. BA has also ordered the same number of A350s, widely seen as Airbus's riposte to the Dreamliner. It uses similar lightweight composite materials and by the time of delivery may include a version of the lithium-ion batteries. The airline's stance reflects the broader aviation picture. The purchase of an A380 or 787 is far less a decision between manufacturers than a question of competing visions of the economics and future of air travel. Airlines carrying high volumes of passengers on major routes favour the A380, and Emirates - by far the largest customer - has refitted its Dubai hub to service its fleet, which is set to reach 140 planes. Five depart Heathrow for Dubai daily. At crowded airports where slots are at a premium, putting more customers on each plane taking off can make real sense. But if the A380 is, as an Airbus spokesman put it, a \"congestion buster\", the 787 is better known as a \"hub buster\" \u2013 one that rewrites traditional models of funnelling connecting passengers onto the jumbos that make long-haul flying viable. With fewer seats, its fuel efficiency and range are enabling the likes of a direct Heathrow-Austin connection \u2013 BA's next new route for 2014 \u2013 even with less passenger demand than established routes. On the simple comparison of orders, the 787 is beating the A380, though Airbus has the satisfaction of knowing its superjumbo is slowly wiping the ageing Boeing 747 from the skies. Technical problems did ground a Norwegian Air Dreamliner last week in the US, but burning batteries and emergency landings are slowly becoming a more distant chapter in the 787's story. It is now approaching 100m miles in service and last month surpassed 1,000 orders. Tinseth says: \"The technologies are being proven \u2026 Was it a risk worth taking? Absolutely.\" The planes compared Airbus A380 Cost: $403.9m Size: Seats 525 passengers in a typical three-class cabin layout Range: Up to 15,700km Orders: 259 Deliveries: 119 Boeing 787 Dreamliner Cost: $290m Size: 300-330 passengers in a typical layout Range: Up to 12,964km Orders: 1012 Deliveries: 103 *Cost and size for 787-10 model.

From the unveiling of its pioneering design in 2004 to the first delivery in 2011, there was an industry buzz. Then mutterings of concern grew into a chorus of alarm in January, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/17/boeing-rushes-restore-faith-dreamliner\" title=\"\">safety authorities grounded the fleet after a spate of incidents, including a burning battery</a>.</p> <p>But after a few relatively trouble-free months, Boeing's insistence that these were just teething troubles has been accepted and orders have grown.</p> <p>Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president for marketing, landed on a lot of tarmac during 2013, selling the plane and restating its merits to customers anxiously reviewing their purchases. \"It wasn't a great start,\" he admits. \"We clearly had challenges early in the year \u2026 and the disruption that presented.\"</p> <p>The most alarming challenge was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2013/jan/16/passengers-evacuate-787-dreamliner-after-emergency-landing-video\" title=\"\">a battery that caught fire on a Japan Airlines plane</a>, fortunately on the ground at Boston airport.

      "bodyText": "Pay always matters. It will matter even more than usual in 2014 when it will determine not just the fate of the UK's economic recovery but conceivably the result of the next election as well. Rising real wages will underpin solid growth in consumer spending, trigger a long-overdue pick-up in investment and give George Osborne a narrative for the Conservatives' election campaign in 2015. By contrast, another year in which earnings rise less rapidly than prices will make a sustainable recovery much less likely and dent David Cameron's re-election hopes. The year ends with fears that the UK has the wrong sort of growth. The latest balance of payments figures revealed the biggest quarterly deficit since the Lawson boom of the late 1980s, a time of previous excess demand in the economy. There are concerns \u2013 entirely justified by the UK's recent history \u2013 that another consumer and housing-led recovery will lead inexorably to the same outcome. After three boom-busts in the housing market since the early 1970s, it's easy to see why a 40% jump in mortgage approvals during 2013 has raised eyebrows. In truth, it is too early to predict how this recovery will turn out. The first point to note is that nearly all recoveries in the west rely on consumption in their early stages. In China, where investment accounts for around half of national output, it is possible for the state to prime the pump of recovery. In mature, developed economies, investment tends to account for 10-20% of gross domestic product and consumption around two-thirds of GDP. Mathematically, it is harder to get an economy growing without a rise in consumption. What tends to happen is that rising consumption encourages companies to invest. The increase in demand for goods and services means firms need more productive capacity, so they move to bigger premises and buy new kit. Crucially, though, they only do so if they think the increase in consumption is for real. If they suspect that the boost from household spending is temporary, companies make do. So, the fact that UK growth during 2013 was dominated by consumption is unexceptional. Nor is it a surprise that the housing market played a big part in the story, given that residential property sector is a sizeable industry in Britain. At the start of 2013, it was hard to see why consumer spending would bounce back. The economy had flatlined for two years and confidence was low. Inflation had comfortably outstripped earnings during 2012, making it hard for families to make ends meet. Three factors combined to change the picture: cheap money, the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS), and rising consumer confidence. Threadneedle Street cut its official rate to 0.5% in early 2009 but it took a long time for the monetary stimulus to have an impact. It only really did so when FLS was announced in the summer of 2012. This was a deal under which the commercial banks could borrow more cheaply from the Bank of England provided they passed on the benefits to their customers. The idea was that households and business borrowers would benefit: loans would become more readily available and the interest rates charged on them would be lower. Lending to businesses was disappointing, but the impact on the mortgage market was rapid and significant. Consumer psychology is difficult to fathom. Those who kept their jobs throughout the deep slump of 2008-09 and the flatlining of 2011-12 may have felt by early 2013 that they were no longer at great risk of being made redundant. It is also likely, though, that the pickup in the housing market boosted confidence, not least because rising house prices generated the sense that life was returning to normal. Consumers may simply have been looking for an excuse to feel less miserable after years of gloom. Whatever the reason, there was a steady and marked improvement in confidence, which began in late 2012 and continued through the spring and summer. Rising optimism led to higher spending, and this led to higher growth. The increase in consumer spending did not come about through increments in living standards. Indeed, when consumer demand was especially strong in the middle of 2013 inflation was running at 3% while average earnings were growing by 1%. What occurred was that consumers ran down their savings to fund higher spending. Again, this is not unusual. Households get more cautious in troubled times and they save more just to be on the safe side. When they perceive that life has become less difficult, they save less. But, unless consumers are willing to save less and less and borrow more and more, there is only so long this process can continue. Eventually, spending growth has to be the result of rising incomes rather than falling savings. All of which brings us back to the present. Consumer confidence has edged lower in the past three months, reversing part of the gain seen earlier in the year. High street spending in October and November was weaker than the City had been expecting. Again, this is wholly predictable. Consumers no longer felt comfortable about running down their savings and so they spent a bit less. They may have had a bit of a splurge at Christmas but will then retrench in the new year when the credit card bills roll in. After a year in which the consumer has been the driving force behind the expansion of the economy, 2014 should be the year when investment kicks in. Many of the objective conditions for an increase in business spending are in place: companies are cash rich, profitability is good, interest rates are set to stay low, and ageing capital stock needs replacing. The one factor not in place is the most important one of all: an increase in real wages. If companies believe that consumers will carry on spending, they are much more likely to take the plunge on new investment projects. If they think consumer spending will stall, they will keep their plans on hold. In those circumstances, the recovery in the UK will prove unsustainable. It will depend on a sugar rush from rising house prices stimulating further falls in consumer spending. The lack of new investment will mean that inflationary pressures build up and the trade deficit will continue to widen. Companies have got used to having the upper hand in wage negotiations but now need to grasp a simple message: rising real incomes equals rising consumption equals rising investment equals a far higher chance, even given the structural flaws in the economy, of a sustainable recovery. Give Britain a pay rise.",

Anderson retains numerous roles, including chairman of the Reclaim Fund \u2013 owned by the, er, Co-operative Banking Group. Arthur Daley Decanter for Salesmanship After years in which the Arthur Daley Decanter for Salesmanship had been a shoo-in for banks and energy companies, 2013 threw up a more diverse field in what has become the blue riband category. Obviously the perennial runners are still competitive, as was confirmed with Lloyds Banking Group and SSE being slapped with record fines of \u00a328m and \u00a310.5m. But this year's entries contained a new sector, as well as a new way of selling.

Michael Fish Medal for Forecasting At the beginning of the year, it was all woe for George Osborne. His policy of austerity was being slammed by rivals and, worse, the figures weren't stacking up for him much either. So it was odds-on that two UK recessions in swift succession would be followed by a third, and therefore an \"unprecedented triple dip\".

So the judges awarded this year's medal to the entire economics profession, along with their own prediction: economists will put in a strong showing in 2014. George III Memorial Plate for US Retreats The old cliche states that what starts in the US inevitably comes to the UK (syphilis is an early example) \u2013 but the reverse is rarely true. The committee has long been aware that Americans seem much less keen on embracing our creations, so as soon as any UK company launches businesses in the US, the judges automatically pencil them in as a possible future winner for this illustrious gong. This forward-thinking approach has made them appear shrewd again this year, and the committee barely paused to refill their glasses as they considered the contenders in this category. In fact, they were considering a field of one. Tesco, which had always dealt rather sniffily with any criticisms that it might not be such a brilliant plan to try to compete with Walmart in its home territory, left its US chain Fresh &amp; Easy to file for bankruptcy in October, as it finally admitted defeat in America. The UK grocer also agreed to sell the majority of its US stores to billionaire Ron Burkle, lending his Yucaipa investment vehicle \u00a380m to take on about 150 stores \u2013 meaning the withdrawal package cost the British retailer about \u00a3150m. A worthy winner. Qing Dynasty Vase for Eastern Trade The last time anybody can recall a row over Brits forcing drugs on the Chinese market, it ended with our boys taking Hong Kong. These days the benefits for British commercial interests don't quite match those of the opium wars \u2013 but, if you want to go down this route, it does mean our committee will present you with a lovely vase to stash in your boardroom. That's the honour bestowed by the judges on UK pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline, which admitted in July that Chinese doctors were bribed by its executives with cash and sexual favours, in return for prescribing the company's drugs. Still, pretenders to this award be warned: you may need to work towards it. In 2012, GSK was fined $3bn for bribing doctors in the US. The Ponzi Endowment for Financial Services Before choosing a recipient for this award \u2013 made in recognition of sharp practice in the financial services sector \u2013 the judges wanted to put on record their thanks to the gong's new sponsor: a collective of global financial regulators keen to encourage the type of behaviour that kept them so busy in 2013. These regulators have been raking it in, reportedly collecting $43bn in penalties and settlements this year. That means the contenders for the endowment included the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Rabobank, who have all been clobbered with hefty fines this year. But in the end, the favourite scooped the prize. It seems that barely a week can pass without JP Morgan's unflappable boss, Jamie Dimon, calling the company treasurer and asking him to deposit another wad into the regulators' accounts, with the bank putting aside $23bn for potential litigation since 2010 and admitting its legal bills could be $6.8bn more.

      "bodyText": "When Frankfurt social worker Stefan Mohr needed a new location for the troubled children he works with to express themselves through spray paint and graffiti, it did not take him long to find a potential site. The trouble was, the vast area of fencing he found, down the road from the derelict warehouse the children had been using, was round the site on which the European Central Bank's new \u20ac1bn headquarters was being built. Mohr contacted the bank. To his surprise, it not only agreed to let him use the fence around one of Europe's biggest building sites for graffiti, it offered \u20ac10,000 to pay for wooden panels to be attached to the fence, and for supplies of spray paint. Mohr said he thought from the start that the homeless and underprivileged young people he works with would get a kick out of spraying on the site of such a politically symbolic building. But he had no idea that some of the world's most famous graffiti artists would help turn the fence into one of Frankfurt's biggest tourist attractions. \"All we wanted to do was find a place for kids to express themselves and show the public that graffiti is art, not vandalism,\" Mohr said. \"It has proved amazingly popular, with people coming from across the world to paint and take photos, and pictures from the wall are used in the press all over the world. We never thought it would get popular; all we wanted was somewhere to paint.\" The graffiti, which is often highly political and includes caricatures of ECB president Mario Draghi and German chancellor Angela Merkel, has proved so popular that dozens of banks and money managers have been interested in buying the works. \"A lot of people want to buy pieces, but we didn't do this to make money,\" Mohr said. \"We don't want to sell them. We like to see the pictures painted over. That's how graffiti works.\" However, their landlord, the ECB, was allowed to buy one of the first works, showing two cocks fighting, and will display the piece inside the building when it opens in 2014. Another artwork was sold after an investment fund owned by computer billionaire Michael Dell hired investigators to track down the artist behind a piece inspired by the Bond film Casino Royale. It shows Draghi and Merkel as 007 and a Bond girl inside a casino. The painting, on plywood, now hangs in the Manhattan office of Dell's company, MSD Capital. Both MSD and Mohr declined to state how much the work was sold for, but it was less than the cost of shipping it to New York. The money went to the artist, rather than the publicly funded Under Art Construction project Mohr runs. Mohr has refused to sell any of the works since, despite more than 20 approaches. Although many of the works depict Merkel, Draghi and the ECB in a derogatory way \u2013 in reaction to their role in forcing austerity measures on struggling eurozone economies \u2013 the bank does not censor the art. \"They don't tell us what to paint or not paint \u2013 just that there must be no fascism or sexism,\" Mohr said. He added that about 60% of the works reflect the eurozone crisis, and that painters from Spain, Portugal and Greece are most likely to choose political themes. \"Painters and young people have ideas that connect with the ECB and the problems of Europe.\" Andrea J\u00fcrges, who looks after the project on behalf of the ECB, said the bank was happy to be satirised: \"They can paint whatever they want \u2013 negative things about the ECB are fine in my view.\" She said everyone at the ECB, Draghi included, is delighted that the project has proved so popular. \"When they did a painting session one night recently, it was so packed you couldn't get near the front to see them.\" The mayor of Frankfurt, Peter Feldmann, himself a former youth worker, supports the project and is calling on all construction sites in the city to allow graffiti on their perimeters. J\u00fcrges said: \"I agree with the mayor: construction sites are ugly and this sort of thing is a wonderful opportunity to make something nice, and give young people space to express themselves.\" The art works will continue to be replaced by new graffiti every three months until the new 45-storey building, designed by Austrian architect Wolf Prix, opens in late 2014. After that, anyone will be able to bid for pieces, with money going to the Under Art Construction programme.",

BAE Systems, Britain's largest manufacturing employer, announced nearly two weeks ago that it had failed to secure a \u00a36bn order for Typhoon fighter jets from the United Arab Emirates, despite the enthusiastic backing of David Cameron for a deal. With the decline of the British state as a buyer of BAE's equipment \u2013 hence the 1,775 job losses at Portsmouth and Glasgow \u2013 the company has been forced to seek new markets that can afford products with multibillion-pound price tags. It is a small market and one that is crowded with western competitors \u2013 such as France's Dassault \u2013 that are also scrabbling for deals from the defence ministries of emerging countries.</p> <p>BAE's news showed that even our manufacturing base is unbalanced, dependent as it is on a single customer that will be in a sustained period of fiscal retrenchment regardless of which party gains power in 2015.</p> <p>So, a wish for 2014 is for balance: a recognition among business and political leaders that economic growth is not an unalloyed good if it repeats the historical errors of stoking debt, consumption and estate agents' fees.

Each autumn, high streets get stocked-up and festively decked-out stores. A small fortune is spent trying to persuade the public to shop early, because this is the time when full prices can be charged and profit margins fattened. Every year, consumers blow a big raspberry to this idea and make retailers sweat.</p> <p>A fortnight before Christmas, stores go into panic mode, worrying that they will be left with masses of unsold stock. Prices are slashed and consumers start to spend. This trend has been accentuated in recent years by the protracted squeeze on real incomes, which has made consumers even hungrier for a bargain. But it is likely to continue even when living standards start to rise again. Consumers are too canny: they know how to play the Christmas game.</p>",

O'Leary takes a seat at the back of the plane Were we to name one exec to watch in 2014, Michael O'Leary would rather it wasn't him: the Ryanair chief has pledged to be a lot quieter. The most successful aviation boss of the past decade has decided to remove himself from the public frontline in 2014, after admitting: \"I'm getting in the way.\" O'Leary's decision to become the airline world's Greta Garbo, unlikely as that sounds for a serial attention-grabber, followed a startling admission that the airline had to change its ways and \"stop unnecessarily pissing people off\". Instead of O'Leary's regular press conferences, which tipped reams of newsworthy quotes into journalists' laps, the public face of Europe's largest short-haul airline will be a new director of sales and marketing.

Each autumn, high streets get stocked-up and festively decked-out stores. A small fortune is spent trying to persuade the public to shop early, because this is the time when full prices can be charged and profit margins fattened. Every year, consumers blow a big raspberry to this idea and make retailers sweat. A fortnight before Christmas, stores go into panic mode, worrying that they will be left with masses of unsold stock. Prices are slashed and consumers start to spend. This trend has been accentuated in recent years by the protracted squeeze on real incomes, which has made consumers even hungrier for a bargain. But it is likely to continue even when living standards start to rise again. Consumers are too canny: they know how to play the Christmas game.",

In a recent interview in the Times, the archbishop came out with some pertinent criticisms of the way the coalition is focusing the brunt of its austerity policy on the most vulnerable. Archbishop Nichols believes that too many people are being left behind in this so-called \"recovery\". So much for the prime minister's \"big society\", which \"hasn't helped\". \"Charity isn't an alternative to public service. At our last bishops' meeting, a number said that they never thought they would use the word 'destitute' again, but there are now families with nothing: that's shameful and shocking.\" Nichols observes that the government's \"welfare\" policies are being applied without any degree of flexibility towards people's individual circumstances. I recall referring in this column more than a year ago to John Le Carr\u00e9's powerful phrase about the coalition's welfare policies being tantamount to \"planned penury\". The church sees the consequences of these heartless policies at first hand. The victims turn up on the doorstep. The churches see, in Nichols's words, that \"there have been clumsily targeted cuts and the most vulnerable are suffering \u2026 The way assistance is administered is very degrading and the language around benefits recipients has become much harsher.\" Again, the chairman of the Trussell Trust reports that the number of food banks it administers has risen to the point where they are now feeding over half a million people, compared with 41,000 in 2010. According to Iain Duncan Smith, the most prominent perpetrator of these ill-conceived \"welfare\" policies, the charities that draw attention to the plight of the hungry and the dispossessed are merely scaremongering and have a \"political agenda\". Well, so they should have a political agenda. This is the season of goodwill but this right-wing Conservative government, thinly disguised as a coalition, is emerging as a government of ill-will. And, as I pointed out a fortnight ago, it has a very political agenda, which is to reduce public spending not because it needs to be reduced, but because those people running the Conservative party have a religious belief in implementing tax cuts for the higher echelons of society at the expense of the social safety net that so many governments of both major parties supported for so many decades after the second world war. David Cameron has at various times indicated his admiration for such past Tory stalwarts as Harold Macmillan and Ian Gilmour; both would be appalled by what is going on now. This government seems to be woefully bereft of any sense of humanity or fundamental decency when speaking about welfare \u2013 and, indeed, administering it. The nature of its underlying strategy is forensically examined in a new paper by the veteran British economist Brian Henry (The Coalition's Economic Strategy: Has It Made a Bad Thing Worse?). In it, Henry gives the lie to the coalition's repeated claim that the austerity programme was necessary to clear up the \"mess\" it inherited. Careful comparison of the so-called \"structural\" deficit leads him to the conclusion that this was no worse at the end of Labour's pre-crisis years than it had been under the Conservatives: by far the greatest reason for the deficit was the consequence of the collapse in economic activity induced by the financial crash. It was a \"demand shock\" rather than the \"supply shock\" that took place after the oil crisis of 1973-74, when much capacity was made redundant by the huge change in relative costs of energy. The financial crisis required stimulation of demand, not further contraction. Henry concludes: \"The coalition has seized the opportunity at the moment of the UK's greatest economic crisis since the 1930s, and the widespread uncertainty about its causes, to impose a protracted fiscal contraction with the aim of reducing the tax burden.\" However, Henry himself, while referring to \"uncertainty\", is in little doubt that financial engineering and lax regulation were at the root of the crisis. It is a mark of the success of the government's propaganda that so many people believe the \"big lie\" that it was all down to \"Labour's mess\". How long they can get away with the big lie remains to be seen. Meanwhile, it is vitally important that Labour does not, out of timidity, try to ape the coalition in a \"tough\" welfare policy. Otherwise, what is the point of the Labour party?",

      "bodyText": "Will rising house prices and higher pay bring back the feelgood factor? As the Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, pointed out recently, Britain's microwave-like housing market tends to \"turn from lukewarm to scalding hot in a matter of a few economic seconds\" \u2013 and that seems to be exactly what's happened over the past 12 months. By the end of 2013, the London market was well on the way to scorching and, in almost every other part of the country, it had at least begun to defrost. Brits \u2013 at least those who have managed to clamber on to the housing ladder \u2013 love nothing better than rising property prices, and the recovery has been a key driver of growing consumer confidence and spending. But for those locked out of the housing market, the key to a happier new year will be whether, and when, real wages finally start to recover from the longest squeeze in more than a century. With overseas demand weak, a large pool of jobless workers and an extraordinary 3 million people saying they are \"underemployed\" and would prefer to work more hours, it's hard to see what would make employers start paying more. For the time being, we're likely to be left relying on a good old-fashioned, debt-fuelled boom. Will Mark Carney raise interest rates in 2014, as the economy gathers pace? He certainly hopes not. The whole thrust of the Bank of England's policy since the Canadian central banker took up the reins in Threadneedle Street has been to reassure consumers and companies that the Bank won't \"pull the rug out\" from under the recovery by raising rates too soon. Of course, the definition of \"too soon\" is up for grabs. The monetary policy committee opted for an unemployment rate threshold of 7% when it announced its policy of forward guidance, assuming at the time that it would be at least three years before that was reached. Just three months later, they conceded we could get there within a year and a half. But the Bank has enthusiastically embraced the new macroprudential tools that it hopes will allow it to smooth out booms and busts in certain markets \u2013 such as property \u2013 without clobbering the economy with an across-the-board rate rise. Its director for financial stability, Andy Haldane, has called this a \"sharp philosophical shift\". So even if unemployment drops below 7%, it seems unlikely the Bank will reach for a rate rise without yanking other levers first \u2013 and that's likely to take us into 2015 at the earliest. Is the global economy heading for another crash? Not much has been seen of Gordon Brown since he left Downing Street in May 2010, but the former prime minister caused a stir earlier this month when he said failure to learn the lessons of the 2007-09 financial and economic crisis means the global economy is heading for another meltdown. Brown speaks from experience and has a point. The unity displayed when the world was looking into the economic abyss after the collapse of Lehman Brothers did not last long. Many problems, including too-big-to-fail banks and the growth of a largely unregulated shadow banking system, have not been adequately addressed. Central banks are unclear about how and when to remove the colossal stimulus they have provided for their economies over the past five years. These core weaknesses mean it would be unwise to rule out another financial crisis in 2014. Crashes did, after all, have a habit of breaking out every few years before the Big One in 2007. Nor should it be any comfort that no one can see one coming in 2014. That's what they said last time. How will Janet Yellen fare as Federal Reserve chairman? Ben Bernanke will bow out in the new year, having already set in train the process of tapering the Fed's vast programme of quantitative easing. Bernanke said he expected it to take until the end of 2014 to shut the money presses down altogether, but it will be helpful to Yellen, who has often been seen as dovish, that the symbolic first step towards weaning the financial markets off super-cheap money has already been taken. Better still, world markets responded enthusiastically. But it may not all be plain sailing: just because investors shrugged off the first step doesn't mean there won't be a more severe response as tapering continues. And the make-up of the Fed's open markets committee, which sets interest rates, is due to take on a more hawkish tone as QE sceptics Richard Fisher (of Dallas) and Charles Plosser (of Philadelphia) take up voting seats. If inflationary pressure rises as the economy picks up, Yellen will face growing calls to move faster. As a serious economist and Fed veteran, she has as good a chance as anyone of walking the fine line between scuppering recovery and letting inflation run out of control. But unwinding QE on this scale is an unprecedented challenge: it seems all but certain that more turmoil lies ahead. Which of the emerging markets looks risky in 2014? If there is to be a seismic shock to the global economy next year, the smart (sic) money is on it coming from the emerging world. Developing countries have seen large flows of \"hot money\" courtesy of the QE activities of the west's central banks. With interest rates low in the developed world, investors have parked their cash in the higher-yielding currencies of the emerging economies. Now that the Federal Reserve has started to reduce the amount of stimulus it is providing each month, the fear is that the hot money will leave emerging markets as quickly as it arrived, leaving countries facing runs on their currencies. The most vulnerable emerging markets look to be those with big current-account deficits, because they are likely to be the first targets for currency speculators. High on the list would be Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and India. The biggest risk of all, however, is China. Foreign investors have been impressed by the economic reforms announced by the communist leadership but, in the short term, China is slowing down after its debt-fuelled recovery from the last recession. A hard landing in China would have severe global ramifications. Is the eurozone over the worst of its tribulations? Yes, to the extent that a disorderly breakup of the single currency has become far less of a risk since Mario Draghi said in July 2012 that the European Central Bank would do \"whatever it takes\" to safeguard the euro's future. But no, if the criterion is the state of the eurozone economy. Four big legacy problems from the last crisis will hold Europe back over the coming 12 months: growth, unemployment, deflation and zombie banks. Unlike the US and, latterly, the UK, the eurozone has yet to recover from the recession of 2008-09. A double-dip recession ended in 2013 but growth is still barely positive and not nearly strong enough to bring down a joblessness rate of more than 12%. Deflation is already a reality in Greece and Cyprus, while in Portugal, inflation is only just above zero. Falling prices increase the real value of debt, making it harder for countries to repay what they owe. The two potential flashpoints for 2014 are the ECB's asset quality review of Europe's banks, and the need for fresh bailouts for the two most vulnerable countries: Greece and Portugal. What's more likely: tax cuts in the budget or the sack for Ed Balls? Rumours have been swirling around Westminster since the autumn statement that Ed Miliband is losing patience with his shadow chancellor and is thinking of replacing Balls in a reshuffle. But it looks improbable, and not just because the Labour leader lacks a credible alternative. Balls was right when he warned austerity would hold back the recovery; to throw him overboard now would give the impression that George Osborne was right all along. There is far more chance the chancellor will provide a bit of a budget giveaway. After all, the public finances are improving and, by March, the general election will be little more than a year away. But Osborne is in no position to throw money around: the public finances are in much worse shape than he expected them to be when he took office in 2010, and the priority is to balance the books by the end of the decade. Any tax cuts will be small, and largely financed by savings elsewhere. If there is to be a giveaway, it will be in the 2014 autumn statement or the 2015 budget. Will Abenomics succeed in fixing Japanese economy? The drastic attempt by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, to jolt the moribund economy into life has already borne fruit: since he took power a year ago, growth has picked up to a cracking annual rate of 3%, and deflation of -0.1% year on year in December 2012 had given way to inflation of 1.1% by October. But the burning question for 2014 is whether the first two of his three policy \"arrows\" \u2013 a spending surge and quantitative easing on a massive scale \u2013 will be followed by the promised third arrow: economic reform. Among other things, the Abe administration is creating hundreds of thousands of childcare places, in a bid to tempt more mothers into the workplace and harness the power of what he calls womenomics. A series of overseas trade deals, including the ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership, are also likely to lead to the opening-up of new sectors of Japanese industry to competition. But these are long-term reforms, and investors are expecting Abenomics to go on yielding quick results. There's a clear risk markets will lose faith with the debt-burdened Japanese government in the meantime (ratio of debt to GDP: 246%). By the end of 2014, we will have a much clearer idea of whether Abe's gamble has paid off.",

But unwinding QE on this scale is an unprecedented challenge: it seems all but certain that more turmoil lies ahead.</p> <h2><strong>Which of the emerging markets looks risky in 2014?</strong></h2> <p>If there is to be a seismic shock to the global economy next year, the smart (sic) money is on it coming from the emerging world. Developing countries have seen large flows of \"hot money\" courtesy of the QE activities of the west's central banks. With interest rates low in the developed world, investors have parked their cash in the higher-yielding currencies of the emerging economies. Now that the Federal Reserve has started to reduce the amount of stimulus it is providing each month, the fear is that the hot money will leave emerging markets as quickly as it arrived, leaving countries facing runs on their currencies.</p> <p>The most vulnerable emerging markets look to be those with big current-account deficits, because they are likely to be the first targets for currency speculators. High on the list would be Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and India.</p> <p>The biggest risk of all, however, is China. Foreign investors have been impressed by the economic reforms announced by the communist leadership but, in the short term, China is slowing down after its debt-fuelled recovery from the last recession. A hard landing in China would have severe global ramifications.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Is the eurozone over the worst of its tribulations?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, to the extent that a disorderly breakup of the single currency has become far less of a risk since Mario Draghi said in July 2012 that the European Central Bank would do \"whatever it takes\" to safeguard the euro's future. But no, if the criterion is the state of the eurozone economy. Four big legacy problems from the last crisis will hold Europe back over the coming 12 months: growth, unemployment, deflation and zombie banks.</p> <p>Unlike the US and, latterly, the UK, the eurozone has yet to recover from the recession of 2008-09. A double-dip recession ended in 2013 but growth is still barely positive and not nearly strong enough to bring down a joblessness rate of more than 12%. Deflation is already a reality in Greece and Cyprus, while in Portugal, inflation is only just above zero. Falling prices increase the real value of debt, making it harder for countries to repay what they owe. The two potential flashpoints for 2014 are the ECB's asset quality review of Europe's banks, and the need for fresh bailouts for the two most vulnerable countries: Greece and Portugal.</p> <h2><strong> What's more likely: tax cuts in the budget or the sack for Ed Balls?</strong></h2> <p>Rumours have been swirling around Westminster since the autumn statement that Ed Miliband is losing patience with his shadow chancellor and is thinking of replacing Balls in a reshuffle. But it looks improbable, and not just because the Labour leader lacks a credible alternative. Balls was right when he warned austerity would hold back the recovery; to throw him overboard now would give the impression that George Osborne was right all along.</p> <p>There is far more chance the chancellor will provide a bit of a budget giveaway. After all, the public finances are improving and, by March, the general election will be little more than a year away. But Osborne is in no position to throw money around: the public finances are in much worse shape than he expected them to be when he took office in 2010, and the priority is to balance the books by the end of the decade. Any tax cuts will be small, and largely financed by savings elsewhere. If there is to be a giveaway, it will be in the 2014 autumn statement or the 2015 budget.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Will Abenomics succeed in fixing Japanese economy?</strong></h2> <p>The drastic attempt by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, to jolt the moribund economy into life has already borne fruit: since he took power a year ago, growth has picked up to a cracking annual rate of 3%, and deflation of -0.1% year on year in December 2012 had given way to inflation of 1.1% by October.</p> <p>But the burning question for 2014 is whether the first two of his three policy \"arrows\" \u2013 a spending surge and quantitative easing on a massive scale \u2013 will be followed by the promised third arrow: economic reform. Among other things, the Abe administration is creating hundreds of thousands of childcare places, in a bid to tempt more mothers into the workplace and harness the power of what he calls womenomics. A series of overseas trade deals, including the ambitious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/trans-pacific-partnership-a-guide-to-the-most-contentious-issues\" title=\"\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, are also likely to lead to the opening-up of new sectors of Japanese industry to competition.</p> <p>But these are long-term reforms, and investors are expecting Abenomics to go on yielding quick results. There's a clear risk markets will lose faith with the debt-burdened Japanese government in the meantime (ratio of debt to GDP: 246%). By the end of 2014, we will have a much clearer idea of whether Abe's gamble has paid off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two big anniversaries will be celebrated next summer: the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war and seven years since the start of the most serious global financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Neither, despite initial optimism, was over by Christmas. Indeed, recovery from the events triggered by the losses made on sub-prime mortgages in the United States has been as faltering and costly as the war of attrition on the western front: the occasional advance set against a prolonged period of stasis. The coming year is supposed to be the one in which the global economy finally sorts out its problems: the US picks up speed; China avoids a hard landing; Japan emerges once and for all from deflation; Europe exits its debt crisis; and new regimes for supervising banks ensure no return to the irresponsible, highly leveraged lending of the pre-crash era. But the events of the past few years have taught policymakers not to count their chickens. There are still five good reasons for them to remain vigilant: The nature of the crisis History shows that the most serious recessions are those that involve the financial sector, include a large number of countries and affect the core of the global system. The crisis that began in 2007 scores on all three counts. Unfinished business In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression, strict curbs were put on the activities of the banks and these remained in force for many decades. Supervision has been tightened up since the near-collapse of the financial system in late 2008 but the power of the big international banks has not really been challenged and the shadow banking system remains largely unregulated. Unconventional policy Central banks and finance ministries tore up their instruction manuals when the crisis erupted. They slashed interest rates to just above zero, they turned on the money presses, they used taxpayers' money to recapitalise the banks and they allowed budget deficits to balloon in order to support demand. Economic policy entered uncharted waters and has remained there. Fiscal policy \u2013 decisions affecting tax and spending \u2013 has been tightened, but none of the major central banks is planning to raise interest rates or to sell back the bonds they have amassed through quantitative easing. Central banks have no real idea what will happen when they try to return monetary policy to normal. Global disharmony For a brief period when the global crisis looked most dangerous, there was genuine co-operation in the G20 gathering of developed and emerging-market economies. There was a sense that global problems \u2013 a shortage of demand, high unemployment levels, regulation of transnational finance \u2013 required global solutions. This mood, however, only lasted from the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 until the London summit of April 2009. Once emergency action had averted a second Great Depression, countries went their own way, leaving the G20 an ineffectual body. Falling real incomes The squeeze on real wages is one way in which the \"new normal\" differs from the pre-crash world. While there had been signs in the quarter-century leading up to 2007 that weaker trade union power and outsourcing had made life tougher for workers, the tendency was for wages to rise more quickly than prices. The post-crash period has seen a period of falling inflation-adjusted incomes unprecedented in modern history \u2013 a lost decade of eroding living standards that has resulted in a dearth of global demand at a time of global overproduction.",
