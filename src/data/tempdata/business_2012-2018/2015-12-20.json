      "bodyText": "The Christmas tree in the reception of what used to be Mark Group, an energy company with more than 1,000 staff, looks jaunty enough but underneath it there are barely a handful of presents. \u201cThey\u2019re fake,\u201d confides one of the few remaining staff. It is a grim reminder of the hardship being faced by hundreds of people who lost their jobs when the company went into administration in October. George Baker, 27, a thermographer, was part of a team analysing thermal images of homes to see how much energy they were wasting. The cost of Christmas presents for his two daughters, aged three and six, will come from his jobseeker\u2019s allowance and his partner\u2019s part-time wage, with support from friends and family. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to the best of our ability not to let this affect them and we\u2019ve kept their routine the same, as far as possible,\u201d Baker explained after the weekly trip to collect his dole money. \u201cChristmas is just around the corner so that\u2019s one of the main struggles at the moment.\u201d George was one of nearly 1,000 workers who were informed by administrators from Deloitte that their services were no longer required at the Leicester-based business. \u201cThere was a lot of emotion, crying from the ladies and anger from the men, but there was nothing we could do. I had to drive home and tell my other half in a company car I had, because I lived far away. About a week after, someone turned up at 8.30am knocking on the door saying they were here for the car. I can\u2019t buy another one, so that affects everything from going to the shops to dropping the little ones off at nursery.\u201d Prior to Mark Group\u2019s failure, George had been in full-time employment for seven years. Now he cannot find work because there is little demand for his niche skill in his home town of Doncaster. \u201cThe first few weeks were full, just sorting out our finances. After that it got very empty and boring. I just didn\u2019t know what to do with myself and I wasn\u2019t sleeping because I haven\u2019t been doing as much during the day. I suppose it\u2019s practice for when I retire,\u201d he said. Before its demise, Mark Group was a sizeable operation with two main divisions \u2013 one installing insulation to improve energy efficiency in homes and the other fitting solar panels for both the commercial and residential markets. The insulation business had already suffered due to the government\u2019s decision in 2014 to axe the green deal, which helped fund energy efficiency measures such as cavity wall insulation. The company had been thrown a lifeline when this year the US firm SunEdison decided to buy Mark Group to use as a beachhead for investing in the UK\u2019s growing solar industry. Eight weeks later, however, the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, announced plans for an 87% cut to the feed-in tariff \u2013 a scheme under which the government paid people with solar panels for the energy they produced. The proposal demolished the financial rationale for people and businesses to install solar, signing Mark Group\u2019s death warrant in the process. Like many of his former colleagues, George blames the government for his current situation. \u201cThe changes they make in parliament have an impact all over the country,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s former chief commercial officer, Bill Rumble, who has formed an insulation company called BillsaveUK out of the ashes of Mark Group, agrees. Sitting a few feet away from a trophy for Leicestershire\u2019s business of the year, awarded to Mark Group in 2009, he recounts the sequence of events that killed off the firm. Although the end of the green deal hurt Mark Group\u2019s business model, SunEdison\u2019s arrival offered a glimpse of a bright future backed by an overseas investors with deep pockets. Mark Group had recently installed the largest roof-mounted photovoltaic array in the UK, at a Marks &amp; Spencer distribution centre, and expected to win more big-ticket contracts with its newfound backer. But the decision to take the axe to subsidies dealt a crippling blow to the investment case for solar. \u201cSunEdison acquired the business understanding that the environment was supportive,\u201d Rumble said. \u201cAs soon as the feed-in tariff was removed, that position looked very different.\u201d What\u2019s more, Rumble believes that solar energy was just a few years away from being cheap enough not to require government support to grow. He said: \u201cWe understood the industry couldn\u2019t depend on subsidies forever. But in four or five years it could have been an energy source that was subsidy-free. It seems short-sighted.\u201d The day the administrators came in was \u201cundoubtedly one of the worst days of my life\u201d, he recalled. \u201cHelping people carry personal belongings to their cars brings it home to you. You\u2019re not sure what to say when they close the boot. It all feels very cold. \u201cThere will still be people out there facing a miserable Christmas. We were a large company and our job losses were very visible but I\u2019m sure that story will be repeated many times over in small businesses around the country.\u201d Even the government agrees with that view. Last week, Rudd rowed back on the subsidy cut, reducing it to 65%. But her department\u2019s own impact assessment estimates that even this milder cut could cost up to 18,700 jobs. Even those who have managed to find work after Mark Group\u2019s demise have been left scarred by the experience. Vanessa Reading, 43, Rumble\u2019s personal assistant, found that the stress of redundancies had created resentment among former friends. \u201cA lot of people have got jobs with Billsave but there are people who haven\u2019t who now hate the company and the directors,\u201d she explained. \u201cSome people have turned against me, friends, because I\u2019ve got a job here, but I\u2019ve got bills to pay. I\u2019m a single mum with a son and I need to put food on the table.\u201d Liz Kendall, Labour\u2019s MP in Leicester West, helped to organise a jobs fair for former Mark Group employees, 50 of whom found work as a result. \u201cI was really devastated for everyone who lost their job at Mark Group and I know that being unemployed is particularly difficult at this time of year,\u201d Kendall said. She told the Guardian she had written to the business secretary, Sajid Javid, about the impact of government policy in her constituency and been referred to Rudd, who Kendall says has so far refused to meet to discuss the matter.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christmas shoppers have been snapping up festive bargains, as retailers slashed prices to cope with tough trading conditions. At Oxford Circus on Sunday, throngs of consumers exiting the tube station to the sound of steel drums playing Jingle Bells, were greeted by a forest of sale signs and discount tags. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by how quiet it is. It\u2019s even a lot quieter than it is in summer. I\u2019ve enjoyed shopping today,\u201d said Gavin Hodges, 32, holding a bag with a roll of wrapping paper sticking out. \u201cI bought one thing for myself and one thing for my husband.\u201d Hodges said he had a similar experience on Saturday, at the vast Westfield shopping centre at White City, west London. \u201cThe 50% sales \u2013 it\u2019s started,\u201d he said. That chimes with Andy Lyon, retail expert at consultancy PWC, who said retailers in Nottingham, Leicester and Birmingham had reported a \u201crelatively quiet\u201d weekend, as shoppers increasingly rely on the internet to do their Christmas shopping, instead of queuing up in stores. \u201cI don\u2019t think the big rush has happened. Online has gone from strength to strength, and that\u2019s the real winner this Christmas,\u201d he said. PWC expects online sales in 2015 to be up 20% on last year. \u201cFrom the retailers\u2019 point of view it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re panicking just yet; but the next few days will be quite interesting to watch.\u201d Unusually mild weather has made warm winter clothes ranges difficult to shift, adding to the woes of retailers who experienced disappointing sales on Black Friday last month, despite offering deep discounts. Fashion retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 issued a profit warning last week, saying that the warm autumn had dented sales. It said profits would be up to 22% below expectations. The traditional January sales now start well before Christmas, with savvy consumers primed to expect price cuts. Data collected by PWC suggests that three-quarters of retailers are already reducing prices \u2013 a similar proportion to the same time last year. Veteran retail analyst Richard Hyman said drastic pre-Christmas discounts are the final chapter in what he claims has been the most challenging year for the retail sector in more than 35 years. Prices have fallen consistently throughout the year, with supermarkets in particular facing relentless competition from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Despite recent increases in wages, which have begun to ease the squeeze on living standards which followed the financial crisis, Hyman predicts a shake-out in the New Year, as shops count the cost of a lacklustre Christmas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of zombie-looking, ailing retailers that are not long for this world,\u201d he said. He also ridiculed British retail efforts to to mimic Black Friday \u2013 traditionally a big shopping day in America, and the day after Thanksgiving. Last year, there were scuffles in some stores as consumers swooped on cut-price consumer electronics, such as televisions. But sales this year appear to have been disappointing. \u201cBlack Friday was a disaster,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cAfter a relentless diet of discounting, the retail sector tried to say to consumers, \u2018Here\u2019s another discount.\u2019\u201d Back on Oxford Street, Julian Chinnici, 29, confirms that despite the bustle, the pre-Christmas rush is not as frenzied as in some years. \u201cIt\u2019s less busy than I expected it would be.

I\u2019ve been busy rushing all the shopping for everyone. But I am finished for today.\u201d Not everyone in the crowds had shopping bags in their hands, with Christmas shoppers joined by tourists and people just soaking up the festive atmosphere. Sitting on a bench among the shoppers, Chris Fields, 43, said: \u201cI\u2019ve been people-watching. It\u2019s so mild \u2013 people are even out in T-shirts. It seems upbeat, and it\u2019s nice to see decorations.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure how much shopping was left to do: \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask my wife\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are selling out of meats such as venison as adventurous shoppers opt for alternatives to the traditional turkey for the UK Christmas dinner centrepiece. Sales of duck, guinea fowl, goose and even veal are all strong as diners seek to upgrade their festive feast by recreating a favourite restaurant experience or a TV cookery dish. While turkey may still rule the roost as the favourite festive meat for Christmas dinner, retailers say their customers are this year choosing smaller birds and easy-to-carve cuts such as turkey crowns to serve alongside alternative meats and see the family through the holiday period. At Sainsbury\u2019s, rack of venison and veal roasting joints from its pre-order range have both sold out. Overall venison sales are more than double (up 115%) this time last year. The retailer ordered 40% more veal in volume terms during the lead up to Christmas and has doubled its range of RSPCA Freedom Food accredited veal lines. It expects to sell more than 100,000 fresh turkeys on Tuesday alone, but predicts the most popular size will be 6kg compared with 7kg in the past. Sales of organic turkeys and crowns (which now account for more than half its turkey sales) are also up 10% year on year. \u201cOver the last year we\u2019ve been working with our trusted suppliers to bring more top quality game and veal to our customers in response to their huge popularity,\u201d said Susi Richards, head of food at Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cIt used to be that these sorts of meats were only ordered in restaurants. Now, for a special occasion like Christmas, people want to recreate the experience at home. Venison and veal are high protein and low in fat, making them great choices for nourishing the family throughout the festive season, which is much more than just Christmas Day itself.\u201d Tesco said over the last three years demand for goose, guinea fowl and duck has grown by around 20%. \u201cWith the growing popularity of TV cooking shows we are finding that more people than ever before are looking to jazz up their festive feasts,\u201d said Tesco poultry buyer Kieran Gilmore. \u201cWhile turkey remains as popular as ever, it\u2019s guinea fowl, goose and duck that have been growing the most in popularity with Christmas shoppers.\u201d Guinea fowl was \u201ca particular gourmet treat with its rich and succulent taste\u201d, Gilmore said. \u201cAs it\u2019s not as big as the other traditional Christmas birds it\u2019s definitely something to consider for a smaller gathering.\u201d The trade body British Goose Producers said sales of goose are up by 8% on last Christmas, possibly thanks to a storyline in The Archers. However, geese remain massively outnumbered by turkeys, with 10m turkeys consumed in the UK last Christmas, compared with just 250,000 geese. The discount supermarkets are also offering premium products. At the weekend Aldi offered its first ever dry-hung, free-range bronze turkey from Suffolk producer Rumburgh Farm, costing \u00a344.99 for a 4kg-6 kg bird, around half the cost of a bird of comparable quality from upmarket rivals. In what it claims is a UK first to help the country\u2019s growing number of single-person and smaller households, Tesco is selling a microwaveable frozen turkey joint complete with stuffing, which takes just 10 minutes to cook. Waitrose said enough turkey foil will be sold in the week of Christmas to wrap Big Ben over nine times and it will sell more than 800,000 kg of turkey \u2013 enough to feed more than 1.7m people. Christmas Eve, or \u201cT-day\u201d, is the busiest day for its customers to pick up their turkeys, with one being collected every second.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Netflix paid no UK corporation tax last year despite being estimated to have around 4.5m subscribers in the country, it has been reported. The video streaming service behind award-winning series such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards charges customers a minimum of \u00a35.99 a month to subscribe and has grown rapidly since its UK launch in 2012. According to a Sunday Times investigation, it generated an estimated \u00a3200m of revenue in Britain last year but any profits from the UK in 2014 were booked overseas. There is no suggestion that Netflix has broken the law. The paper reported that latest accounts for Netflix International BV, which was based in Luxembourg until the end of last year, show a net turnover of \u00a3415m and profits of \u00a311.3m in 2014, with British customers accounting for the largest proportion of turnover. It says the company paid income tax in Luxembourg of \u00a3573,396, equivalent to a rate of about 5%. The company says it is in \u201cexpansion\u201d mode and is making overall losses on its international operation. A spokesman said its British subsidiary employs about 12 people and will pay some corporation tax this year, adding: \u201cWe are fully compliant with all applicable rules.\u201d In July, it was reported that despite having more than 65m subscriptions worldwide the cost of third-party content on Netflix was $7.7bn (\u00a35.2bn), about 4.6 times its net revenue. Earlier this month, Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, was reported to have paid zero UK corporation tax last year. By contrast, Starbucks, which was widely criticised over corporate tax avoidance in 2012 following details of its meagre tax contribution, revealed last week it has paid \u00a38.1m corporation tax this year, nearly as much as it paid in its first 14 years in the UK, after bowing to pressure to scrap its complex tax structures. The UK is believed to be Netflix\u2019s biggest market outside the US, where it has more than 40m subscribers, with the number of British subscribers predicted to reach 9.5m by the end of the decade. The company has been facing increasing competition from rival streaming services such as Amazon, Hulu and HBO in the US. In the UK, Amazon Prime is Netflix\u2019s closest rival.",

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers now have to save for up to 24 years to set aside a deposit large enough to buy them a foot on Britain\u2019s housing ladder, according to new research. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has used the Bank of England\u2019s latest survey of household finances to show that with house prices rising sharply, it would now take almost a quarter of a century for low- and middle-income households to accumulate a deposit on average, if they set aside 5% of their disposable income each year. It is lower than the peak reached before the financial crisis, but dramatically higher than the three years that was the norm in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 and comes despite interest rates remaining at the emergency level of 0.5% set by the Bank of England in the depths of recession. George Osborne has introduced a series of help-to-buy policies, including shared ownership schemes and taxpayer guarantees for mortgages for first-time buyers, and pledged in his spending review last month to \u201cturn generation rent into generation buy\u201d. But Resolution\u2019s chief economist, Matt Whittaker, warned that help to buy may simply boost house prices, lifting them further out of the reach of lower-income households. \u201cTo the extent that these schemes have stoked demand and so propped up house prices in recent years, they have served to make homeownership even less attainable for many, while increasing the gains flowing to older homeowners who have been the main beneficiaries of the sustained housing boom,\u201d he said. Resolution said it is concerned that the rising cost of homeownership is exacerbating a generational divide, which has seen the baby boomer generation accumulate a financial cushion, while younger workers have struggled as wages have been squeezed. Its analysis of the Bank\u2019s data shows that among households headed by under-45s, 28% of non-homeowners say they do not think they will ever manage to buy. Among the poorest fifth of households, the figure rises to 39%. Ashley Seager, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation thinktank, which campaigns for a better deal for younger households, said: \u201cToday\u2019s wealthy baby boomers found it easy to buy housing a generation or two ago, especially as MIRAS tax relief on mortgages was available to them. But now their children and grandchildren cannot access housing in anything like the same way.\u201d He welcomed the chancellor\u2019s recent crackdown on the buy-to-let market, which has restricted the tax relief landlords can claim, with the aim of levelling the playing field with owner-occupiers. The Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, which has been given the task of preventing future financial crises, has also warned that it is becoming increasingly concerned about whether buy-to-let borrowers are fuelling an unsustainable boom. Osborne is currently consulting about whether to hand the FPC new powers over buy to let, which could see the supply of mortgages dry up, even if the Bank\u2019s base rate remains at zero.",

Ashley has called an extraordinary general meeting on Monday of Findel shareholders, who will vote on the appointment of Ben Gardener, a Sports Direct employee, to the board. Findel\u2019s board has already advised shareholders to vote against the appointment of Gardener, who is linked to the controversial administration of part of Sports Direct\u2019s USC chain. In a letter to shareholders, it said the appointment would \u201ccompromise the independence of the board and would provide information and voice to one shareholder in preference to other shareholders\u201d. Major shareholders Toscafund, Schroders and River &amp; Mercantile, who together control 43.9% of Findel, have already agreed to vote against Sports Direct. Their support for Findel\u2019s board means Sports Direct is unlikely to secure the 50% backing it needs to install Gardener. The battle with Findel comes as Ashley\u2019s business faces heavy criticism over employment practices at Sports Direct following revelations made by the Guardian. Sports Direct boss Dave Forsey has also been charged with a criminal offence in relation to redundancies which occurred when part of the USC fashion chain was put into administration. Findel said Sports Direct was a direct competitor of its online football kit store Kitbag and was also interested in buying its Express Gifts division, which sells homewares, toys, games and other gifts online. \u201cIt is not appropriate to appoint a [Sports Direct] nominee director to the board given [Sports Direct\u2019s] commercial interests in the company\u2019s business,\u201d the board said. \u201cThe most appropriate way for [Sports Direct] to gain control of the company\u2019s capabilities is to make a fair offer for the whole company. Were [Sports Direct] to purchase the company from shareholders, it could make appointments to the board and control the company\u2019s business.\u201d Sports Direct snapped up its 19% stake in Findel in September. Its shares soared, on speculation that Ashley was after Kitbag and in anticipation of a bidding war, as Findel said it had already agreed terms on a sale with another party. In early November Sports Direct put out a notice requisitioning an emergency shareholder meeting to vote on the appointment of Gardener. Sports Direct has a history of taking strategic stakes in other retailers in an attempt to gain influence over their boards. Earlier this year it secured space within Debenhams\u2019 department stores after taking out a put option on shares in Debenhams, which gave it influence over a 16.6% stake.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Fed has spoken. For the first time in nearly a decade, policymakers this week boosted key short-term interest rates. Now that the deal is done it is time for you to start looking at your interest rate policy too. Banks, having read the signals, were quick to respond. Within hours, Wells Fargo became the first in a steady parade of financial institutions to boost their own prime lending rates, with those increases taking effect Thursday. The best customers at banks like JPMorgan Chase, KeyCorp, SunTrust, PNC, Citibank, Wells Fargo and many others now will pay a base rate of 3.5% for their consumer loans, instead of the 3.25% that has been in effect for the past seven years. By historic standards, that\u2019s still cheap. For most of the past two decades, prime lending rates have hovered between 5% and 10%, and as recently as 2007 topped 8%. But after such a long period during which lending rates haven\u2019t budged an inch, any change is bound to come as a shock \u2013 especially when it\u2019s simply the harbinger of more profound changes still to come. The rate hike announced by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues last week won\u2019t be an isolated event, as they made clear in their statement after wrapping up their meeting and announcing their decision. By the end of 2016, they expect the federal funds rate to be at about 1.375%, up from its current, new range of 0.25% to 0.50%. That means that we need to brace ourselves for at least four more interest hikes next year \u2013 and four more opportunities for lenders to make all forms of consumer debt more costly. This time around, banks and other lenders have had plenty of time to prepare for a single, very small rate increase. Speculation about the first post-financial crisis rate hike has been swirling around the financial markets throughout the year, and debt markets have priced in much of the movement. When Yellen made the much-telegraphed announcement (having previously done everything except hire the Goodyear blimp to warn us all what was coming) the US stock market even staged a brief, daylong relief rally. Going forward, however, the uncertainty will be greater, and each rate increase will be that much more burdensome both for consumers and for the economy as a whole. So, while there\u2019s no reason to panic about what modestly higher interest rates might do to your financial situation, or to financial markets, there\u2019s a good argument for using the coming weeks to prepare yourself for what\u2019s coming. First of all, you\u2019ll need to accept the reality that the cost of your debt is going to rise more rapidly than the income you get from your savings. That may seem counterintuitive, since both what you owe in the form of loans and what you receive in interest on debt is tied to the interest rate. Usually, banks will raise interest rates in order to attract cash in the form of deposits, but right now, they\u2019re pretty flush with capital and don\u2019t need to attract much more: they\u2019re already wondering how to lend out what they already have in a prudent manner. That means there is little incentive for them, at this early stage in the game, to move rapidly to pay more interest on savings accounts as the Fed raises rates. Studies suggest that this has been true historically, too; the reluctance on the part of banks to match Fed interest rate hikes promptly with offers of higher interest rates to depositors may have cost the latter as much as $100bn annually during periods when the Fed was boosting rates. You can start shopping around for better options on both savings accounts (currently averaging a mere 0.1%, a fifth of the level it was back in 2006, according to Bankrate) and certificates of deposit, or CDs; yields on a one-year CD now average only 0.3%, down from 4% in 2006. The larger a deposit you are able to make (and in the case of a CD, the longer the time period you are able to tie up the money for), the higher the rate you are likely to find. If you\u2019re looking for a high-yielding savings account, your best bet may be an online bank that compensates for its lack of physical presence (and the convenience that offers and that many customers still value) by offering some of the best savings account interest rates. Still, your ability to capture any upside from higher interest rates is going to be limited by the willingness of financial institutions to pass along those benefits in the form of higher-yielding investments. It\u2019s true that new CDs issued in the coming months likely will offer more appealing rates. The problem? If you need to cash out an existing CD in order to move capital into one of those higher-paying products, you\u2019ll likely face much greater penalties designed to prevent you from doing precisely that. While you\u2019ll want to keep scrutinizing the landscape for opportunities that present themselves, in the next few months, your priority needs to be on the risk side of the ledger. That\u2019s because, as the prompt action of the banks with respect to their prime rates demonstrated, financial institutions will move more rapidly to make the costs of auto loans, credit card borrowing, home equity lines of credit, mortgages and other loans more costly. If you\u2019ve got an adjustable-rate mortgage that has an annual readjustment feature, you really should be talking about refinancing your mortgage into a fixed-rate structure before the impact of a series of rate hikes begins to take its toll. Anyone with any kind of floating rate debt should evaluate their financial situation, calculating not only what they can afford to pay at today\u2019s interest rates but if interest rates rise a full percentage point between now and the end of 2016. One of the contributing factors in the mortgage crisis that began in 2007 was the fact that too few people understood how much they would have to fork out every month on their adjustable rate mortgages when interest rates rose. Still, before making the switch from variable to fixed interest rates, check to see it makes sense, given your balance and the time remaining on the loan, since fixed interest rates tend to be higher. Look for ways to shift debt into lower-cost structures. In the case of credit card users, that may mean using seizing zero percent introductory rates offered by card issuers to new customers with good credit. If you\u2019re a disciplined borrower and know you won\u2019t load up your cards with fresh spending (and you\u2019re in a financial position to do so), you might be able to take out a home equity line of credit or other bank loan at a lower interest rate than your credit cards are offering and use the proceeds to pay off the balance on your cards. The ripple effects will take months to show up. Federal student loans reprice in the summer, for instance, and by next July undoubtedly will be pricier. By then, private student loans already will have registered the impact of higher borrowing costs, since their interest rates are linked closely to short-term interest rates. Fed policymakers have told us what they\u2019re going to do next. It\u2019s up to us to listen and prepare as best we can.",

For the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">first time in nearly a decade</a>, policymakers this week boosted key short-term interest rates. Now that the deal is done it is time for you to start looking at your interest rate policy too.</p> <p> Banks, having read the signals, were quick to respond. Within hours, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/16/wells-fargo-bank-announced-wednesday-it-would-increase-its-prime-rate-to-35-percent.html\">Wells Fargo</a> became the first in a steady parade of financial institutions to boost their own prime lending rates, with those increases taking effect Thursday. The best customers at banks like JPMorgan Chase, KeyCorp, SunTrust, PNC, Citibank, Wells Fargo and many others now will pay a base rate of 3.5% for their consumer loans, instead of the 3.25% that has been in effect for the past seven years.</p> <p> By historic standards, that\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/bank-lending-rate\">still cheap</a>. For most of the past two decades, prime lending rates have hovered between 5% and 10%, and as recently as 2007 topped 8%. But after such a long period during which lending rates haven\u2019t budged an inch, any change is bound to come as a shock \u2013 especially when it\u2019s simply the harbinger of more profound changes still to come.</p> <p> The rate hike announced by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues last week won\u2019t be an isolated event, as they <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-16/fed-ends-zero-rate-era-signals-4-quarter-point-2016-increases\">made clear in their statement</a> after wrapping up their meeting and announcing their decision. By the end of 2016, they expect the federal funds rate to be at about 1.375%, up from its current, new range of 0.25% to 0.50%. That means that we need to brace ourselves for at least four more interest hikes next year \u2013 and four more opportunities for lenders to make all forms of consumer debt more costly.</p> <p> This time around, banks and other lenders have had plenty of time to prepare for a single, very small rate increase. Speculation about the first post-financial crisis rate hike has been swirling around the financial markets throughout the year, and debt markets have priced in much of the movement. When Yellen made the much-telegraphed announcement (having previously done everything except hire the Goodyear blimp to warn us all what was coming) the US stock market even staged a brief, daylong <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/market-snapshot-dow-rallies-on-heels-of-historic-federal-reserve-interestrate-hike-20151216-00748\">relief rally</a>. </p> <p> Going forward, however, the uncertainty will be greater, and each rate increase will be that much more burdensome both for consumers and for the economy as a whole. So, while there\u2019s no reason to panic about what modestly higher interest rates might do to your financial situation, or to financial markets, there\u2019s a good argument for using the coming weeks to prepare yourself for what\u2019s coming.</p> <p> First of all, you\u2019ll need to accept the reality that the cost of your debt is going to rise more rapidly than the income you get from your savings. That may seem counterintuitive, since both what you owe in the form of loans and what you receive in interest on debt is tied to the interest rate. </p> <p> Usually, banks will raise interest rates in order to attract cash in the form of deposits, but right now, they\u2019re pretty flush with capital and don\u2019t need to attract much more: they\u2019re already wondering how to lend out what they already have in a prudent manner.

      "bodyText": "It is December 1843 in London. Queen Victoria has been on the throne for six years, Sir Robert Peel is prime minister, and Charles Dickens is about to publish a seasonal novella. A Christmas Carol is the story of how the embittered miser Ebenezer Scrooge becomes generous and cuddly following visits from the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. It is December 2015. Queen Elizabeth II has just become Britain\u2019s longest reigning monarch. David Cameron, who views himself as a modern-day Peel, is prime minister. And a latter-day Dickens is about to publish a remake of the 19th-century classic. So here it is: an economics Christmas Carol. The story begins with a journey a century into the past. In many ways life could not have been grimmer in December 1915. The Great European powers have been at war for 16 months. Britain and her allies have suffered heavy losses at Gallipoli; armies face each other across the barbed wire on the western front. But it is not all bad news. A second industrial revolution is in full swing, bringing with it a new wave of inventions that will transform the way people live their lives. Some of these \u2013 the telephone, the motor car, the aeroplane, electric light, cinema \u2013 are already available. Others, such as wireless, TV and antibiotics, remain in the future. The economic change spawns a cultural revolution. Modernism is all the rage, from Stravinsky and Picasso to Joyce and Le Corbusier. Now turn the clock forward by 20 years. It is 1935, another unhappy period. It is the decade of the Great Depression and totalitarianism. The Nuremberg race laws have been passed; Stalin\u2019s purges are in full swing. But look closely enough and, once again, there is a silver lining to the cloud. The worst of the slump is over and unemployment is coming down. In the US, laws are being passed to prevent Wall Street from capsizing the economy. In Britain, Keynes is putting the finishing touches to the General Theory, a book that will revolutionise economics. Old industries such as coal are in decline. Newer industries such as car manufacturing are on the rise. It\u2019s now December 1975 and pessimism abounds. The long postwar boom has come to a sudden halt following a fivefold increase in oil prices. Keynesian economics seems incapable of finding a solution to stagflation: a combination of high inflation and rising unemployment. In Britain, the annual increase in the cost of living has reached a peacetime peak of 26%, and before another year is out the Labour government will be forced to obtain a loan from the International Monetary Fund that comes with painful strings attached. On the other hand, the internet revolution has begun, the first mobile telephone call has been made two years earlier, and any year that includes the first showing of Fawlty Towers can\u2019t be all bad. So, that\u2019s Christmases past. The first thing to say about Christmas present is that it could have been worse. At one point in 2015, the euro was having an existential crisis, there appeared a real possibility that the world would slide into deflation, and that regional conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East might spread. There have been four big themes to the global economy in 2015. The first is the uncertainty about what has been happening in China, where growth has clearly slowed but nobody is quite sure by how much. Officially, everything is going according to a plan that will allow growth to be more sustainable, but the official figures are, with good reason, taken with a large dollop of salt. Some analysts, those at the consultancy Fathom, for example, believe China is already suffering a hard economic landing. The second big theme, linked to the first, has been collapsing commodity prices. If 1975 was a year when Opec showed its muscle, 2015 has been the year when the oil cartel demonstrated its impotence. At a time when Iranian oil has started to flow back into global energy markets, Saudi Arabia has decided to drive the oil price lower by pumping more crude in the vain belief this will kill off the US shale industry. This is a classic example of a country shooting itself in the foot; the Saudis need an oil price of $100 a barrel to balance the books. The price is currently around a third of that level. The third theme has been Greece and the euro. From the moment Alexis Tsipras became prime minister at the head of his Syriza coalition in January, Athens was on a collision course with its single-currency partners. Tsipras had three mutually incompatible objectives: to soften the terms of Greece\u2019s austerity programme; to return the country to growth; and to remain in the euro. At one point in the summer, it looked as if this trilemma might be resolved by Greece leaving (or being pushed out of) the single currency. Eventually, and in time-honoured fashion, Europe came to a compromise: Greece got a third bailout by agreeing to more draconian terms than those in force before Syriza came to power. The half-finished nature of the global recovery has been the fourth big theme of 2015. In the developed world, Britain and the US appear to have made more progress than the eurozone and Japan, but life has not really returned to normal even in the Anglo-Saxon economies. To be sure, growth looks reasonably solid and unemployment is down to pre-crisis levels, but only because interest rates have remained at ultra-low levels. Inflation is low and workers have had to get used to nugatory wage increases. The year has ended with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in the US for the first time in almost decade, a small increase in the cost of borrowing that could have big ramifications in some of the more vulnerable emerging market economies. Brazil, in particular, is in serious trouble. The optimistic way of looking at 2015 is to see it as the pivot between the long hangover that followed the Great Recession and a new era of strong growth marked by stricter control of financial markets, a new wave of inventions, and the move towards a cleaner, greener economy following the deal on climate change reached in Paris earlier this month. The pessimistic way of looking at 2015 is to see it as a brief interlude between one crisis and the next, marked by the steady descent into deflation, populism and protectionism. Seen from this perspective, the underlying problems of the global economy \u2013 inequality, debt and financial market excess \u2013 have not gone away. The ghost of Christmas future knows what happens next. But as all Dickens fans know, his works were often published as serials to keep the reader guessing. Come back next week to find out what 2016 will bring.",

Parkmead is headed by Tom Cross, who founded and later sold Dana Petroleum to Korea National Oil Corporation for $2.9bn.

Unseasonably warm weather, security fears in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks and a shift to online shopping have combined with hopes of catching a late bargain to make this year a nail-biter for many retailers. Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and BHS are among those already running extensive promotions, particularly on knitwear and coats, which have been left on the rails as temperatures have topped 15C in one of the mildest Decembers in more than 50 years. The average level of discounts across the high street is expected to hit 45% this weekend, according to analysts at consultancy Deloitte \u2013 the deepest level since 2008 when the British banking system nearly collapsed. The warm weather has already pushed one retailer, Bonmarch\u00e9, into a pre-Christmas profit warning, and analysts believe others could follow. Retail analysts at HSBC cut their expectations for clothing sales over Christmas by 2% last week. \u201cThe net result will be a transfer into post-Christmas sales at a loss of revenue and or [profit] margin,\u201d Paul Rossington said. He cut annual profit forecasts for Debenhams, Next, M&amp;S and N Brown. Food shopping has also been delayed as many people will take time off after this weekend. \u201cShoppers will leave it late this year \u2013 60% are planning to do their main grocery shop in the week before Christmas,\u201d said Mike Watkins, UK head of retailer and business insight at market research firm Nielsen. An estimated \u00a35.9bn is expected to be spent over the four days from Saturday to Tuesday, according to card provider MasterCard, more than half of it on groceries. Retailers are also unsure of the impact of the Black Friday discount day in late November, which is likely to have encouraged shoppers to buy early to bag a bargain. \u201cThe end of 2015 sees the sector in a state of flux as retailers wait to see whether Christmas peak sales are impacted significantly by Black Friday. A number of retailers\u2019 strategies for the coming year depend on how this \u2018double humped camel\u2019 scenario plays out,\u201d said Julie Carlyle, head of retail at business advisory firm EY. The wider availability of \u201cclick and collect\u201d services, and public confidence in the idea of buying goods online and picking them up when convenient, has also encouraged shoppers to delay their gift purchases. But with just days to go before Christmas, concerns about deliveries mean more people will now hit the high street, where the majority of sales are still made. An estimated 2.5% more shoppers are expected to visit their local high street on Monday compared to last year, according to analysts at FootFall, as the belated shopping spree gets under way. Steve Richardson, UK regional director at FootFall, said: \u201cWe expect the Panic Monday shift \u2013 when consumers abandon online shopping and take to the streets, in a bid to ensure they tick off all the final gifts on their Christmas lists \u2013 to be even more pronounced this year.\u201d He said Tuesday 22 December was likely to be the busiest day of the week, based on evidence from 2009, the last time that Christmas Day fell on a Friday. Visa, however, is predicting that Wednesday 23rd will be the biggest shopping day, when its cardholders will spend nearly \u00a32m a minute during the lunchtime rush as Brits spend 3% more overall than on the same day last year.",

    "webTitle": "The innovators: colour-changing bandage to help fight antibiotic resistance", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The growing threat of antibiotic resistance because of unnecessary prescribing is a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d that should be ranked alongside terrorism in terms of risk, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Sally Davis, has said. The drugs are often administered to patients with wounds as a precautionary measure to prevent a bacterial infection from developing. However, not all patients will need antibiotics and the problem for doctors is identifying which ones are susceptible to infection. Researchers at the University of Bath, led by Dr Toby Jenkins, have developed a type of dressing that can alert doctors when a wound becomes infected, avoiding the precautionary use of antibiotics. The dressing releases a fluorescent dye in small dots when a wound, such as a burn, becomes infected, allowing medics to treat it quickly. Jenkins recalls visiting a burns unit six years ago with Dr Amber Young, his clinical collaborator on the project, who heads the burns research centre at Bristol children\u2019s hospital. The sight of a child suffering from severe burns after accidentally pouring boiling water over herself was a powerful motivation, he says. While the primary trauma injury could be treated, there was a real risk of infection. \u201cKnowing that because there was no rapid way to diagnose the infection and that she could die the next day as a result is highly motivational,\u201d Jenkins said. Typically, if a doctor is concerned about a wound, they can use swabs to take samples and send them off to a lab where results will be returned in one or two days, during which time an infection can become full blown and result in septicaemia, sepsis, shock or even death, he said. To be on the safe side, clinicians may prescribe antibiotics if symptoms such as a raised temperature or redness occur. In one study, it was found that 25% of patients in a burns group were treated with antibiotics when the proportion with infections was just 7%. As well as being costly, this adds to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Having to remove the dressing to assess whether the burn is infected is a painful process and can cause scarring or severe trauma in children. In an infected wound, bacteria live in a biofilm, a group of micro-organisms where cells stick to each other. The dressing developed by Jenkins switches to its fluorescent colour when it comes into contact with these wound biofilms. This happens when the build-up of bacteria on the wound reaches a stage where the body\u2019s immune system can no longer deal with it \u2013 the critical colonisation threshold (CCT). \u201cWhat we think happens here is that we get a rapid increase in the bacterial density of the wound surface so you go from perhaps a low density film of bacteria to a really high density bacteria,\u201d Jenkins said. It is not easy to measure, he said, so clinicians and nurses may prescribe antibiotics as a precautionary measure. When the dressing detects infection, the fluorescent dots will be visible in 10-20 minutes. This will be before the bacteria gets into the bloodstream and gives doctors time to act, said Jenkins. The bacteria that the dressing can detect are staphylococcus aureus, of which MRSA is a form, pseudomonas, which was linked to the deaths of three babies in 2012, and enterococcus faecalis, which comes from the gut. \u201cWhat we really want to do is send the patient home but the big worry is that maybe there is an infection so the current advice is that you tell the parent to check the temperature every few hours. But temperature is not a great guide for infection. So you would use this in addition, in part to give parental reassurance that things are OK.\u201d The prototype of the dressing is being tested by the university. It is likely to be trialled on patients in three years and it is hoped that it will be on the market by 2020. The early version does not detect which type of infection has formed, but the aim in future is to have different infections represented by different colours. The threat of Antibiotics resistance Warnings about the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are stark. Davis said that if tough measures were not taken to restrict the use of antibiotics and no new ones were sourced, the health system risked returning to standards last seen in the early 19th century. Research indicates that routine surgery and chemotherapy may become all but impossible unless action is taken to halt the waning effect of antibiotics. If the drugs lose just 30% of their efficacy there could be 120,000 more infections and 6,300 infection-related deaths each year in the US alone, according to a study in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. \u2022You can read our archive of The Innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and around the world.",

However, not all patients will need antibiotics and the problem for doctors is identifying which ones are susceptible to infection.</p> <p>Researchers at the University of Bath, led by Dr Toby Jenkins, have developed a type of dressing that can alert doctors when a wound becomes infected, avoiding the precautionary use of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/antibiotics\">antibiotics</a>.</p> <p>The dressing releases a fluorescent dye in small dots when a wound, such as a burn, becomes infected, allowing medics to treat it quickly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/18/soft-touch-doctors-write-10m-needless-prescriptions-a-year-says-nice\">Doctors write 10m needless antibiotics prescriptions a year, says Nice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jenkins recalls visiting a burns unit six years ago with Dr Amber Young, his clinical collaborator on the project, who heads the burns research centre at Bristol children\u2019s hospital. The sight of a child suffering from severe burns after accidentally pouring boiling water over herself was a powerful motivation, he says.</p> <p>While the primary trauma injury could be treated, there was a real risk of infection. \u201cKnowing that because there was no rapid way to diagnose the infection and that she could die the next day as a result is highly motivational,\u201d Jenkins said.</p> <p>Typically, if a doctor is concerned about a wound, they can use swabs to take samples and send them off to a lab where results will be returned in one or two days, during which time an infection can become full blown and result in septicaemia, sepsis, shock or even death, he said.</p> <p>To be on the safe side, clinicians may prescribe antibiotics if symptoms such as a raised temperature or redness occur. In one study, it was found that 25% of patients in a burns group were treated with antibiotics when the proportion with infections was just 7%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/antibiotics-apocalypse-research-resistance-threat-breakthrough\">I believed we would face an antibiotics apocalypse - until now | Richard James</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as being costly, this adds to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Having to remove the dressing to assess whether the burn is infected is a painful process and can cause scarring or severe trauma in children.</p> <p>In an infected wound, bacteria live in a biofilm, a group of micro-organisms where cells stick to each other. The dressing developed by Jenkins switches to its fluorescent colour when it comes into contact with these wound biofilms. This happens when the build-up of bacteria on the wound reaches a stage where the body\u2019s immune system can no longer deal with it \u2013 the critical colonisation threshold (CCT).</p> <p>\u201cWhat we think happens here is that we get a rapid increase in the bacterial density of the wound surface so you go from perhaps a low density film of bacteria to a really high density bacteria,\u201d Jenkins said. It is not easy to measure, he said, so clinicians and nurses may prescribe antibiotics as a precautionary measure.</p> <p>When the dressing detects infection, the fluorescent dots will be visible in 10-20 minutes. This will be before the bacteria gets into the bloodstream and gives doctors time to act, said Jenkins. </p> <p>The bacteria that the dressing can detect are staphylococcus aureus, of which MRSA is a form, pseudomonas, which was<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16645597\"> linked to the deaths of three babies in 2012</a>, and enterococcus faecalis, which comes from the gut.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we really want to do is send the patient home but the big worry is that maybe there is an infection so the current advice is that you tell the parent to check the temperature every few hours. But temperature is not a great guide for infection. So you would use this in addition, in part to give parental reassurance that things are OK.\u201d</p> <p>The prototype of the dressing is being tested by the university. It is likely to be trialled on patients in three years and it is hoped that it will be on the market by 2020. The early version does not detect which type of infection has formed, but the aim in future is to have different infections represented by different colours.</p> <h2> The threat of Antibiotics resistance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/the-guardian-view-on-antibiotic-resistance-a-clear-and-present-danger\">Warnings</a> about the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are stark.

      "bodyText": "Over the past few days, trade ministers from scores of countries have spent hours flogging the long-dead horse that is the Doha round of global trade talks in Nairobi \u2013 and hardly anyone noticed. The World Trade Organisation, which convened last week\u2019s conference, was once regularly targeted by protesters as the secretive, all-powerful puppet master of global capitalism. Back in 1999, in the innocent days before the sub-prime crisis laid bare the sinister power of international finance, WTO talks in Seattle broke down amid clouds of tear gas, as anti-capitalist protesters expressed their fury at the rigged rules of the global marketplace, which, as they saw it, entrenched the wealth of the rich and excluded the poor. Yet last week\u2019s gathering, attended by Britain\u2019s Lord (Francis) Maude, barely registered with the world\u2019s angry young radicals, who have turned their attention to bashing bankers \u2013 through the Occupy movement, for example. As it became clearer in recent years that the Doha round was dying, the anti-poverty campaigners who once spent hours poring over the intricate details of cotton subsidies and sugar tariffs have moved on too. Launched in late 2001, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in New York, the Doha round was meant to open up new opportunities for developing countries to trade their way out of poverty and drive the next stage of what then seemed the unstoppable progress of globalisation. But 14 years of talks have failed to yield an achievable deal; indeed, the issues dividing the main protagonists have barely shifted since negotiations collapsed acrimoniously in Geneva in July 2008. Back then, I watched US trade representative Susan Schwab lambast her Indian and Chinese counterparts for wanting to protect their farmers from cut-price imports. This issue of \u201cspecial safeguards\u201d was still being scrapped over in Nairobi. Doha failed for many reasons, some more worrisome than others. It was probably always far too ambitious to try to tie up simultaneous deals across agriculture, manufacturing and services. The hope was that countries would give ground in some areas in return for concessions elsewhere, but this unwieldy, triple-track approach meant deadlock in one area led to comprehensive failure. The one-country-one-vote constitution that makes the WTO a more democratic institution than, for example, the International Monetary Fund, also makes negotiations cumbersome and decision-making clunky. Political capital was another key challenge: lowering barriers to foreign competition is a tough domestic sell, especially in hard times when workers feel their jobs may be vulnerable. Optimists at the WTO\u2019s Geneva headquarters hoped President Obama would swing his weight behind their efforts to improve the global trading system, but other priorities \u2013 not least the fraught passing of his healthcare reforms \u2013 have always seemed more pressing in Washington, where suspicion of unfettered free trade runs deep on both sides of Congress. And most recently, a flowering of \u201cplurilateral\u201d deals, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership between the US and Japan, has seen groups of like-minded countries \u2013 economic coalitions of the willing \u2013 sign up to liberalisation on their own terms. Meanwhile, the nature of contemporary capitalism means the hot political issues are no longer import tariffs or agricultural subsidies but international taxation, financialisation and freedom of movement for migrant workers. If Doha is dead, some noble aspirations will be buried with it. It was conceived as a \u201cdevelopment round\u201d \u2013 offering poor countries a stake in the global trading system to tackle poverty and prevent them from becoming recruiting grounds for terrorism. It became increasingly clear, though, that rich countries were unwilling, or politically unable, to offer much without a quid pro quo \u2013 and developing countries don\u2019t have much to give. So what began as an expression of the spirit of internationalism quickly descended into a series of cross-cutting mercantilist spats. And while trade liberalisation continues apace through plurilateral deals between powerful trading blocs, these rarely include the poorest countries. Afghanistan became the WTO\u2019s latest fully signed-up member in Nairobi last week. (This was one of the few concrete announcements to come out of the summit.) But it is joining a train that has been stuck in the station for more than a decade. The WTO still has a crucial role to play, as the policeman of the world\u2019s trading system. But after 14 years of deadlock, the ideal of deepening economic relationships between rich and poor, north and south, in a way that would be mutually beneficial and to which all member countries could sign up has been extinguished. Even protesters who once saw the WTO as the evil headquarters of capitalism red in tooth and claw might spare a moment to lament the fading of one-country-one-vote multilateralism it represented. (The Paris climate talks provided a heartening counter-example \u2013 albeit with few details as to how new emissions targets will be met.) But for those on the left who dream of collective global solutions to the other pressing ills of modern capitalism, from tax avoidance to reckless financiers, 14 years of failure ought to give pause for thought.",
