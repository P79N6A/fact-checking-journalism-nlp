      "bodyText": "Five years ago, when the financial services boom was in full swing, Britain's manufacturers felt like a Cinderella industry, neglected and ignored, as the Labour government knighted bankers and sang the praises of the City. It was a measure of how much has changed that when the EEF, the manufacturing trade body, held its national conference in Westminster earlier this month, Vince Cable and Ed Miliband both delivered major speeches \u2013 followed by a guest appearance by the chancellor at a glitzy dinner that night. Ever since George Osborne declared that he wanted to start a \"march of the makers\" in last year's budget, politicians across the ideological spectrum have been assiduously wooing metal-bashers, carmakers and even obscure research scientists whose inventions might be money-spinners. Ed Miliband has called for a renewed sense of national pride in products that are \"made in Britain\". Yet there remains a sense of frustration in the business community that despite the cheerleading, politicians still don't understand the challenges many firms are facing. British Chambers of Commerce director general John Longworth has lambasted politicians for undermining businesses, burdening them with red tape while expecting them to drive the recovery. He says his organisation is doing its best to point exporters towards what government support is available, but that, overall, Britain is \"miles off\" being business friendly. \"Exporters need to have the right sort of support to access the right markets ... They need to have adequate confidence or access to capital in the home market and they need to be able to employ the right people,\" he says. Vince Cable's department published a \"plan for growth\" alongside last year's budget, which included a smorgasbord of measures on deregulation and government support. But Steve Radley, the EEF's head of policy, says: \"Our concern, looking at it a year on, is: is the plan for growth sufficiently visible, and is it having the impact across Whitehall that it needs to have?\" Cable himself clearly shares these concerns, judging by a highly critical letter to the prime minister about industrial strategy that was leaked to the press. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, says the letter highlighted an ideological gap within the coalition, as well as a problem of practical implementation: \"I think there's a real division within government about how to shape future growth. We've got to move away from the situation where business's voice in government is reliant on the charisma and the clout of the secretary of state.\" The issue cuts across party lines: some in the Tory party \u2013 including backbench MP George Freeman (see right) would like to see the government shrug off the old, instinctive suspicion of state intervention via industrial policy. But Umunna says the chancellor himself, despite his recent ringing words in support of the manufacturing sector, still doesn't get it. \"Osborne is wedded to the old orthodoxies where you have to leave it to the market. People forget that that bastion of free-market thinking, the US, has been incredibly interventionist. Osborne is outside the international mainstream thinking on this.\" So far, there is scant evidence that the government's desire to boost industry is bearing fruit. Exports have certainly risen over the past year, as Osborne and other ministers had hoped; but a sharp improvement in the overall trade deficit has remained elusive (see chart). And there is little likelihood that manufacturing will offer a solution to the deterioration in the labour market: today's manufacturers tend to be more hi-tech and less labour-intensive than in the past. So despite upbeat headlines, such as Jaguar Land Rover announcing last week that it would take on 1,000 new workers, employment in the sector has continued to decline. The international environment hasn't helped. In the autumn, as the eurozone debt crisis raged, confidence in many sectors plunged as firms feared that demand from key continental markets would be badly affected. Since the latest Greece bailout bought some time for Europe's politicians, the mood has improved, but Radley says he remains concerned that investment will not be as strong as the government hopes. The Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts rely on business investment growth of almost 8% in 2012 and 9% in 2013 to drive economic growth. Some analysts warn that this is the real problem any struggling small business will have to face over the next couple of years: even if they broadly agree with the chancellor's approach to tackling the deficit, they will be operating in a climate where the government is sucking demand out of the economy. \"If you start from the position that what they think they should be doing is cutting in a weak economy, this is immediately setting up a high barrier to any recovery at all,\" says James Meadway of the New Economics Foundation. Many firms have healthy balance sheets after taking a cautious approach to expansion since the crisis. But it would hardly be surprising if in the current climate, with demand at home being hammered by cuts, they chose to cling to that financial comfort blanket instead of making risky investment decisions. \"There are huge question marks about whether the positive sentiment that we have seen coming through in business surveys will translate into investment,\" Radley says. Against this background, he says, many of the policies that have made the headlines in the discussions in the run-up to next week's budget \u2013 on the 50p tax rate or a so-called \"mansion tax\" on \u00a32m homes, for example \u2013 have had little to do with how to help business through tough times. Instead, he would like to see cuts in national insurance for firms taking on younger workers, additional support for apprenticeships and training, and higher capital allowances for firms buying equipment. Osborne is expected to make a separate announcement in the runup to the budget this week about how his new national loan guarantee scheme, which will use government guarantees to underpin bank loans to small businesses, will work. Business groups say they will monitor its operation closely to see whether it is delivering genuine benefits to their members. And when the chancellor stands up on Wednesday, businesses will be listening carefully for signs that Osborne meant what he said when he called for a march of the makers. Radley says: \"It's very hard to get a message across to business, which is why you have to work incredibly hard at it.\"",
