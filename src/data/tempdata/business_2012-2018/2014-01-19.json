      "bodyText": "A bank that aims to challenge the big five high street institutions has raised almost \u00a3400m to fund its expansion plans. Metro Bank, which was founded by Vernon Hill, a US financier, said over the weekend it had raised capital by selling shares to institutional and private investors. The company said it sold the stock at a share price 30% higher than at its previous capital raising in June 2012, and that the deal brought the total amount raised by the bank so far to \u00a3641m. The capital raising is Metro's fourth since it launched in 2010 as Britain's first new high-street lender for more than a century. It promised to shake up the country's banking industry and now has 25 branches in and around London, with plans to have 200 by 2020. Last year it reported a \u00a3100m annual loss, which it said was expected during an early period of expansion. Each branch \u2013 or store, as the bank's founder and chairman, Vernon Hill, prefers to call them \u2013 costs a minimum of \u00a32m to build and launch. Hill made a fortune from growing and selling Commerce Bancorp in the US for more than $8bn (\u00a35bn). The government is keen to encourage competition in a banking industry dominated by five players, two of which were bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis. Metro plans to use the new funds to expand its retail, commercial and private banking operations. It said that, following the capital raising, it was one of the most secure banks in the country, with a leverage ratio of 25% and a tier one capital ratio of 63%.",

      "bodyText": "Silicon Valley has launched a last-ditch attempt to derail plans devised by the G20 group of countries to close down international loopholes that are exploited by the likes of Google, Amazon and Apple to pay less tax in the UK and elsewhere. The Digital Economy Group, a lobbying group dominated by the leading US digital firms, has written to the OECD, the Paris-based thinktank tasked by G20 leaders with drawing up reforms, saying it is not true that communications advances have allowed multinational groups to game national tax systems. Suggesting that any leakage of tax revenues flowing from the complex corporate structures of digital groups is merely coincidental, the Digital Economy Group says: \"Enterprises that employ digital communications models do not organise their business operations differently as a legal or tax matter.\" Their denial of tax engineering follows a string of tax scandals in Europe and the US in the past two years. In the UK, Google bore the brunt of criticism from Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, after it emerged that Google \u2013 which the Guardian understands is a member of the DEG \u2013 had been allowed to pay \u00a33.4m in tax to HMRC in 2012 despite UK revenues of \u00a33.2bn. Above all the DEG letter insists international tax rules should not be altered specifically to target digital companies, a move it says would be penalising their operational innovation. \"We believe that [digital] enterprises operating long-standing business models, subject to established international tax rules, should not become subject to altered rules on the basis that they have adopted more efficient means of operation.\" Sol Picciotto, a Lancaster University law professor, said the DEG's stance was hard to sustain. \"I don't think you could fairly say that they don't organise their business differently [to secure tax advantages] ... I don't think it's true ... It's rubbish.\" The DEG paper and other submissions to the OECD have been published in advance of a progress update from the thinktank on Thursday. The update comes amid concern the political will for tackling tax avoidance by online and hi-tech groups is fading. Reform had been a hot topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos this time last year but, as business and political leaders reconvene this week, it is not expected to feature prominently. Twelve months ago, David Cameron was among the most outspoken critics of multinational tax avoidance. \"Some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these are ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility and for governments to act accordingly,\" he told an audience at Davos last January. \"This is an issue whose time has come ... [Multinational companies should] wake up and smell the coffee.\" He is not expected to return to the topic this week. One source close to No 10 said Cameron believed Britain's presidency of the G8 last year had scored successes elsewhere on tax policy \u2013 specifically in the battle against individuals using offshore havens for evasion \u2013 so there was no need to return to the subject of corporate tax, which is handled by the G20. The DEG's hostility to the G20 reform agenda is in contrast to the more conciliatory tone previously adopted by Google. Last year executive chairman Eric Schmidt insisted he \"understands why Google is at the centre of [the] debate\" following criticisms of the search group's controversial tax structuring in the UK. Writing in the Observer he conceded \"international tax law could almost certainly benefit from reform\". He said he hoped that politicians \"seize the initiative and make meaningful tax reform\".The DEG submission was signed by three top US tax lawyers at Baker &amp; McKenzie acting on DEG's behalf, one of whom had been poached in 2011 from the OECD, where she had been played a senior role in tax policies affecting global online and hi-tech groups. The letter describes the DEG as \"an informal coalition of leading US and non-US software, information/content, social networking, and e-commerce companies\". Baker &amp; McKenzie did not respond to a request for further information on DEG membership. When asked if they were members of the lobby group, Amazon and Apple were either unavailable or declined to comment. One source with knowledge of the DEG said: \"It is largely if not exclusively made up of tech companies, mainly from Silicon Valley ... Most of the big guys are there.\" The G20 tax reform project was announced last summer, billed as the \"once in a century\" opportunity to overhaul the global tax system. While the work has the backing of all G20 nations, it has been most enthusiastically championed by France, with strong backing from Britain and Germany. America's support has been conspicuously lukewarm. France has been pushing hard for tax reforms specifically targeted at digital groups. It has argued that new technologies have opened up a host of possible corporate structures previously unimaginable. In the UK many leading retail groups have called for reform, highlighting what they see as unfair tax advantages afforded to multinationals such as Amazon by outdated tax treaties. Some of Britain's largest high street chains \u2014 including Sainsbury's, John Lewis, Dixons and Mothercare \u2014 have all called for a crackdown on Amazon's tax arrangements.",

Wilson also said the government should scrap the Help to Buy mortgage deposit scheme in London to prevent house prices from spiralling out of control. In a Sunday Telegraph interview, he said the scheme risked stoking a price bubble that would put homes out of the reach of all but the most affluent. He argued house prices had reached absurd levels and said the scheme, which supports mortgages for houses up to \u00a3600,000, was pushing up demand at a time when the supply of affordable housing was the problem. Last year, house prices increased on average by 8.4%, or 15% in London. Inflation is running at 2% and income growth remains at less than 1%, further stretching the ability of buyers to afford a home. \"Help to Buy turbo-charges an already rising market inside London \u2013 stopping it would be economically sensible and help prevent the north-south divide getting even wider,\" Wilson said. L&amp;G said housebuilding was the key to keeping prices in check and it was keen to invest directly in infrastructure. In December, it invested \u00a3169m in infrastructure assets including a chain of care homes and a planned new hospital. It has also taken a stake in British housebuilder Cala Homes.",

      "bodyText": "Those on the outside might imagine that the business leaders who gather in Davos each year to chew the fat are concerned only about enriching themselves. Critics might imagine that the company bosses, jetting to the World Economic Forum 5,000 feet up in the Swiss Alps in their helicopters, mink-clad trophy wives in tow, are oblivious to the struggles of the poor. But they would be wrong. As the rich and powerful make their last-minute preparations for their week up the magic mountain, they want the message to be sent out that they understand about inequality. They feel the pain. Truly they do. The evidence for the \"Davos gets it\" line comes from the annual risk report compiled by the WEF. It asks 700 of its members what they think will be the most pressing threats to the global economy over the coming decade. Inequality is seen as the most likely risk. Klaus Schwab, who created the Davos meeting in the 1970s, is pleased about that finding. As a good old-fashioned social democrat, he wants his members to take a history lesson and realise that capitalism cannot survive if income and wealth become concentrated in too few hands. For much of the 20th century, the more far-sighted business leaders realised this. They understood that their workers needed reasonable wages so that they could buy the goods and services they were making. They grasped the idea that a market system in its rawest form was incompatible with democracy and so acquiesced while some of the rough edges were knocked off via progressive taxation, welfare states and curbs on capital. Deep down, they feared that the Russian revolution would provide a template for disaffected workers in the west. Attitudes have changed in the past 30 years. The so-called Great Compression of incomes seen from the 1930s to the 1970s went into reverse, with the top 1% grabbing the fruits of growth. The rich used their money and their influence to ensure that governments did their bidding. After the Berlin Wall came down, there was no rival model and less need to show restraint. With the arrival of a unipolar world came a return to a more aggressive form of market economics that had not been seen since the early days of industrialisation. Schwab said last week that uninclusive growth is unsustainable, and he is right. A paper released today by Oxfam makes the same point, noting that the richest 85 people in the world have the same amount of wealth \u2013 $1.7tn \u2013 as the bottom half of the Earth's population. That's quite a staggering figure. You could get these 85 people on a London double-decker bus (not that they would ever be seen on a bus) and they would be as wealthy as 3.5 billion people. The counter-argument is that there is much less poverty than there was 15 or 20 years ago, and this \u2013 in large part due to three decades of explosive growth in China \u2013 is true. Those who argue that a rising tide lifts all boats wonder what all the fuss is about. The fuss is about three of the topics that will feature on the Davos agenda this year: the durability of economic recovery, climate change, and the gap between rich and poor. In the run-up to the crisis of 2007-09, rising inequality was compatible with expansion only because of ever-higher levels of personal debt. Since the crisis, the show has been kept on the road thanks to unprecedented stimulus from central banks. In the short term, the concern is what will happen in the more fragile emerging market economies as the US Federal Reserve tapers away its asset-purchase programme. The dollar-printing process led to hot money flooding out of the US and into higher-yielding emerging market currencies; the winding down of the programme may see it flooding out again. A longer-term concern is that the sustained squeeze on real wages \u2013 an intensification of the trend of the past quarter-century \u2013 will mean that people borrow more to fund their consumption habits just as the phasing out of the stimulus makes borrowing more expensive. The second big question, which has lain dormant since the crisis, is whether the current global growth model is consistent with preventing the planet from frying. Recessions always push environmental issues down the agenda, and this has been a particularly deep and painful recession. The lack of global co-ordination and the (misguided) belief that fracking is the answer to the world's energy needs have not helped matters. Finally, there's inclusivity. The recession has been particularly brutal on the young, many of whom are either unemployed or doing jobs for which they are overqualified. In many emerging market countries, populations are weighted towards the under-25s, the group most likely to migrate or cause social unrest at home. Modern media makes the skewed distribution of wealth, power and opportunity all too apparent. As the Oxfam report put it: \"When wealth captures government policymaking, the rules bend to favour the rich, often to the detriment of everyone else. The consequences include the erosion of democratic governance, the pulling apart of social cohesion, and the vanishing of equal opportunities for all. Unless bold political solutions are instituted to curb the influence of wealth on politics, governments will work for the interests of the rich.\" There will no doubt be plenty of support in public this week for Schwab's line on inequality. Eyebrows will be raised and hands will be wrung at some of the more striking findings of the Oxfam report, such as that in the US, the wealthiest 1% have captured 95% of post-financial crisis growth since 2009 while the bottom 90% have got poorer. But don't expect much support for any of Oxfam's suggested remedies for inequality: that corporations should stop using offshore boltholes to avoid tax; that business leaders should support progressive taxation, universal provision of health and education, and a living wage in all the companies they control. The CEOs in Davos may be worried about the impact of inequality but they are not that worried, and not nearly as worried as they should be. Schwab could make life more uncomfortable for his guests by naming and shaming the aggressive tax avoiders, declining to invite them to his annual talkfest. This, though, would leave many empty rooms in Davos. Instead, companies such as Google (UK 2012 turnover: \u00a33bn; UK profits: \u00a3900m; corporation tax: \u00a311.6m) can pretend they are good global citizens. Journalists have this year been invited to a \"fireside chat\" with Eric Schmidt, as if to show that the Google chairman is not a ruthless tycoon but the reincarnation of Franklin Roosevelt.

      "bodyText": "Reports that small-scale shops are leading growth on the high street have been met with scepticism by independent retail bodies. \"These figures raised all our eyebrows,\" said Michael Weedon of the British Independent Retailers Association. \"The shops in our community are seeing flat sales at best.\" According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), small retailers recorded an 8.1% rise in sales in December compared with a 2.6% rise at large high-street businesses. Food sales at small shops were flat but there was strong growth among shops selling household and secondhand goods, jewellery and toys. At stores specialising in goods other than food or clothing, sales rose more than 12%. Weedon said the figures were particularly surprising because most non-food retailers were fighting against price deflation, with fewer shoppers out on the high street as cash-strapped Britons try to rein in their spending. \"What we've seen from our figures in three out of the last four quarters is that turnover has fallen because prices have been down.\" Doubts about the strength of sales in small shops came as figures showed the 600 retailers on Oxford, Regent and Bond streets in the West End of London, mostly large chains, enjoyed a 10% year-on-year jump in sales in December. The rest of Britain saw an average increase of 6.1%. Retailers reported that sales were driven by the demand for technology and fashion, with \"tech-accessories\" including earmuff headphones, touchscreen gloves and iPad covers proving to be popular gifts for Christmas 2013. Richard Dickinson, chief executive of New West End Company, which represents businesses in the central London area, said: \"The stormy weather conditions understandably kept many shoppers away, but those who came weren't window shoppers \u2013 they came and made big purchases. Boxing Day in particular was a major success for West End retail.\" Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, said: \"London is clearly outperforming the rest of the UK economy, with West End retailers benefiting from both the boom in wealthy international visitors and the revival in activity and confidence in the City.\" Supermarket groups are opening small local food shops because of an apparent trend towards consumers shopping little and often and close to home, rather than making big weekly or monthly shopping trips to an out-of-town store. The ONS figures suggest that independent food retailers are not benefiting from that trend. \"We do know there's a move towards local shopping and so I'm surprised food stores haven't done well,\" said James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores. But he suggested that trade had been better for local food shops in the days after Christmas than in early December: \"We're hearing from our members that they're having a very good time so far this year.\" However, the ONS is not alone in indicating that things are improving for small shopkeepers. The rate of shop vacancies on British high streets dropped below 14% in December for the first time in three years, according to the Local Data Company (LDC). Matthew Hopkinson, director at LDC, said the drop in shop vacancies was a \"significant step\" and indicated that life was improving for small-scale retailers, which occupy the majority of town centre sites. Lowman said: \"There's a move towards a more personalised service and retailers who have invested in their communities. \"Hyperlocal websites and social media are about people seeking something unique about where they live and support independent retailers of all kinds.\" But the ONS figures suggest that small retailers seeing the fastest growth by far are those based online \u2013 sales rose by more than a quarter year-on-year in December, according to ONS.",

      "bodyText": "Total, the first major oil company to join the race to find shale gas in Britain, has promised to bring high safety standards to the controversial industry and shrugs off any fears of damage to its reputation. But environmental campaigners say the French group should not be allowed to \"frack\" for shale until the result is known of an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into a gas blowout in the North Sea. The Paris-based group said it had carefully investigated the environmental evidence of the impact of shale exploration before taking its decision to buy into a license in the East Midlands where it hopes to become an operator. And Total brushed off criticism made by some green groups that it was hypocritical to search for shale in Britain when the French government has an effective ban in place. \"We respect the political decisions made in the countries in which we operate and the UK government has made the strategic choice to explore for shale gas,\" said a company spokesman. \"We believe Total is well positioned to offer its experience and expertise, both in terms of exploration and production but also in the application of best health and safety and environmental practice.

      "bodyText": "The chief secretary to the Treasury has poured cold water on plans being hatched inside Royal Bank of Scotland to pay bumper bonuses to senior staff. Danny Alexander said he was sceptical about whether any application to double maximum payouts at the mostly state-owned bank could be justified. The Liberal Democrat MP was responding to claims by Labour that the government was preparing to allow a bonus scheme that would enable the bank to bypass an EU cap on pay awards due to take effect next year. David Cameron plans to impose a \u00a32,000 cap on cash bonuses and has promised to veto any increase in the overall pay bill at the bank, but without limiting bonuses paid in shares. After a steep cut in the number of investment bankers at RBS, Labour said the pool of funds would be shared among fewer individuals, undermining Cameron's pledge and allowing for even bigger pay awards. Alexander told BBC1's Sunday Politics show that no approach had yet been made by RBS. \"I would obviously look at what they have to say, but I would be very sceptical as to whether a case could be made,\" he said, adding: \"It's a bank that, along with the whole financial system, has benefited from the taxpayer standing behind it and where the strategy is now, RBS has to focus much more on domestic, retail and business customers.\" RBS \u2013 81% of which is owned by the taxpayer \u2013 is deciding whether to implement adaptations of schemes drawn up by rivals such as Barclays and HSBC, which are planning to offer top staff payments in shares alongside salaries and bonuses. RBS said it was consulting about its pay arrangements but that no decisions had been made. All the big European banks and international banks with operations in Europe are closely monitoring each other's efforts to find ways to keep offering multimillion-pound payments to staff despite the EU cap on bonuses. Under the rule from Brussels \u2013 which came into force this month and applies to bonuses handed out in a year's time \u2013 bonuses for the most senior bankers must be limited to 100% of salary unless shareholders give explicit permission for double that. Labour forced the issue of pay at RBS and the bonus cap out into the open by calling on the government to use its stake in the bank to prevent any bonuses of more than 100% of salary being awarded. If RBS decided to proceed with a 200% maximum, the government could block this by refusing to back any resolution put to the annual meeting \u2013 usually held in May \u2013 asking for the authority to do so.

      "bodyText": "Participants at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos expect to discuss pressing social and economic issues. They may not expect to be handed wearable gadgets that tell their smartphones if they're walking far enough or getting enough restful sleep. But that's happening at this year's meeting. We want to convince the world's corporate, political and civil society leaders that good mental and physical health is one of the most pressing social and economic issues of the day. Our concept of healthcare has become too narrow. Too often we see the job of health systems as mending people when they get ill, instead of giving them the tools to stay healthy. We delegate the problem to ministries of health, rather than creatively engaging other public and private organisations to promote health. From regulating particulate emissions to encouraging cutting down on sugar and salt to addressing stress in the workplace, the possibilities are endless. It may seem obvious that a healthier population makes for a happier society and a more productive economy; nonetheless, the insight is often overlooked. We need to spend less energy worrying about funding institutional care for an ageing population, and more asking how to minimise those costs by helping everyone stay healthy longer. Children born today should hope not only to live a long life, but to still be healthy and happy in old age. If that's to happen, we need to elevate health to a high-level, cross-sectoral conversation that informs every decision a society makes. How to design our cities? How to transport ourselves? How to produce, label and market our food? How to generate energy without polluting our air? These decisions should be guided by a health perspective, just as much as decisions about how to fund our hospitals. What are the most effective formal and informal ways of educating our children to make healthy lifestyle choices? What incentive structures for adults make the healthy choices the easy ones? Those are the kind of questions we'll be exploring in the inaugural health summit and 25 other sessions at this year's Davos. The time is right to elevate the conversation on health. For the last few years, economic crisis management has understandably absorbed much of Davos delegates' attention. This year, there is a sense that the global economy is out of intensive care and embarking on rehabilitation. As we ask how metaphorically to improve the economy's health, literally improving the population's health must be part of the answer. Recent years have likewise seen breakthroughs in personalised medicine, which will increasingly enable the repersonalisation of healthcare. Often, falling ill feels like losing one's individuality \u2013 being reduced to a patient identification number and a definition in the medical textbooks. As genomic understanding becomes more nuanced and testing more accessible, we will get more personalised advice on how each of us can best maximise our health. Importantly, that goes for mental health as well as physical. We are understanding more and more about how the wiring of our brains can go amiss, and how it can be put right. But that knowledge is useless if not acted upon. In low- and middle-income countries, it is estimated that more than three-quarters of severe mental health problems go untreated. Even in higher-income countries, untold numbers of people suffer in silence from their mental health issues from fear of being stigmatised if they seek treatment. One in four of us will suffer from mental health issues at some point in our lives. Beyond the human costs \u2013 not only on those struggling with mental disorders, but on their families and friends \u2013 there is a significant economic burden. Mental ill-health has become the leading cause of absenteeism in many firms. Its cumulative cost is estimated at \u00a310 trillion over the next 20 years. We need to find ways to create a culture in which nobody fears moral judgment in mentioning that they're suffering from depression, any more than in describing how they broke an ankle. Rehumanising health is one of the great opportunities of our time. We need to take healthcare decisions out of institutions and empower individuals to optimise their own health. Personalising the issue of health for the world's economic leaders at Davos is a good way to start.

Its cumulative cost is estimated at \u00a310 trillion over the next 20 years.</p> <p>We need to find ways to create a culture in which nobody fears moral judgment in mentioning that they're suffering from depression, any more than in describing how they broke an ankle.</p> <p>Rehumanising health is one of the great opportunities of our time. We need to take healthcare decisions out of institutions and empower individuals to optimise their own health. Personalising the issue of health for the world's economic leaders at Davos is a good way to start.</p> <p><em>Robert Greenhill is managing director, chief business officer and a member of the managing board of World Economic Forum</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 2,500 of globalisation's movers and shakers gather for their annual four-day mountaintop conclave this week, aware that the world is still being shaken by the events of half a decade ago. When the World Economic Forum met in Davos in early 2009, it was against the backdrop of the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers a few months earlier, and a contraction in activity that raised fears of a second Great Depression. Since then, hopes of a quick return to business as usual have been dashed by sluggish recovery, an incomplete repair job on banks, rising inequality, growing political alienation and concerns about extreme weather events and internet meltdown. Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the WEF, has told the business executives, academics and government officials attending Davos this year that much remains to be done. \"Economic growth patterns, the geopolitical landscape, the social contract that binds people together, and our planet's ecosystem are all undergoing radical, simultaneous transformations, generating anxiety and, in many places, turmoil,\" he said. Much also remains to be done if the WEF is to make progress on the gender quotas it set four years ago. Then it told its 100 corporate partners \u2013 attracted to the Swiss resort by the opportunities to hammer out business deals behind the scenes \u2013 that they could bring a fifth representative only if it was a woman. Yet the percentage of women attending is just 16%. Saadia Zahidi, head of gender parity and human capital at the WEF, says efforts are being made to push gender up the agenda. This year's theme is \"Reshaping the world\" and Zahidi points to six sessions, including a key event with Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and the IMF's Christine Lagarde on on 25 January \u2013 though many delegates will have left by then. The issues most likely to crop up during the five days of formal and private sessions include: Technology In the year since the last Davos, the world has been convulsed by the online surveillance revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden. The concern at the WEF is that the distrust sown by this has led to a \"balkanisation\" of the web, with national authorities becoming less willing to co-operate, at a time when the world is vulnerable to a systemic failure. This year's meeting will note that while scientific and technological breakthroughs have the potential to change the world for the better, there is a need to build defences against the increasingly aggressive hackers and the threat of \"cybergeddon\". Inequality Each year, the World Economic Forum surveys 700 of its members to gauge risks to global prosperity over the next decade. This year, the biggest threat was seen as the growing gap between rich and poor. Given that some of the richest people on the planet will be at Davos, meetings are likely to be long on the need to address the problem and short on practical measures, particularly ones that might affect corporate profits or low marginal tax rates for the well-off. But Schwab says the issue cannot be ducked: \"The slowdown is taking place against the backdrop of rising economic inequality, owing to the declining share of national income going to labour, a worldwide phenomenon \u2013 resulting from globalisation and technological progress \u2013 that poses a serious challenge to policymakers. Systems that propagate inequality, or that seem unable to stem its rise, contain the seeds of their own destruction. But in an interdependent world, there is no obvious solution, as the high mobility of capital fuels global tax competition.\" The global economy Much attention will be paid to the fact that the deepest slump in postwar history has been followed by the weakest recovery. In the past, economies have tended to be booming five years after a recession, but growth has been weak despite low interest rates and money creation programmes. Attention this year will focus on four issues. Can the US \"taper\" away its QE stimulus without aborting its tepid recovery and triggering a fresh crisis in one of the \"fragile five\" emerging countries (India, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey and Brazil)? Can China switch to a more liberalised model without a hard landing? Will the eurozone be able to avoid Japanese-style deflation? And will 2014 be the year when Japan emerges from two decades of slow growth and falling prices? Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will give a keynote speech on 22 January, and insiders are expecting an optimistic tone following signs that his stimulus package is working. Geopolitics Davos likes to see itself as a mini UN, using the presence of so many leaders to seek progress in some of the world's trouble spots. This year, attention will focus on the Middle East, particularly Syria, and relations between Iran and Israel. Hassan Rouhani, Iran's president will be speaking to the WEF on 23 January. Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and its president, Shimon Peres, will also be in Davos, but will not share a platform with Rouhani. More generally, the WEF believes there is a crisis of global governance, with countries reluctant to co-operate on issues such as climate change and an erosion of trust in politicians caused by the banking crisis.",

At the start of the week, the Treasury select committee has invited along Lord Levene and Gary Hoffman, whom you'll recall were the double act that once ran NBNK, the cash shell set up to bid for a bank. This should be intriguing (even though they ended up shooting blanks) as they were in line to buy the branches that Lloyds had to sell off under the terms of its \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout, until some bright chap said they'd be better off flogging them to the Co-op. Well, possibly not. Anyway, Levene has since let it be known that the former governor of the Bank of England, Lord King, told him the government wanted the Co-op to buy the Lloyds branches all along, which should lead to some decent lines about political meddling. Labour can accuse the coalition of messing up a chance to increase banking competition (its latest theme) while the Tories and the Lib Dems can shoot back that they might not have been so keen on selling to the Co-op if Labour had shared its file on the heroic appetites of the bank's former chairman, Rev Paul Flowers. That would be mischievous nonsense, of course. Everyone knows Flowers wasn't running anything. A big round to buy at Marston's The directors at Marston's may require some Dutch courage on Tuesday, when the brewer and pub operator becomes one of the first companies to seek shareholder approval for its remuneration policy under new rules for binding votes on pay introduced by Vince Cable. In preparation for the big day, Marston's has overhauled its incentives. Chief executive Ralph Findlay will be entitled to a maximum of \u00a31,795,000 next year in salary, bonus and shares, although the remuneration committee expects the total to be nearer to \u00a31,065,000. Even the lower figure would be a considerable increase on 2013. The master brewer earned \u00a3636,000 after missing out on annual bonus and long-term incentive shares because the company's earnings had not grown compared with the year before and earnings per share were below target. Among the brands in Marston's cellars are Hobgoblin beers, whose seasonal brews are known for their unusual names. Shareholders could select from the beers on offer and give the pay policy a \"Full Brazilian\", but a thumbs-up is probably more likely than a \"Dirty Tackle\". WH Smith's floored payoff? Kate Swann, the chief executive who kept WH Smith in health while other booksellers fell like flies in the face of competition from Amazon, left the company last year with a \u00a313m payout. During her decade at the company she forged a reputation as a formidable cost-cutter, and when she resigned in June, a grateful board rewarded her with shares worth more than \u00a311m, even though the majority were not exercisable at the time of her departure. Swann's penny-watching did not go unnoticed by customers. Shoppers' smartphone snaps of the threadbare, ripped and stained floors in WH Smith shops have made the @WHS_Carpet Twitter account a viral hit. But will the remuneration committee's generosity to Swann be repaid with a carpeting from shareholders at the annual general meeting on 22 Janaury? Advisory group Pirc is urging a vote against the payoff. \"Although allowed by scheme rules, it is not clear how these awards will benefit shareholders, given she is no longer in a position to contribute to the performance which is being rewarded,\" Pirc points out. \"We note that a stated aim of pay policy is retention. It is unclear how permitting directors to keep awards on resignation aids retention.\" Maybe the money should have been spent on new lino instead.",

      "body": "<p>Toss away those bowler hats; caps are all the rage in the City these days. But the fashion-conscious banker has nothing to fear: these are not the cloth caps associated with the working classes but the limits being imposed on bonuses and \u2013 if Ed Miliband gets his way \u2013 on the market share of the big banks.</p> <p>The Labour leader did his part to ensure both caps got an airing last week. He started off with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/jan/15/david-cameron-ed-miliband-royal-bank-scotland-bonuses-video\" title=\"\">an attempt to embarrass George Osborne</a>, who could use the taxpayer's shareholding to prevent RBS handing out bonuses to its bankers any bigger than their salaries, and he ended the week with a pledge to ensure that big banks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/17/ed-miliband-banks-cost-of-living-labour\" title=\"\">would have their market share limited</a>.</p> <p>Having stirred up a hornet's nest, Miliband then got stung. Bank of England governor Mark Carney expressed his irritation at the bonus cap being proposed by the EU and his scepticism that limiting market shares of banks would encourage competition.</p> <p>Carney's view on the bonus cap is the right one. The attempt by Brussels to limit the size of bankers' grotesque pay cheques is indeed crude. Telling them their bonuses can only be 100% of their salaries \u2013 or even 200% if shareholders give their approval \u2013 is a red rag to a canny banker, who in 2012 would on average have received a bonus worth 370% of salary. Before the onset of the 2008 crisis, so the rumours go, it would have been 1,000%.</p> <p>Little wonder that small armies of remuneration experts are now being deployed to devise ways to get around the cap by any legal means necessary.</p> <p>But Miliband's decision to get the debate into the open was also right. To anyone outside the City, it looks as if while austerity kicked in for most of us after the 2008 crisis, in the Square Mile the party just kept going.</p> <p>The Labour leader was also right to reawaken the debate about competition. No matter how many times the figures are repeated, they are still startling. The big four banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and the bailed-out duo Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 have an 80% share of the current account market. Lloyds alone has a 30% share.</p> <p>Miliband has skated over the role of the last Labour government in allowing the market shares to reach these levels by overriding the concerns of the Office of Fair Trading and allowing Lloyds to rescue HBOS in the autumn of 2008. HBOS had been a real competitor. In a wave of frantic growth after the turn of the century \u2013 remember Howard the singing bank manager? \u2013 it helped stir up competition to such an extent that the market share of the big four fell from 74% in 2000 to 64% in 2008 \u2013 before rocketing back as the financial crisis kicked in.</p> <p>One of the penalties the EU imposed in exchange for allowing \u00a365bn of taxpayer money to be poured into RBS and Lloyds was divestment of branches \u2013 631 of them hived off under Lloyds's TSB brand and 314 of RBS's to be reinvented as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/28/williams-glyns-bank-resurrected\" title=\"\">Williams &amp; Glyn's</a>.

      "bodyText": "Toss away those bowler hats; caps are all the rage in the City these days. But the fashion-conscious banker has nothing to fear: these are not the cloth caps associated with the working classes but the limits being imposed on bonuses and \u2013 if Ed Miliband gets his way \u2013 on the market share of the big banks. The Labour leader did his part to ensure both caps got an airing last week. He started off with an attempt to embarrass George Osborne, who could use the taxpayer's shareholding to prevent RBS handing out bonuses to its bankers any bigger than their salaries, and he ended the week with a pledge to ensure that big banks would have their market share limited. Having stirred up a hornet's nest, Miliband then got stung. Bank of England governor Mark Carney expressed his irritation at the bonus cap being proposed by the EU and his scepticism that limiting market shares of banks would encourage competition. Carney's view on the bonus cap is the right one. The attempt by Brussels to limit the size of bankers' grotesque pay cheques is indeed crude. Telling them their bonuses can only be 100% of their salaries \u2013 or even 200% if shareholders give their approval \u2013 is a red rag to a canny banker, who in 2012 would on average have received a bonus worth 370% of salary. Before the onset of the 2008 crisis, so the rumours go, it would have been 1,000%. Little wonder that small armies of remuneration experts are now being deployed to devise ways to get around the cap by any legal means necessary. But Miliband's decision to get the debate into the open was also right. To anyone outside the City, it looks as if while austerity kicked in for most of us after the 2008 crisis, in the Square Mile the party just kept going. The Labour leader was also right to reawaken the debate about competition. No matter how many times the figures are repeated, they are still startling. The big four banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and the bailed-out duo Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 have an 80% share of the current account market. Lloyds alone has a 30% share. Miliband has skated over the role of the last Labour government in allowing the market shares to reach these levels by overriding the concerns of the Office of Fair Trading and allowing Lloyds to rescue HBOS in the autumn of 2008. HBOS had been a real competitor. In a wave of frantic growth after the turn of the century \u2013 remember Howard the singing bank manager? \u2013 it helped stir up competition to such an extent that the market share of the big four fell from 74% in 2000 to 64% in 2008 \u2013 before rocketing back as the financial crisis kicked in. One of the penalties the EU imposed in exchange for allowing \u00a365bn of taxpayer money to be poured into RBS and Lloyds was divestment of branches \u2013 631 of them hived off under Lloyds's TSB brand and 314 of RBS's to be reinvented as Williams &amp; Glyn's. That equates to market shares of around 5%. But Miliband, who has also sidestepped questions over the exact size of his proposed market share cap, is right to question whether either of these two new networks will create viable competitive forces. While there are plenty of obstacles to Miliband's idea that banks should be forced to sell off branches \u2013 just look at the problems Lloyds and RBS are having in getting rid of those branches whose divestment the EU has mandated \u2013 that is not to say that the issue should not be looked at again. As matters stand, the Office of Fair Trading was probably going to consider a formal referral to the Competition and Markets Authority in 2015 anyway. But Miliband has turned up the heat. Hats off to him. Shell's shocking week The shock profit warning by Shell last week came almost 10 years after another very dark day in the history of the Anglo-Dutch behemoth: the admission that it had been overstating its oil and gas reserves.

Certainly there is no suggestion of regulators being misled this time, but Ben van Beurden, who took over this month, appears to have found a bit of a mess under his desk, one which will see fourth-quarter profits collapse by 70%.
