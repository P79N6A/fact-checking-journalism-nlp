      "bodyText": "A little while ago I met with the prime minister and advised him that I would be challenging him for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and I asked him to arrange a meeting of the party room to enable a leadership ballot to be held. Of course, I\u2019ve also resigned as communications minister. Tony Abbott appointed Turnbull as his communications spokesperson in 2010, charging him to \u201cdemolish the government\u201d on the issue of the NBN. He was never able to do that in opposition but once in power as the actual communication minister he was able to transform the NBN by adopting a measure of high speed broadband which will see less than a quarter of those with a fibre to the node connection being able to access speeds of 100Mbps. Now this is not a decision that anyone could take lightly. I have consulted with many, many colleagues, many Australians, many of our supporters in every walk of life. This course of action has been urged on me by many people over a long period of time. It is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. It may not have been the fault of any one minister, but the treasurer, Joe Hockey, certainly wore a lot of the blame and was replaced by Scott Morrison. Importantly the run of 30 Newspolls losses in a row for Tony Abbott began in the run up to Hockey\u2019s first budget in 2014. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs. Economic confidence was a big issue for Turnbull. And on this score he certainly can claim to have achieved success. The latest NAB Monthly Business Survey found that business conditions index moved three points higher to +21 index points, which is a record high since the monthly survey commenced in March 1997. And certainly no one can accuse the Turnbull government of not being pro-business. That confidence could perhaps be said to have led to more jobs. At the time he removed Abbott, annual employment growth was running at 2.4% and rising. The growth would drop off severely throughout 2016, before picking up very strongly last year. Right now annual employment growth is 3.3%, but the average throughout Turnbull\u2019s time as prime minister is 2.1%. Is that growth due to business confidence? Well, nearly 70% of the new jobs since August 2015 have come from the construction, education and healthcare industries \u2013 which is rather sizeable given they only employ 31% of all workers. Healthcare and education hardly have anything to do with business confidence given they are dominated by the public sector, and the big growth in construction has been due to large infrastructure projects \u2013 and much of that is due to Hockey\u2019s asset recycling scheme whereby state governments sold public assets in order to get funding from the federal governments to build new infrastructure. Now, we are living as Australians in the most exciting time. The big economic changes that we\u2019re living through here and around the world offer enormous challenges and enormous opportunities. And we need a different style of leadership. Just what was so exciting about September 2015 is a bit unexplained. Certainly for Malcolm Turnbull, becoming prime minister meant it was very exciting for him. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities ... and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people\u2019s intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people. Of course one man\u2019s slogan is another man\u2019s advocacy. Already in this speech Turnbull was trying out his first slogan \u2013 that of it being the most exciting time to be an Australian. This evolved into the need to be \u201cinnovative and agile\u201d. By the 2016 election, slogans were back in vogue as we become very much used to hearing \u201cjobs and growth\u201d, and Turnbull took to labeling Bill Shorten, Billion Dollar Bill. At the end of 2016, Turnbull was arguing in a very Abbott-esque way that \u201cif you vote Labor at the next election and Labor wins, you will pay more for electricity\u201d. Indeed, energy policy and sloganeering has come very easily for the prime minister. In September and October 2017 he could scarce talk of energy policy without describing the ALP\u2019s policy being a combination of \u201cideology and idiocy\u201d. And he also has decided that the best way to respect the intelligence of the Australian people is to explain time and again that the \u201cwind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun doesn\u2019t shine all the time.\u201d He also referred to the ALP\u2019s proposal to wind back negative gearing as a \u201chousing tax\u201d and that it was \u201ca big sledgehammer they are taking to the property market\u201d that would \u201cdevalue every home, every property, in Australia\u201d. Ahh yes, so much respect for our intelligence. Now if we continue with Mr Abbott as prime minister, it is clear enough what will happen. He will cease to be prime minister and he\u2019ll be succeeded by Mr Shorten. You can\u2019t fact check a what-if, but there are very few outside of Tony Abbott\u2019s inner circle who disagree with this view \u2013 and certainly at the time a majority of the Liberal party did so. You only have to see the catastrophically reckless approach of Mr Shorten to the China-Australia free-trade agreement, surely one of the most important foundations of our prosperity, to know he is utterly unfit to be prime minister of this country and so he will be if we do not make a change. The China free trade agreement is an excellent example of how treating Australians with intelligence and not using slogans gets quickly brushed aside. The economic benefits of free trade agreements are almost always overblown, and the economic modelling for the China free trade agreement used out of date information, but no matter, any free trade agreement is seen as an ultimate good by Turnbull as much as was the case under Abbott. The one thing that is clear about our current situation is the trajectory. We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott\u2019s leadership. Now we get to it. Many leaders make statements that come back to bite them \u2013 Rudd\u2019s line about climate change being the \u201cgreat moral challenge\u201d, Gillard\u2019s about no carbon tax, Abbott\u2019s about no cuts to education, health, the ABC, SBS and no change to pensions. At least those were based around policy. Turnbull in a fit of misguided hubris decided to make polling the centrality of his reasoning for challenging Abbott. The 30 Newspolls that Abbott lost stretched from just prior to the 2014 budget \u2013 a time where Christopher Pyne was still able to suggest that voters would be \u201cglad\u201d about the first Hockey budget. They weren\u2019t, and from May 2014 to September 2015, Abbott lost 30 straight Newspolls \u2013 averaging a two party-preferred vote of 46.8%. By contrast with Abbott\u2019s 16 months of losing polls, Turnbull\u2019s losing streak has been going since the end of September 2016, is now in its 19th month, and has seen the Liberal party average a two-party preferred poll of 46.9% . If voters had made up their mind about Tony Abbott, it would seem they have given us an extra three months to confirm their views of Malcolm Turnbull. Of course Newspoll is but one poll, and the Essential Media poll was well ahead of the curve. The Liberal party has now lost 79 consecutive Essential Media polls \u2013 the streak beginning July 2016. Now what we also need to remember, and this is a critical thing, is that our party, the Liberal party, has the right values. We have a hugely talented team here in the parliament. That huge talent was needed, because within three months Turnbull would lose his first two ministers \u2013 Jamie Briggs and Mal Brough both resigned in December. Three months later Stuart Robert would resign over a breach of ministerial standards, and in January last year Sussan Ley resigned after questions about her travel expenses. Our values of free enterprise, of individual initiative, of freedom, this is what you need to be a successful, agile economy in 2015. The value of freedom now includes a proposal to jail journalists for possessing classified information, and where an ATO whistleblower has had his house raided by the AFP, and where offices of the AWU were also raided as part of an investigation conducted by the Registered Organisations Commission, the news of which was leaked by an adviser in employment minister, Michaelia Cash\u2019s, office. And as for free enterprise, so long as you are not an energy company choosing to make a business decision about an ageing coal-fired power station, it\u2019s all good. What we have not succeeded in doing is translating those values into the policies and the ideas that will excite the Australian people and encourage them to believe and understand that we have a vision for their future. We also need a new style of leadership in the way we deal with others whether it is our fellow members of parliament, whether it is the Australian people. We need to restore traditional cabinet government. There must be an end to policy on the run and captain\u2019s calls. On this score, Turnbull has certainly been less guilty of captain\u2019s calls as was Abbott. But he has been rather good at making statements which sound like government policy only to back away from them soon after \u2013 such as a proposal in early 2016 to allow income tax to be collected by the states, which was quickly knocked on the head by premiers. As for the cabinet government. Certainly ministers are given a greater free hand \u2013 but this is as much a reflection of Turnbull\u2019s lack of power than his system of governance. That Peter Dutton feels free to talk on any issue he desires without any risk of rebuttal by the prime minister \u2013 such as on the issue of South African farmers \u2013 is not really reflective of traditional cabinet. We need to be truly consultative with colleagues, members of parliament, senators and the wider public. We need an open government, an open government that recognises that there is an enormous sum of wisdom both within our colleagues in this building and, of course, further afield. Well, he did consult with all voters on the issue of marriage equality \u2013 the postal survey which produced largely the same result as all the polling on the issue had recorded, but with the added bonus of a few months of homophobic abuse. It is interesting to hear Turnbull argue that we need an open government. This from the man who has led a government that has fought handing over documents relating to the AWU raids, and the release of documents relating to boat turn backs, and which has seen the Northern Australian Infrastructure Fund refuse to release of documents relating to discussion of a $900m loan to Adani due to reasons such as \u201ccyber bulling\u201d. His government was apparently so in need of being open that his attorney general, George Brandis, did all he could to prevent the release of his diary. But above all we have to remember that we have a great example of good cabinet government. John Howard\u2019s government most of us served in, and yet few would say that the cabinet government of Mr Abbott bears any similarity to the style of Mr Howard. So that\u2019s what we need to go back to. Finally, let me say something about Canning. Now this is an important byelection and I recognise dealing with this issue in the week before the byelection is far from ideal. But regrettably, there are few occasions that are entirely ideal for tough calls and tough decisions like this. The alternative if we were to wait and this issue, these problems were to roll on and on and on, is we will get no clear air The fact is we are maybe 10 months, 11 months away from the next election. Every month lost is a month of lost opportunities. We have to make a change for our country\u2019s sake, for the government\u2019s sake, for the party\u2019s sake. From a practical point of view a change of leadership would improve our prospects in Canning, although I\u2019m very confident with the outstanding candidate we have that we will be successful. The Canning byelection was held on 19 September due to the death of the sitting member, Don Randall. In the run up to the election, the polling showed the very safe Liberal seat was likely to see a big swing against it polling around 52% \u2013 though the candidate Andrew Hastie was still expected to win. Turnbull took over the prime ministership four days before the byelection and Hastie won with 55.3% of the vote. We are probably more than 10 months away from an election now \u2013 unless events take a turn for Turnbull\u2019s worse. He would be in no hurry to go to an election he is likely to lose. Please, you\u2019ll understand that I now have to go and speak to my colleagues. I trust I\u2019ve explained the reasons why I am standing for the leadership of the Liberal party. Motivated by a commitment to serve the Australian people to ensure that our Liberal values continue to be translated into good government, sound policies, economic confidence, creating the jobs and the prosperity of the future. Remember this, the only way, the only way we can ensure that we remain a high wage, generous social welfare net, first world society is if we have outstanding economic leadership, if we have strong business confidence. That is what we in the Liberal party are bound to deliver and it\u2019s what I am committed to deliver if the party room gives me their support as leader of the party. \u201cHigh wage\u201d? Well, yes, we are in an international sense. But high wages would not be something the prime minister would be wishing to talk up at the moment. When he took over in 2015, private sector wages were growing at a very low annual rate of 2.1%, now they are growing at an even lower 1.9%. Also in that period, household income per capita has fallen in real terms from $12,110 to $11,943. And generous social welfare net? Clearly one not generous enough to prevent 7,000 asylum seekers possibly losing income support, or where unemployed who turn down a \u201csuitable job\u201d \u2013 which potentially could be well below their level of expertise \u2013 would lose four weeks\u2019 worth of payments. It is a policy which is the hallmark of all welfare polices under Turnbull \u2013 policy that demonises those on welfare and which solves no problem. In 2015-16 for example, just 589 of the 880,606 jobseekers were penalised for failing to accept a suitable job. It is much like the robo-debt measures that has seen Centrelink have to wipe or change one in six of the 165,000 debt noticed it issued in the first 14 months of the program. But yes, business confidence is high. Thank you very much.",

Three months later Stuart Robert would resign over a breach of ministerial standards, and in January last year Sussan Ley resigned after questions about her travel expenses. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Our values of free enterprise, of individual initiative, of freedom, this is what you need to be a successful, agile economy in 2015. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The value of freedom now includes a <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-23/journalists-at-risk-of-jail-under-foreign-interference-laws/9353606\">proposal to jail journalists for possessing classified information</a>, and where an ATO whistleblower has had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/04/afp-raid-home-of-tax-office-whistleblower-over-abc-investigation\">his house raided by the AFP</a>, and where offices of the AWU were also raided as part of an investigation conducted by the Registered Organisations Commission, the news of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/federal-police-begin-investigation-into-leak-to-media-about-awu-raids\">was leaked by an adviser</a> in employment minister, Michaelia Cash\u2019s, office. </p> \n<p> And as for free enterprise, so long as you are not an energy company choosing to make a business decision about an <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/liddell-power-station-government-pressures-agl-to-sell-to-alinta/9620650\">ageing coal-fired power station</a>, it\u2019s all good.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>What we have not succeeded in doing is translating those values into the policies and the ideas that will excite the Australian people and encourage them to believe and understand that we have a vision for their future.</p> \n <p> We also need a new style of leadership in the way we deal with others whether it is our fellow members of parliament, whether it is the Australian people. We need to restore traditional cabinet government. There must be an end to policy on the run and captain\u2019s calls.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>On this score, Turnbull has certainly been less guilty of captain\u2019s calls as was Abbott. But he has been rather good at making statements which sound like government policy only to back away from them soon after \u2013 such as a proposal in early 2016 to allow income tax to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/30/turnbull-confirms-state-income-tax-plan-and-says-it-will-fix-core-problem-of-federation\">collected by the states</a>, which was quickly knocked on the head by premiers. </p> \n<p> As for the cabinet government. Certainly ministers are given a greater free hand \u2013 but this is as much a reflection of Turnbull\u2019s lack of power than his system of governance. That Peter Dutton feels free to talk on any issue he desires without any risk of rebuttal by the prime minister \u2013 such as on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/16/turnbull-refuses-to-condemn-or-support-duttons-comments-on-south-african-farmers\">the issue of South African farmers</a> \u2013 is not really reflective of traditional cabinet.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>We need to be truly consultative with colleagues, members of parliament, senators and the wider public. We need an open government, an open government that recognises that there is an enormous sum of wisdom both within our colleagues in this building and, of course, further afield.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Well, he did consult with all voters on the issue of marriage equality \u2013 the postal survey which produced largely the same result as all the polling on the issue had recorded, but with the added bonus of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-11/ssm-same-sex-marriage-respectful-debate-ugly-side/8996500\">a few months</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/21/homophobic-anti-marriage-equality-material-surfaces-in-postal-survey-campaign\">homophobic abuse</a>. </p> \n<p> It is interesting to hear Turnbull argue that we need an open government. This from the man who has led a government that has fought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/20/michaelia-cash-loses-bid-to-avoid-handing-over-documents-relating-to-awu-raids\">handing over documents</a> relating to the AWU raids, and the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/03/details-of-australias-asylum-seeker-turnback-operations-released-in-foi-battle\">documents relating to boat turn backs</a>, and which has seen the Northern Australian Infrastructure Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/28/agency-ruling-on-federal-loan-to-adani-cites-cyberbullying-as-reason-for-secrecy\">refuse to release of documents relating</a> to discussion of a $900m loan to Adani due to reasons such as \u201ccyber bulling\u201d. </p> \n<p> His government was apparently so in need of being open that his attorney general, George Brandis, did all he could <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-06/george-brandis-and-mark-dreyfus-foi-dispute/7818938\">to prevent the release of his diary</a>. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>But above all we have to remember that we have a great example of good cabinet government. John Howard\u2019s government most of us served in, and yet few would say that the cabinet government of Mr Abbott bears any similarity to the style of Mr Howard. So that\u2019s what we need to go back to.</p> \n <p> Finally, let me say something about Canning. Now this is an important byelection and I recognise dealing with this issue in the week before the byelection is far from ideal. But regrettably, there are few occasions that are entirely ideal for tough calls and tough decisions like this. The alternative if we were to wait and this issue, these problems were to roll on and on and on, is we will get no clear air</p> \n <p> The fact is we are maybe 10 months, 11 months away from the next election. Every month lost is a month of lost opportunities. We have to make a change for our country\u2019s sake, for the government\u2019s sake, for the party\u2019s sake. From a practical point of view a change of leadership would improve our prospects in Canning, although I\u2019m very confident with the outstanding candidate we have that we will be successful.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The Canning byelection was held on 19 September due to the death of the sitting member, Don Randall. In the run up to the election, the polling showed the very safe Liberal seat was likely to see a big swing against it polling around 52% \u2013 though the candidate Andrew Hastie was still expected to win. Turnbull took over the prime ministership four days before the byelection and Hastie won with 55.3% of the vote.</p> \n<p>We are probably more than 10 months away from an election now \u2013 unless events take a turn for Turnbull\u2019s worse. He would be in no hurry to go to an election he is likely to lose.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Please, you\u2019ll understand that I now have to go and speak to my colleagues. I trust I\u2019ve explained the reasons why I am standing for the leadership of the Liberal party. Motivated by a commitment to serve the Australian people to ensure that our Liberal values continue to be translated into good government, sound policies, economic confidence, creating the jobs and the prosperity of the future.</p> \n <p> Remember this, the only way, the only way we can ensure that we remain a high wage, generous social welfare net, first world society is if we have outstanding economic leadership, if we have strong business confidence. That is what we in the Liberal party are bound to deliver and it\u2019s what I am committed to deliver if the party room gives me their support as leader of the party.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\u201cHigh wage\u201d? Well, yes, we are in an international sense. But high wages would not be something the prime minister would be wishing to talk up at the moment. When he took over in 2015, private sector wages were growing at a very low annual rate of 2.1%, now they are growing at an even lower 1.9%. </p> \n<p>Also in that period, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/08/australia-isnt-in-recession-but-we-might-as-well-be\">household income per capita</a> has fallen in real terms from $12,110 to $11,943.</p> \n<p> And generous social welfare net? Clearly one not generous enough to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/30/new-dose-of-cruelty-up-to-7000-asylum-seekers-to-lose-income-support\">prevent 7,000 asylum seekers</a> possibly losing income support, or where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/11/minister-says-jobseekers-who-turn-down-suitable-work-will-lose-four-weeks-pay\">unemployed who turn down</a> a \u201csuitable job\u201d \u2013 which potentially could be well below their level of expertise \u2013 would lose four weeks\u2019 worth of payments. It is a policy which is the hallmark of all welfare polices under Turnbull \u2013 policy that demonises those on welfare and which solves no problem. In 2015-16 for example, just 589 of the 880,606 jobseekers were penalised for failing to accept a suitable job.</p> \n<p> It is much like the robo-debt measures that has seen Centrelink have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/14/centrelink-forced-to-wipe-or-reduce-one-in-six-robo-debts\">wipe or change one in six of the 165,000 debt</a> noticed it issued in the first 14 months of the program. </p> \n<p> But yes, business confidence is high.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Thank you very much.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2017/02/annotation-enhancer\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of the Australian owners of Homebase is flying to the UK for a whistlestop tour of its stores this week as the future of the struggling DIY chain hangs in the balance. The Wesfarmers chairman, Michael Chaney, is being accompanied on store visits by Archie Norman, the retail turnaround expert who chairs Marks &amp; Spencer and advises the Australian group. In February, Wesfarmers said it was considering quitting the UK after losses spiralled at Homebase which has more than 200 stores and 12,000 staff. Customers had dwindled after the new owners stripped out home furnishings ranges and turned some stores into outposts of Bunnings, its successful DIY brand in Australia. Perth-based Wesfarmers bought Homebase for \u00a3340m two years ago but the botched takeover saw the unravelling retailer lose close to \u00a3100m in the last six months of 2017. The Australian firm had intended to spend \u00a3500m over several years to turn Homebase into a British version of Bunnings, which is famous for low prices and \u201csausage sizzles\u201d. The Wesfarmers chief executive, Rob Scott, told investors in February that \u201call options are open\u201d as it wrote off A$1bn (\u00a3547m) in the deal. \u201cThere\u2019s value in this network and we want to make sure that we reduce the trading losses and hopefully put the business on to a path to profitability,\u201d said Scott. Norman is said to have counselled Wesfarmers against buying Homebase, arguing it would not be a transformational deal for what is one of Australia\u2019s biggest companies. Homebase would be hard to integrate with the existing Bunnings chain, which has larger stores and a different product range, he argued. Wesfarmers is now said to be working with investment bankers at Lazard to review options for Homebase. Norman, who also chairs Lazard\u2019s London operation, declined to comment. Wesfarmers is saddled with Homebase\u2019s \u00a31bn rent bill over the length of its leases and has already said it could close up to 40 of the worst-performing stores. A handful of disposals have taken place so far. A new management team, led by former B&amp;Q executive Damian McGloughlin, has set about rejigging its product range to once again appeal to British shoppers. It has dropped the \u201clowest prices are just the beginning\u201d advertising strapline and introduced \u201cyour home improvement and garden centre\u201d. Given the tough choices faced by Wesfarmers, private equity firms, including Hilco, Endless and Lion Capital, are said to be circling the business. Another name being linked to a possible deal is the discount chain B&amp;M. It is unclear whether any bid would be for the whole of Homebase or, in B&amp;M\u2019s case, a parcel of stores. Homebase\u2019s troubles have added to the gloom engulfing the British high street following a spate of restructuring and refinancing deals. In recent weeks, fashion chain New Look has used a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to close 60 stores and renegotiate rents. Flooring retailer Carpetright is exploring a similar restructuring strategy that could lead to the closure of up to a quarter of its stores, while Mothercare is rumoured to be considering a CVA to speed up the closure of about a third of its 143 stores. The baby goods specialist is already locked in talks with lenders that are expected to conclude by the end of next month. It is also seeking additional financing to fund its improvement plans.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The retail entrepreneur who conquered the UK high street with the Danish brand Tiger is looking to repeat the success with the launch of a new children\u2019s clothing and toy chain. Philip Bier will open the first \u00cfD Kids store in London next month after finalising a franchise deal with the eponymous French company. With a turnover of \u20ac860m (\u00a3750m), the retail giant owns eight brands including kidswear label Oka\u00efdi and Oxybul, a range of educational toys, and has a global network of 1,200 shops. Bier, who opened the first Tiger store in Basingstoke in 2005, became a multi-millionaire after selling his stake in the successful chain last year. The ambitious Dane has now set up Bier Brothers with his brother Jacob, a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer, to bring new retail brands to our high streets. \u201cWe want to be the preferred partner for foreign retailers who want to enter the UK,\u201d said Bier. \u201cThe ambition is to have six brands in five years\u2019 time.\u201d Bier is pressing ahead with the new business despite a punishing retail climate that has seen the share price of struggling Mothercare plummet and Toys R Us collapse into administration. \u201cIf people say I\u2019m mad I have some sympathy for that statement,\u201d says Bier. \u201cBut if you take Toys R Us they stood still and relied on doing the same thing for 25 years with no material change in their model. They just expected customers to turn up with a basket and fill it. That doesn\u2019t happen anymore.\u201d The first \u00cfD Kids store, selling both Oka\u00efdi and Oxybul, is located in the Southside Shopping Centre in Wandsworth, an affluent south-west London suburb popular with young families. Oka\u00efdi clothing is more expensive than that sold by Zara, where jeans and T-shirts start at around \u00a320 and \u00a36, but cheaper than designer stores. \u201cThe demographic is right in Wandsworth and there is an incredible concentration of buggies,\u201d says Bier. \u201cThe French children\u2019s apparel market is incredibly competitive because they don\u2019t wear a school uniform. The intention is to make it a national chain of probably 50 shops.\u201d The backdrop to the launch of \u00cfD Kids is a challenging one as the toy market shrank by 3% to \u00a33.4bn in 2017. But despite the travails of Toys R Us, its rival The Entertainer recently reported a 37% increase in annual profits to \u00a311.5m for 2017. The outlook for the children\u2019s clothing market is more buoyant as it is forecast to grow by 8.1% between 2017 and 2022, according to retail analysts at GlobalData. Bier says one of the strengths of \u00cfD Kids is that like Tiger it primarily sells own-label products so is a destination for shoppers. \u201cIf you want an \u00cfD product you have to go to \u00cfD. That\u2019s one of the reasons Tiger worked so well. If you want Tiger products you have to go to Tiger.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 10 April 2018 because an earlier version referred to Philip Bier as a founder of Tiger. Philip Bier was a founding member of Tiger in the UK.",

With a turnover of \u20ac860m (\u00a3750m), the retail giant owns eight brands including kidswear label Oka\u00efdi and Oxybul, a range of educational toys, and has a global network of 1,200 shops.</p> <p>Bier, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/30/posh-pound-shop-tiger-uk-denmark\">opened the first Tiger store</a> in Basingstoke in 2005, became a multi-millionaire after <a href=\"tel:/www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/02/tiger-makes-millions-for-couple-who-brought-danish-store-to-uk\">selling his stake</a> in the successful chain last year. The ambitious Dane has now set up Bier Brothers with his brother Jacob, a top mergers and acquisitions lawyer, to bring new retail brands to our high streets. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to be the preferred partner for foreign retailers who want to enter the UK,\u201d said Bier. \u201cThe ambition is to have six brands in five years\u2019 time.\u201d</p> <p>Bier is pressing ahead with the new business despite a punishing retail climate that has seen the share price of struggling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mothercare\">Mothercare</a> plummet and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/02/toys-r-us-slashes-prices-closing-down-sale-store-closures-uk\">Toys R Us </a>collapse into administration.</p> <p>\u201cIf people say I\u2019m mad I have some sympathy for that statement,\u201d says Bier. \u201cBut if you take Toys R Us they stood still and relied on doing the same thing for 25 years with no material change in their model. They just expected customers to turn up with a basket and fill it. That doesn\u2019t happen anymore.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first \u00cfD Kids store, selling both <a href=\"http://www.okaidi.fr/\">Oka\u00efdi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oxybul.com/\">Oxybul</a>, is located in the Southside Shopping Centre in Wandsworth, an affluent south-west London suburb popular with young families. Oka\u00efdi clothing is more expensive than that sold by Zara, where jeans and T-shirts start at around \u00a320 and \u00a36, but cheaper than designer stores.</p> <p> \u201cThe demographic is right in Wandsworth and there is an incredible concentration of buggies,\u201d says Bier. \u201cThe French children\u2019s apparel market is incredibly competitive because they don\u2019t wear a school uniform. The intention is to make it a national chain of probably 50 shops.\u201d</p> <p>The backdrop to the launch of \u00cfD Kids is a challenging one as the toy market shrank by 3% to \u00a33.4bn in 2017. But despite the travails of Toys R Us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/22/the-entertainer-tough-year-ruin-toy-chains-christmas-gary-grant\">its rival The Entertainer</a> recently reported a 37% increase in annual profits to \u00a311.5m for 2017. The outlook for the children\u2019s clothing market is more buoyant as it is forecast to grow by 8.1% between 2017 and 2022, according to retail analysts at GlobalData. </p> <p>Bier says one of the strengths of \u00cfD Kids is that like Tiger it primarily sells own-label products so is a destination for shoppers. \u201cIf you want an \u00cfD product you have to go to \u00cfD. That\u2019s one of the reasons Tiger worked so well. If you want Tiger products you have to go to Tiger.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 10 April 2018 because an earlier version referred to Philip Bier as a founder of Tiger. Philip Bier was a founding member of Tiger in the UK.<br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The living rooms of newly built homes in Britain are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, according to research that charts how living space has shrunk to levels last seen 80 years ago. The research, by LABC Warranty, which provides warranties for new-build homes, found the average living room in a house built since 2010 was 17.1 square metres (184 sq ft), compared with 24.9 sq m (268 sq ft) in the 1970s, a 32% contraction. The study also found that modern-day master bedrooms were on average 13.4 sq m (144 sq ft) in size, compared with 14.7m (158 sq ft) in the 1970s. \u201cOverall, Britain built the biggest houses in the 1970s,\u201d said a spokesman for LABC but from the 1980s onwards \u201cBritain\u2019s houses started to regress\u201d. Despite the vogue for \u201cisland\u201d kitchens, the space given to food preparation peaked in the 1960s and is now 13% smaller in new-build homes, the report said. The research points to a reduction in the number of bedrooms, which peaked in the 1980s at an average of 3.6 compared with just under three bedrooms today - the first time the figure has fallen below three, according to LABC Warranty. Overall, today\u2019s homes are the same size as those built in the 1940s, the research found. The figures are based on an analysis of 10,000 floorplans of homes built since the 1930s and taken from property sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla. LABC Warranty started its analysis for 1930s homes because of the lack of data available for properties built before then: \u201cWhether they have been knocked down to make way for new housing developments or turned into student accommodation, there simply weren\u2019t 10,000 houses available for us to analyse,\u201d they said. The figures will add to the growing controversy over \u201crabbit hutch Britain\u201d, with the boom in office-to-residential conversions, particularly of urban 1960s tower blocks free from the usual space standard requirements, resulting in a spate of \u201cshoe-box homes\u201d. The Guardian found one property in the centre of Croydon measured just 14.9 sq m, even though government guidance states that the minimum floor area for any new home should be 37 sq m. \u201cWe were also passed drawings of plans for an eight-apartment development in Archway, north London \u2013 in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Islington North constituency \u2013 where two of the units measured just 13.5 sq m (145 sq ft). That\u2019s a room measuring just 12ft by 12ft. The plans were rejected by the council. In 2014, researchers from Cambridge University found that, at an average of 76 sq m, the UK\u2019s newly built homes were the smallest by floor area in Europe, some way behind the next worst, in Italy and Portugal, at 81.5 sq m and 82.2 sq m respectively. Danish homes were by far the most spacious, at 137 sq m, followed by Greece, at 126.4 sq m. Developers of modular homes, pre-fabricated cheaply in production-line factories, argue that micro-homes offer a solution to the urban housing crisis. One social housing provider in south-west London has pioneered factory-made units that are 26 sq m in size, which it says is suitable for single young people to rent while they save for a mortgage deposit. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 April 2018 to correct the figure in the main picture caption.",

      "bodyText": "At the time it was big, big news. Three days before the general election, official figures showed that Britain\u2019s trade had taken a marked turn for the worse. Government claims that the economy was healthy took a knock. That was June 1970, a time when the size of Britain\u2019s trade gap was front page stuff. Headlines screamed about the UK being back in the red. The TV news bulletins were full of it. Harold Wilson is supposed to have blamed it \u2013 along with England\u2019s defeat by West Germany in the World Cup \u2013 for his unexpected defeat at the hands of Ted Heath the following Thursday. All this for a trade deficit of just \u00a331m, distorted by the arrival in Britain of a couple of Boeing\u2019s new jumbo jets. Times have changed and it\u2019s a fair bet that when the latest set of trade figures are released on Wednesday they will not generate nearly so much interest, even though Britain\u2019s performance has grown steadily worse over the subsequent decades. In 1970 as a whole, the trade deficit averaged 0.2% of GDP \u2013 a performance that today would be greeted with jubilation rather than despair. Not since the early 1980s has the UK run a surplus on goods, and at the last count the annual deficit was running at \u00a3135bn. The deficit in manufactured products alone stood at \u00a395bn. For the first time in ages, however, there has been a stirring of interest in trade. Donald Trump is obviously one reason for that. The protectionist in the White House has spent the past week ratcheting up the pressure on China. The risk of a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies looms much larger than it did. Brexit has also moved trade up the political agenda. Forty-three per cent of the UK\u2019s exports in 2016 went to other EU countries, and business groups are keen to ensure that post-departure impediments to trade are kept to a minimum. Britain\u2019s trade performance with the rest of the EU has been woeful. According to data produced by the House of Commons library, it has run a trade deficit in goods and services combined in every year since 1999. What\u2019s more, the deficit is getting bigger over time, doubling from \u00a341bn to \u00a382bn between 2012 and 2016. The UK\u2019s trading performance with the rest of the world has been better. Exports and imports were broadly in balance from 1999 to 2011 but since 2012 there has been a fivefold increase in the surplus from \u00a38bn to \u00a339bn. The economist Christopher Smallwood has been looking at what has been happening to the UK\u2019s manufacturing trade deficit since 2005. He finds that almost all sectors are running a bigger deficit. The deficit with Germany has increased by 5% a year, with France by 7% a year and with the rest of the EU by 11% a year. Smallwood says the UK\u2019s trade performance has deteriorated because the single market and the customs union are designed to suit other countries, Germany in particular, but not Britain. \u201cIt is not surprising that our trade deficit with the EU continues to grow, because the single market and customs union does not represent a free trade area. It is a free trade area only in goods. Manufactured goods represent Germany\u2019s comparative advantage, whereas ours is in services. \u201cWe have entered into a lop-sided arrangement under which all impediments to trade have been removed from areas where our trading partners are strong but not from areas where we are strong. So obviously our overall trade deficit with them has gone on rising, and will continue to do so.\u201d This argument is supported by the data. Britain runs a surplus in services with the EU and while it has been growing it has not been doing so nearly fast enough to offset a growing deficit in goods, especially manufactured goods. What\u2019s more, the trend will continue unless EU barriers to trade in services are removed. Inevitably, life will be easier for exporters of EU manufactured goods to the UK than it will be for exporters of UK services to the EU. Trade deficits have consequences. The need to finance them means there will be upward pressure on interest rates. Productivity growth, which depends on a thriving manufacturing sector, will be lower than it would otherwise would be. Workers who lose their jobs in industry will be decanted into low-wage, low-skill sectors. Clearly, the UK\u2019s whopping trade deficit is the result of a range of factors. High interest rates, an over-valued currency, a culture of short-termism, poor management and unwillingness to invest in new machinery and skills have all played a part. It would fly in the face of the evidence to suggest that the trade deficit is simply a function of being a member of the single market and the customs union. Equally, it is hard to deny that other countries are doing rather better out of the current trading arrangements. Britain\u2019s trade deficit for goods and services combined with the EU is 4% of GDP and rising. More than two-thirds of the deficit in goods is with the EU. The surplus in services is around a sixth of the deficit in goods. Business groups say that leaving the single market and the customs\u2019 union will make matters even worse, but imagine the UK on the outside weighing up the pros and cons of joining a club where the trading rules amplified our weaknesses and nullified our strengths. Would we really be gagging to join?",

All this for a trade deficit of just \u00a331m, distorted by the arrival in Britain of a couple of Boeing\u2019s new jumbo jets.</p> \n<p>Times have changed and it\u2019s a fair bet that when the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/uktrade/january2018\">latest set of trade figures </a>are released on Wednesday they will not generate nearly so much interest, even though Britain\u2019s performance has grown steadily worse over the subsequent decades. In 1970 as a whole, the trade deficit averaged 0.2% of GDP \u2013 a performance that today would be greeted with jubilation rather than despair. Not since the early 1980s has the UK run a surplus on goods, and at the last count the annual deficit was running at \u00a3135bn. The deficit in manufactured products alone stood at \u00a395bn.</p> \n<p>For the first time in ages, however, there has been a stirring of interest in trade. Donald Trump is obviously one reason for that. The protectionist in the White House has spent the past week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/05/trump-china-trade-war-new-tariff-proposal-100-billion\">ratcheting up the pressure on China</a>. The risk of a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies looms much larger than it did. <br></p> \n<p>Brexit has also moved trade up the political agenda. Forty-three per cent of the UK\u2019s exports in 2016 went to other EU countries, and business groups are keen to ensure that post-departure impediments to trade are kept to a minimum.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s trade performance with the rest of the EU has been woeful. According to data produced by the <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7851\">House of Commons library</a>, it has run a trade deficit in goods and services combined in every year since 1999. What\u2019s more, the deficit is getting bigger over time, doubling from \u00a341bn to \u00a382bn between 2012 and 2016. <br></p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s trading performance with the rest of the world has been better. Exports and imports were broadly in balance from 1999 to 2011 but since 2012 there has been a fivefold increase in the surplus from \u00a38bn to \u00a339bn.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The economist Christopher Smallwood has been looking at what has been happening to the UK\u2019s manufacturing trade deficit since 2005. He finds that almost all sectors are running a bigger deficit. The deficit with Germany has increased by 5% a year, with France by 7% a year and with the rest of the EU by 11% a year. <br></p> \n<p>Smallwood says the UK\u2019s trade performance has deteriorated because the single market and the customs union are designed to suit other countries, Germany in particular, but not Britain.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not surprising that our trade deficit with the EU continues to grow, because the single market and customs union does not represent a free trade area. <a href=\"https://financialobserver.eu/poland/the-single-market-is-difficult-for-services/\">It is a free trade area only in goods</a>. Manufactured goods represent Germany\u2019s comparative advantage, whereas ours is in services. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe have entered into a lop-sided arrangement under which all impediments to trade have been removed from areas where our trading partners are strong but not from areas where we are strong. So obviously our overall trade deficit with them has gone on rising, and will continue to do so.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f7ad0a18-de29-4f4f-9968-cc131fa91abf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Productivity is an economic measure of the efficiency of a workforce. It typically measures the level of output per hour of work, or per worker.</p>\n    <p>A more productive workforce signals stronger growth and healthier public finances. Productivity gains are vital to economic prosperity because it signals that more is being achieved by workers in less time. Gains are typically achieved through advances in technology and increased skill levels within a workforce.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, productivity growth has stalled since the financial crisis, putting it behind international rivals. The UK ranks fifth out of G7 leading industrial nations, with Canada and Japan having weaker levels of productivity. Germany is the most productive nation per hour, while the US is top for output per worker.</p>\n    <p>Weak productivity is problematic because it signals weaker economic growth, therefore eroding the public finances. Without an improvement in productivity, economies miss out on increases in wages and living standards, putting further pressure on the welfare system and depressing tax receipts.</p>\n    <p>Some industries are more productive than others. In the UK, manufacturing firms are among the most efficient, whereas the services sector operate at below average productivity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This argument is supported by the data. Britain runs a surplus in services with the EU and while it has been growing it has not been doing so nearly fast enough to offset a growing deficit in goods, especially manufactured goods. What\u2019s more, the trend will continue unless EU barriers to trade in services are removed. Inevitably, life will be easier for exporters of EU manufactured goods to the UK than it will be for exporters of UK services to the EU.</p> \n<p>Trade deficits have consequences. The need to finance them means there will be upward pressure on interest rates. Productivity growth, which depends on a thriving manufacturing sector, will be lower than it would otherwise would be. Workers who lose their jobs in industry will be decanted into low-wage, low-skill sectors.<br></p> \n<p>Clearly, the UK\u2019s whopping trade deficit is the result of a range of factors. High interest rates, an over-valued currency, a culture of short-termism, poor management and unwillingness to invest in new machinery and skills have all played a part. It would fly in the face of the evidence to suggest that the trade deficit is simply a function of being a member of the single market and the customs union.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-08T13:07:29/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK trade gap graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2018-04-08T13:07:29/embed.html\">UK trade gap graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Equally, it is hard to deny that other countries are doing rather better out of the current trading arrangements. Britain\u2019s trade deficit for goods and services combined with the EU is 4% of GDP and rising. More than two-thirds of the deficit in goods is with the EU. The surplus in services is around a sixth of the deficit in goods.</p> \n<p>Business groups say that leaving the single market and the customs\u2019 union will make matters even worse, but imagine the UK on the outside weighing up the pros and cons of joining a club where the trading rules amplified our weaknesses and nullified our strengths. Would we really be gagging to join? <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "On 5 July 1945, the British people \u201cspoke\u201d. Churchill had been a great war leader, but memories of the unemployment and penury of the interwar years were strong. Labour was elected by a resounding majority. On 23 February 1950, the Attlee government went to the country, and, again, the people \u201cspoke\u201d. The government was re-elected. Although that immediate postwar Attlee government has been almost sanctified by modern historians, things were rough for it most of the time. The largely Conservative press attacked many of the social reforms that were subsequently accepted by the Tory party. The going got even rougher for the second Attlee government, with a fatal split between the leftwing \u201cBevanites\u201d and the mainstream of the Labour party. Within 20 months of the 1950 election, the beleaguered government found itself forced into calling another election. Yes, on 25 October 1951, the people \u201cspoke\u201d again. This time they \u2013 or, rather, a sufficient number of them \u2013 had changed their minds. To repeat: within 18 months, the \u201cwill of the people\u201d had altered. Now, the referendum on our membership of the European Union took place on 23 June 2016. It is more then 18 months since that terrible day \u2013 time for a sufficient number of people to have changed their minds, and time for the predominantly Remain younger voters to appreciate the loss of freedom that would ensue if Brexit went ahead \u2013 and to resolve that, given another chance, this time more of them would vote. Now, I did not get where I am today by making rash forecasts: but I was struck by the recent findings of one research organisation that there has been a modest movement in favour of Remain, and that analysis of demographic trends suggests this trend is likely to continue. No doubt this is one reason that the fanatical Brexiters seem prepared to see their \u201cred lines\u201d scratched out one by one in order to achieve their ultimate goal, which is Brexit at any cost. And as Harry Eyres and George Myerson point out in their entertaining Johnson\u2019s Brexit Dictionary \u2013 Or, An A to Z of What Brexit Really Means, for the Daily Mail and its slavish Brexiter followers the definition of \u201ctraitor\u201d is \u201cone who disagrees in any way with Brexit\u201d. Sadly, to listen to the BBC you could be forgiven for thinking either that Brexit had already happened, or that it is 100% certain that it will. To which I say, as an admirer of the Roman poet Horace, nil desperandum. It was obviously a mistake of the Remain campaign before the referendum to allow themselves to come across as threatening immediate gloom and doom \u2013 although they were right about the collapse of the pound, which has aggravated the squeeze on real incomes that was already apparent. But if Brexit is allowed to go ahead, the implications of leaving the single market \u2013 one of Theresa May\u2019s deranged commitments \u2013 will soon become apparent. Already there are reports of British companies planning to cut back workforces. And the Japanese, on whose investment in this country\u2019s car and electronic industries the Thatcher governments depended for their putative \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d, have been dropping heavy hints about their plans for relocation to mainland Europe if Brexit goes ahead. It is almost criminal that this government is preoccupied with obeying a snapshot \u201cwill of the people\u201d protest vote when so many of those people are being hit by the impact of its continuing austerity. Every day now, one hears of the way the \u201ccuts\u201d are associated with rising crime, social distress, and hospitals that cannot cope. Only the other day the former health secretary, Andrew Lansley, complained that the cuts \u2013 that is, his former cabinet colleague George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme \u2013 had delayed diagnosis of one of his own health problems. How long will it be before the government \u2013 and, for that matter, the Labour party \u2013 realise that our EU partners mean what they say about attempts to cherry-pick? As my friend Sam, whom I often meet at the open-air cafe in Kenwood, London, declared the other day: \u201cAll the negotiators are doing at the moment is trying to achieve what we already have.\u201d The plain truth is that membership allowed us to cherry-pick. Leaving the club does not. Margaret Thatcher achieved the single market we wanted and we were exempted from joining the eurozone. Contrary to one of the many myths spread by the Brexiters, we also have a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card when it comes to any move towards a closer political union. The best of both worlds. Wake up, Theresa May. Europe needs us and we need Europe.",

It is more then 18 months since that terrible day \u2013 time for a sufficient number of people to have changed their minds, and time for the predominantly Remain younger voters to appreciate the loss of freedom that would ensue if Brexit went ahead \u2013 and to resolve that, given another chance, this time more of them would vote.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How long will it be before the government \u2013 and the Labour party \u2013 realise that our EU partners mean what they say?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, I did not get where I am today by making rash forecasts: but I was struck by the recent findings of one research organisation that there has been a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43336351\" title=\"\">modest movement in favour of Remain</a>, and that analysis of demographic trends suggests this trend is likely to continue. No doubt this is one reason that the fanatical Brexiters seem prepared to see their \u201cred lines\u201d scratched out one by one in order to achieve their ultimate goal, which is Brexit at any&#xa0;cost.</p> <p>And as Harry Eyres and George Myerson point out in their entertaining <em>Johnson\u2019s Brexit Dictionary \u2013 Or, An A to Z of What Brexit Really Means</em>, for the <em>Daily Mail</em> and its slavish Brexiter followers the definition of \u201ctraitor\u201d is \u201cone who disagrees in any way with Brexit\u201d. Sadly, to listen to the BBC you could be forgiven for thinking either that Brexit had already happened, or that it is 100% certain that it will. To which I say, as an admirer of the Roman poet Horace, <em>nil desperandum</em>.</p> <p>It was obviously a mistake of the Remain campaign before the referendum to allow themselves to come across as threatening immediate gloom and doom \u2013 although they were right about the collapse of the pound, which has aggravated the squeeze on real incomes that was already apparent.</p> <p>But if Brexit is allowed to go ahead, the implications of leaving the single market \u2013 one of Theresa May\u2019s deranged commitments \u2013 will soon become apparent. Already there are reports of British companies planning to cut back workforces. And the Japanese, on whose investment in this country\u2019s car and electronic industries the Thatcher governments depended for their putative \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/25/toyota-seeks-clarity-over-brexit-fog\" title=\"\">dropping heavy hints</a> about their plans for relocation to mainland Europe if Brexit goes ahead.</p> <p>It is almost criminal that this government is preoccupied with obeying a snapshot \u201cwill of the people\u201d protest vote when so many of those people are being hit by the impact of its continuing austerity. Every day now, one hears of the way the \u201ccuts\u201d are associated with rising crime, social distress, and hospitals that cannot cope. Only the other day the former health secretary, Andrew Lansley, complained that the cuts \u2013 that is, his former cabinet colleague George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme \u2013 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/03/lord-lansley-calls-for-better-screening-after-revealing-cancer\" title=\"\">delayed diagnosis of one of his own health problems</a>.</p> <p>How long will it be before the government \u2013 and, for that matter, the Labour party \u2013 realise that our EU partners mean what they say about attempts to cherry-pick? As my friend Sam, whom I often meet at the open-air cafe in Kenwood, London, declared the other day: \u201cAll the negotiators are doing at the moment is trying to achieve what we already have.\u201d</p> <p>The plain truth is that membership allowed us to cherry-pick. Leaving the club does not. Margaret Thatcher achieved the single market we wanted and we were exempted from joining the eurozone. Contrary to one of the many myths spread by the Brexiters, we also have a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card when it comes to any move towards a closer political union. The best of both worlds.</p> <p>Wake up, Theresa May. Europe needs us and we need Europe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "During the cold war, the US and the Soviet Union had the potential to obliterate each other with their nuclear arsenals. Both sides knew a conflict was unwinnable, and that explained why the missiles remained in their silos. It was known as mutually assured destruction. The closest the world came to MAD was the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, which ended with the Kremlin backing down over its decision to base nuclear weapons 90 miles from the Florida coast. More than half a century later, memories of the cold war have come flooding back as the US and China lock horns over trade. Financial markets have gyrated as Washington and Beijing display their protectionist hardware. The rhetoric has become increasingly bellicose. Khrushchev and Kennedy were playing for much higher stakes, but the principle is the same: the missile-laden ships are getting ever closer to the shore. Serious trade trouble between the US and China has been in the offing ever since Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016. In that year, America ran a trade deficit of about $30bn a month with China, but Trump said it was only that big because Beijing was playing dirty. Unlike previous presidents who talked tougher than they acted, Trump has kept the promises he made about China while running for president. With strong backing from corporate America, he launched an investigation into China\u2019s alleged theft of US intellectual property. Last Tuesday, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer announced that, as a result of that probe, the US would release a list of some 1,300 products that could be targeted with a 25% tariff \u2013 worth a total of $50bn \u2013 unless China changes its ways. The following day, Beijing announced that it would fight fire with fire. China published a list of US imports, again worth $50bn, on which it would levy a 25% tariff. China\u2019s hit list was smaller but carefully targeted to hurt sensitive US sectors, such as soya bean farming and the aerospace industries. Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, tried to calm things down by insisting that the US and China would be able to sort out their problems without a trade war. The conciliatory atmosphere did not last, however, because late on Thursday Trump said he had asked Lighthizer to consider imposing tariffs on another $100bn of Chinese imports. Beijing responded by saying it would fight the US \u201cat any cost\u201d. For now, this is still a cold trade war. Neither side has yet imposed its threatened tariffs, and there is plenty of time for a negotiated settlement. What ought to happen is simple. China should recognise that there is some merit in Trump\u2019s argument. US firms have essentially been forced to cede intellectual property rights to gain access to the big and growing Chinese market. If Beijing announced an end to that practice, Trump could remove his threat of tariffs and both sides could then disarm. But the White House needs to create the conditions under which Beijing can do this. China is the world\u2019s second biggest economy and an emerging superpower. It demands to be treated as an equal rather than as a developing country that has no option but to do Washington\u2019s bidding. In a tit-for-tat tariff war, the Chinese would come off worse \u2013 because they export more to the US than they import. But Beijing has other weapons, including its massive holding of US Treasury bills. Any move to dump these government bonds would be mutually assured destruction with a vengeance. But that\u2019s the danger with cold wars: in the wrong hands, they can turn hot. Murdochs could still have influence On the face of it, the prospect of Disney buying Sky News to help Fox break the regulatory blockade against its Sky bid suggests Rupert Murdoch might finally win the day. Concerns that the Murdochs taking over Sky \u2013 which would see them control Sky News, the Times and the Sun \u2013 would give them too much influence over UK news media has proved the thorn in the side of the deal. The Murdochs ( and Sky) have pointed out that shutting Sky News would at a stroke resolve media plurality concerns, but have so far gone the route of offering a range of independence and financial guarantees instead to try to get clearance. Disney\u2019s $66bn offer for most of Fox includes it ultimately taking control of Sky News anyway, so guaranteeing it to regulators now seems an elegant solution. But Disney, which has said it will buy Sky News even if its deal to buy Fox were to collapse, has not made the offer out of a burning desire to get into the UK news business. Comcast, the owner of NBC Universal, is preparing to gatecrash the party with a \u00a322bn bid for Sky. This is well above the \u00a319bn that Fox\u2019s bid values Sky at. The City believes Sky is now worth much more \u2013 it is performing strongly and has just scored a significant goal in the latest Premier League TV rights auction\u2013 potentially more than \u00a316 a share. Disney knows it has a bargain and does not want to see Fox blocked from buying Sky, thwarting its deal and opening the door to a bidding war with Comcast. As Sky News\u2019s potential saviour, Disney appears to be a good one, with proven success as a broadcaster \u2013 it owns ESPN and the ABC network in the US \u2013 and a clean track record. But how long would it be committed to Sky News once it has got what it really wants \u2013 Fox? And does this really solve the issue of the Murdoch\u2019s influence? Following the Disney deal, Fox shareholders, which include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the enlarged company. The Murdoch family trust will become Disney\u2019s second-biggest single shareholder (mutual fund giant Vanguard is the biggest, but it is a \u201cpassive\u201d investor) and is likely to be actively involved. Bob Iger, the Disney chief executive, has refused to rule out a top job for Fox chief James Murdoch after the deal goes through. If Disney wins the day, the Murdochs could continue to wield significant influence over the very asset they sold to defuse plurality concerns. Should Facebook mark its own homework? It is amazing how an upcoming appearance in front of Washington legislators can encourage even the shyest of technology billionaires to start talking. Mark Zuckerberg, boss of Facebook, warmed up for his first trip to Capitol Hill next week by doing a round of media interviews in which, in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he confessed to making mistakes but promised to do better in future. US congressmen need to pin him down. First, on hard details. Second, on the nature of his company\u2019s business model. Why did it take so long for Facebook to reveal the scale of the data breach? The company knew that information had been harvested by a third party in late 2015. Why didn\u2019t it alert users at the time? And will it commit to doing so if its new tighter controls over apps and developers fail? Zuckerberg has made big claims about Facebook\u2019s new ability to protect the integrity of elections, specifically its powers to detect Russian bots. He said Facebook had not been \u201con top\u201d of the problem during the US presidential election in 2016. But thanks to the use of artificial intelligence tools, Zuckerberg said, he was \u201cmuch happier\u201d with its performance during last year\u2019s elections in France. Why, given past failures, should Facebook be trusted to mark its own homework? And what does Zuckerberg mean why he says some regulation might be appropriate? How does he think such a system could work? And why does Facebook accept political advertising at all? Isn\u2019t it always at risk of being out-smarted by state-sponsored disinformation and fake news attacks? Would Facebook accept its platform can only be properly cleaned up if the business model is radically revised? Why not allow users to opt-out of data-sharing? Or could users elect to see only the types of adverts they choose? Facebook would be massively less profitable, but wouldn\u2019t such an approach be truer to the spirit of \u201ccommunity\u201d that Zuckerberg always proclaims?",
