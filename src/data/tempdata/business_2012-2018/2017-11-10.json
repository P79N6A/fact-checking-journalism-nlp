      "bodyText": "One of the first A380s to take to the skies a decade ago will be taken out of service in a remote French airport next week, as the manufacturer Airbus hopes for a major order to allay doubts over its superjumbo\u2019s long-term future. An A380 launched by Singapore Airlines in 2007 will be parked at Tarbes airport in the Pyrenees by its owner, a German aircraft leasing company. According to Bloomberg, the firm will rent out the plane\u2019s engines while it searches for an operator to take over from Singapore Airlines, raising the possibility that an aircraft that costs $432m straight off the production line could be scrapped. However, a much-needed boost for the aircraft and Airbus could be imminent. The first major airline order in four years for an A380 is anticipated on Sunday after negotiations with the Emirates airline. Hopes are high at the Franco-German manufacturer that the start of the Dubai airshow will lead to the biggest purchase since the same airline ordered 50 A380s in 2013. The partly British-built plane was once the ultimate status symbol for airlines, and seen as the best model to fly to increasingly congested major global airports. But its prospects have begun to look increasingly bleak, with Emirates propping up sales by making 142 of all 317 A380 orders to date. Almost two years have elapsed since the Japanese airline ANA bought just three A380s. Predictions of the A380\u2019s demise have been made with increasing confidence since Airbus said in July that it would cut production again, from 12 to eight planes per year. Such an announcement will have stoked glee at rival manufacturer Boeing. Airbus executives say the reduced production rate means the plane, which typically carries more than 500 passengers, will continue to be made for the next 10 years. British manufacturers contribute significantly: the plane\u2019s enormous wings are made in Broughton, north Wales, while some A380s have Rolls-Royce engines \u2013 the single most expensive part of the plane at $46m each. Landing gear, tyres and some of the electronic systems are also made in the UK. An Airbus spokesman would not comment on rumours of a fresh Emirates deal for up to 30 planes, but said the company was in discussions with new airlines, as well as existing customers who \u201cwould benefit from topping up their fleet\u201d. The sales chief at Airbus, John Leahy, is due to retire at the end of 2017 after 23 years in the job, with many expecting a swansong deal. The president of Emirates, Tim Clark, said Leahy was anxious to sell the airline \u201ca squillion A380s\u201d before he left. But succession planning has gone awry, with Leahy\u2019s deputy no longer in the running to replace him. Few buyers have come to the market, and even fewer for secondhand superjumbos. Last year, Malaysia Airlines gave up on selling off six A380s and instead refitted them as 700-seaters to take Muslim passengers to the annual Hajj pilgrimage. So far in 2017, orders have only been cancelled, with Air France deciding to buy Airbus A350s. While passengers have enthused about the doubledecker A380 for its relative peace, space and comfort, its economics have been altered by changing route networks. Smaller alternatives such as the A350 and the Boeing 787 now have similar range and fuel efficiency per passenger. Chris Tarry, an aviation industry analyst, said of the A380: \u201cAs a customer it\u2019s a fantastic machine to fly on. But the key for any airline is having the right model and the right costs. In the time between having something on the drawing board and getting a new type into service, things change.\u201d Airbus\u2019s superjumbo was designed when the definitive jumbo jet, the Boeing 747, was in its prime. Partly, aviation has been reshaped by more passengers flying direct to secondary airports, rather than via hubs, which the A380 was expected to serve. Tarry said: \u201cThe theory before was that you need a very large aeroplane to get the lowest seat costs. But then you also need large traffic flows to get the number of passengers to fill the seats. What is clear is that we now see a new generation of aeroplanes which offer equally low seat-mile costs \u2013 how much it costs to fly one passenger one kilometre \u2013 with fewer people on board.\u201d Now, single-aisle planes such as Airbus\u2019s A321neo and Boeing\u2019s 737 Max will have a range of more than 4,000 miles, enough to compete on long-haul routes and less of a risk for investors. Yet Tarry did not think the A380 was finished yet, even if only the patronage of Emirates continued to underpin production. \u201cIf you are in the Gulf and ideally placed to aggregate demand on routes from north-west to south-east \u2013 and increasingly from north-east to south-west \u2013 the economics changes.\u201d Last Friday, Emirates\u2019 100th A380 was delivered, and the airline\u2019s chief executive, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, indicated he would be looking for more. Two days ago, for a Guinness world record, a team of Dubai police officers dragged one of Emirates\u2019 300-tonne A380s across the tarmac. Airbus will be praying for such continued levels of commitment in the Gulf.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC has revealed that it closed accounts linked to South Africa\u2019s Gupta family corruption investigation, admitting for the first time concerns about its potential ties to the snowballing scandal. The bank said it had also flagged up its worries to the financial crime expert who has overseen its money-laundering controls since it was fined a record $1.9bn in 2012 for processing cash for Mexican drug lords and terrorists. Regulators in the UK are already looking into whether HSBC and another bank, Standard Chartered, had ties to the Guptas after former cabinet minister Peter Hain passed a list of transactions to the chancellor warning of their \u201cpossible criminal complicity\u201d. HSBC admitted on Friday that it was forced to close bank accounts held by \u201cfront companies\u201d associated with the Guptas. The bank has previously declined to comment on its involvement, but revealed its concerns after details of transactions linked to the Guptas emerged. The bank said: \u201cHSBC has been reviewing its exposure to the Guptas for some time, and has closed a number of accounts for associated front companies wherever we have found them. \u201cAs we identify or are presented with new information, we will continue to investigate further and take appropriate action.\u201d HSBC is understood to have closed the accounts in 2014, the same year that Standard Chartered said it had shut down accounts linked to the Guptas. It also notified Michael Cherkasky, who monitors the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering controls as a condition of its 2012 settlement with the US Department of Justice and the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The bank issued a statement in response to evidence contained in the GuptaLeaks, a tranche of files released in South Africa and reported in the Wall Street Journal. The documents reportedly reveal that HSBC bank accounts in Dubai were used to channel millions of dollars via companies linked to contracts to sell Chinese rail locomotives to South Africa. The contracts are being examined as part of an ongoing corruption investigation into whether the wealthy Gupta family benefited from wielding influence over South Africa\u2019s president Jacob Zuma. Lord Hain, who first raised concerns about UK banks\u2019 links to the Guptas last month, said: \u201cThis demonstrates yet again that any global company doing any business with the Guptas or Zumas is guaranteed to be badly contaminated, just as Bell Pottinger was going bankrupt, and KPMG, McKinsey and SAP have also been.\u201d Banks like HSBC must not be conduits for alleged money-laundering, Hain said, adding that all the evidence points to not just HSBC but other banks having been such conduits. The Guptas, who have not responded to requests for comment about the allegations by the Guardian, have previously denied any wrongdoing. Fresh detail about transactions involving HSBC could lead to the bank facing investigation by US authorities, because they were made in dollars and cleared by the bank\u2019s New York office. The FBI is already examining whether businesses linked to the Guptas moved money through the American financial system, according to reports in the US. The bank has been battling to increase its resilience to financial crime since the 2012 fine, when it reached a settlement with the US authorities over allegations it had allowed money from the Sinaloa drug cartel to be laundered via its Mexican branches. As part of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) Cherkasky was installed in July 2013 to oversee HSBC\u2019s efforts to clean up its act. The bank has said it is on track to have its anti-money laundering and sanctions policy framework in place by the end of this year, although Cherkasky has uncovered issues along the way. \u201cHSBC is determined to prevent criminals from accessing the financial system,\u201d the bank said. \u201cThis is inherently challenging because those who seek to launder money are often extremely sophisticated, hiding behind legitimate companies, layers of front companies, connected parties and individuals that have controlling interests in the subject companies. In February HSBC revealed it was investigated by the FCA over potential breaches of money laundering rules that had been highlighted by Cherkasky. Cherkasky\u2019s final report is thought to be scheduled for next March, after which it will be up to the DoJ to decide whether the terms of the DPA have been met. On Friday Standard Chartered had its DPA \u2013 originally agreed around the same time as HSBC\u2019s \u2013 extended for a second time, until July 2018.",

      "bodyText": "And finally....European stock markets have closed for the week, in the red. The FTSE100 closed down 51 points, or 0.7%, at 7432. That\u2019s its lowest level since the start of October, despite this morning\u2019s better-than-expected trade figures. Packaging firm Bunzl shed 6%, after Morgan Stanley warned that it could be threatened by Amazon\u2019s business-to-business distribution project. Here\u2019s the damage: This means the FTSE 100 has had its worst week in two months, dragged down by retail stocks (amid signs that consumers are cutting back). David Madden of CMC Markets says: European equity markets are in the red today as traders feel uneasy about being long going into the weekend in light on the sharp correction yesterday. The rapid move lower yesterday got traders thinking about how much markets have come in recent months, and that prompted some profit taking. And on that note, it\u2019s time to wrap up. Hope you have a great weekend. GW Some late news before the weekend; US consumers have become a little gloomier. The University of Michigan\u2019s monthly gauge of morale fell to 97.8 in October, a big fall from September. Time for a quick recap. Uber drivers are celebrating after the company failed to overturn a ruling that they are actually workers, not self-employed contractors. Lawyers say it is a landmark ruling, that means Uber faces liabilities for national minimum wage, sick pay and holiday pay. However, the taxi app company could appeal again. Kevin Charles, consulting barrister at Crossland Employment Solicitors, argues that the UK\u2019s gig economy faces a major shake-up. \u201cThe decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u2018workers\u2019 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u2018gig economy\u2019. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u2019s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u2018gig economy\u2019 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u2018worker\u2019 where previously they had been treated as \u2018self-employed\u2019 and denied access to any employment rights. \u201cThe EAT\u2019s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u201d But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century: Sam Dumitriu, the ASI\u2019s Head of Projects, says: \u201cUber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers. \u201cIt may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u2018app\u2019 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.\u201d The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news from the UK, including... Britain\u2019s trade deficit narrowed in September, thanks to a rise in exports to the EU. Manufacturing output has jumped, as firms benefit from the weaker pound and global economic growth But construction output shrank sharply as firms refuse to commit to new offices and factories UK GDP expanded by 0.5% in the last three months, a little faster than before Here\u2019s Larry Elliott\u2019s take: Britain\u2019s economic growth rate rose to 0.5% in the last three months, according to a new report. NIESR, the think tank, estimates that the UK growth rate picked up last month. That pushed growth in the August-October period up to 0.5%, they believe, from 0.4% in July-September. That\u2019s up from 0.3% in the first and second quarters of 2017, suggesting the economy is recovering from its early slowdown. Amit Kara, Head of UK Macroeconomic Forecasting at NIESR, says: Although economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. NIESR also predict that the Bank of England will have raised interest rates to 2% by 2021 My colleague Rob Davies was at the Employment Appeal Tribunal this morning. Here\u2019s his take: The ride-hailing firm Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed. The landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u2019s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision. Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed. Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central London, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u201cpersonal flexibility they value\u201d. The Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights. Aslam said: \u201cI have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us. \u201cI am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u201d Farrar said: \u201cUber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u201d More here: Today\u2019s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers. Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u2019t simply declare that workers are \u201cself-employed\u201d, if the evidence doesn\u2019t back it up. He explains: Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u2019s findings \u2013 specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service. \u201cThis is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. \u201cThe test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u2013 it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u201d Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u2019s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u2019s business model. She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too. Brown explains: With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u2019 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give. \u2018Probably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed. If they are workers though, they may be exposed to a significant NIC liability. There may also be a substantial VAT liability.\u2019 Frank Field MP, who chairs the House of Commons work and pensions committee, says today\u2019s ruling is a \u2018huge success for workers\u2019. He adds: [Labour MP] Rachel Reeves and I will next week be proposing to our select committees a draft bill which would make these individual, but important, skirmishes a thing of the past as legislation would protect all workers in similar situations.\u2019 Oxford law professor Jeremias Prassl is tweeting the key points from today\u2019s ruling: UK law firm Bates Wells Braithwaite, which represented Uber\u2019s drivers, are understandably delighted to have won today\u2019s ruling. They argue that it is a critical moment in ending exploitation of workers in the gig economy. Paul Jennings, partner at Bates Wells Braithwaite, sums up the mood: \u201cWe are delighted with today\u2019s judgment which is ethically and legally the right outcome. The ruling will have significant implications for approximately 40,000 Uber drivers and, more broadly, individuals engaged across the so called \u2018gig economy\u2019. We anticipate that tens of thousands drivers will now seek to make substantial back-dated claims. \u201cOur clients have fought tirelessly to gain the rights that they clearly should have been afforded from the outset.\u201d Uber could continue its battle, by appealing to the court of appeal or even the supreme court. Nick Elwell-Sutton, partner at Clyde &amp; Co, warns that this will mean more uncertainty for UK companies and workers. \u201cThe final outcome of this case will provide employers with much needed clarity in this area. But uncertainty is likely to linger until the supreme court has and possibly beyond that, if the government commits to legislative changes.\u201d \u201cThe cloud of uncertainty looming over the gig economy has undoubtedly made new businesses in the UK cautious about building a business model around a self-employed ad-hoc workforce, which may be further stagnating growth and therefore damaging the UK economy.\u201d \u201cThis is particularly concerning as the Brexit clock keeps on ticking \u2013 the UK needs to ensure it is demonstrating that it is open for business and at the very least showing business that there is legal clarity around alternative employment practices.\u201d Jamie Jenkins, barrister at St John\u2019s Buildings, predicts that Uber will appeal again. Ruth Kennedy, barrister at 2 Temple Gardens, tweets: Crowley Woodford, employment partner at law firm Ashurst, believes Judge Eady\u2019s ruling has massive consequences for other companies, as well as Uber. \u201cThe implications of this appeal decision reach far beyond the price of a taxi journey home. Uber\u2019s business model for its workforce has again been found to be fatally flawed; the so-called \u201cself-employed\u201d drivers are in fact workers entitled to basic rights such as holiday and sick pay. This decision has re-opened a can of worms which will have a ripple effect on the financial viability of the gig economy in its current form and beyond that into mainstream industries.\u201d Unions are urging Uber to accept today\u2019s ruling and \u201cthrow in the towel\u201d, rather than continuing its fight. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: No company, however big or well connected, is above the law. \u201cUber must play by the rules and stop denying its drivers basic rights at work. \u201cThis ruling should put gig economy employers on notice. Unions will expose nasty schemes that try and cheat workers out of the minimum wage and holiday pay. \u201cSham self-employment exploits people and scams the taxman. The Uber drivers\u2019 union GMB deserve huge credit for their work on this case.\u201d You can read the full ruling in the Uber case, here. In it, her honour Judge Eady QC explains that the Employment Tribunal was correct to conclude that an Uber driver who had the Uber app switched on, was within London, and willing and able to accept assignments was working for Uber London Ltd (ULL) under a \u201cworker\u201d contract. As she puts it: If the reality is that Uber\u2019s market share in London is such that its drivers are, in practical terms, unable to hold themselves out as available to any other PHV operator, then, as a matter of fact, they are working at ULL\u2019s disposal as part of the pool of drivers it requires to be available within the territory at any one time. Today\u2019s ruling confirms that Uber\u2019s drivers in the UK are entitled to various workers\u2019 rights such as holiday pay and the national minimum wage. It\u2019s another victory for the two Uber drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who argued successfully that they and fellow drivers were effectively employees. The ruling has significant ramifications for the gig economy, and firms whose business model is based on flexible working patterns. Legal firm Leigh Day say it\u2019s a landmark ruling. Newsflash: Uber has lost its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are actually workers. An employment tribunal in London has backed the original ruling, last year, that Uber drivers are not self-employed. More to follow.... Britain\u2019s construction industry, though, had a bad September. Construction output slumped by 1.6% during the month, the biggest fall since March 2016. Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains, says Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is hurting the building sector: \u201cToday\u2019s figures indicate the shadow of Brexit still looms large over the industry \u2013 the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum causing imported building materials costs to rise, while company and UK investors caution is holding back investment in new projects, so many contractors\u2019 margins are shrinking. \u201cCommercial and industrial sectors that rely on ambitious multi-million pound construction projects are the hardest hit, and only new builds in the private house sector, propped up by the likes of Help to Buy loans, are offering any glimmer of hope at the moment. Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, points out that the construction sector is now in recession: Yael Selfin, chief economist at HSBC UK, reckons UK exporters should be doing better... Britain\u2019s economy may finally be benefitting from stronger global growth and the effect of the weaker pound, says James Smith of ING. He\u2019s encouraged by the jump in manufacturing growth in September, saying: One of the big \u2018good news\u2019 stories of 2017 is the global pick-up in growth. That, along with the weaker pound, has seen UK manufacturing sentiment rise noticeably. But for much of this year, you wouldn\u2019t know it by looking at the production numbers. But a sharp 0.7% month-on-month rise in production during September, following some better readings over the summer, suggests these positive drivers may finally be being reflected in higher output Capital Economics have stripped out oil and \u2018erratic\u2019 factors from today\u2019s UK trade figures to show how the underlying picture is improving. Despite September\u2019s decent figures, Britain\u2019s total trade deficit actually widened over the last quarter to \u00a39.5bn. More good news! Britain\u2019s factories were running full steam ahead in September. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% over the month, easily beating expectations of a 0.3% increase. A stronger-than-expected manufacturing performance benefited the broader measure of industrial production, which also beat forecasts with a 0.7% increase according to the ONS data. The figures mean that the production sectors - which include mining and utilities as well as manufacturing - made a stronger contribution to the economy in the third quarter than previously thought, growing by 1.1% between July and September. A rise in factory activity over the three months was largely driven by the production of cars and medical equipment, the ONS said. Here\u2019s the official explanation of how Britain grew its exports to the EU in the last quarter: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00a31.7 billion (3.8%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. As shown in Figure 2, this was due to decreases in exports of fuels (\u00a31.6 billion) and chemicals (\u00a31.0 billion), which offset increases in exports to non-EU countries of other commodities over the same period. Exports of goods to EU countries increased by \u00a30.9 billion (2.2%) between the three months to June 2017 and the three months to September 2017. The main contributor was increases in exports of transport equipment (predominately cars), which increased by \u00a30.7 billion. Breaking: Britain\u2019s trade deficit has narrowed by \u00a3700m, partly due to a rise in exports to European countries. The gap between what Britain imports and exports fell to \u00a32.75bn in September, a better result than expected. August\u2019s trade gap has been revised lower, too, to \u00a33.45bn. The Office for National Statistics says the improvement is \u201c primarily due to increased exports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold)\u201d. The trade in goods deficit is also better than expected, coming in at \u00a311.2bn. August\u2019s dire figure has been upgraded to \u00a312.3bn, not the \u00a314.25bn initially reported. The report also shows that the UK exported \u00a3900m more goods to European countries in the three months to September, but sold \u00a31.7bn LESS to non-EU countries. Imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries increased, by \u00a31.7bn and \u00a31.5bn respectively over the last quarter. The ONS says: The increase in imports of unspecified goods (including non-monetary gold) and fuels from non-EU countries represents the largest increase in import commodities, alongside increases of mechanical and electrical machinery, material manufactures and fuel imports from EU countries. German business leaders have weighed in on the tricky issue of Brexit, warning that time is running out to agree a comprehensive deal between the two sides. Reuters has the details: The European Union and Britain will not be able to reach a comprehensive deal on their future economic relations by the March 29, 2019, exit deadline, Germany\u2019s largest industry group BDI warned on Friday, adding that a hard Brexit was very likely. The two sides will need many years to complete a comprehensive deal on trade and investments, BDI managing director Joachim Lang told Reuters. The comments come ahead of showdown talks between prime minister Theresa May and business leaders from the UK and Europe, on Monday. UK and EU negotiators are due to wrap up the latest round of talks in Brussels later today. The latest rumour is that Northern Ireland could remain inside the European customs union and single market after Brexit. This would avoid \u201ca hard border on the island of Ireland\u201d, reports the Financial Times. It offers the intriguing prospect that City banks could move operations to Belfast rather than, say, Frankfurt to retain passporting rights in the EU.... It\u2019s a dank, grotty morning in the City of London, as traders await today\u2019s trade figures. The FTSE 100 is bobbing around the 7485 mark, up one meagre point. The French CAC and German DAX are equally subdued, as the markets slope towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is hoping that this morning\u2019s trade data will provide some intrigue. The FTSE has struggled in the last couple of days, with a volatile commodity sector and a flagging set of retail stocks dragging the UK index back below 7500. As for the pound, while its seen some progress in recovering last week\u2019s post-Bank of England losses, it\u2019s still nowhere near its pre-hike highs. Against the dollar sterling\u2019s the wrong side of $1.315, while against the euro the currency is straining to keep its ahead above \u20ac1.13. We\u2019ll see whether the latest manufacturing and industrial production figures can make anything better a bit later. The former is forecast to fall from 0.4% to 0.3% month-on-month, while the latter is expected to nudge higher, from 0.2% to 0.3%. There\u2019s also the goods trade balance reading, with analysts estimating the deficit to have shrunk from \u00a314.2bn in August to \u00a312.9bn in September. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s known as Britain\u2019s \u2018other\u2019 deficit problem -- the gap between what Britain buys from the rest of the world, and what it sells back. New trade figures due out today may show that the UK managed to narrow this gap, a little. Economists predict that the trade deficit dropped to around \u00a34.5bn in September, from August\u2019s disappointingly large \u00a35.6bn. That would be a welcome sign, but frankly the broad picture is that Britain is still struggling to rebalance its economy. There\u2019s also been no sign, yet, that the weak pound is boosting exports. In August, the trade in goods deficit expanded to an alarming \u00a314.2bn -- dwarfing Britain\u2019s surplus in service. This goods deficit is expected to drop to \u00a312.8bn in September - still a yawning gap in historical terms. In a flurry of data, the Office for National Statistics will also publish new UK industrial production figure. UK manufacturing output is expected to have grown by 0.3% in September, down from 0.4% in August. Then at lunchtime the National Institute of Economic and Social Research will estimate how fast the UK\u2019s economy grew between August and October. We know that the UK grew by 0.4% in July to September, so these figures will show if growth slowed last month. Also coming up today... World stock markets seem a little edgy today after yesterday\u2019s selloff. Some traders blame uncertainty over US tax \u2018reform\u2019 plans, amid complaints that the richest Americans will benefit the most. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, explains: President Donald Trump and corporate America may not be satisfied with the revised Senate Republican tax plan. The dollar and global equities received a hit on news that Republican senators are likely to delay the introduction of corporate tax cuts until 2019. The reaction in markets wasn\u2019t a surprise, given that investors have been pricing in a lot of good news and further pullback may continue for a couple of days or weeks, as many stocks look overbought at the moment. The Senate wants to maintain the seven tax brackets, rather than the four proposed by the house. They also want to tax foreign profits held by offshore U.S. companies at a different rate. However, the timing of the corporate tax cuts will likely determine how markets move for the remainder of 2017. Meanwhile in London, Uber will discover whether its appeal against a court ruling that its drivers are employees has been successful. And finally (as they say on the TV news), John Lewis are launching their Christmas advert, starring a large and cuddly creature named Moz who lives under the bed. A damning indictment of Britain\u2019s housing crisis, no doubt, but can he match the success of Monty the Penguin?....

However, the taxi app company could appeal again.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Charles</strong>, consulting barrister at <strong>Crossland Employment Solicitors, </strong>argues that the UK\u2019s gig economy faces a major shake-up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe decision signals what may be viewed as a curtailment of the use, or misuse, of thousands of \u2018workers\u2019 within the rapidly growing modern business phenomenon, known as the \u2018gig economy\u2019. Whilst each case will have to be decided on its own facts the EAT\u2019s decision will no doubt make it easier for many people working in the \u2018gig economy\u2019 to argue that you have to look at the reality of the situation and not just the contract and that they now fall within the definition of \u2018worker\u2019 where previously they had been treated as \u2018self-employed\u2019 and denied access to any employment rights.</p> <p>\u201cThe EAT\u2019s decision will no doubt be welcomed and celebrated by the 40,000 Uber drivers working in the UK and many others in a similar position. However, they may wish to leave the champagne on ice pending any appeal by Uber to the Court of Appeal which will undoubtedly follow.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But... free-market thinktank the Adam Smith Institute argues that the law needs to catch up with the 21st Century:</p> <p><strong>Sam Dumitriu, </strong>the <strong>ASI\u2019s</strong> Head of Projects, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cUber drivers choose to use the app because they want the freedom to pick when they work and which trips to take. Granting drivers worker status may force Uber to schedule shifts and cut pay at peak times, leading to less choice for drivers and longer wait-times for consumers.</p> <p>\u201cIt may also discourage rivals to Uber, like Lyft and Taxify, from coming to the UK hurting competition.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s ruling reveals the problem of relying on employment legislation written before the word \u2018app\u2019 even existed. Minicab drivers have been traditionally classified as self-employed, but drivers who are able to choose their own hours, trips and simultaneously use a rival app are now classified as workers. We should update the law to take into account the added flexibility that gig economy platforms like Uber bring.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The ruling came amid a flurry of economic news from the UK,

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">Uber</a> has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights rather than as self-employed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/28/uber-uk-tribunal-self-employed-status\">landmark Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) ruling</a> could have major ramifications for labour rights in Britain\u2019s growing gig economy. The US company said it would launch a further appeal against the EAT decision.</p> <p>Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, backed by the GMB union, won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing they should be classified as workers with rights such as minimum wage and holiday pay, rather than self-employed as Uber claimed.</p> <p>Uber challenged the ruling at the EAT in central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a>, saying it could deprive drivers of the \u201cpersonal flexibility they value\u201d.</p> <p>The Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which backed the drivers during the appeal, said the decision showed that firms were choosing to deprive workers of their rights.</p> <p>Aslam said: \u201cI have been campaigning against Uber since 2014 and, although I always knew I was on the right side, it has always been a struggle that has brought enormous pressure on us.</p> <p>\u201cI am glad that the judge today confirmed what I and thousands of drivers have known all along: that Uber is not only exploiting drivers, but also acting unlawfully.\u201d</p> <p>Farrar said: \u201cUber cannot go on flouting UK law with impunity and depriving people of their minimum-wage rights. We have done everything we can, now it is time for the mayor of London, Transport for London and the transport secretary to step up and use their leverage to defend worker rights rather than turn a blind eye to sweatshop conditions.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/10/uber-loses-appeal-employment-rights-workers\">Uber loses appeal in UK employment rights case</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:47:33.578Z\">at 1.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059be4c0cdb10716cc118e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:57:27.825Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Expert: Uber can't have its cake and eat it</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today\u2019s ruling is a hammer-blow to the argument that Uber was merely providing a service to drivers who used its app to find customers.</strong></p> <p>Tim Goodwin, associate at Winckworth Sherwood, says it also shows that companies can\u2019t simply declare that workers are \u201cself-employed\u201d, if the evidence doesn\u2019t back it up.<br></p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rather unsurprisingly, the appeal tribunal has agreed with the employment tribunal\u2019s findings \u2013 specifically that the drivers are not self-employed, and that Uber is not some sort of technological middle-man but essentially a transportation service.</p> <p> \u201cThis is a hugely significant decision for Uber, and also the gig economy more generally. Increasingly, we are seeing that courts and tribunals are reluctant to allow businesses to have their cake and eat it, by exercising enormous control over their workforce whilst also denying them basic rights like paid holiday, sick leave and protection from discrimination. </p> <p>\u201cThe test appears to remain the same. If a business wants to have significant control over its workforce, it has to be prepared to treat its workers fairly. If the business is prepared to allow the worker a significant degree of latitude in his or her dealings, then it will be more likely that it can get away with calling them a self-employed contractor. Either way, self-employed status cannot be imposed from the top down \u2013 it has to reflect the reality of the arrangement between the worker and the business.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T13:49:26.018Z\">at 1.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a059ce5c0cdb10716cc11a5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-10T12:37:02.225Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Carolyn Brown, employment partner and head of RSM Legal, believes today\u2019s ruling has a significant impact on Uber\u2019s business model.</strong></p> <p>She suggests that the company could now find itself facing claims for national insurance payments, and backdated VAT too.</p> <p>Brown explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With control being a critical factor in the assessment of the taxi drivers\u2019 working status but a key requirement for the service Uber provides, something may have to give.</p> <p>\u2018Probably a more pressing concern for Uber though is the possible consequences it may have on their exposure to tax and National Insurance Contribution liabilities. As it stands, Uber would not be obliged to pay employer NIC in respect of their drivers if they are self-employed.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has accused the owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotel chains of reneging on a commitment to pay the living wage to staff in the capital. Intercontinental Hotels pledged to pay the higher wage rate to secure the title of official hotels provider to the 2012 London Olympics. Khan said he was shocked at the breach of trust by the hotel group, which has refused to honour a commitment made in 2012 to pay the living wage within the next five years. The mayor warned the company it was unlikely he would endorse any future partnerships with the Greater London Authority without a change of policy. Officials from City Hall had hoped this week to hear from Intercontinental Hotels (IHG) that it was ready to make good on its pledge. However, the group\u2019s new chief executive, Keith Barr, said that since 2012, employment costs had increased dramatically, preventing it from paying the \u00a310.20 an hour rate to all staff. Khan said in a letter to Barr that he understood that businesses faced rising costs, including higher rents and business rates, but \u201cgiven the ongoing success and profitability of IHG, I believe your business has the ability and responsibility to keep the promise you made both to Londoners and to your own staff\u201d. An IHG spokesperson said: \u201cOver the past five years there have been several valuable changes to UK pay and benefits legislation, including the introduction of a national living wage, pension auto-enrolment, higher national insurance and the apprenticeship levy. \u201cWe won\u2019t be moving forward with gaining the voluntary London living wage accreditation, but remain focused on hospitality as a great career, as well as the associated pay and benefits, to ensure we remain an employer of choice.\u201d The row comes at the end of a week of events to publicise the living wage that kicked off on Monday with the announcement of rise in the voluntary minimum to \u00a310.20 in London and \u00a38.75 per hour in the rest of the country. The Living Wage Foundation, which grew out of a campaign started in 2001 by the community group Citizens UK, sets new rates each year to reflect the wage a worker needs to sustain a decent quality of life. More than 3,600 companies are signatories and pay their employees the higher rate. Khan said: \u201cTo truly tackle the scourge of in-work poverty in London I need businesses such as yours to take the responsible step, especially when you have already committed to do so.\u201d Citizens UK\u2019s executive director, Neil Jameson, said: \u201cBack in 2012 IHG, the owners of Holiday Inn promised they would pay a London living wage to hotel staff in the capital but, five years on, hardworking staff are still waiting for this pay rise. \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that IHG have let down workers and customers by not paying the London living wage after saying they would. We would urge IHG to meet with workers and urgently agree a timetable towards paying the London living wage and accreditation with the Living Wage Foundation.\u201d In April 2016, the government introduced a new \u00a37.50 national living wage to supplement the minimum wage, though just for workers aged 25 years and older. IHG added: \u201cWe have made good progress in increasing the pay and benefits of managed hotel colleagues over the past five years, including going beyond legislative requirements for national living wage by paying the 19% of our workforce under 25 years old the new rate. \u201cNearly 90% of colleagues are now paid more than the national living wage rate. Through our IHG academy programme we have also helped to train and upskill more than 500 local people.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of the London Stock Exchange\u2019s major shareholders has called an emergency meeting in a bid to block the surprise departure of its chief executive, Xavier Rolet, and oust its chairman instead. The Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI), which owns 5% of the LSE, requisitioned an emergency meeting calling for the removal of the LSE chairman, Donald Brydon, and an end to the search for a new chief executive. It is also calling for Rolet to remain in office until 2021 on the same terms of employment, assuming he wants to do so. In a letter to Brydon, the TCI founder, Sir Christopher Hohn, said Brydon had \u201cfailed to provide shareholders with any substantive basis for the removal of the chief executive\u201d. \u201cHiding behind confidentiality agreements denies shareholders the ability to review your actions and demonstrates the bad corporate governance over which you are presiding.\u201d Hohn will get the chance of a face-to-face showdown with directors after accepting an offer from the LSE to address a board meeting to be scheduled for next week. The exchange escalates an extraordinary row that began when the LSE announced in October that Rolet would depart by the end of the year, but cited only succession planning as a reason he was leaving at the age of 57. In previous correspondence between TCI and the LSE, the stock exchange has cited \u201csuccession planning\u201d and \u201ccorporate governance\u201d to explain Rolet\u2019s departure, adding that it was bound by a confidentiality agreement with its chief executive of nine years. Earlier this week, the LSE said Rolet would be \u201cproviding input into the process to identify his successor and is focussed on his role as chief executive until his successor is appointed\u201d. But Hohn said a \u201cmajority\u201d of shareholders want Rolet to stay and should be able to hear from him in person about whether he wants to do so. TCI\u2019s shareholding of more than 5% gives it the right to call an emergency general meeting, but the date will be determined by the LSE.",

    "webTitle": "London's love affair with Saudi Aramco smacks of Brexit desperation | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Saudi Aramco is worth somewhere between $1tn and $2tn, depending on whose estimate you prefer. In short, Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company is not short of a few dollars. Why on earth, then, would UK government think it necessary to offer Aramco a $2bn loan guarantee? The official answer is that this is just business as usual. The UK Export Finance agency exists to promote UK exports by making our firms\u2019 goods and services more competitive. The Saudis may not actually need a $2bn credit backstop but, hey, what\u2019s the harm in giving them a prod to buy British? Politics in Saudi Arabia may be in a state of upheaval but Aramco is not the defaulting type. Well, that\u2019s one explanation. Another is that this is another sop to the Saudis to encourage them to list their oil company in London rather than New York, assuming an international flotation is still in prospect after the arrest of various princes, former ministers and tycoons last weekend. The listing and loan guarantee are \u201ctotally separate,\u201d insists the Treasury. That is becoming a well-used line. The Financial Conduct Authority argued similarly when its sudden interest in relaxing the rules on investor protections for state-owned firms to make it easier for them to secure a \u201cpremium\u201d listing in London just happened to coincide with Aramco\u2019s interest. The UK\u2019s love-in with Aramco smacks of desperation, born of the political desire to score a high-profile post-Brexit \u201cwin\u201d for London. But some victories aren\u2019t worth the price, as big fund management houses have been telling the FCA endlessly. Bending the rules on \u201cpremium\u201d listings to accommodate Aramco risks long-term damage to the City\u2019s reputation as a place where investors enjoy strong rights. London shouldn\u2019t need to lower governance standards, and the timing of the Treasury\u2019s $2bn loan guarantee merely deepens the sense of grubby games being played. Burberry boss\u2019s first collection includes a profit warning If you think \u00a3950 for a nylon rucksack is a little on the steep side, Burberry, maker of said item, has news for you: it\u2019s going upmarket. The new chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, wants the company to establish itself \u201cfirmly\u201d in the luxury end of the fashion market, as opposed to paddling around in the shallows of \u201ccontemporary\u201d luxury. By way of illustration, he said rivals can charge 50% more for a standard Oxford polo shirt. Get Burberry\u2019s bargain versions \u2013 a snip at \u00a3150 \u2013 while you still can. On paper, one can understand why Gobbetti is so keen to \u201csharpen our brand positioning\u201d and \u201celevate leather goods.\u201d Truly upmarket brands such as Gucci and Hermes are making a mint. Luxury handbag companies produce 26% operating profit margins, he said, while poor old Burberry currently runs on 17%. Yet the shares fell 10%. It wasn\u2019t Burberry\u2019s shocking invention of new verbs (\u201cwe will wardrobe the customer\u201d \u2013 what?) that frightened investors but the cost of Gobbetti\u2019s overhaul. Capital expenditure will be cranked up. Sharpening the brand will also blunt revenues and profits in the short-term. Burberry, having just reported a 24% improvement in profits to \u00a3127m at the half-year stage, expects to go sideways for two years. Once the group has reached Gobbetti\u2019s promised land of \u201csustainable\u201d returns, revenues will start growing again and there will be a \u201cmeaningful\u201d improvement in profit margins. That\u2019s the theory, anyway, but, as with all such reinventions, the short-term financial pain is certain but the eventual rewards are not. Mulberry, albeit on a smaller scale, once tried to boost its handbags into the price stratosphere and the strategy flopped. Gobbetti brings a more experienced hand yet he still needs a chief designer to replace Christopher Bailey, who is leaving next year and wasn\u2019t even given a walk-on role in Thursday\u2019s City presentation. Bailey seems to be yesterday\u2019s man already, which feels harsh \u2013 he wasn\u2019t much cop as chief executive during his brief stint but he had previously hauled the brand out of the doldrums. For better or worse, it\u2019s the Gobbetti show now. His plan may come good eventually but let\u2019s not miss the obvious: his first collection included a profits warning. Why is Xavier Rolet leaving LSE? Soon we may know It\u2019s on: an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the London Stock Exchange Group to consider the motion that the chairman be unceremoniously dumped. The Children\u2019s Investment Fund (TCI), an activist investor with a 5% stake in the LSE, has lost patience. It wanted a straight explanation for why the LSE chief executive, Xavier Rolet, is leaving next year. It hasn\u2019t got one, thus it is calling on all shareholders to vote to remove the chairman, Donald Brydon, and keep Rolet, assuming he\u2019s willing to stay. This is a fine feud and Brydon has played his hand badly. In today\u2019s world, you simply can\u2019t announce that a well-regarded chief executive is going but not tell shareholders why. TCI claims Rolet was, in effect, sacked and has been prevented by confidentiality clauses from saying so. We don\u2019t have Brydon\u2019s version of events because neither he nor the LSE will speak. TCI\u2019s method of forcing an answer is aggressive but the tactic is justified. The LSE\u2019s failure to explain was glaring on day one. To maintain the deafening silence for three weeks is ridiculous. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "A weaker pound and a pick up in the global economy helped deliver the fifth straight monthly rise in UK factory output in September, providing a much-needed boost to Philip Hammond ahead of his budget later this month. After a bruising period for the government, the improved performance by manufacturing will provide the chancellor with tentative evidence that the economy is edging out of the period of slow growth which has persisted since the start of the year. One of Britain\u2019s leading economic thinktanks, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), said its latest estimates showed the economy growing by 0.5% in the three months ending in October, up from 0.4% in the quarter ending in September. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed that manufacturing production increased by 0.7% last month and by 1.1% in the third quarter of 2017. In a further boost to the chancellor, the ONS also reported signs of an improvement in Britain\u2019s trade performance, with the monthly deficit down by \u00a3700m in September. Over the third quarter as a whole, however, the trade deficit widened by \u00a33bn, indicating that the benefits of the fall in the value of sterling are taking longer to show up in exports than in manufacturing output. There was less good news for the chancellor from construction, which contracted for the second successive quarter and is now officially in recession. Kate Davies, a senior ONS statistician, said: \u201cManufacturing grew strongly with robust growth in cars and medical equipment. However, construction dropped for the second quarter running, driven by falls in commercial work and housing repairs. \u201cThe UK\u2019s trade balance with the rest of the world worsened, mainly due to large increases in imports of machinery, gold and fuel, partially offset by falling imports of aircraft.\u201d Manufacturing \u2013 which accounts for about 10% of the economy \u2013 has grown by 2.7% over the past year but remains below its level when the UK entered the deep recession of 2008-09. The depreciation of sterling since the EU referendum in June 2016, which has seen the pound fall by around 10% against the dollar, has made UK goods cheaper in world markets but foreign-made goods dearer in Britain. In September, the UK\u2019s deficit in goods and services stood at \u00a32.8bn, down from \u00a33.5bn in August. A deficit of \u00a311.3bn in goods was partly offset by a surplus of \u00a38.5bn in services. Over the three months to September, the deficit was \u00a39.5bn, up from \u00a36.6bn in the quarter ending in June. Amit Kara, Head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, said \u201cWe estimate that economic growth recovered to 0.5% in the three months to October from 0.4% in the third quarter. \u201cAlthough economic growth is likely to be stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when growth in other OECD countries has strengthened. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand.\u201d Chris Williamson, UK economist at analysis firm IHS Markit, said: \u201cOfficial data confirm the survey signals of a multi-speed economy. While manufacturing is enjoying strong growth, construction is in the doldrums, entering a new technical recession.\u201d Samuel Tombs, UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macro, said: \u201cThe performance of UK trade since sterling\u2019s huge depreciation remains abysmal.\u201d He added that the main problem involved exporters pushing up their prices, almost wiping out the benefits of a cheaper currency. \u201cIn foreign currency terms, the price of exports rose by 0.9% month-to-month in September, leaving them only 6% below their late 2015 peak. Meanwhile, the lack of domestically-produced alternatives for the goods that Britain imports means that it simply has had to accept higher import prices.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Some of the world\u2019s top creative minds have been employed. Millions have been spent. The film has been months in the making and shrouded in secrecy. But this is not the release of a Hollywood blockbuster \u2013 it is the launch of the John Lewis Christmas advertising campaign. Over the past decade the department store chain has turned its festive adverts into an annual media moment. It has produced a stream of heart-warming, tear-jerking ads, from a romance between two snowmen, to Monty the Penguin, the sad tale of a lonely man on the moon and last year\u2019s bouncing boxer dog. This year it has once again pulled out all the stops to come up with a memorable campaign featuring Moz, a huge, snoring under-the-bed monster with puppy dog eyes. Academy award-winning screenwriter Michel Gondry, the director behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, was called in to make the two-minute TV advert. Aside from working with middle England\u2019s favourite shop he is known for his video collaborations with artists including Radiohead, Bj\u00f6rk and Daft Punk. The soundtrack to the ad is a classic Beatles song, Golden Slumbers from the 1969 Abbey Road album, re-recorded by rock band Elbow. The cost of this extravaganza \u2013 all designed to boost sales and sprinkle a little glitter on the John Lewis brand \u2013 is reckoned to be about \u00a37m. It will premiere in the advertising breaks in Friday night\u2019s Gogglebox on Channel 4. Such was the pre-launch secrecy that journalists wanting to view the advert first had to sign a legal non-disclosure agreement. The feelgood factor generated by the John Lewis campaigns has prompted retail rivals to up their game \u2013 and steal from the JL playbook. Marks &amp; Spencer, which in 2016 gave us Mrs Claus, a James-Bond style character, has this year turned to Paddington, with TV adverts designed to cash in on the Paddington 2 movie. Sainsbury\u2019s, which in recent years has produced a touching commemoration of the famous first world war Christmas Day football match and an animated family saga accompanied by a song performed by James Corden, will unveil its 2017 campaign on Sunday night. Boots, House of Fraser and Waitrose will also launch their Christmas campaigns this weekend. They are part of a total advertising splurge of nearly \u00a36bn planned for the final quarter of 2017 \u2013 \u00a3140m more than last year, according to the Advertising Association, as stores and big brands attempt to persuade shoppers to forget their straining household budgets and enjoy a festive binge. \u201cThe festive season accounts for such a significant proportion of sales that there can be no holding back on ad spend,\u201d says Leo Rayman, chief executive of Grey London, the ad agency behind Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Paddington-led campaign. \u201cA bad Christmas can make or break a company\u2019s year.\u201d Retailers are facing a nail-biting run up to Christmas this year and a good advert could be the difference between a good and bad festive season. Inflation, an unseasonal warm start to autumn, consumer fears about the uncertainty of Brexit and a squeeze on disposable income have all hit sales in recent months. A recent survey by the CBI business lobby group showed high street sales falling at their fastest rate since the height of the recession in 2009. John Lewis is particularly hoping for a good end to 2017 after its profits halved at its parent group, which also owns Waitrose, in the first part of its financial year. In recent weeks the department store has revealed a string of poor sales numbers, with takings down around 4% on the same time last year. Homewares and technology \u2013 big ticket items \u2013 have been particularly badly hit. Fashion chain Next has also reported falling sales, along with New Look and Debenhams. Christmas advertising is also rapidly moving online. The amount spent on TV ads in the coming weeks is expected to fall slightly to \u00a31.3bn, as big brands switch spending into social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Spending on social media video ads is expected to increase 40% to \u00a3234m, according to advertising analysts WARC. Retailers now make special versions of their ads to be shared on Instagram and Facebook and some have piggy-backed on the frenzy that now accompanies the annual John Lewis ad by making amusing rip-off versions for social media. John Lewis itself is putting its Moz video on social media a full 13 hours before he appears on TV. Moz the monster was created by John Lewis\u2019s long-term agency Adam&amp;Eve and shot in a London studio. It stars seven-year-old twins Ethan and Tobias, who both play the same young boy in different scenes. Moz is an enormous Sesame Street-style puppet with two adult men inside. The monster puppet was filmed live and its expressions were added later using CGI technology partly created by mapping the face of an actor. Craig Inglis, John Lewis\u2019s customer director, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s Christmas campaign brings to life the power of children\u2019s imaginations and the joy of great friendships. Moz and Joe\u2019s story is magical and heartwarming.\u201d Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, described it as standard John Lewis schmaltz but warned that one Christmas soon the department store might need to come up with some new ideas to keep customers interested. \u201cJohn Lewis is still the best at this kind of heartwarming story campaign. They follow a set playbook and don\u2019t err far from that. It obviously works for them but I think at some point they might need to shake it up.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

It obviously works for them but I think at some point they might need to shake it up.\u201d<br></p> \n<p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">here</a>.</p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p><em><sup><br></sup></em></p> \n<p><em><sup>This article contains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/nov/01/reader-information-on-affiliate-links\">affiliate links</a> to products.

      "bodyText": "Investigators have raided the offices of ticket resale companies StubHub and Viagogo as part of a probe into suspected breaches of consumer law in the \u201csecondary ticketing\u201d industry, the Guardian has learned. Officials from the Competition and Markets Authority seized information about the companies\u2019 relationship with prominent ticket touts, who harvest tickets for in-demand events and sell them via the two sites. The raids are key to an investigation launched last year into whether ticketing companies are giving fans enough information about their tickets, such as who the seller is and whether buyers could be denied entry due to undisclosed restrictions on resale. Investigators are also looking at whether touts benefit from \u201cconnections\u201d at resale websites to gain advantage over genuine fans trying to get hold of tickets. The CMA is understood to have issued an \u201cinformation notice\u201d to four ticket resale companies, also including GetMeIn and Seatwave, demanding details of any relationships with major touts and turnover from ticket sales. According to sources familiar with the investigation, GetMeIn and Seatwave complied but Swiss-based Viagogo and StubHub, which is owned by online auction website eBay, refused to hand over the information voluntarily. The regulator, whose powers also allow it to obtain search warrants, later raided StubHub\u2019s office on Tottenham Court Road in London and Viagogo\u2019s office on Cannon Street in early August. Officials are understood to have seized data relating to StubHub\u2019s \u201ctop seller\u201d programme, which manages its relationships with industrial-scale ticket touts selling tickets at vast mark-ups. According to StubHub\u2019s Top Seller Handbook, touts who make more than $250,000 of sales per year are entitled to benefits including discounts on seller fees, which increase as their sales rise. Top sellers can also get access to a password-protected web platform, where they can access tools to help them manage their listings on multiple sites and upload dozens of tickets at a time for sale. Earlier this year, eBay bought Ticket Utils, a company that produces software to enable \u201clarge sellers on StubHub to enjoy a best-in-class solution for inventory management, ticket distribution and internationalisation of their inventory\u201d. StubHub said its Top Seller programme was designed to \u201cincentivise trusted sellers to sell their inventory on our platform, including lower fees and technical support\u201d. It said the programme followed all relevant laws and eliminated \u201cfraudulent or illegal activity on our site.\u201d The site has previously come under fire from a parliamentary committee for allowing touts to sell tickets without complying with UK laws that demand sellers provide information such as the row and seat number. StubHub said 98% of its sellers declared themselves to be genuine consumers rather than touts, but said it did not \u201cpolice or monitor\u201d the claims and was under no obligation to do so. A spokesperson for the CMA declined to comment on the raids, which came nearly a year after it opened a probe into \u201csuspected breaches of consumer protection law in the online secondary tickets market\u201d. In March this year, it provided an update on its work, saying it was looking into whether tickets sold to fans could deny them entry to venues, as artists and promoters try to prevent large-scale touting. The CMA is also working alongside National Trading Standards, which is understood to be conducting a separate investigation into ticket touting known as Operation Electra. The organisation was given a ringfenced budget to investigate ticket touting last year as part of a package of measures aimed at curbing the secondary ticketing market. A spokesperson declined to comment on investigations but said: \u201cNational Trading Standards remains concerned that consumers are being left out of pocket after using secondary ticketing websites to purchase tickets. \u201cWith concerts and events increasingly refusing to accept resold tickets we\u2019d strongly advise people take steps to protect themselves by only buying tickets from official sellers, most of which are working with the authorities to help ensure more tickets are made available to genuine fans through official vendors.\u201d StubHub said: \u201cWe understand the CMA investigation is ongoing and therefore await the outcome of this.\u201d Viagogo did not return requests for comment.",
