      "bodyText": "The Bank of England needs to use a sledgehammer to combat a severe economic downturn caused by the vote to leave the EU, one of Britain\u2019s most respected thinktanks has warned. In a grim assessment of the UK economy after the vote for Brexit, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said 320,000 jobs would be lost by the third quarter of next year and warned that the economy had a 50% chance of slipping into recession in the next 18 months. Inflation would increase to more than 3% for the first time in five years in late 2017 as the weak pound pushes up the price of imports and the government would be forced to borrow an extra \u00a347bn in the next four years, NIESR said on Wednesday. According to the thinktank, economic growth would slow to 0.2% in the current quarter from 0.6% in the previous three months and stagnate for the rest of the year. Growth is forecast at 1% for all of next year but conditions could worsen, it said. Its report followed a series of dire business surveys including one showing the economy shrinking at its fastest pace since 2009. NIESR said the slowdown was caused by reduced business investment after Brexit, which threatened to disrupt companies\u2019 most important trading relationships. Rising unemployment, muted wage growth and uncertainty would also hit consumer spending, it added. Simon Kirby, principal research fellow at NIESR, said: \u201cWe expect the UK to experience a marked economic slowdown in the second half of this year and throughout 2017. There is an even chance of a technical recession in the next 18 months while there is an elevated risk of further deterioration in the near term.\u201d With the Bank set to announce its response to Brexit-induced economic uncertainty on Thursday, NIESR called on the monetary policy committee to act decisively by cutting interest rates and resuming its bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing. Cutting rates from 0.5% to a new record low of 0.1%, starting with a quarter point cut on Thursday, and buying another \u00a3200bn of government bonds could offset most of the effects of Brexit, NIESR said. The government may also need to step in with tax cuts or spending increases to support the economy, it added. Jack Meaning, a NIESR research fellow, said: \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a fiscal response, monetary policymakers should be using as much of a sledgehammer as they can. If they went to the limits they could almost but not quite offset the downturn we are forecasting.\u201d Kirby said focusing on the chances of a short recession risked distracting policymakers from the threat of long-term stagnation caused by prolonged uncertainty. An \u201cendemic, long-lived problem where certainty does not return to normal levels\u201d would be a big worry for policymakers, he said. NIESR called on the Bank of England to \u201clook through\u201d an expected spike in prices that it said would prompt the governor, Mark Carney, to write letters to the chancellor next year explaining why inflation had exceeded 3% for the first time since March 2012. Meaning said it would be better for the Bank to push up inflation temporarily than to hold off on monetary policy and risk the downturn taking hold. Meaning\u2019s comments echo those of Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, who argued last month that his fellow rate-setters should act boldly to support economic confidence with rate cuts and other measures. Jagjit Chadha, NIESR\u2019s director, said there were doubts about how effective cuts to borrowing costs would be with rates already close to zero and little understanding about where the economy was heading. NIESR said additional options included the Bank buying corporate bonds, though the supply was limited, and an extension of its funding for lending programme for Britain\u2019s banks. \u201cOne key question is whether the government should now issue bonds and use the money to develop long-term investment projects that yield a rate of return for those parts of the country that the referendum result tells us feel somewhat left behind,\u201d Chadha said.",

      "bodyText": "Millions of public records used to track down white collar criminals and combat money laundering would be deleted under proposals being considered by the government\u2019s company registration agency. Companies House maintains a database on every firm incorporated in the UK, providing access to their accounts and listing all directors and shareholders. But the agency is facing mounting pressure from businesses \u2013 and reportedly from members of parliament \u2013 to take down valuable information. Proposals are being considered to reduce the amount of time the records of dissolved companies are retained, from 20 years to six. If the rules are changed, more than 2.5m records could be lost. Campaigners are warning that such a move would be a major step back in the global fight against corruption. Police investigators, the National Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office, lawyers, journalists and bank compliance teams all make extensive use of the data, with many searches involving dissolved companies and their directors. Alex Cobham, director of research at the Tax Justice Network said the proposal \u201cflies in the face of the government\u2019s previous leadership on corporate transparency, and against the criminal market abuse that follows from opacity\u201d. \u201cThe marginal cost of storing and maintaining open access to data is near zero \u2013 so the only possible reason for this proposal is to make it easier for people to hide their track record. And what gets hidden? Little that is good. Histories of administration and liquidation, along with the trails that might otherwise be followed by law enforcement officials from the UK and elsewhere tracing various forms of corruption and tax abuse.\u201d Complaints have increased since Companies House made its information available free to the general public, via a rapidly searchable website, in June last year. Requests for previously paid-for information are running at 2m a day. Approximately 64m searches were made in the nine months from June 2015 until the end of March 2016, according to the organisation\u2019s annual report. A Companies House spokesman said: \u201cWe are currently considering the correct period for which records of dissolved companies should be kept on the register. This issue is being considered following a number of complaints made by members of the public who believe that retaining, and making publicly available, information relating to long-dissolved companies is inconsistent with data protection law.\u201d There is no time limit for records to be kept under data protection law, but business people linked to dissolved companies have been citing the legislation when arguing for a shorter retention period, and complaints have been filed with the data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. The Opencorporates group, which works to improve transparency by publishing free information on 107m companies worldwide including those on the UK register, said it was currently receiving a dozen requests a day from those keen to have their details taken down. It believes records should be retained for as long as possible. \u201cIt is essential that the greatest publicity be given to companies so that everyone knows who they are doing business with,\u201d said Opencorporates founder Chris Taggart. \u201cWhile directors and owners enjoy protection from company debts under the law, the quid pro quo for that is transparency. The vast majority of people in any country are not company directors or shareholders, but they do work for companies and buy from companies.\u201d Companies House records currently stretch back to 1996. A look back through the earliest available annual reports shows that between 2000 to 2010, about 2.3m companies were dissolved in the UK. Information on companies associated with Dominic Chapell, the three times bankrupt director who was running the BHS department store chain when it collapsed, would no longer be available if the proposals to keep records for six years only were in place today. Earlier this year, Spain\u2019s industry minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Soria, was forced to resign after his links to an offshore company in the Panama Papers was exposed using information on long-dissolved UK entities controlled by his family.",

Well, sort of. The supermarket best known for groceries, television adverts featuring the actor Prunella Scales, and investigations by the Serious Fraud Office has opened a pop-up wine bar in London\u2019s Soho district, which for the next two weeks will serve only Tesco\u2019s finest* wine range. A visit to the bar \u2013 housed in a Soho art gallery on Wardour Street which is closed for the summer \u2013 quickly introduces you to wine waiter, Ricardo. He\u2019s good looking, Italian, and extremely confident in his patter \u2013 until you ask for a glass of claret. The bar has none, Ricardo says, despite the looming presence of Tesco\u2019s finest* M\u00e9doc or its finest* Chateau Montagne St Emilion on the menu. Ricardo replaces himself with his boss, Shane, of the West London Wine School, a man with phrases in his locker such as \u201cresidual sugars\u201d that challenge drinkers to concentrate for the entirety of his sentences. At some point he utters something along the lines of \u201cyouth and a lack of complexity\u201d, and while it\u2019s not quite clear if he\u2019s talking about the wine or his staff, he recommends Tesco\u2019s finest* Rioja Reserva 2011. Wine buffs might tell you that 2011 is not Rioja\u2019s \u201cfinest\u201d year, but this one is certainly agreeable enough, at least mid-afternoon after a good lunch. Sensing a lull in proceedings, the ever attentive Shane returns with a complimentary snifter of the M\u00e9doc, but one feels his heart isn\u2019t quite in it and his scepticism is quickly validated. With each bottle of the M\u00e9doc, Tesco might also want to throw in a free case of gout, as sips improve only after taking a mouthful of Stilton. Then there\u2019s another Rioja (this time the Gran Reserva 2010) and perfectly drinkable that is too. Lisa, the server on this occasion and a survivor of the Hardy\u2019s wine events at international cricket, says the staff had heroically tasted all 48 wines in the pop-up bar the night before. She insists, of course, that not all of it was digested, with plenty of Tesco\u2019s finest* propelled down the spittoon. The M\u00e9doc, it seems, has its uses.",

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, drawing a line under the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal seems a reasonable idea. There can be few consumers unaware of the gigantic scam perpetrated by the big banks during the 1990s and the 2000s. A time bar was first mooted by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for 2018, but now looks like being extended by a year to 2019. That sounds like good news for customers. The banks are deeply unimpressed with the first big decision made by Andrew Bailey, the FCA chief executive, since his arrival from the Bank of England. Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and the other big lenders have all been making provisions for a line to be drawn in the sand in 2018. Clearly, this is not good news for the banks, because a PPI bill that already stands at \u00a337bn means weaker profits, smaller dividends and a lower share price. Nor is it marvellous news for a government which will find the uncertainty over the final cost of PPI unwelcome as it seeks to get rid of its stakes in Lloyds and RBS. In fact, there should be no sympathy for the banks. The hefty costs they have incurred, are incurring, and will continue to incur as a result of PPI are entirely of their own making. As even a cursory look at the charge sheet shows, Bailey is still letting them off lightly. Let\u2019s start with the way the banks mercilessly and knowingly rooked their customers. PPI was not a case of mis-selling by the odd bad apple; it was mis-selling on an industrial scale. Regulation of the banks as they perpetrated this scam was somewhere on the scale between lax and non-existent. Nor was there much contrition when the scandal finally came to light. On the contrary, when the regulator finally woke up to what was happening and said compensation should be paid, the banks fought the decision in the courts. It was only when Lloyds broke ranks that consumers started to get paid back. Even then, consumers have had to battle against quite blatant foot-dragging on the part of the banks. The reluctance to settle legitimate claims is demonstrated by figures showing that 70% of complaints to the ombudsman about the refusal of banks to pay up have been upheld. Consumer groups argue that only when the banks stop playing for time should a deadline for PPI claims even be considered. It\u2019s hard to disagree. Helicopter money looms closer in Japan Going Japanese. It\u2019s the fear that haunts policymakers the world over. Mario Draghi had the travails of the world\u2019s third-biggest economy at the back of his mind when he made the case for negative interest rates in the eurozone. The risk of deflation helps explain why the US Federal Reserve has been so reluctant to push up the cost of borrowing and why the Bank of England has kept UK official rates at 0.5% for the past seven or so years. Japan has been trying to get out of its economic mess for a quarter of a century. It demonstrates what can happen if countries fail to spot the root causes of a problem, fail to act quickly enough, and remove policy stimulus over-hastily. More pertinently, it provides a warning of what can happen when conventional economic tools cease to work. The government of Shinzo Abe has just announced details of a supplementary budget designed to boost growth and drive inflation back up to its official 2% target. A 28tn yen package sounds like a lot of money, but as has tended to be the way in Japan, appearances can be deceptive. Half the 28tn yen is supposed to be extra spending by the private sector, and a further quarter will be the provision of cheap loans. The extra spending by the government amounts to 6tn yen, only 4.5tn yen of which will be spent in the current year. Abe\u2019s government says the fiscal measures will increase national output by 1.3% in the current year. That looks highly improbable given the modest size of the package. Lifting Japan out of its malaise is going to require something more radical, which is why the talk of helicopter money is becoming louder. And why Draghi et al are watching so closely. Lack of strikes is not a sign of workplace harmony Like bell-bottomed trousers and prog rock, industrial action is a relic of a bygone age. Official records stretch back to the 1890s and never in all that time have as few people been involved in disputes as the 81,000 who went on strike in 2015. Nor was this a one-off. The post-war peak for days lost through strikes came in a period that embraced the miners\u2019 strikes of 1972 and 1984-5 and the Winter of Discontent in 1978-9. Since then, the number of stoppages has dwindled. So is this a golden era of workplace harmony? Hardly. Grievances have not disappeared. Brexit was partly caused by year after year of falling real wages. The difference is that with union power restricted and fewer workers covered by collective bargaining, employers call the shots.",

      "bodyText": "Talks will start on Wednesday to avert the most extreme disruption yet for long-suffering Southern passengers, with 40% of trains to be cancelled as conductors prepare to strike for five days next week. Southern\u2019s train operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), said it did not expect to return to its normal timetable until at least September, even without the industrial action. GTR and the RMT union will meet at the independent Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) on Wednesday and Thursday to try to resolve the dispute over the future role of conductors. GTR aims to run up to 60% of Southern\u2019s normal timetable should the strike go ahead. The main line between London and Brighton, including to Gatwick, will operate a reduced service, with fewer trains again running on coastal and other routes. There will be no trains on lines to Tonbridge, Uckfield and Havant. Southern will not provide rail replacement buses during the strike, citing a lack of sufficient vehicles and the congestion they would cause. All first-class carriages will be declassified and made available to all passengers. Meanwhile, Southern said reduced services were expected to run for at least a further five weeks. The emergency schedule Southern implemented on 11 July remains in place with more than 300 trains a day axed, in what was billed as an attempt to provide a more reliable service. However, the latest performance figures show that one in four of the remaining Southern trains ran significantly late outside London on Monday and fewer than half arrived on time. Unions staged two 24-hour strikes in May and June over plans to rebrand conductors as onboard supervisors, making the drivers solely responsible for closing train doors. GTR said it would start to implement the changes from 21 August. RMT said it would suspend industrial action if the company agreed to also axe its planned changes and refrain from imposing new contracts. Last week, it confirmed the strike would run from next Monday to Friday in response to the company and government\u2019s \u201cpoint-blank refusal\u201d to engage. RMT wrote to the new transport secretary, Chris Grayling, asking for direct talks after he said tackling Southern\u2019s issues would be a priority in his new role, but the union said the request had been ignored. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the \u201carrogance and inaction\u201d of GTR and the government demonstrated they had no interest in resolving the dispute. But the rail minister, Paul Maynard, said the move showed the union \u201chad decided that it is not on the side of the passenger\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn called on the government to cancel GTR\u2019s franchise. At a rally on Tuesday evening in Brighton, one of the cities most affected by the Southern crisis, Corbyn was expected to say: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that can unite this party, and indeed this city, it\u2019s campaigning to get rid of the Southern franchise and bring the railways into public ownership. \u201cDespite the constant failures of the GTR franchise \u2013 which includes Southern and Thameslink \u2013 they continue to make huge profits while cutting staff, cutting services and raising your ticket prices. What is the point of a franchise agreement \u2026 if a company can walk away from their commitments at no cost?\u201d The Department for Transport said the solution is for the RMT to abandon the dispute, blaming the union for the high levels of sick leave that have contributed to delays. Cash said: \u201cRMT enters these talks in good faith. It must be the priority of everyone on our railways to protect and enhance the safety of the travelling public at this time of extraordinary pressure on our services. That is the fundamental issue at the heart of this dispute. \u201cRMT once again thanks the travelling public for their support for the frontline rail staff whose job is to keep people safe on our dangerously overcrowded trains and platforms.\u201d GTR\u2019s passenger service director, Angie Doll, said: \u201cWe are sorry that our passengers once again look set to suffer further disruption because of the RMT. The union must call this action off by Thursday afternoon if we are to avoid having to put in Monday\u2019s strike timetable. \u201cThis action is not necessary. Our new onboard supervisors will no longer close the doors, a task that passes to the driver with the aid of CCTV. This will cost no one their jobs, and frees up staff on board trains to better serve passengers. \u201cAs many services will have staff on board as they do today and our on-board staff will have an improved role which better meets the needs of passengers, securing their valued position on the railway for the long term.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Slough has the highest proportion of properties owned by offshore companies outside London, according to an analysis of Land Registry data. The research by conveyancing services firm Search Acumen found that in Slough one in 238 properties \u2013 both commercial and residential \u2013 have an owner that is a company registered abroad. Widespread ownership of UK property by offshore companies is a relatively recent phenomenon. The data reveals that 55% of the titles owned by offshore companies as of October 2015 were bought during the period 2010-2015. Just 3% of titles owned by overseas firms were bought before 2000. But inside the capital, the concentration of foreign ownership is much higher. In the EC postcodes, which cover the City of London plus parts of Islington, Camden and Tower Hamlets, one in 25 properties are owned by offshore companies, followed closely by the W postcodes, which stretch from the city centre to Mayfair, Kensington and the western suburbs towards Heathrow. The data includes only offices and homes owned by offshore companies. If individual foreign ownership was also counted, the figures would likely be much higher. The Land Registry lists 99,345 freehold or leasehold titles across England and Wales as being owned by foreign-registered businesses, including 675 within Slough\u2019s SL postcode area. Research by the Guardian in May found that 40,000 properties across London are owned by secretive offshore companies, an increase of 9% over the previous 10 months. Entire developments from the East End to Knightsbridge have been sold to anonymous owners shielded by companies in tax havens, including Panama, Liechtenstein and the British Virgin Islands. The rising use of tax havens to buy property comes amid growing concern over residences in the capital being used as investment assets by foreign buyers. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has attacked the use of homes as \u201cgold bricks\u201d after the Guardian revealed that almost two-thirds of The Tower, the UK\u2019s tallest residential building, has been sold abroad, with a quarter held in tax havens. Slough joins Manchester as the most popular destination after the capital for offshore buyers. The researchers say the reason for Slough\u2019s popularity is partly the town\u2019s huge trading estate, which is home to large numbers of foreign companies.

      "bodyText": "Worries about the global economy, disappointment with the Japanese stimulus package, a continuing slide in the oil price and further falls for banks have all combined to help push stock markets lower. Investors are also nervous about this week\u2019s Bank of England rate-setting meeting. Commerzbank fell sharply after warning its earnings would fall this year, leading the whole sector lower. Banks had been under pressure following the results of the European stress tests on Friday, while UK banks were additionally hit by news that the deadline for consumers to claim missold PPI had been extended. In the US, investors were unsettled by a host of car makers reporting disappointing sales figures for July. Meanwhile West Texas Intermediate - the US oil benchmark - dropped below $40 a barrel again, and is currently down 1.57% at $39.43 on further concerns about a supply glut amid weakening demand. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 48.55 points or 0.73% at 6645.40 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% at 10,144.34 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.84% at 4327.99 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.76% to 16,098.37 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.77% lower at 8277.3 In Greece the Athens market lost 3.15% to 551.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 99 points or 0.54%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s the view on Japan - which earlier launched its new stimulus programme - from the International Monetary Fund: Back with the UK and the Bank of England, and Richard Woolnough of M&amp;G Investments believes there is no need for Carney &amp; Co to rush things: The market is assuming that the Bank of England now has to act to prevent the severe crisis risk it outlined in previous press conferences. However as the UK is currently around two and a half years from departing the European community, the BoE has time on its side: half a year of pondering the implications of Brexit, and then two years of full membership to consider post-Brexit... [At the moment] we have a healthy economy, operating at near full capacity, that is about to be given a shot in the arm from a fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate perspective. On the negative side, the UK economy is going to experience some potential slowdown in two and a half years\u2019 time, as barriers to trade with our neighbours are likely to be implemented. With some associated falls in potential capital expenditure and consumer confidence before this. The tailwinds look capable of more than matching the headwinds over the next two years. Indeed, if you are a business and have any spare capacity that needs to be used ahead of the Brexit deadline (for example a UK based car manufacturer), the logic should be to produce at full speed before the trade barriers are increased, especially given the fall in sterling. It looks like UK exporters are in a great position until the spring of 2019. The BoE\u2019s own forecasts pre-Brexit show inflation returning to or above target over the next couple of years. The problem the BoE now faces is that the benefits of Brexit (looser fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, and the lower exchange rate) will occur well before the potential headwinds in 2019. The monetary authorities like to work in a counter cyclical fashion, however the economic damage that could occur from the decision to leave could well be delayed. In fact acting aggressively early could well result in a mini boom, which will make the eventual delayed event of Brexit appear even more severe. For these reasons, the BoE should not be too aggressive in easing monetary policy on Thursday. The chances of a recession and deflation in 2019 will depend on how the UK economy adjusts to its new role in the world. Or just maybe, in two and a half years\u2019 time market mechanisms such as the exchange rate and the fact the UK has had time to prepare for leaving the EU will mean the market will be focused on new issues and not an event that could seem like a distant memory. The full comment is here. US car sales for July have come in below expectations so far: A positive survey from New York, as businesses shrug off any effects of the UK Brexit vote. The ISM New York business activity index came in at 60.7 in July, up from 45.4 in the previous month. The report said: New York City business activity returned to cautious optimism after the short term pre-Brexit negativity seen in May and June....While nearly all of the June responses came in before the Brexit vote, July results revealed no initial ill effects from the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. Current Business Conditions rose to a 7 month high of 60.7 in July after contracting for two consecutive months for the first time since the Great Recession. US markets have joined in the global declines, as concerns about the state of the economy combine with the continuing weakness in the oil price to unsettle investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 29 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.17% and Nasdaq 0.21% lower. European markets continue to lose ground, with banking shares under pressure again in the wake of Friday\u2019s stress test results and, in the UK, the latest developments with PPI. Back with the UK, and the prospect of the Bank of England cutting interest rates on Thursday. Larry Hatheway, group chief economist at asset management firm GAM, said: The Bank of England is widely expected to ease monetary policy this week in response to concerns that \u2018Brexit\u2019 has further weakened an already slowing UK economy, making it less likely that inflation will hit the Bank\u2019s target over its two-year time horizon. Among the factors likely to underpin an easing are surveys showing weaker investor and consumer confidence, softer PMI and industrial production figures and anecdotal evidence regarding weak investment spending intentions. A more competitive sterling exchange rate and signs of resilient exports are positives, but are unlikely to prove decisive for the MPC. Nor is some expected easing of fiscal policy, given lags in implementation and uncertainty about its scope and timing. The market anticipates at least a quarter point cut in the base rate, but an expansion of asset purchases and a \u2018bias to ease\u2019 would not be surprises. But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, believes the Bank of England would do well to hold fire on a rate cut: Act in haste, repent at leisure, these are words the Bank of England MPC would do well to consider this week when they are widely expected to meet and move on interest rates for the first time in 87 months, only rather than raising them as was expected to be the case two years ago, expectations are pretty much nailed on that we could well see a 0.25% cut to the headline rate and potentially an announcement of more asset purchases. That the market is pricing this in as a 100% certainty is largely as a result of the expectations that have been built up in the aftermath of June\u2019s historic Brexit vote. In essence the central bank has boxed itself into a corner, and despite recent data should really be asking itself whether it would be wise to act at all this week... Quite frankly it remains far too early to establish what damage has been done to the UK economy as a result of recent uncertainty irrespective of what recent PMI and confidence data tells us. Proponents of stimulus this week will no doubt argue that this week\u2019s awful manufacturing and construction numbers mean that the bank has to act, but just because we\u2019ve seen a knee jerk plunge in consumer and business confidence doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll continue to head lower. As it is with rates already at record lows it is not immediately apparent what a further rate cut now would achieve, apart from reinforce the negativity surrounding the UK economy, which in turn could see any further measures backfire. Last week\u2019s Q2 GDP numbers show that the UK economy potentially has more scope to adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d policy with respect to further measures given interest rates are already at record lows, and credit is freely available. If the new government sees fit to wait until its autumn statement to deliver new fiscal measures, surely it makes sense for the Bank of England to also wait to see what new Chancellor Philip Hammond delivers later this year and supplement policy that way. Acting now in the absence of hard data runs the risk of the market tail wagging the policy maker\u2019s dog, and could see any further action backfire in the same way the Bank of Japan\u2019s recent policy measures backfired. Oil prices have bounced back, after WTI crude in the US fell below $40 a barrel earlier today \u2013 but concerns about oversupply remain, and could push prices lower again soon. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is up 75 cents at $42.89 a barrel, a 1.8% gain on the day. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading 55 cents higher, a 1.37% rise, after briefly dipping below $40. The outlook is for lower demand, coupled with record-high crude production from Opec members this month, as top exporter Saudi Arabia is pumping close to record levels. Analysts at Commerzbank said: Financial investors are increasingly betting on a continuing price slide and are thereby generating additional selling pressure. WTI\u2019s dip below $40 took it into a bear market, with prices down more than 20% from its peak in June. FXTM Research analyst Lukman Otunuga said: Sentiment remains bearish towards the commodity and the mounting anxiety towards its incessant declines could provide an additional foundation for bears to install another round of selling. Dollar weakness did little to quell the selloff and further losses could be expected as the horrible mixture of oversupply fears and depressed demand attract sellers to attack. Just out in the US: consumer spending has gone up more than expected in June, as households bought a range of goods and services. The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.4%, following a similar gain May. When adjusted for inflation, spending increased 0.3%, compared with 0.2% in May. The data was included in last week\u2019s second-quarter GDP release, which showed consumer spending increased at a 4.2% annual rate, the fastest in almost two years. The jump accounted fro almost the entire 1.2% economic growth in the second quarter \u2013 which was an unexpectedly weak GDP reading. Turning to UK interest rates, JPMorgan economist Allan Monks said the Bank of England should go ahead and cut rates on Thursday, as expected. Ex-MPC member Kate Barker wrote an article in today\u2019s Times arguing against a cut in rates, with the belief it would do more harm than good. As a well-respected former MPC member, Barker\u2019s views are noteworthy at a time when the BoE faces a big decision. We do not find Barker\u2019s argument wholly persuasive, however. The BOE is well positioned to provide at least some timely support during what increasingly appears to be a material demand shock. Barker\u2019s argument is not about the appropriate timing of monetary easing, the need for a policy response or even the prospect of a rise in inflation. Instead, she argues that lower rates would be costly - through adversely affecting bank profits and inducing savers to cut spending - and ineffective, as easier policy would not resolve the uncertainty at the heart of the demand slowdown and would raise import prices through further weakening the currency. Bank deposit rates are still positive, which will help to cushion the adverse impact on profits. The BoE also has the option of offering banks cheaper funding to reduce the burden on savers. While Barker argues that half of mortgages are fixed rate products, this means there are half that are not. Few doubted that higher rates would have affected spending through this mechanism. It is also hard to square a view that there would be \u201clittle impact on the mortgage market\u201d with the simultaneous concern that easier monetary policy would threaten longer term economic stability by \u201cencouraging borrowing against inflated asset prices\u201d. It is clear that easier monetary policy does not remove Brexit uncertainty. But it is not supposed to. Rather, looser monetary policy can help to limit the extent of demand weakness and leave the economy in a better position in the future. Indeed, more policy action now might reduce the need for further action in the future. And any subsidy the BoE offers banks could then be removed more quickly. A lower policy rate right now might also be a necessary response to further declines in the global risk-free interest rate. This partly determines where the BoE\u2019s current equilibrium policy rate is, which the MPC has no control over. Failing to ease in this environment \u2013 especially given expectations for the BoE to do so \u2013 would amount to a de facto tightening in monetary policy. Monks added that there is no doubt that fiscal policy would be a more effective response for the UK \u2013 as Barker argues. But the BoE sets policy on the basis of current government policy and has been criticised in the past for expressing explicit views on fiscal policy. It will take at least a few months for a change in fiscal policy to be announced, let alone to start affecting demand. The BoE has the ability to offer some support upfront before handing over the baton to fiscal policy. Indeed, if fiscal policy is altered significantly, as the BoE may be anticipating, the MPC would be free in the future to reverse any temporary monetary stimulus package it implements this week. It is ironic that while some on the monetary side of the fence are arguing for a fiscal response, one of the first statements the new UK Chancellor made on appointment was that \u201cthe initial response to this kind of a [Brexit] shock must be a monetary response delivered by the Bank of England\u201d. Both policymakers should stop dithering and support a slowing economy, in our view. Bond yields in the eurozone are rising along with those in Japan, a sign of investor concerns about Tokyo\u2019s apparent shift from monetary easing towards fiscal stimulus. As the Japanese government approved 13.5tn yen ($132bn) in fiscal measures, markets fretted that this could mean that the Bank of Japan eases its aggressive bond buying programme. On Friday, the central bank disappointed markets by keeping the programme steady, and announcing it would review policy in September. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda sought to calm nerves today by saying that the planned review of monetary policy would not weaken the central bank\u2019s stimulus. Rabobank strategist Matt Cairns told Reuters: The concern is that they are clutching at straws as they run out of firepower. Both in Japan and Europe, we are at a bit of a crossroads in that policy has now run for a considerable period without any material gains. Japan\u2019s 10-year bond yields rose more than 10 basis points to a 4 1/2 month high of -0.03%. Benchmark German yields rose 4 bps to -0.12%. Most other eurozone yields were up 3-4 bps. Another factor are expectations that the European Central Bank will slow its asset purchases in August. And here is more on the UK construction survey data \u2013 see the full story here. There is some confusion as to the size of Japan\u2019s fiscal stimulus package (it depends on what is included, obviously). We went with the Reuters figure of $132bn. That aside, Martin Gilbert, chief executive of fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management, tweeted: Gold, a popular safe haven in times of turmoil, is climbing towards $1,360 an ounce as expectations of US interest rate hikes receded following weaker economic data last week. Spot gold was up 0.5% at $1,359.17 an ounce. The euro has risen above $1.12 for the first time in more than a month. The dollar is being sold after the unexpectedly poor US second-quarter GDP numbers last Friday (the annualised growth rate came in at 1.2%). The FTSE 100 index has touched a two-week low, in its second day of declines. It has lost 0.55% to 6657.63, down nearly 37 points. Direct Line, the UK\u2019s biggest motor insurer, is bucking the trend, jumping 8.1% 383.9p after first-half profits beat analysts\u2019 forecasts. Rival Admiral has also benefited, with its shares rising 2.3% to \u00a321.98. The Dax in Frankfurt lost nearly 150 points, a fall of more than 1.3%, following Commerzbank\u2019s profit warning, while the CAC in Paris has shed 1.4%. European shares are still lower this morning, with banks and oil companies among the biggest fallers. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up developments: Scepticism at the rigour of recent stress tests has sent bank shares plummeting for a second day. Oil prices in bear market territory is weighing on the energy sector. In London, builders\u2019 merchant Travis Perkins, which today warned of the impact of the Brexit vote on business, is leading the FTSE 100 index lower, with its shares down nearly 3% at \u00a314.98. RBS and Barclays are close behind, with losses of 2.9% and 2.8% respectively. Housebuilder Berkeley Group is down 2.6% while Lloyds Banking Group shares have lost 2.3%. Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s Commerzbank was among the worst performing banks after its profit warning. Lawler said: The share price decline this year in Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse has been so severe that both banks have been demoted from the Euro Stoxx 50 index. If regulators had hope for a confidence booster from the stress tests results, they\u2019ve had a rude awakening. Monte dei Paschi\u2019s rescue deal was a step in the right direction but the funds involved are too small and there are too many banks with too many non performing loans to repeat the same model across the sector. Safe havens including the Japanese yen and gold were higher, as Japan\u2019s fiscal stimulus package caused some disappointment, he said. The Australian dollar erased early losses to gain on the day after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to a record low of 1.5%, in another sign of investors questioning the efficacy of central bank stimulus. Stocks had been gaining in the past two-months as Brexit fears eased, despite oil peaking in June. But the slide below $45 per barrel in Brent crude appears to have been the price point at which stock markets have sat up and paid attention. Oil prices have slumped into bear market territory with a 20% decline from this year\u2019s peak, with WTI crude now below $40 per barrel. Brent at $40 per barrel would mark a 50% retracement of the gains from the low this year and could be a target for short-sellers. US stocks look set for a lower open, following in the footsteps of European and Asian markets, ahead of earnings from Pfizer, Procter &amp; Gamble and AIG. Back to the PPI story. uSwitch.com is advising people who think they\u2019ve been mis-sold a PPI policy to complain to their bank. If they are still unhappy, they can take their complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service for free. Tashema Jackson, money expert at uSwitch.com, said: By proposing to set a deadline the Financial Conduct Authority is sending a signal that consumers impacted by PPI mis-selling should get their skates on to seek payback. However, as PPI is still the biggest cause for complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do before the industry can finally draw a line under this scandal. It\u2019s now important that the banks, regulator and Ombudsman work together to raise awareness of the new deadline, so that those yet to claim do so \u2013 without having to pay fees charged by claims management companies. Germany\u2019s second-biggest bank, Commerzbank, has warned earnings will fall this year, sending its shares to a record low. It blamed businesses borrowing less and the drag on revenues from negative interest rates. In April, the German bank had warned that it would be \u201cmore challenging\u201d to match 2015\u2019s net profit of \u20ac1.06bn. Its shares plunged 8.5% at one stage to a record low of \u20ac5.27 this morning, giving the company a market value of just \u20ac6.6bn. They are now trading 7.8% lower. Most European banks showed themselves resilient in the latest EU-wide stress tests last Friday. Banks from Italy, Ireland, Spain and Austria fared worst in the tests, which were conducted by the European Banking Authority, the pan-European regulator. Commerzbank was near the bottom in the stress tests. Low or negative interest rates are an issue for all banks, depressing their profits. Ingo Frommen, analyst at LBBW (Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg), said: Commerzbank has two issues. Concerns about its capital are big. In the EBA simulation, Commerzbank showed one of the lowest readings, and that was based on the higher capital ratio of end-2015. Separately, there is a vastly more sober view about the future development in the low interest rate environment, which is causing a \u20ac100m annual hit on Commerzbank. Producer prices in the eurozone rose more than expected in June for the second month in a row, due to soaring energy prices. The European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro climbed 0.7% on the month, following a 0.6% gain in May. Compared with June 2015, prices were down 3.5%. The pick-up in monthly price pressures will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which has been fighting ultra-low inflation (and the spectre of deflation) in the eurozone for some time. Here is our full story on the extension of the PPI claims deadline. Our banking editor, Jill Treanor, reported in April that persistent misconduct and an aggressive sales culture had cost the UK\u2019s banks and building societies \u00a353bn in fines, compensation and legal fees over the past 15 years. The PPI scandal alone has cost them \u00a337bn so far, while they have paid \u00a324bn in compensation to consumers. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed. The much healthier condition of the banks in this crisis suggests that the construction sector\u2019s developing downturn will be much milder than the collapse in 2008/09, which saw a peak-to-trough fall in output of 17%. Still, the likelihood that Brexit negotiations will be protracted suggests that businesses will remain reluctant to commit to major capital expenditure for a long time to come. Meanwhile, the public investment plans won\u2019t be reviewed until the Autumn Statement at the end of the year and most major construction projects have long lead times. So its hard to see the construction sector escaping its recession within the next year. Returning to the UK construction numbers, Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, has some interesting insight into how the sector works. For many construction firms, Brexit is an unwelcome distraction when their primary focus has been on recovering after the lean years following the last recession. This data will not lift their mood. That said, while many will fear recession, the sector is more robust today than it was back in 2008. He said construction firms were used to dealing with contract delays. Today\u2019s contractors are also on the whole more rigorous in their bidding than in previous years, reducing firms\u2019 exposure to costly over-runs. More of the largest businesses are getting a significant chunk of their income from service contracts, providing some insulation from the potential of delayed or cancelled projects. All this is not to say that the industry is completely relaxed. Those with exposure to London will be particularly concerned should the commercial property market suffer a significant slowdown. \u201cNevertheless, even if construction firms are nervous in the current climate, the hope is that the sector is robust enough to ride out any short-term disruption in the wider economy. Ireland has also been affected by the Brexit vote. A separate survey, the Investec manufacturing PMI for Ireland, showed the first decline in factory output in more than three years. The index dropped to 50.2 in July from 53.0 in June, only just above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. New business stalled in July, ending a three-year period of expansion. A market slowdown and the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU were mentioned as factors reducing new orders. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the survey showed the continued impact of Brexit-related worries on the economy that raises the risk of a recession. If the construction PMI is combined with the final manufacturing and the flash services PMI, the \u2018all sector\u2019 PMI will have sunk to 47.3 from 51.9 in June. As such, the surveys signal the steepest fall in business activity since April 2009; the turnaround in the index (a 4.6 point drop) being the largest ever deterioration recorded since the surveys began in 1997. We await tomorrow\u2019s final services PMI for an updated signal. While we remain cautious about reading too much into the survey signals from months in which both political and economic uncertainty was so intense, the data raise the prospect of the economy sliding into decline in the third quarter and entering recession. Employment fell for the first time in just over three years as construction firms scaled back capacity. Use of subcontractors fell the most in nearly three years. Williamson added: A ray of hope was provided by the rate of decline of new orders easing slightly compared to June\u2019s three-and-a-half year record, though it was still worryingly steep. There were mixed signals on inflationary pressures. While prices for materials spiked higher as the weak pound caused import prices to rise, showing the largest monthly rise since March of last year, rates charged by subcontractors showed the smallest rise for just over three years as firms competed for business on price. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: July\u2019s survey is the first construction PMI compiled entirely after the EU referendum result and the figures confirm a clear loss of momentum since the second quarter of 2016, led by a steep and accelerated decline in commercial building. Reduced volumes of new work to replace completed projects contributed to a fall in employment for the first time in just over three years. UK construction firms frequently cited ongoing economic uncertainty as having a material negative impact on their order books. In particular, survey respondents noted heightened risk aversion and lower investment spending among clients, notwithstanding a greater number of speculative enquiries in anticipation of lower charges. Meanwhile, exchange rate depreciation resulted in sharper input cost inflation and there are concerns that additional supplier price rises for imported materials could be around the corner. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not all bad news, at least insofar as the decline in construction output was little-changed from June\u2019s seven-year low. There were also some reports that demand patterns had been more resilient than expected given the uncertain business outlook. The three main construction sectors all recorded lower output, with commercial activity worst hit. Markit said: Anecdotal evidence suggested that economic uncertainty following the EU referendum was the main factor weighing on business activity in July, especially in the commercial building sector. However, there were also reports suggesting that demand patterns had been more resilient than expected, and some firms linked new enquiries from international clients to exchange rate depreciation. New orders fell at a slower pace than in June, offering some hope that the weaker pound could help secure new orders. Britain\u2019s construction industry shrank at the fastest pace in seven years in July following the Brexit vote, according to a closely-watched industry survey. The construction PMI from Markit/CIPS fell to 45.9 from 46.0 in June, marking the lowest reading since June 2009. Any readings above 50 indicate expansion; any readings below point to contraction. Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have fallen below $40 a barrel for the first time since April, as worries over a global oil glut intensified. Light crude for delivery in September lost 11 cents, or 0.3% to $39.95 a barrel, moving deeper into bear territory (a bear market is defined as a fall of 20% from a recent peak). Brent crude is trading at $42.12 a barrel, down 2 cents or 0.05%. Looking ahead to the UK construction PMI data, out at 9.30am BST, economists at Daiwa said: The main European data release today will be the UK\u2019s construction PMI \u2013 the first time this survey has been released since the vote to leave the EU. While yesterday\u2019s manufacturing PMI reported the second-steepest monthly drop on record \u2013 down more than 4pts to its lowest level since February 2013 \u2013 the decline in the equivalent construction PMI is expected to be less marked. But that\u2019s only because the construction sector had already signaled a significant loss of momentum in the run up to the referendum vote, with the headline PMI having fallen more than 5pts to 46 in June. Indeed, the anticipated further 2pt drop in July would leave the index at its lowest since April 2009. Brexit is casting a long shadow over housing and construction stocks like Travis Perkins, said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown. The company\u2019s fortunes are closely attuned the housing market, as home purchases are often followed up by improvement works. Whilst there are doubts hovering over the UK economy, stocks like Travis Perkins could be in for a rough time. The company also sources products from over 50 countries, so the devaluation of Sterling after Brexit could squeeze margins, unless Travis can push the pain back onto suppliers. Nonetheless Travis\u2019 results for the first half were positive, with particularly strong sales growth in its consumer division, which includes Wickes and Tool Station. Cheap borrowing costs and Help to Buy should continue to provide some support for housing transactions, while Travis Perkins\u2019 contracts division could stand to benefit if the government decides to turn the infrastructure spending taps on. For the time being however, Brexit is casting a long shadow over housing and construction stocks like Travis Perkins. Meanwhile, broker Tullett Prebon is cashing in on Brexit. It said the pound\u2019s tumble following the referendum would boost its revenues. The firm, which has agreed to buy rival ICAP\u2019s hybrid voice broking business, reported an 11% rise in underlying operating profits to \u00a367m for the six months to June. Chief executive John Phizackerley said: The outcome of the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership was a momentous political event. It has already led to a change in leadership of the government and gave rise to exceptional volatility in the financial markets. Although it is too early to speculate on the long term impact of Brexit, the company has in the immediate aftermath seen little adverse impact and in fact the increase in volatility has resulted in higher levels of activity recently. The company is well positioned to support its clients during this period and we are grateful that they have continued to place their confidence in us as a trusted partner. From an FX perspective a fall in the value of sterling will result in a positive impact on reported revenue. In the six months to 30 June 2016 over 80% of revenue is in non-sterling currencies of which over 60% is in dollars and over 10% is in euros. Back in the UK, builders\u2019 merchant Travis Perkins has warned that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU has created \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d in the outlook for the building supplies market, and flagged weaker demand in the run-up to the poll and following the referendum. The company owns Wickes, BSS, Toolstation and Tile Giant. John Carter, its chief executive, said: It is clear that the result of the EU referendum has created significant uncertainty in the outlook for our end markets and we did experience weaker demand in the run up to and immediately followingthe referendum. Our two-year like-for-like sales [compared with the last two years] in July have been below the levels we experienced in the second quarter, however we have seen a gradual improvement through the course of the month. In our view it is too early to precisely predict end market demand and we will continue to monitor the lead indicators we track and will react accordingly. The company reported a 10.2% rise in adjusted pretax profits to \u00a3184m for the six months to June. Its shares were the second-biggest faller on the FTSE 100 in early trading, down 2.6% to \u00a315.04. Japan\u2019s fiscal package comes days after the Bank of Japan eased policy again and said it would review its monetary stimulus programme in September, which has boosted expectations for \u201chelicopter money,\u201d printing more money for government debt. Prime minister Shinzo Abe told a meeting of cabinet ministers and ruling party executives on Tuesday morning: We compiled today a strong economic package draft aimed at carrying out investment for the future. With this package, we\u2019ll proceed to not just stimulate demand but also achieve sustainable economic growth led by private demand. In Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet has approved a 13.5tn yen ($132bn) stimulus package, which includes cash payouts to low-income earners and boosts infrastructure spending. The package includes 7.5tn yen of spending by the national and local governments, and earmarks 6tn yen from the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, which is not included in the government\u2019s general budget. It comes amid mounting concerns that the Bank of Japan has run out of ammunition, with its policy triggering the worst sell-off of government bonds in three years. European stock markets are bathed in red at the open. FTSE 100 index in London down more than 30 points, or 0.5%, at 6,659.46 Dax in Frankfurt down 0.6% at 10,308.53 CAC in Frankfurt down 0.5% at 4,387.97 Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.6% at 8,463.10 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1.5% at 16,300.23 The new PPI complaint deadline is a year later than expected, and analysts said this could well mean more payouts for banks. Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said: For example, in its 2015 full year results, Lloyds set aside additional provisions to cover claims until mid-2018, so it is possible that an extra year\u2019s worth of provisioning may now be required. We would not be surprised to see top-ups of a few hundred million pounds, and perhaps as high as \u00a31bn, for each of the large UK banks, with Lloyds being the worst affected. Over here, Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has extended the deadline for complaints about payment protection insurance to mid-2019. Consumers who believe they have been missold the controversial insurance now have until the end of June 2019 to make a claim. Banks have paid out \u00a324bn in compensation in customers over the past five years for misselling PPI \u2013 Britain\u2019s costliest scandal in financial services. It has cost them even more, \u00a337bn in total. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s decision to extend the deadline is bad news for banks, which were hoping to draw a line under the scandal. Lloyds Banking Group has borne the brunt of customer complaints and paid out the most compensation. UK banking shares are down this morning and are among the top fallers on the FTSE 100 index. Royal Bank of Scotland has lost 2.2% while Lloyds is down 1.5% and Barclays has lost 1.4%. More on the Australian rate cut. The Commonwealth Bank quickly passed on a cut of 0.13 percentage points to home loan borrowers, but the RBA insisted that the housing market would not catch fire. The governor of Australia\u2019s central bank, Glenn Stevens, said supervisory measures had strengthened lending standards, and banks were being more cautious about who they lent money to. The most recent information suggests that dwelling prices have been rising only moderately over the course of this year, with considerable supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Growth in lending for housing purposes has slowed a little this year. All this suggests that the likelihood of lower interest rates exacerbating risks in the housing market has diminished. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ve woken up to news that the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates to a record low. It lowered the cash rate by a quarter point to 1.5%, amid low inflation and a slowing housing market. More details here. New Zealand\u2019s central bank could well follow suit next week. Before that, we will get the Bank of England\u2019s monthly decision on Thursday. The latest dire manufacturing survey data piled pressure on the Bank to cut rates this week (it could also take other action, such as more quantitative easing \u2013 bond-buying \u2013 to stimulate the economy). Yesterday\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI showed factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in more than three years in July, following the Brexit vote. The uncertainty created by the referendum hit domestic orders while the weaker pound drove up the cost of imported materials for manufacturers. French and Chinese data also disappointed, while Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector is growing again. Today, we are getting the latest snaspshot on how Britain\u2019s construction sector performed in July. It is not expected to have fared any better than manufacturing, with another slide in activity likely. The construction PMI is out at 9.30am BST. Hong Kong markets have shut after typhoon Nida swept through the city with gale-force winds. More than 150 flights have been cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at the airport. The Australian dollar fell sharply on the rate cut announcement, but later recovered. The Australian stock market rose slightly before falling back 0.7%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed down 1.5%.",

However as the UK is currently around two and a half years from departing the European community, the BoE has time on its side: half a year of pondering the implications of Brexit, and then two years of full membership to consider post-Brexit...</p> <p>[At the moment] we have a healthy economy, operating at near full capacity, that is about to be given a shot in the arm from a fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate perspective. On the negative side, the UK economy is going to experience some potential slowdown in two and a half years\u2019 time, as barriers to trade with our neighbours are likely to be implemented. With some associated falls in potential capital expenditure and consumer confidence before this.</p> <p>The tailwinds look capable of more than matching the headwinds over the next two years. Indeed, if you are a business and have any spare capacity that needs to be used ahead of the Brexit deadline (for example a UK based car manufacturer), the logic should be to produce at full speed before the trade barriers are increased, especially given the fall in sterling. It looks like UK exporters are in a great position until the spring of 2019.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41770a596d0b6978b17c11b8155b0d849944a57a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41770a596d0b6978b17c11b8155b0d849944a57a/0_26_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England will unveil its latest rate decision on Thursday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England will unveil its latest rate decision on Thursday</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>The BoE\u2019s own forecasts pre-Brexit show inflation returning to or above target over the next couple of years. The problem the BoE now faces is that the benefits of Brexit (looser fiscal policy, looser monetary policy, and the lower exchange rate) will occur well before the potential headwinds in 2019. The monetary authorities like to work in a counter cyclical fashion, however the economic damage that could occur from the decision to leave could well be delayed.</p> <p>In fact acting aggressively early could well result in a mini boom, which will make the eventual delayed event of Brexit appear even more severe. For these reasons, the BoE should not be too aggressive in easing monetary policy on Thursday.</p> <p>The chances of a recession and deflation in 2019 will depend on how the UK economy adjusts to its new role in the world. Or just maybe, in two and a half years\u2019 time market mechanisms such as the exchange rate and the fact the UK has had time to prepare for leaving the EU will mean the market will be focused on new issues and not an event that could seem like a distant memory.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full comment is <strong><a href=\"https://www.bondvigilantes.com/blog/2016/08/02/prexit-brexit-boe-delay-change-monetary-policy/?source=twitter#\">here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-02T14:40:55.681Z\">at 3.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57a0ab1ee4b04a702984e431\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-02T14:16:35.301Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US car sales for July have come in below expectations so far:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/760473966565818369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">US Auto Sales (Jul):<br>\u2022 Ford -3.0% v -0.5% exp<br>\u2022 GM -1.9% v -1.0% exp<br>\u2022 Chrysler +0.3% v +1.9% exp<br>\u2022 Nissan +1.2% v +3.0% exp</p>&mdash; Sigma Squawk (@SigmaSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SigmaSquawk/status/760473966565818369\">August 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a0a4f0e4b029a322bcf583\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-02T14:06:31.531Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A positive survey from New York, as businesses shrug off any effects of the UK Brexit vote.</p> <p>The ISM New York business activity index came in at 60.7 in July, up from 45.4 in the previous month.

Nor is some expected easing of fiscal policy, given lags in implementation and uncertainty about its scope and timing.</p> <p>The market anticipates at least a quarter point cut in the base rate, but an expansion of asset purchases and a \u2018bias to ease\u2019 would not be surprises.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, believes the Bank of England would do well to hold fire on a rate cut:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Act in haste, repent at leisure, these are words the Bank of England MPC would do well to consider this week when they are widely expected to meet and move on interest rates for the first time in 87 months, only rather than raising them as was expected to be the case two years ago, expectations are pretty much nailed on that we could well see a 0.25% cut to the headline rate and potentially an announcement of more asset purchases.</p> <p>That the market is pricing this in as a 100% certainty is largely as a result of the expectations that have been built up in the aftermath of June\u2019s historic Brexit vote.</p> <p>In essence the central bank has boxed itself into a corner, and despite recent data should really be asking itself whether it would be wise to act at all this week...</p> <p>Quite frankly it remains far too early to establish what damage has been done to the UK economy as a result of recent uncertainty irrespective of what recent PMI and confidence data tells us. Proponents of stimulus this week will no doubt argue that this week\u2019s awful manufacturing and construction numbers mean that the bank has to act, but just because we\u2019ve seen a knee jerk plunge in consumer and business confidence doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll continue to head lower.</p> <p>As it is with rates already at record lows it is not immediately apparent what a further rate cut now would achieve, apart from reinforce the negativity surrounding the UK economy, which in turn could see any further measures backfire.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s Q2 GDP numbers show that the UK economy potentially has more scope to adopt a \u201cwait and see\u201d policy with respect to further measures given interest rates are already at record lows, and credit is freely available.</p> <p>If the new government sees fit to wait until its autumn statement to deliver new fiscal measures, surely it makes sense for the Bank of England to also wait to see what new Chancellor Philip Hammond delivers later this year and supplement policy that way.</p> <p>Acting now in the absence of hard data runs the risk of the market tail wagging the policy maker\u2019s dog, and could see any further action backfire in the same way the Bank of Japan\u2019s recent policy measures backfired.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a094d6e4b04a702984e3af\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-02T13:14:47.611Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil bounces back, but concerns over glut remain</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oil prices have bounced back, after WTI crude in the US fell below $40 a barrel earlier today \u2013 but concerns about oversupply remain, and could push prices lower again soon.</p> <p>Brent crude, the global benchmark, is up 75 cents at $42.89 a barrel, a 1.8% gain on the day.

As a well-respected former MPC member, Barker\u2019s views are noteworthy at a time when the BoE faces a big decision. We do not find Barker\u2019s argument wholly persuasive, however. The BOE is well positioned to provide at least some timely support during what increasingly appears to be a material demand shock.</p> <p>Barker\u2019s argument is not about the appropriate timing of monetary easing, the need for a policy response or even the prospect of a rise in inflation. Instead, she argues that lower rates would be costly - through adversely affecting bank profits and inducing savers to cut spending - and ineffective, as easier policy would not resolve the uncertainty at the heart of the demand slowdown and would raise import prices through further weakening the currency.</p> <p>Bank deposit rates are still positive, which will help to cushion the adverse impact on profits. The BoE also has the option of offering banks cheaper funding to reduce the burden on savers. While Barker argues that half of mortgages are fixed rate products, this means there are half that are not. Few doubted that higher rates would have affected spending through this mechanism. It is also hard to square a view that there would be \u201clittle impact on the mortgage market\u201d with the simultaneous concern that easier monetary policy would threaten longer term economic stability by \u201cencouraging borrowing against inflated asset prices\u201d.</p> <p>It is clear that easier monetary policy does not remove Brexit uncertainty. But it is not supposed to. Rather, looser monetary policy can help to limit the extent of demand weakness and leave the economy in a better position in the future. Indeed, more policy action now might reduce the need for further action in the future. And any subsidy the BoE offers banks could then be removed more quickly. A lower policy rate right now might also be a necessary response to further declines in the global risk-free interest rate. This partly determines where the BoE\u2019s current equilibrium policy rate is, which the MPC has no control over. Failing to ease in this environment \u2013 especially given expectations for the BoE to do so \u2013 would amount to a de facto tightening in monetary policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Monks added that there is no doubt that fiscal policy would be a more effective response for the UK \u2013 as Barker argues. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But the BoE sets policy on the basis of current government policy and has been criticised in the past for expressing explicit views on fiscal policy. It will take at least a few months for a change in fiscal policy to be announced, let alone to start affecting demand. The BoE has the ability to offer some support upfront before handing over the baton to fiscal policy.</p> <p>Indeed, if fiscal policy is altered significantly, as the BoE may be anticipating, the MPC would be free in the future to reverse any temporary monetary stimulus package it implements this week. It is ironic that while some on the monetary side of the fence are arguing for a fiscal response, one of the first statements the new UK Chancellor made on appointment was that \u201cthe initial response to this kind of a [Brexit] shock must be a monetary response delivered by the Bank of England\u201d. Both policymakers should stop dithering and support a slowing economy, in our view.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57a07856e4b04a702984e32c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-02T10:47:56.735Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone bond yields rising</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bond yields in the eurozone are rising along with those in Japan, a sign of investor concerns about Tokyo\u2019s apparent shift from monetary easing towards fiscal stimulus. </p> <p>As the Japanese government approved 13.5tn yen ($132bn) in fiscal measures, markets fretted that this could mean that the Bank of Japan eases its aggressive bond buying programme.

      "bodyText": "It was a stern message David Cameron took with him on his visit to the Caribbean last September: \u201cIf we\u2019re to beat corruption, we need transparency.\u201d And some in the region \u2013 he did not name them \u2013 could do better. \u201cIf we want to break the business model of people stealing money and hiding it in places where it can\u2019t be seen: transparency is the answer.\u201d Just two weeks earlier, US tax investigators had revealed a major investigation into suspected evasion by customers of a group of companies in nearby Belize, one of the region\u2019s most notorious secrecy havens. Officials told a court in Florida they believed it \u201cvery likely\u201d that the companies under scrutiny \u2013 including Belize Bank International (BBI) and Belize Corporate Services (BCS) \u2013 had been used by US citizens to hide assets and evade tax over a period possibly stretching back as far as 2006. What makes this ongoing investigation awkward for the UK government is that these companies are owned by Lord Ashcroft, former deputy chair of the Conservative party. As one of the party\u2019s most generous donors, he did more than anyone to bankroll David Cameron\u2019s path to Downing Street in 2010. Five years earlier, he also injected funds into Theresa May\u2019s election campaign when she was seen as being at risk of losing her Maidenhead seat. There is no allegation that any of Ashcroft\u2019s businesses evaded tax or knowingly helped others to do so. Nevertheless, US investigators have a thick file of past cases involving criminals, tax dodgers and their advisers, all of whom are said to have used Ashcroft\u2019s Belizean companies to hide assets and dodge tax. Many of the services offered by BBI and BCS, investigators say, may have appealed to those looking to hide assets. In its promotional brochure, for example, BBI advertises offshore banking for international customers, stressing \u201cpremier discretion, privacy and simplicity\u201d. The bank also offers services in conjunction with BCS, a sister company specialising in setting up and administering offshore companies. Investigators suspect tax evaders have been using BCS to set up companies to mask their ownership of bank accounts with BBI. Services offered by BCS \u2013 which boasted of more than 16,400 offshore companies under its management \u2013 include virtual offices, nominee directors, company secretary services, mail-forwarding and remote access. All of these, US tax officials argue, are attractive to tax evaders. On the homepage of its website, BCS previously listed six advantages of Belizean offshore companies, including \u201casset protection\u201d, \u201ctax minimisation\u201d and \u201cbank accounts and investments outside of an individual\u2019s name\u201d. Elsewhere, under FAQs, the website explains: \u201cConfidentiality is one of the many attributes of a Belize [offshore company]. No information pertaining to the identity of directors and shareholders is filed in any public register in Belize.\u201d A spokesman for Ashcroft told the Guardian it was not appropriate to put questions to him about his Belizean group of companies because he has not been involved as a director for many years. He stood down as a director of the group\u2019s holding company, Caribbean Investment Holdings (CIH), in 2011. CIH is listed on the London stock exchange but Ashcroft retains a stake of 75%. A spokesman for CIH noted there were no allegations of wrong-doing against the group. Meanwhile, all relevant subsidiaries, including BBI, have said that \u2013 in compliance with US law \u2013 they regularly update American tax authorities on offshore accounts they provide for US citizens. Even though CIH companies do not stand accused of breaking the law, the fact that their name appears at the heart of a major evasion investigation sat uneasily with Cameron\u2019s crusade against corporate secrecy in offshore tax havens. The US investigation has led to BBI and BCS being placed on a blacklist by American tax authorities. This list has 97 entries and includes many Swiss banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse. It names those firms either under investigation, cooperating with investigations or whose customers are under investigation. Inclusion on the blacklist means US tax evaders wishing to own up to hidden assets and accept a fine now face much higher penalties if they use BBI or BCS to conceal their wealth. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, may also be embarrassed about a money trail from Belize to the Tory party. Around \u00a35.4m of donations linked to Ashcroft have entered party coffers from a UK consultancy firm called Bearwood Corporate Services over many years. Some of the cash was directly targeted at ensuring the re-election of May, who Ashcroft had identified in secret polling as one of the most vulnerable Tory MPs. And where did Bearwood\u2019s money come from? Between 2006 and 2011, it received \u00a31.64m in fees from CIH companies. Relations with Ashcroft soured in Cameron\u2019s latter years at No 10 Downing Street. The peer resigned from the House of Lords last year, citing other commitments and his bitterness was laid bare last October when he co-authored a biography of the prime minister that attracted attention for its salacious \u2013 and uncorroborated \u2013 retelling of alleged high jinks during Cameron\u2019s student days. May, meanwhile, has remained on better terms with Ashcroft, reportedly making sure to attend his lavish 70th birthday celebrations last March. Ashcroft, who backed Brexit, remains an influential figure in Tory politics through his polling operations and ownership of the website ConservativeHome. If there were ever any doubts how he viewed the recent seismic political changes, it ended with a tweet last month. \u201cCongratulations to the team at @ConHome (and its proprietor!!) for supporting Brexit and then immediately backing Theresa May ...\u201d",

      "body": "<p> It was a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-to-the-jamaican-parliament\">stern message David Cameron took with him</a> on his visit to the Caribbean last September: \u201cIf we\u2019re to beat corruption, we need transparency.\u201d And some in the region \u2013 he did not name them \u2013 could do better.</p> <p> \u201cIf we want to break the business model of people stealing money and hiding it in places where it can\u2019t be seen: transparency is the answer.\u201d</p> <p> Just two weeks earlier, US tax investigators had <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/court-authorizes-irs-issue-summonses-discover-us-taxpayers-offshore-bank-accounts-belize-ba-0\">revealed a major </a>investigation into suspected evasion by customers of a group of companies in nearby Belize, one of the region\u2019s most notorious secrecy havens.</p> <p> Officials <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/772096/download\">told a court in Florida they believed it \u201cvery likely\u201d</a> that the companies under scrutiny \u2013 including Belize Bank International (BBI) and Belize Corporate Services (BCS) \u2013 had been used by US citizens to hide assets and evade tax over a period possibly stretching back as far as 2006.</p> <p> What makes this ongoing investigation awkward for the UK government is that these companies are owned by Lord Ashcroft, former deputy chair of the Conservative party. As one of the party\u2019s most generous donors, he did more than anyone to bankroll David Cameron\u2019s path to Downing Street in 2010. Five years earlier, he also injected funds into Theresa May\u2019s election campaign when she was seen as being at risk of losing her Maidenhead seat. </p> <p> There is no allegation that any of Ashcroft\u2019s businesses evaded tax or knowingly helped others to do so. Nevertheless, US investigators have a thick file of past cases involving criminals, tax dodgers and their advisers, all of whom are said to have used Ashcroft\u2019s Belizean companies to hide assets and dodge tax. </p> <p> Many of the services offered by BBI and BCS, investigators say, may have appealed to those looking to hide assets. In its promotional brochure, for example, BBI advertises offshore banking for international customers, stressing \u201cpremier discretion, privacy and simplicity\u201d. </p> <p> The bank also offers services in conjunction with BCS, a sister company specialising in setting up and administering offshore companies. Investigators suspect tax evaders have been using BCS to set up companies to mask their ownership of bank accounts with BBI. </p> <p> Services offered by BCS \u2013 which boasted of more than 16,400 offshore companies under its management \u2013 include virtual offices, nominee directors, company secretary services, mail-forwarding and remote access. All of these, US tax officials argue, are attractive to tax evaders.</p> <p> On the homepage of its website, BCS previously listed <a href=\"file:///web.archive.org:web:20080615135510:http/::www.belizecompanies.com:\">six advantages of Belizean offshore companies</a>, including \u201casset protection\u201d, \u201ctax minimisation\u201d and \u201cbank accounts and investments outside of an individual\u2019s name\u201d.</p> <p> Elsewhere, under <a href=\"http://www.belizecompanies.com/?page_id=61\">FAQs</a>, the website explains: \u201cConfidentiality is one of the many attributes of a Belize [offshore company]. No information pertaining to the identity of directors and shareholders is filed in any public register in Belize.\u201d </p> <p> A spokesman for Ashcroft told the Guardian it was not appropriate to put questions to him about his Belizean group of companies because he has not been involved as a director for many years. </p> <p> He stood down as a director of the group\u2019s holding company, <a href=\"http://www.cihltd.co/\">Caribbean Investment Holdings</a> (CIH), in 2011. CIH is listed on the London stock exchange but Ashcroft retains a stake of 75%. </p> <p> A spokesman for CIH noted there were no allegations of wrong-doing against the group. Meanwhile, all relevant subsidiaries, including BBI, have said that \u2013 in compliance with US law \u2013 they regularly update American tax authorities on offshore accounts they provide for US citizens.</p> <p> Even though CIH companies do not stand accused of breaking the law, the fact that their name appears at the heart of a major evasion investigation sat uneasily with Cameron\u2019s crusade against corporate secrecy in offshore tax havens.</p> <p> The US investigation has led to BBI and BCS being placed on a <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/foreign-financial-institutions-or-facilitators\">blacklist by American tax authorities</a>. This list has 97 entries and includes many Swiss banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse. It names those firms either under investigation, cooperating with investigations or whose customers are under investigation. </p> <p> Inclusion on the blacklist means US tax evaders wishing to own up to hidden assets and accept a fine now face <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/offshore-voluntary-disclosure-program-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers-2012-revised\">much higher penalties</a> if they use BBI or BCS to conceal their wealth. </p> <p>Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, may also be embarrassed about a money trail from Belize to the Tory party. Around \u00a35.4m of donations linked to Ashcroft have entered party coffers from a UK consultancy firm called Bearwood Corporate Services over many years. Some of the cash was directly targeted at ensuring the re-election of May, who Ashcroft had identified in secret polling as one of the most vulnerable Tory MPs. And where did Bearwood\u2019s money come from? Between 2006 and 2011, it received \u00a31.64m in fees from CIH companies.</p> <p> Relations with Ashcroft soured in Cameron\u2019s latter years at No 10 Downing Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebd5360f7c7e62025d62b5965e88b2ac0e01b1f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebd5360f7c7e62025d62b5965e88b2ac0e01b1f7/0_0_1854_2835/654.jpg\" alt=\"Call Me Dave by Lord Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call Me Dave by Lord Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> The peer resigned from the House of Lords last year, citing other commitments and his bitterness was laid bare last October when he co-authored a biography of the prime minister that attracted attention for its salacious \u2013 and uncorroborated \u2013 retelling of alleged high jinks during Cameron\u2019s student days. May, meanwhile, has remained on better terms with Ashcroft, reportedly making sure to attend his lavish 70<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations last March.</p> <p> Ashcroft, who backed Brexit, remains an influential figure in Tory politics through his polling operations and ownership of <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/\">the website ConservativeHome</a>.</p> <p> If there were ever any doubts how he viewed the recent seismic political changes, it ended with a tweet last month. \u201cCongratulations to the team at @ConHome (and its proprietor!!) for supporting Brexit and then immediately backing Theresa May ...\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "An offshore bank owned by Tory donor Lord Ashcroft has closed a large number of customer accounts and faced a wave of withdrawal requests after becoming increasingly caught up in a US tax-evasion crackdown, the Guardian has learned. The value of deposits at Belize Bank International (BBI) shrank by almost three-quarters in the space of just six months, and confidential emails seen by the Guardian suggest some BBI customers have struggled to recover their cash. So stretched is the position that BBI in April told a court in Belize that it could not pay a $3.3m judgment against it without liquid assets falling below the minimum amount required by law. Ashcroft, 70, has a fortune estimated at \u00a31.34bn after decades as an investor and deal-maker in businesses ranging from car auctions to cleaning services and offshore banking. Best known in the UK as the former Conservative party deputy chairman who fell out with David Cameron, the peer co-wrote last year a biography of the former prime minister notable for its allegations of debauched student years. Ashcroft was awarded a peerage in 2000 at the request of the party\u2019s then leader William Hague. It later emerged, however, that a promise he had reportedly given at the time \u2013 to relinquish his controversial tax exile arrangements \u2013 had not been kept for many years. Ashcroft resigned from the House of Lords last year, but remains closely involved in British politics through his polling and publishing businesses. Ashcroft also owns the influential Tory website ConservativeHome, where he writes regularly. Contacted by the Guardian, Ashcroft\u2019s offshore bank BBI denied it was in crisis and said it faced a short-term problem. There is no allegation that BBI evaded tax, or that the bank knowingly helped customers to do so. However, tough US anti-evasion laws have increased compliance costs for BBI\u2019s partners, prompting Bank of America and Commerzbank to terminate relationships with the bank. The departure of these partner banks has in many instances left BBI struggling to maintain basic services for account holders. Adding to BBI\u2019s woes, US tax inspectors revealed last September that they are investigating suspected evasion by some of the bank\u2019s customers. The inquiry comes at an especially unhelpful time for BBI as it attempts to find replacement partner banks. BBI confirmed that \u201ccertain deposits have been returned to customers\u201d, and that the loss of partner banks was \u201can important development\u201d. \u201cBBI is strong and very well-capitalised,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that deposit withdrawals had in fact strengthened the balance sheet. Asked about long delays on withdrawal requests, he said: \u201cThe bank is satisfied that it has fulfilled its obligations with expedition, and has done so effectively.\u201d However, according to documents seen by the Guardian, some customers have had to wait months for their money to be returned. One was told last June that his account was being terminated and that he should provide final wire transfer instructions within eight days. Four months later, BBI told the customer there were still \u201cconsiderable delays\u201d with money transfers because of the loss of partner banks. In March, he was told: \u201cWe are currently unable to complete or execute wire transfers \u2026 You are \u2026 welcome to visit us here in Belize to withdraw the funds in person.\u201d More recently, BBI has suggested a customer could alternatively reapply for a Visa credit card, which he could then use to withdraw funds in batches from a cash machine. Another BBI account-holder to have complained of problems with money transfers was the Belizean arm of Mossack Fonseca, the offshore law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal. The Panama Papers, obtained by S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, were shared through the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) with the Guardian and other media. Leaked emails show Mossack Fonseca sought advice from a local law firm in Belize last August about its BBI bank account. The law firm replied: \u201cBBI is closing all offshore accounts \u2026 It is a shock to us as well especially with the very short time line provided. It is the first time we are experiencing this type of situation \u2026\u201d A spokesman for BBI said only selected accounts had been closed and this was part of a long-planned strategy. \u201cOf its own volition, and in common with many other financial institutions, BBI has been engaged in a de-risking programme for several years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has meant that \u2026 [certain] depositors\u2019 funds have been repaid.\u201d In April, BBI bosses told the supreme court of Belize it had received unprecedented withdrawal requests. Its chairman, Lyndon Guiseppi, explained that, while the bank was financially robust, there was a short-term squeeze on cash meaning it would struggle to pay a $3.3m court judgment. He said: \u201cIf [the bank] has to make payments due under the order this will have serious consequences for the bank, the wider financial sector and the broader economy of Belize.\u201d Such a payment, Guiseppi added, would \u201cstymie the bank\u2019s ability to make payments to depositors, which the bank \u2026 is coming under increasing pressure to do so [sic].\u201d The crisis is blamed on big overseas banks terminating partnership arrangements, known as \u201ccorrespondent banking relationships\u201d, with BBI and other banks in Belize. These relationships provide the means by which Belize\u2019s offshore banks can provide services to its customers around the world. According to credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s, Bank of America and Commerzbank accounted for 80% of correspondent banking services in Belize until late last year. Belize\u2019s prime minister, Dean Barrow, has blamed the exodus of correspondent banks on draconian regulations and unsubstantiated smears from Washington. \u201cCurrent US policy is proving existentially damaging \u2026 to the [Caribbean] sub-region of which Belize is a member,\u201d he has said. \u201cThere are ... continuing statements classifying our jurisdictions as harmful tax havens. This is designed to put our offshore sector out of business. \u201cIt is a kind of damnation by innuendo since no bill of indictment listing any specific instances of violation is ever offered. But the implication that doing business with us is fraught with risk is crippling our jurisdictions.\u201d Ashcroft, Belize and BBI Ashcroft\u2019s bank is one of the oldest in Central America, established in 1902 in what was then British Honduras. For 75 years the bank traded as a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, which \u2013 despite its name \u2013 had extensive operations around the Caribbean. In 1987, the branch was bought by Michael Ashcroft, the son of a British colonial administrator who had attended school in Belize before being sent to boarding school in Norwich. In 1990, in part after advice from Ashcroft, Belize passed laws creating an offshore financial centre. Modelled on legislation in the British Virgin Islands, this was a bold move to attract investment into the country, newly independent but economically weak. At the same time, the government granted Ashcroft\u2019s bank a 30-year special tax break, paving the way for BBI to prosper, catering to customers outside the country. Since then, Ashcroft\u2019s banking and related Belizean interests have become a mainstay of the tiny economy, in particular its financial services. Belize has a population of 350,000, more than 40% of whom live in poverty. Ashcroft, who owns a colonial style home on the Caribbean seafront in Belize City, was made the country\u2019s ambassador to the UN, and in 2000 was knighted by the Queen \u2013 who remains Belize\u2019s head of state \u2013 for services to the local community. While he is well known for his political donations in the UK, Ashcroft has also taken an active interest in Belizean politics, reportedly contributing financially to both main parties. As in the UK, he has on occasion fallen out with some Belizean politicians on specific issues, including the prime minister. Together, Ashcroft\u2019s main Belizean business interests are listed on the London stock exchange as Caribbean Investment Holdings (CIH), though three-quarters of shares remain under Ashcroft\u2019s ownership. In its latest annual report, CIH told investors that at the end of March last year its balance sheet was part-funded by $249m of customer deposits that could be withdrawn on demand. Of that sum, central bank data suggests, $102m was deposited by businesses and individuals with accounts at BBI. Since then, however, BBI deposits have dropped to \u00a331m. BBI does not disclose how many deposit accounts it provides, or where its overseas customers are based. The vast majority of deposits are thought to have been made in US dollars, with a much smaller amount in sterling and lesser sums in euros and Canadian dollars. The CIH annual report, published last September, reassured shareholders that past experience suggested that customer deposits would remain \u201ca long-term and stable source of funding\u201d.",

For 75 years the bank traded as a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, which \u2013 despite its name \u2013 had extensive operations around the Caribbean.</p> <p>In 1987, the branch was bought by Michael Ashcroft, the son of a British colonial administrator who had attended school in Belize before being sent to boarding school in Norwich. In 1990, in part after advice from Ashcroft, Belize passed laws creating an offshore financial centre.</p> <p>Modelled on legislation in the British Virgin Islands, this was a bold move to attract investment into the country, newly independent but economically weak. At the same time, the government granted Ashcroft\u2019s bank a 30-year special tax break, paving the way for BBI to prosper, catering to customers outside the country.</p> <p>Since then, Ashcroft\u2019s banking and related Belizean interests have become a mainstay of the tiny economy, in particular its financial services. Belize has a population of 350,000, more than 40% of whom live in poverty.</p> <p>Ashcroft, who owns a colonial style home on the Caribbean seafront in Belize City, was made the country\u2019s ambassador to the UN, and in 2000 was knighted by the Queen \u2013 who remains Belize\u2019s head of state \u2013 for services to the local community.</p> <p>While he is well known for his political donations in the UK, Ashcroft has also taken an active interest in Belizean politics, reportedly contributing financially to both main parties. As in the UK, he has on occasion fallen out with some Belizean politicians on specific issues, including the prime minister.</p> <p>Together, Ashcroft\u2019s main Belizean business interests are listed on the London stock exchange as Caribbean Investment Holdings (CIH), though three-quarters of shares remain under Ashcroft\u2019s ownership.</p> <p>In its latest annual report, CIH told investors that at the end of March last year its balance sheet was part-funded by $249m of customer deposits that could be withdrawn on demand. Of that sum, central bank data suggests, $102m was deposited by businesses and individuals with accounts at BBI. Since then, however, BBI deposits have dropped to \u00a331m.</p> <p>BBI does not disclose how many deposit accounts it provides, or where its overseas customers are based. The vast majority of deposits are thought to have been made in US dollars, with a much smaller amount in sterling and lesser sums in euros and Canadian dollars.</p> <p>The CIH annual report, published last September, reassured shareholders that past experience suggested that customer deposits would remain \u201ca long-term and stable source of funding\u201d. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The cost of the payment protection insurance scandal, which has already reached \u00a337bn, is likely to escalate after the financial regulator extended its proposed deadline for claims by customers mis-sold policies by more than a year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stunned the industry on Tuesday by proposing a deadline of June 2019, rather than the spring 2018 cutoff it had suggested in October in a move intended to draw a line under the costliest ever misselling scandal. Banks, which had been operating on the basis of the 2018 deadline, are now expected to increase their provisions while consumer experts urged individuals to make claims. According to an estimate by the New City Agenda thinktank, PPI has already cost \u00a337.3bn and the prospect of the rising cost drove bank shares lower. Lloyds Banking Group closed off by 1%, Royal Bank of Scotland was down by 1.7% and Barclays was 3.5% lower. The FCA calculates that \u00a324.2bn has been paid out to 12 million consumers since 2011 \u2013 when the payouts first started \u2013 from more than 50m policies sold since the 1990s. Guy Anker, managing editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: \u201cThe urgent clarion-call to consumers is if you\u2019ve had a loan, credit card or mortgage in the last 10 years you should be checking now whether you had PPI on it and if so, was it mis-sold? Many people are shocked they had PPI when they didn\u2019t think so, as one way it was mis-sold was it was added even though they said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d Most focus was on Lloyds, which already has a bill of \u00a316bn \u2013 the largest of any of the banks. Gary Greenwood, a banks analyst at stockbroker Shore Capital, said the cost for Lloyds could be up to \u00a31bn. \u201cWhether additional provisions are required and how material these may be is uncertain at this stage, and we await further comment from the companies in this respect. However, we would not be surprised to see top-ups of a few hundred million pounds, and perhaps as high as \u00a31bn, for each of the large UK banks, with Lloyds being the worst affected.\u201d Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, suggested \u00a32bn as an estimate of the likely extra cost for the major players due to the FCA\u2019s proposed extension. The regulator\u2019s decision is a blow to the banks, which had hoped for an easier ride after the former chancellor George Osborne ousted the hardline then FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley last year. Andrew Bailey, Wheatley\u2019s successor, took over last month, but has been on the FCA board since 2013. Bailey said: \u201cPutting a deadline on PPI complaints will bring the issue to an orderly conclusion in a way that protects both consumers and market integrity.\u201d Consumer groups remained cautious about the impact of a deadline for claims. Alex Neill, director of policy and campaigns, at Which?, said: \u201cIf a PPI deadline is to be introduced, when millions of pounds are still being set aside for payouts, the FCA must work with banks to ensure that customers who might not know they were mis-sold PPI get back the money they are owed. The process for making a claim must be much more straightforward.\u201d Lloyds said it was disappointed by the extension. \u201cWhile we welcome the clarity provided by today\u2019s update, we are disappointed that the two-year deadline suggested by the regulator won\u2019t commence until June 2017, delaying a prompt to action and therefore potential redress for consumers,\u201d said the bank, which is 9% owned by taxpayers. Lloyds did not increase its provision immediately. It has \u00a32bn of unused provisions and pointed out that complaints had fallen to 7,500 a week, from an average of 8,500 in the first half of 2016. In the past week, the bank said the number of complaints had declined to 6,700, the lowest since 2011, when compensation started being paid out. The banks sold insurance to borrowers from the late 1990s onwards, claiming that it would protect their payments if they fell ill or lost their jobs. But many policies were ineffective, foisted on people who did not need them or were sold them in an underhand manner.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has announced a June 2019 deadline for customers to make claims for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Why is the deadline being imposed? The FCA says imposing a deadline would allow banks to draw a line under the PPI scandal, which has been dragging on for years. Estimates by New City Agenda puts the total bill for handling claims at more than \u00a337bn while the FCA calculates that \u00a324.2bn has been paid out to consumers since 2011, the rest being the cost of tackling claims plus provisions made in anticipation of more payouts. When did the mis-selling of PPI begin? PPI has been sold alongside mortgages, credit cards and other unsecured loans since the 1990s. It was supposed to cover payments on loans if customers fell ill or lost their jobs. In 2004, the Guardian reported how Barclays had been making profits from PPI and other examples quickly followed. It received new prominence in 2005 when Citizens Advice issued a so-called super-complaint to competition watchdogs about what it described as a \u201cprotection racket\u201d, starting a series of events that led to the compensation payments to consumers and sales of some types of PPI being banned. How many customers are affected? The now defunct Financial Services Authority told parliament 53m PPI policies had been sold. Around 45m of those were sold by banks, worth around \u00a344bn. It is not clear how many of these policies were mis-sold \u2013 initial estimates by the FCA were that 3m people were affected \u2013 but by January 2016 12m customers had received compensation, totalling \u00a324.2bn. Selling PPI was very profitable for banks. In its evidence to parliament, the regulator highlighted one PPI policy sold alongside a mortgage which cost the customer \u00a320,838 over the loan term even though the maximum they could reclaim was \u00a331,000, an illustration of the scale of profits involved which led banks to risk mis-selling. Is the deadline the same for all customers? The consumer panel, which represents consumer interests at the FCA, questioned the deadline. In its submission to the FCA about a time bar, it pointed out that 5.5m customers may already face an earlier cut-off. This is because they have already been contacted by their banks and, if they are covered by existing rules, will already have the clock ticking on a three-year time limit for claims. How many more claims do the banks face? Given the cold-calling from claims management companies (CMCs) it might seem improbable that anyone who was mis-sold a policy has not already made a claim. However, according to the the Professional Financial Claims Association (PFCA), only about half of the sums paid out represent refunded payments. The rest is interest, with the banks obliged to pay 8% interest on the money being returned. This suggests an even higher bill for PPI . Guy Anker, managing editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, points out that the Financial Ombudsman is upholding 70% of complaints rejected by banks. \u201cTo go to the ombudsman you have to first complain to the bank, so it\u2019s likely banks are still wrongly rejecting claims from over half of those who have been mis-sold,\u201d said Anker. Are there any new twists? A court ruling in the Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance case also looks likely to add to the PPI bill. The court concluded that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. The case involved Susan Plevin, who found that 72% of the \u00a35,780 premium she paid was commission for the lender and the broker that sold her the loan, with the rest going to the PPI provider, Norwich Union. How much will I get if I claim? That will depend on your circumstances, but the average is \u00a32,000. The BBC has reported one case of a businesswoman from Hertfordshire receiving \u00a365,000 from her credit card company MBNA. Moneysavingexpert has one example of an \u00a382,000 payout to a Barclaycard customer. What is happening to claims now? Lloyds Banking Group, which sold more PPI policies than any other bank, said claims in the last week had reached their lowest weekly level since the highpoint of 2011. It is still receiving 6,700 claims a week \u2013 down from 10,000 per week in the past. Over the past six weeks, PPI complaints fell to 7,500 per week from an average of 8,500 in the first half of 2016. What happens next? The FCA will run a consultation until 11 October before finalising the rules. Consumer experts reckon that CMCs \u2013 which the National Audit Office estimates have received up to \u00a35bn in commission from PPI payments \u2013 will make extra efforts to generate claims for consumers. The banks will also have to agree to spend \u00a340m on an awareness campaign to ensure customers make claims before the deadline. Anker said customers who had previous claims rejected should contact the Ombudsman if they have not already done so. \u201cBanks have been fined for poor complaints handling \u2013 your bank rejection does not mean you weren\u2019t mis-sold.\u201d",

In <a href=\"https://www.fs-cp.org.uk/sites/default/files/fscp_response_rules_and_guidance_on_payment_protection_insurance_complaints.pdf\">its submission to the FCA </a>about a time bar, it pointed out that 5.5m customers may already face an earlier cut-off. This is because they have already been contacted by their banks and, if they are covered by existing rules, will already have the clock ticking on a three-year time limit for claims.</p> <h2><strong>How many more claims do the banks face?</strong></h2> <p>Given the cold-calling from claims management companies (CMCs) it might seem improbable that anyone who was mis-sold a policy has not already made a claim. However, according to the the <a href=\"http://www.pfca.org.uk/\">Professional Financial Claims Association</a> (PFCA), only about half of the sums paid out represent refunded payments. The rest is interest, with the banks obliged to pay 8% interest on the money being returned. This suggests an even higher bill for PPI . </p> <p>Guy Anker, managing editor at MoneySavingExpert.com, points out that the Financial Ombudsman is upholding 70% of complaints rejected by banks. \u201cTo go to the ombudsman you have to first complain to the bank, so it\u2019s likely banks are still wrongly rejecting claims from over half of those who have been mis-sold,\u201d said Anker.</p> <h2><strong>Are there any new twists?</strong></h2> <p>A court ruling in the <a href=\"http://ukscblog.com/new-judgment-plevin-respondent-v-paragon-personal-finance-limited-appellant-2014-uksc-61/\">Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance</a> case also looks likely to add to the PPI bill. The court concluded that if a PPI seller failed to disclose to a customer that it had received a large commission from the product provider, the sale was unfair under the 1974 Consumer Credit Act. The case involved Susan Plevin, who found that 72% of the \u00a35,780 premium she paid was commission for the lender and the broker that sold her the loan, with the rest going to the PPI provider, Norwich Union.</p> <h2><strong>How much will I get if I claim?</strong></h2> <p>That will depend on your circumstances, but the average is \u00a32,000. The BBC has reported one case <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18554478\">of a businesswoman from Hertfordshire receiving \u00a365,000 from her credit card company MBNA</a>. Moneysavingexpert has one example of an \u00a382,000 payout to a Barclaycard customer.</p> <h2><strong>What is happening to claims now?</strong></h2> <p>Lloyds Banking Group, which sold more PPI policies than any other bank, said claims in the last week had reached their lowest weekly level since the highpoint of 2011. It is still receiving 6,700 claims a week \u2013 down from 10,000 per week in the past. Over the past six weeks, PPI complaints fell to 7,500 per week from an average of 8,500 in the first half of 2016. </p> <h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2> <p> The FCA will run a consultation until 11 October before finalising the rules. Consumer experts reckon that CMCs \u2013 which the National Audit Office estimates have received up to \u00a35bn in commission from PPI payments \u2013 will make extra efforts to generate claims for consumers. The banks will also have to agree to spend \u00a340m on an awareness campaign to ensure customers make claims before the deadline.</p> <p>Anker said customers who had previous claims rejected should contact the Ombudsman if they have not already done so. \u201cBanks have been fined for poor complaints handling \u2013 your bank rejection does not mean you weren\u2019t mis-sold.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe has unveiled a new multi-trillion yen programme of higher spending on welfare and infrastructure in the latest attempt to steer the country\u2019s struggling economy away from deflation. Tokyo announced a package of largely unspecified tax and spending measures designed to boost activity at a time when exports have been hit by the rising yen and Brexit has dented business confidence. Abe said: \u201cWe compiled today a strong economic package draft aimed at carrying out investment for the future. \u201cWith this package, we\u2019ll proceed to not just stimulate demand but also achieve sustainable economic growth led by private demand.\u201d But the package has failed to impress financial markets, which said the additional boost to demand would be much smaller than the 28tn yen (\u00a3207bn) announced by Abe. Analysts said the additional government spending would be 6tn yen (\u00a344bn), only three-quarters of which would be spent in the current fiscal year. Yields on Japanese bonds rose after Abe announced details of his fiscal plan because investors were fearful that it marked a change of policy in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan has been using aggressive monetary policy \u2013 including negative interest rates and large tranches of quantitative easing \u2013 as the main weapon in its fight against deflation, but Abe\u2019s fiscal package was seen as a sign that monetary policy has lost its potency. The measures include 2.5tn yen for welfare, including help for poor pensioners and childcare subsidies, 1.7tn yen on infrastructure and 0.6tn yen for small and medium sized companies adversely affected by the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The Bank of Japan surprised financial markets last week when it failed to buy more bonds under its QE programme and added to nervousness by saying it would re-evaluate policy in September. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda declined to comment on the upward move in yields (the interest rate) on Japanese government bonds, JGBs, but said the planned review would not lead the Bank of Japan to weaken its stimulus. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would happen,\u201d Kuroda told reporters, when asked whether the promised \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d might lead to reduced stimulus. Abe announced a three-arrow strategy in 2012 designed to reinvigorate Japan\u2019s economy after a prolonged period of slow growth and sporadic deflation during the previous two decades. Monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reform were intended to work alongside each other, but the Bank of Japan has carried most of the burden of boosting growth over the past four years.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are slipping back following recent disappointing economic data - the latest being poor construction figures - and continuing weakness in the oil price. But Direct Line and InterContinental Hotels have bucked the downward trend after their latest updates. Insurer Direct Line has jumped 8% to 383.8p as first half profits fell 5% to \u00a3316.9m after lower investment gains and a new levy to cut insurance costs for homes in flood-risk areas. But the figure was more than 20% than consensus forecasts, and the company also said it would pay a special dividend of 10p a share on top of its interim payout of 4.9p a share. Peel Hunt analyst Andreas van Embden said: Direct Line surprised with an increase in reserve releases, a large part of which is one-off but provides strong support to solvency and the dividend. The solvency ratio was a healthy 184%, well above the usual 150% level following the approval of its partial internal model. This has allowed the company to offer an interim special dividend of 10p on top of the basic dividend per share. After a weak share price performance, these results will go down well and whilst guidance is unchanged, 2016 underwriting results should come in at the top end of the range. At a PE of 14 times, the shares are fairly valued but offer a \u2018best in class\u2019 dividend yield (around 7%). UBS analysts said: A 20% pretax profit beat, an interim special well ahead of expectations, strong capital position, improved outlook, should be taken well, albeit the shares are not cheap on 1.9 times 2016 estimated total net asset value (top end of its historical range). Direct Line is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, and not far behind is rival Admiral which has added 50p to \u00a321.99. Meanwhile InterContinental Hotels is up 95p at \u00a331.09 after faster growth in its global room revenue in the second quarter. Revenue per available room rose 2.5% in the three months to June compared with a 1.5% increase in the first quarter. Operating profit rose 2% to $344m. Chief executive Richard Solomons said: The fundamentals for our industry, and particularly for IHG as one of the largest branded players, remain compelling...Despite the uncertain environment in some markets, we remain confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year. Numis analysts said: Underlying earnings before interest and tax of $344m represented growth of 10% and was marginally ahead of consensus expectations of around $331m (Bloomberg). The key drivers were RevPAR growth of 2.0% and net system growth of 3.6%, consistent with medium term guidance. Following the return of $1.5bn to shareholders, net debt of $1.8bn was as expected and represents leverage of 2.3 times EBITDA. Group RevPAR grew by 2.5% in the second quarter of 2016, faster than +1.5% in the first quarter, and more comparable to 2.4% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Part of the improvement reflected an earlier Easter. Also weakness in oil producing states in the US is starting to annualise: RevPAR in oil producing states fell by 6.3% and the remainder grew +3.7%. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 31.98 points to 6661.97 ahead of this week\u2019s Bank of England rate decision, with growing anticipation of a cut, and despite a new Japanese stimulus package to try and boost its economy. With gold and silver prices edging up as investors look for less risky asset, Mexican precious metal miner Fresnillo is up 60p at \u00a319.83 - helped by a positive update - and Randgold Resources has risen 175p to \u00a390.85. Consumer goods groups were also in demand, with Unilever up 45.5p at 3579.5p and Reckitt Benckiser 80p better at \u00a374.31. But valve control specialist Rotork has slumped nearly 10% to 193.4p. Its profits were in line with expectations but it warned that low oil prices would continue to affect its performance.",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m closing the blog now but there is plenty of food for thought from the RBA decision, not least Australia\u2019s ability or otherwise to resist global economic trends. Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, has made a very good point about this in a note this afternoon, suggesting that super-low rates may become the norm: While central banks in other parts of the world have been forced to reduce rates to near zero, Australia has never been in that position. But these are extraordinary times with technology, \u201cdisruption\u201d and an environment of conservatism driving global inflation rates lower. The Reserve Bank may be uncomfortable with interest rates at current super-low levels, but these are unusual times. It may end up that interest rates of 1-2 per cent become the norm rather than the exception. With inflation low and likely to remain low, the Reserve Bank can attempt to run the economy at a faster rate by cutting interest rates. The aim is to boost spending, employment and investment with the stronger demand lifting the inflation rate back into the 2-3% target band. But there are no guarantees that lower rates will indeed boost economic growth and inflation. That doesn\u2019t mean that you give up trying. Central banks need to do everything in their power to stimulate growth and prevent super-low inflation rates being sustained. And certainly do everything to prevent deflation (falling prices) from taking hold. That seems a suitably apt point at which to call it a day. You can read a full story on the day\u2019s dramatic developments here. Thanks for reading: A dramatic day for the markets in Australia. Here\u2019s a a summary of the main points: The RBA has cut the cash rate to 1.5% from 1.75%, a new record low Governor Glenn Stevens said low inflation meant the board had to act The risk of a housing market bubble had \u201cdiminished\u201d, giving further justification for a cut The Aussie dollar fell sharply to US75.06c but quickly recovered the losses ASX/S&amp;P200 fared worse, rising slightly before dropping 0.7% in volatile trade Commonwealth Bank has passed 0.13% of the cut on to borrowers 10-year bond yields have fallen to a record low of 1.83% Chris Weston at IG reckons the RBA has \u201cthrown caution to the wind\u201d with its analysis of the housing market. Basically, Chris argues, the policy makers don\u2019t think lower rates are going to make any difference to the house prices any more: The Reserve Bank have effectively thrown caution to the wind, respecting their mandate for price stability, amid diminishing negative effects from lower interest rates. One noticeable issue here is the lack of concern lower rates are likely to have on the housing market, with even a hint of concern around the apartment market. It seems we may have reached an inflection point where the consumer is just not enthused about where borrowing rates are and this is something incoming RBA governor Philip Lowe has been arguing in recent times. More reaction flooding in. David Bassanese of BetaShares reckons it\u2019s basically good news. This is his view: The Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to cut interest today was in line with my long-hold expectation that the cash rate would fall to 1.5%. The good news for the economy, however, is that it has been much lower-than-expected inflation \u2013 rather than weaker-than-expected economic growth \u2013 that drove the RBA\u2019s latest decision. And more tweets: My colleague in the Canberra bureau, Gareth Hutchens, has this observation about the RBA statement and what it says about the housing market: The Reserve Bank believes the risk of exacerbating problems in the housing market with further interest rate cuts has diminished. It lists a number of reasons why: Supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards, and a number of lenders are taking \u201ca more cautious attitude\u201d to lending in certain segments. Growth in lending for housing purposes has slowed a little this year. The most recent information suggests that dwelling prices have been rising \u201conly moderately\u201d this year, with \u201cconsiderable\u201d supply of apartments scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. All this suggests that \u201cthe likelihood of lower interest rates exacerbating risks in the housing market has diminished\u201d, it says. The biggest bank has already moved to pass on some of the rate cut to borrowers. Standard variable mortgage holders will pay 0.13% less to take their borrowing costs to 5.22%. That\u2019s still a fairly hefty margin for the banks though - consumer groups might hve something to say about that decision. ASX/S&amp;P200 has bounced back after the RBA announcement. It climbed 30 points to nearly 5575 points but has dipped slightly again in the last few minutes as traders digest the implications of what looks like sustained low interest rates for Australia. Australian bond yields \u2013 the cost of borrowing for the government \u2013 have extended their falls after the announcement. Over to you Scott Morrison to get the cheque book out and get that new infrastructure built? Lots of reaction: The statement by the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens, is interesting in how little it varies from the statement made last month, when there was no change to rates. For example last month he said of the Australian economy: In Australia, recent data suggest overall growth is continuing, despite a very large decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators have been more mixed of late, but are consistent with a modest pace of expansion in employment in the near term. This month he says: In Australia, recent data suggest that overall growth is continuing at a moderate pace, despite a very large decline in business investment. Other areas of domestic demand, as well as exports, have been expanding at a pace at or above trend. Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed, but are consistent with a modest pace of expansion in employment in the near term\u201d. Almost no change in wording at all. So why cut rates this month and not last month? It would appear they were waiting for the inflation numbers, and when they came out low, the decision was made for them. Recent data confirm that inflation remains quite low. Given very subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world, this is expected to remain the case for some time. The dollar is pushing below US75c. But as Greg pointed earlier in the blog, it might not last. The cash rate is now an all-time low of 1.5%. Nearly there ... just a few minutes to go before the announcement in what is also a big day for the markets in Japan. Prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to give details on his 28 trillion yen fiscal stimulus package today (that\u2019s around US$266bn). The Nikkei is down around 0.7% as investors await the details but there\u2019s also pressure on stocks from the falling price of crude oil. Overnight it entered a bear market down below $40 \u2013 a fall of a fifth since June. But if we had a live reporter we\u2019d now be saying \u201cover to Martin Place now ...\u201d But another rate cut would encourage investment in the housing market at a time when many would suggest it doesn\u2019t need any more encouraging \u2013 because a housing glut is on the way. While the latest building approvals figures did show a fall, the reality is we are still building a lot of houses and apartments \u2013 yes down from the record levels a year ago, but still historically very high: And one of the problems with this is that the major increase in apartments and other non-house dwelling in Melbourne and Sydney is that there is a very great deal of apartments that have been approved to be built but which have yet to start construction: There certainly is no great need to encourage investors to build dwellings, the worry is that too many are already being built and are planned to be built. One area this has an impact is rental prices. Rental prices around the nation are growing more slowly than they have for many years: Again this is unlikely because people are reducing their demand for renting, but more an indicator of the overall weak inflation growth and the increase in supply. The RBA may be worried that another cut might just exacerbate this, and eventually see an oversupply of apartments leading to a collapse in the prices, which would cascade on housing prices overall. The question perhaps, given how likely it is that a rate cut will happen, isn\u2019t if the RBA will cut rates, but whether they should. If inflation is a symptom of strong competition and weak work prices, then a rate cut is not going to do much to improve it. That\u2019s not to say a rate cut won\u2019t have an impact. Having less to pay each month in your mortgage does give people an incentive to spend more money. More spending = more turnover = more jobs = more growth in the economy. At least that\u2019s the theory. Given the low rates it could also see people needing to invest more to get the same return. It also might not really have an impact in the area of housing. Are there that many people holding out on buying a house because 5.4% isn\u2019t low enough? The latest building approvals figures out today showed a continued slowing of private sector approvals: The slowing is occurring in most states \u2013 except South Australia where things are going pretty strong: It is unlikely another rate cut would set off another housing boom, especially since housing prices have increased by 31% since December 2011, whereas wages have grown just 11% in that time: The impact of inflation on mortgage rates is also of course a factor as well. While mortgage rates are at record lows, because inflation growth is also scraping along the bottom, that means the real rate of your mortgage is not at a record low: It is lower than it was during the housing boom year before the GFC, but paying 3.7% above inflation on your mortgage is not stunningly low. And because term deposits are at record lows in real terms this means that the gap between what the banks charge to lend you money and what they pay to obtain your money (term deposits are in effect you lending money to the bank) is wider than it has been for over a decade: Basically, since August 2013, the banks have cuts term deposit rates by more than they have mortgages. What about for savers? The cash rate also affects the interest rates banks give you for holding your money. And not surprisingly, because the cash rate is at record lows, so too are the rates for term deposits \u2013 just 2.5% return for the \u201cspecial average rate\u201d: What this mean in real terms is that investors are getting less than a 1% return above inflation: Long gone are the glory days where self-funded retirees could invest in essentially risk-free term deposits and get a real return of above 2%. So what would a rate cut mean in the real world? Well currently the average variable mortgage rate is 5.40% \u2013 the lowest since July 1968 (top of the charts at the time in Australia was the Seekers\u2019 Greatest Hits). The discount rate of 4.60% is lower than any rates we have on record: But rather interestingly banks might not pass on the full cut should the RBA cut the cash rate. The gap between the average mortgage rate and the cash rate is now larger than ever: So while a full 25 basis points cut would reduce the fortnightly payments of a $300,000 loan at 30 years from $777.13 to $755.65, don\u2019t spend that extra $21.50 a fortnight just yet. A little bit more reaction on today\u2019s poor data on the Australian economy. Building approvals and trade figures were both disappointing on the downside for the market. Here\u2019s CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian A weaker set of economic results. A modest slide in the number of dwelling approvals, and a substantial rise in the trade deficit. The only positives to be taken out of the data related to the rise in the value of building approvals. Overall there is nothing in the data to stop the Reserve Bank from cutting interest rates if they deem it necessary. As ever the situation of Australia\u2019s exchange rate will be a factor. Cutting the cash rate should \u2013 all other things being equal \u2013 lead to the value of our dollar falling. This makes our exports cheaper and our imports more expensive. But all other things, alas, are never equal. When the RBA cut the cash rate in May, the value of our dollar was US$0.75. It fell for a bit and then rose again and now sits at ... US$0.75: And while the price of our imports is a factor in our low inflation figures, the reality is inflation is just low everywhere. While the prices of tradables were flat in the past year, the prices of non-tradable items grew at near record lows of just 1.6%: One further argument in favour of the position that the supply side/strong competition is driving low inflation rather than weak demand is that the growth of prices is weak both internationally and domestically. In the past 12 months the price of those \u201ctradable\u201d goods and services which have prices driven mostly on the international market \u2013 eg petrol, most foods, furniture and personal products, audio/visual equipment, motor cars and international holidays \u2013 grew not at all. There\u2019s not much the RBA can do about the price of wheat, oil or Ikea furniture. And weak prices overseas may be due to weak demand throughout the world for products, but that low price really doesn\u2019t reflect the strength of demand in Australia. Petrol prices in the past year dropped 11% and they are now back to 2009 levels: The RBA cutting rates won\u2019t do anything to increase petrol prices \u2013 and petrol alone accounts for 3.55% of the CPI index. There is some conjecture that the low inflation rate is not so much an indicator of weak demand in the economy, but strong competition on the supply side. Certainly when you look at the growth of food prices this aspect comes into play: In the past 12 months the average prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 0.1%. Now clearly that\u2019s not because people have reduced their demand for food and drink. An excellent example of this is milk. It was just a given that the price of milk would go up at along the same pace as overall inflation until Coles and Woolworths embarked on their milk price war, which now sees milk costing the same as it did a decade ago, despite overall inflation being nearly 30% higher than then: But even when we exclude food and beverages (which accounts for 16% of CPI), inflation remains very low: One thing the expectation for a rate cut shows us is how changed the outlook for the economy has become over the past two years. In August 2014, the cash rate was at 2.5% and the market was expecting it to mostly stay there. Instead within a year it was cut twice to 2%. In August last year the market though there would be a cut by now to 1.75% - so they got that right. But they expected by the end of this year things to be improving: The story of the past two years is the market thinking inflation and economic growth will return to some sort of normality, and then later revising those expectations down. Here\u2019s hoping in a year\u2019s time we are not still seeing this trend. The big reason most expect a rate cut is that the latest inflation figures out last week showed the CPI growing annual at just 1%. The two RBA \u201cunderlying\u201d or \u201ccore\u201d inflation measures were also calculated to be growing at just 1.7% for the trimmed mean and 1.3% for the weighted median \u2013 both record lows and all three measures, are well below the RBA\u2019s target band of 2% to 3%: Now just because inflation is outside the target band does not mean the RBA will necessarily act. That band is the aim over the cycle \u2013 so they don\u2019t mind if it occasionally drops below or goes above. But underlying inflation has now been below 2% since September last year, and actual CPI hasn\u2019t been above 2% since September 2014. It is unlikely the RBA would not look to raise rate were the situation reversed and inflation was running over 3% for nearly two years. So if they don\u2019t cut, it might be a sign that the RBA either doesn\u2019t care too much about low inflation, that it\u2019s real inflation band is more 1.5% to 3%, or that it doesn\u2019t think a rate cut will do anything. Over to Greg then... With a week to go before the Rio Olympics, forget wondering whether records will be broken. For that we need only look to Martin Place in Sydney at 2:30pm. Just three months since the RBA cut the cash rate to a record low of 1.75% we have the strong expectation that another record is to be set. The market yesterday was rating it a 68% chance that a cut would occur: This roughly agrees with the odd you can get on the betting sites \u2013 Sportsbet is paying $1.60 for a cut to 1.5% \u2013 which translates to a 62.5% chance. Though the future market today has pushed the likelihood up even further to around 72%. It\u2019s rare the bank goes against the market expectations, but even if it doesn\u2019t happen today, the market has now fully priced in a rate cut by November. Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the Reserve Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy decision \u2013 aka interest rates decision. Greg Jericho will be here shortly with his inimitable mix of analysis and comment but before then just a quick bit of scene-setting. The market now believes there is a 76.6% chance that the RBA will cut rates again today \u2013 to a new all-time low of 1.5% (assuming just a 0.25% cut), according to CommSec. The cash rate was last cut in May to 1.75%. That follows worse than expected official figures on building approvals earlier today. Approvals for the construction of new homes fell 2.9% in June, which was worse than market expectations of a 0.5% rise. In other gloomy news, Australia\u2019s trade deficit grew in June from $2.2bn to $3.1bn Shares across Asia Pacific are subdued in the run-up to the RBA decision at 2.30pm AEST. The Aussie is flat at around US75.35c ahead of the meeting but 10-year bond yields are at an all-time low, indicating a bearish outlook for the dollar.",
