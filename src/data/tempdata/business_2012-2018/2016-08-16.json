      "bodyText": "Accountants, lawyers and consultants whose multibillion pound industry provides advice on how to aggressively avoid tax could face large financial penalties under government proposals. Plans set out in a consultation document released on Wednesday will suggest that tax advisers whose schemes are defeated in the courts might pay a fine of up to 100% of the money lost to the taxpayer. It follows prime minister Theresa May\u2019s pledge last month to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance \u2013 widely seen as part of an appeal to working-class Britons struggling with their finances. Firms including PriceWaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young and a select band of tax lawyers have previously been accused by MPs on the public accounts committee (PAC) of helping major corporate clients to minimise tax by exploiting complex schemes. Thousands of wealthy individuals, meanwhile, were revealed to have avoided tax on their Swiss bank accounts through offshore companies marketed by HSBC and other European lenders. Currently tax avoiders face significant financial costs when HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) defeats them in court but those who advised on, or facilitated, the avoidance bear little risk. The consultation document is expected to clarify rules around whether proven tax avoiders have taken reasonable care to ensure their tax returns do not contain inaccuracies, making it simpler to enforce penalties when avoidance schemes are defeated. However, details of the proposals were not released in advance and are yet to be seen by tax experts, journalists or campaigners. Jane Ellison, the financial secretary to the Treasury, will on Wednesday open a 12-week consultation over new proposals of governance which will be outlined to the industry. \u201cPeople who peddle tax avoidance schemes deny the country of vital tax revenue and this government is determined to make sure they pay. The vast majority of their schemes don\u2019t work and can land their users in court facing large tax bills and other costs,\u201d she said in a statement. Whitehall sources said that the proposals could allow HMRC officials to stop profiteering around aggressive avoidance schemes which have been defeated in the courts. \u201cIf you are a person who has financially gained from a scheme, then this will apply,\u201d the source said. Earlier this month, HMRC successfully defeated a scheme used by the brewery giant Greene King called Project Sussex, which had been marketed by Ernst &amp; Young. A complex tax avoidance scheme being used by transport group Stagecoach to wipe \u00a311m off its tax bill was defeated in the tax courts in March. Dame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and former chair of the PAC who highlighted the role of individuals and firms that profit from tax avoidance in a committee report last year, welcomed the consultation. \u201cThese advisers have got away with too many dodgy schemes and often marketing tax avoidance wheezes on an industrial scale. If this new measure stops this dodgy tax advice it should end much of the aggressive tax avoidance. \u201cTime will tell whether this measure is tough enough to deal with the long-established habits of advisers who act with lawyers, accountants or bankers and help rich individuals and large companies avoid tax,\u201d she said. Richard Murphy, the chartered accountant who has advised Jeremy Corbyn on tax matters, compared unscrupulous tax advisers and lawyers to a \u201cpinstripe mafia\u201d and said the consultation could clean up the profession. \u201cThe people who create and market these schemes won\u2019t be able to get professional indemnity insurance, and you can\u2019t practice without insurance,\u201d he said. Pressure group the Tax Justice Network welcomed the legislation but said it would need to be enforced in the courts by HMRC. Research director Alex Cobham said: \u201cThe proposal to go after enablers of schemes that have been successfully challenged will have no impact on this major area of tax losses, unless the government is finally willing to take on multinationals and the big four accountancy firms in court.\u201d The Chartered Institute of Taxation urged caution and said that the real consequences on the industry cannot be assessed until the details are released by the government. Advisers will want to examine how the government hopes to define when planning becomes tax avoidance and whether they will face fines even if they have made clients aware of any possible risks. John Cullinane, CIOT\u2019s tax policy director, said: \u201cThe government need to be careful that in their efforts to wipe out avoidance schemes they don\u2019t prevent taxpayers from getting access to honest, impartial advice on the law. Definitions will be crucial.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Workers for takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo are claiming victory after the company said it would not force them to sign contracts agreeing to new pay terms, following a week of protests. A trial due to start in parts of London on Wednesday will see couriers for the company switch from an hourly rate of \u00a37 plus \u00a31 a delivery to a payment of \u00a33.75 for each drop. Riders, who believe that the new deal could result in them earning less money and remove the certainty that they got from an hourly rate, cautiously welcomed the deal. Couriers were originally told that they would have to sign new contract terms, or no longer be able to work for the firm. On Tuesday evening, after seven days of strike action by couriers, the firm said that it would no longer be asking riders to alter their contracts. It told those who wanted to switch areas that they would be able to work nearby. After the concessions were announced, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain tweeted that it was victory for those who had refused to work, and said riders were set to go back to work on Wednesday. In a blog on Deliveroo\u2019s website, co-founder Will Shu wrote that riders were \u201cthe lifeblood of our company\u201d. He said he believed pay would increase under the new system, but he made new commitments to drivers who were unhappy with the change. \u201cIf riders wish to stick with the old scheme, we simply ask them to move over to a neighbouring zone, no more than two miles away,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSigning the new pay-per-delivery service agreement will not be compulsory during the trial \u2013 if riders want to continue working in their zone under the pay-per-delivery trial to see how it works for them, they can do so.\u201d Riders protesting outside Deliveroo\u2019s London headquarters said they had also been promised that no one who had participated in the strike or been interviewed by the media would lose their job or have hours cut. Deliveroo courier Amir Ali said that most drivers were likely to stay on now that they did not have to sign a contract and could see how their earnings altered under the new system. Deliveroo has promised to meet in a month to compare the payslips of those involved in the trial, which covers about 280 of the company\u2019s 3,000 riders in London. \u201cWe will give it a go,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all these days on strike everybody is losing out and we can\u2019t stay without a job for a long time. Within this period of time perhaps the government can see what they can do so that people have more strength.\u201d But another driver who declined to be named said Deliveroo had not given any real concessions. \u201cThey are not changing their strategy,\u201d they said. \u201cThey are signing up new drivers on the new contracts at \u00a33.75 per delivery all the time. It is just a game.\u201d Another driver said he still believed Deliveroo would try to introduce the new payment rate to other areas. Deliveroo, which arranges deliveries from restaurants and consumers, works with self-employed cyclists and motorcyclists who provide their own transport and are not eligible for sick pay or holiday pay. On Friday, after two days of protests and with some of the self-employed workers refusing to do deliveries, Deliveroo said it would guarantee minimum pay at busy periods for workers in the trial, but that they must sign new contracts. Those who did not want to move to the new pay scheme were told that they would need to move to another area. On Sunday the government intervened in the case. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that Deliveroo must pay workers the \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 an hour unless a court or HM Revenue and Customs ruled that they are self-employed. Drivers say that moving to a new delivery area could mean earning less money because it might be less busy and they would earn less via the \u00a31-a-delivery commission. Employment lawyers said signing up to new terms and conditions would mean that their contract was changed beyond the end of the trial period. If they remain in the areas covered by the new deal, which include Camden, Hampstead and Belsize Park, some of the wealthiest areas of London, riders say they are likely to get less work because the system will allow new couriers to flood into the area at busy times.",

      "bodyText": "BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s biggest miner, has reported a record loss of $6.4bn (\u00a34.9bn) following a fatal dam disaster in Brazil, a slump in the price of commodities, and a bet on fracking in the US. Miners are struggling due to a sharp fall in commodity prices, sparked by concerns that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could leave a surplus of raw materials. Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of the London-listed company, said the last 12 months have been challenging and that commodity prices are likely to remain volatile, even if long-term demand remained robust. The miner swung to the net loss in the year to the end of June after making a profit of $1.9bn a year earlier. It is the company\u2019s first annual loss and the first time it has not increase its dividend since Australia\u2019s BHP and the Anglo-Dutch company Billiton merged in 2001. The loss was driven by $7.7bn of writedowns and charges including $4.9bn for the reduced value of its US shale operations and $2.2bn for the collapse of the Samarco dam, which killed 19 people, polluted a river valley and devastated communities in Brazil\u2019s Minas Gerais state in November. \u201cAll of us at BHP Billiton remain deeply saddened by the Samarco tragedy,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cThe company is fully committed to the framework agreement and its programs to remediate and compensate for the impacts of the Samarco dam failure. Good progress is being made on community resettlement, community health and environment restoration.\u201d BHP said the Samarco iron ore mine, owned jointly with Brazil\u2019s Vale, will not get approval to reopen this year after the dam\u2019s failure spilled billions of gallons of mining waste into a valley causing death and homelessness. The company was forced to write down the value of its shale assets because of the tumble in the price of crude oil to less than $50 a barrel. BHP diversified into the oil and gas business in 2012 with an investment in US shale assets. Mackenzie said the company will hold on to the assets because investors liked its range of businesses. \u201cThe last 12 months have been challenging for both BHP Billiton and the resources industry,\u201d Mackenzie, a Scot who took charge of the company in 2013, said. \u201cNevertheless, our results demonstrate the resilience of our portfolio and the diverse ways in which we can create value for shareholders despite low commodity prices. \u201cWhile commodity prices are expected to remain low and volatile in the short to medium term, we are confident in the long-term outlook for our commodities, particularly oil and copper.\u201d Mackenzie said the industry was starting to recover after the price of key commodities such as iron ore and coal hit 25-year lows in January. The BHP boss said there is \u201csome sense that prices have stopped falling as opposed to being in freefall\u201d and the company could start the year with \u201creal momentum\u201d. He added: \u201cSteadily, the end of the supply creation on the back of the China boom is coming to an end, product by product, and that\u2019s putting more of a floor under price than perhaps perceptibly existed maybe a year ago.\u201d Despite the record loss, shares in BHP rose 1.7% to \u00a310.60 on the back of Mackenzie\u2019s confidence. Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at online trading platform Ayondo Markets, said: \u201cDespite the monumental loss the perception is that the worst is over in terms of impairment charges and write-downs. It\u2019s also pertinent that BHP still has a yield and pays a dividend, given the extreme low interest rate environment in which we currently find ourselves.\u201d The commodity rout forced BHP Billiton to scrap its policy of not cutting dividends by slashing the half-year payout in February. It cut the annual dividend by 76% to 30 cents a share, in line with a new policy of linking payments to profits. Nicholas Hyett, analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWith dividends now a function of profits, bottom line growth will be key to future shareholder returns. For now that is being supported by a ruthless cost cutting campaign, but there\u2019s only so far that can go. \u201cWith capital expenditure falling rapidly, the group seems to be pinning its hopes on a recovery in commodity prices to boost earnings in the medium term.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US justice department is reported to have found evidence of Volkswagen acting criminally in connection with the emissions cheating scandal that plunged the German company into crisis. Federal prosecutors are weighing up whether to criminally charge VW and its employees or accept a multibillion-dollar settlement, according to the Wall Street Journal. The justice department and VW declined to comment on the discussions, which are said to have a soft deadline of Christmas 2016. VW has admitted to deliberately cheating on US diesel emissions tests for several years and this summer agreed to pay $15.3bn (\u00a311.8bn) to its customers and regulators. However, the settlement did not preclude criminal charges, and at the time, deputy attorney general Sally Yates sought to reassure consumers that \u201cour criminal investigation remains active and ongoing\u201d. \u201cWe will follow the facts wherever they go and we will determine whether to bring criminal charges against any companies or individual wrongdoers.\u201d It is unusual for US authorities to seek a criminal prosecution of companies or executives, with prosecutors tending to accept an admittance of guilt, an apology from the chief executive and multimillion-dollar fines. In 2014, Toyota paid $1.2bn to settle a criminal investigation into its attempt to mislead the public about a defect that caused unintended acceleration. Last year, General Motors paid $900m to end an investigation into an ignition switch defect, which cut engines and disabled systems such as power steering and airbags, linked to 124 deaths. Both companies agreed to the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee their safety practices for three years. A similar agreement is likely if prosecutors agree a settlement with VW. Three US states have launched lawsuits alleging that VW executives knew the company\u2019s cars had been engineered to cheat US pollution tests and had concluded that \u201cbreaking the law and risking the imposition of fines was an acceptable cost of doing business\u201d. New York, Massachusetts and Maryland filed lawsuits last month alleging that former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn and other top executives were involved in a campaign of \u201csystematic cheating and deception\u201d to mislead US regulators over the emissions of its diesel cars. An 84-page lawsuit filed by New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman alleged that VW had been adapting technology to make its cars\u2019 emissions appear loweras far back as 1999. The company went on to develop bespoke software, termed a \u201cdefeat device\u201d, that allowed its cars to produce up to 40 times as much pollution on the roads than under strict US emissions test conditions. The June settlement required VW to offer to buy back the 475,000 2.0-litre diesel cars it installed with illegal \u201cdefeat device\u201d software designed to trick regulators into believing that its cars were greener than they really were. The buyback is expected to cost VW $10bn. The cost could increase significantly if VW is also ordered to buy back 85,000 3.0-litre Audis, Porsches and SUVs sold since 2009. It was also ordered to spend $2bn on the construction of infrastructure to charge electric vehicles and develop zero-emission ride-sharing across the country. A further $2.7bn will be spent on helping the state replace old buses.",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation hits 20-month high at 0.6% \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has hit its highest level since November 2014, at 0.6%, thanks to a rise in alcohol, transport and hotel costs. The Office for National Statistics says there is no immediate impact from Brexit, but today\u2019s data also shows that firms are being hit by higher input prices, due to the weaker pound. That is likely to push inflation higher in the month ahead. Pension experts fear that savers are going to suffer, at a time when pension deficits are already swelling. Some economists predict that wages will fail to keep pace with rising prices next year, meaning real incomes could start falling again. Rail customers are already facing the prospect of higher fares in 2017, after the Retail prices index jumped to 1.9%. But there\u2019s relief at the Bank of England this afternoon, after its QE stimulus programme got back on track. Here\u2019s our latest news stories and analysis of the data: Although today\u2019s QE auction is technically a success, the Bank of England has been forced to dig deep into its pockets to persuade investors to sell their gilts. For example, it bought 30-year gilts at an average yield of 1.259%. That\u2019s below the 1.3% which these long-dated bonds are changing hands in the City today - meaning the Bank effectively paid over the odds (because yields move inversely to prices). Economist Shaun Richards reckons it\u2019s a bad deal. On the other hand -- the Bank\u2019s priority is to pump \u00a360bn into the financial sector and drive down gilt yields. So on that measure, it\u2019s a success.... Breaking! Britain\u2019s central bank has successfully bought \u00a31.17bn of long-dated UK government debt. Unlike last week\u2019s partially failed operation, the Bank of England had no trouble buying all the gilts it needed, to implement its new quantitative easing programme. Indeed, investors offered to sell over \u00a33bn of gilts, allowing the BoE to cherrypick the lowest prices in today\u2019s \u2018reverse auction\u2019. That will please the Bank, and its governor Mark Carney, as the \u00a360bn QE programme is a key part of his plan to protect the UK economy from the Brexit vote. Heads-up. The Bank of England has just launched a new attempt to buy more than one billion pounds worth of long-dated government bonds from investors. This is the latest stage in the BoE\u2019s \u00a360bn quantitative easing programme, launched earlier this month. Last week, the Bank fell \u00a352m short of its target - with gilt owners deciding to hold onto their precious assets. Could we see another failure today? Possibly...but I suspect that the Bank will simply stump up enough money to get the full \u00a31.17bn allocation. The \u2018reverse auction\u2019 ends at 2.45pm BST, so we haven\u2019t got long to wait for the result.... Food prices in British shops could soon rise sharply, if shops decide to pass on higher import costs. Just in: America\u2019s annual inflation rate has fallen back to 0.8% in July, from 1.0% in June. New figures show that petrol (oh OK, gasoline) prices fell for the first time in five months, meaning the monthly CPI was unchanged compared with June. Economists had expected an annual inflation rate of 0.9%, with prices up by 0.1% during the month. America\u2019s top central bankers at the Federal Reserve have a 2% inflation target (like the Bank of England), so some investors may now conclude that US interest rates are less likely to rise any time soon. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the UK inflation figures, in case you\u2019re just tuning in. The Consumer Prices Index, which is the official inflation measure targeted by the Bank of England, rose to 0.6% year-on-year in July, up from 0.5% in June. That\u2019s the highest rate since November 2014. That\u2019s mainly because: Transport prices rose by 1.6% between June and July this year, compared with a rise of 1.2% between the same 2 months a year ago. That\u2019s mainly due to more expensive petrol and diesel at the pump, and a rise in international rail fares. Alcoholic beverages and tobacco prices rose by 0.5% during the month (a blow to Remain campaigners looking to drown or puff away their sorrows). Restaurants and hotels: prices, overall, rose by 0.4%, compared with a smaller rise of 0.1% a year ago. The wider Retail Prices Index, which includes housing costs, jumped to 1.9% from 1.7% last month: The data also shows that the weak pound is starting to feed through to UK businesses. Producer prices (basically how much companies are charging for their products) jumped by 0.3% Input prices (the cost of raw materials) jumped by 3.3% during the month. In other news... German companies have shaken off the immediate shock of the Brexit vote. The investor confidence measure calculated by Germany\u2019s ZEW Institute rose to 0.5% today, having tumbled to -6.8% in July. Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics says the situation is still fragile, though: The improvement in confidence has been rather moderate and sentiment remains low, as the economic outlook for Europe became increasingly uncertain following the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the EU.\u201d Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s inflation figures: The post-Brexit panic selling of sterling is over but the pound still looks a sell. That\u2019s because the Bank of England has made it clear it is less bothered about the prospect of inflation rising over the coming months than it is about growth and unemployment. In all probability, there will be a further cut in interest rates and there may be another dollop of quantitative easing. Both will weaken sterling, pushing CPI inflation above its 2% target next year. More here: The TUC trade union also fears that Britain\u2019s inflation rate is going to keep rising in the coming months, hurting workers. The solution, they argue, is a burst of well-targeted government spending to protect the economy. Here\u2019s general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cThe slight uptick in inflation is likely to be followed by further increases in prices as the weak pound feeds through to higher costs for every day goods. \u201cAnd following the decision to leave the EU there is a real threat to jobs and growth. \u201cThat\u2019s why the TUC is calling for urgent government action to ensure working people do not pay the price for Brexit. The government should act now to increase investment in infrastructure, build new homes, announce plans for more high-speed rail and give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow.\u201d Given Britain\u2019s government can borrow at record low levels \u2013 just 0.5% per year for a decade \u2013 it\u2019s certainly a good time to investing in the future.... There\u2019s widespread concern that UK rail fares are going to jump by 1.9% next year, tracking the rise in the Retail Prices Index of inflation. The Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: \u201cOur rail fares are already the highest in Europe and today\u2019s increases will only make that record worse. It\u2019s time that ministers gave rail passengers a break and actually froze fares in real terms.\u201d PcW, the consultancy firm, are also unimpressed, arguing that the system is out of date and needs reforming. Here\u2019s our news story on the issue: Many City economists are predicting that UK inflation will soar toward, or even over, the official target of 2% by early next year. That\u2019s due to the weaker pound, as firms are forced to push higher import prices onto consumers. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says this will hurt consumers: \u201cThe first post-referendum data saw the consumer price inflation rate (CPI) edge up from 0.5% in June to 0.6% in July, but it will be some time before the full effect of the fall in sterling following the Brexit vote comes through. Eventually, however, we would expect this to push CPI inflation back up towards its 2% target rate by mid-2017 as import prices rise. A weaker pound is good news for British exporters but will put a squeeze on the real spending power of consumers. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, also expects inflation to spike: \u201cInflation reached its highest rate for 20 months in July but is still short of the 2% target. We are likely to see inflation continue to rise over the remainder of the year and to climb above 2% by early 2017. However, with core inflationary pressures remaining very muted, in line with the enduring softness of wage growth, we expect inflation to peak at 3%. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics also sees higher inflation on the horizon: The jump in inflation is bad news for savers, who have just seen UK interest rates slashed to 0.25%. It could also hurt pension funds, who are facing monstrous deficits thanks to the slump in government bond yields to record lows. Charles Cowling, director at consultancy group JLT, fears trouble ahead: \u201cLatest inflation figures confirm a Brexit double whammy for pension schemes, the first post Brexit evidence of the impact of falling sterling on UK prices. \u201cThe July rise in inflation heaps further woes on pension schemes that had already seen their deficits soar post Brexit as a result of the latest round of QE and falls in interest rates. With pension benefits being linked to inflation, deficits will likely worsen further, adding pressure on trustees and companies alike. \u201cWhether or not Brexit is good for the UK economy, it has certainly been calamitous so far for pension schemes which were already suffering massively in markets which have been extremely difficult. This latest news must increase the likelihood of the Brexit effect bringing down some companies and their pension schemes.\u201d The rise in inflation during July actually shows that the UK economy was in good health before the EU referendum, argues Kallum Pickering of German bank Berenberg. Prices continued to fall for food and non-alcoholic beverages, due to strong competition in the supermarket sector. Most of the upward pressure came from components linked to growth in discretionary spending such as restaurants and hotels and recreation and culture. However... Pickering also warns that the Brexit vote WILL push inflation higher, and also erode our wages. That means real pay may actually start shrinking next year. During the euro crisis, nominal wage growth slowed to a less than 1% year-on-year. With inflation rising to at least the 2% target by early next year, real wages will probably decline during 2017. That echoes a warning from the Resolution Foundation today, who fear that the economic damage of Brexit will more than wipe out any benefit from cutting inflation: This chart, from Ross Finley of Reuters, shows how UK firms had to pay more for their raw materials last month, following the slide in the value of sterling: And you can clearly see the impact in the cost of imports: The pound has gained almost one cent against the US dollar since the inflation report was released, to $1.297. It has also recovered from this morning\u2019s three-year low against the euro, and is now worth \u20ac1.152. (up from \u20ac1.146). Traders may be calculating that higher inflation will make it harder for the Bank of England to cut interest rates any further. Today\u2019s inflation report is the first official government data that covers the period after the EU referendum, so can we see a Brexit effect yet? Mike Prestwood, head of prices at the Office for National Statistics, argues that we can\u2019t. However, he does also point out that UK companies put their prices up in July, which could indicate that prices in the shops will rise this autumn. Prestwood says: \u201cThere was no obvious impact on today\u2019s consumer prices figures following the EU referendum results though the Producer Prices Index suggests the fall in the exchange rate is beginning to push up import prices faced by manufacturers.\u201d It\u2019s also probably too early to spot signs of Brexit damage in the economy, just because it takes time for changes in business strategy, consumer behaviour and currency moves to feed through to the high street. Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown predicts that inflation will keep rising. Here\u2019s his take: Perhaps in a taste of things to come, import prices rose 6.5% year-on-year, their fastest rate in five years. However, in truth the small tick upwards in the headline rate to 0.6% tells us little. The ONS collects data in the middle of each month, so the prices were collected just two or three weeks after the vote. It\u2019s almost certain that the weaker pound will cause inflation to rise more sharply in the coming months, but the effect of sterling\u2019s depreciation will take time to feed through fully into the figures as businesses gradually adjust to the new environment. We also have evidence that the plunge in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is hitting UK businesses. Producer prices, which measure how much British firms charge for their wares, rose by 0.3% in July. That\u2019s the fastest rise in more than two years, and suggests that companies are passing on higher import costs to consumers. This will probably feed into the headline inflation rate in the next few months. This chart shows how transport, alcohol and hotel bills drove up the cost of living last month: Bad news for rail travellers - the Retail Prices Index (another inflation measure) has jumped to 1.9% in July. That means that regulated rail fares could also rise by 1.9%, as RPI is used to set rail fares for 2017. Protests are already taking pace at London rail stations today, from campaigners angry that fares have risen twice as fast as wages since 2010. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is taking part, and arguing that the UK rail network should be taken back into public ownership. At 0.6%, Britain\u2019s CPI inflation rate is now at its highest level in 20 months. The ONS says: Although the small increase in the rate between June 2016 and July 2016 takes it to the highest seen since November 2014, it is still relatively low in the historic context. The main contributors to the increase in the rate were rising prices for motor fuels, alcoholic beverages and accommodation services, and a smaller fall in food prices than a year ago. These upward pressures were partially offset by falls in social housing rent, and falling prices for certain games and toys. Higher transport costs helped to drive Britain\u2019s inflation rate up, according to the Office for National Statistics. Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate rose in July. The Consumer Prices index, the benchmark measure of inflation in the UK, jumped to 0.6%, up from +0.5% in June. Detail and reaction to follow..... The pound has hit its lowest point against a basket of rival currencies since 2010. Reuters has the details: Sterling was down 0.4 percent at 87.15 pence per euro, having hit a three-year low of 87.20 pence. Against a generally weaker dollar, it was a touch higher at $1.2915. The trade-weighted sterling index was down 0.1 percent at 76.8, having shed over 12 percent since June 23, when Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum. The index was its lowest since March 2010, Reuters graphics showed. This chart shows its recent tumble against the euro, to its lowest since 2013. As expected, the London stock market has fallen slightly in the first hour of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 18 points at 6922, having closed at its highest point since June 2015 last night. Mining firms are rallying, but financial stocks and supermarkets are down. Here\u2019s the details: Rail campaigners are urging the government to introduce part-time season tickets, to protect commuters from the impact of another fare hike. As explained earlier, today\u2019s Retail Prices Index will determine how much train operators can raise prices by (the formula is currently RPL +0%). New research shows that fares have risen twice as fast as wages since 2010, prompting calls to rein in the sector. More here: FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says sterling is under \u201cimmense pressure\u201d ahead of the July inflation report, due in 50 minutes. The rising expectations of further monetary stimulus from the Bank of England to quell the Brexit chaos has enticed bears to install repeated rounds of selling, consequently leaving Sterling vulnerable to heavy losses. Sentiment is firmly bearish towards the pound, and the awful combination of soft domestic data coupled with heightened hopes of the BoE cutting UK rates to near zero should ensure prices remain depressed for an extended period. Sterling has slipped to a new three-year low against the euro, as traders get ready for the July inflation report. One pound is currently worth just \u20ac1.1476, its lowest level since August 2013. That means one euro is worth 81.1p. Slerling is also bobbing around a one-month low against the US dollar this morning, at $1.289. Anthony Cheung of City firm Amplify Trading hopes for a break from the August news lull today: Higher food and fuel prices probably pushed Britain\u2019s inflation rate up last month, predicts Naeem Aslam of Think Markets UK. Today, more light will be shed on the consequences of the Brexit vote in terms of CPI data. It is very important to keep in mind that Brexit has not happened yet, only the Brexit vote has occurred and they are two different things. The Bank of England has already accepted that one of the consequences is that inflation will move higher and we do reason that the inflation rate could easily burst the BOE\u2019s target of 2% as early as the first quarter of 2017. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics also reckons today\u2019s inflation report will show that sterling\u2019s \u201cBrexit-driven depreciation\u201d has pushed up prices in the shops. And Yael Selfin, Head of Macroeconomics at KPMG, also expects CPI inflation will rise from June\u2019s 0.5%. Good morning. We\u2019re about to get our first piece of hard economic data since Britain\u2019s fateful EU referendum on June 23. At 9.30am, the UK inflation report will reveal how prices changed last month. It may show that the Brexit vote (and the consequent tumble in sterling) has now fed through to businesses and consumers. The City expects that the consumer prices index will show prices rose by 0.5% over the 12 months to July, matching June\u2019s figure. But some economists reckon it may rise to 0.6%, due to the weaker pound pushing up the cost of imports. Yesterday, the pound hit a one-month low as investors hunkered down ahead of today\u2019s inflation figure. It will be followed by unemployment data tomorrow and retail sales on Thursday. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, explains: Bearish sentiment is building as investors look ahead to a slew of UK data that should offer a much clearer picture of how the economy has been affected by the Brexit vote. The limited evidence so far has been pretty downbeat and point to a marked reversal of fortunes for an economy that enjoyed a very healthy first half of the year. Britain\u2019s army of hard-working commuters will be particularly interested in today\u2019s inflation numbers. The Retail Price index will be used to set rail fares for the next year. Also coming up.... We\u2019re actually quite spoiled for economic data this morning, with US inflation due at 1.30pm BST, followed by a report on America\u2019s industrial sector. Germany\u2019s ZEW institute publishes its monthly investor confidence report at 10am BST. And there\u2019s a new report on oil inventory levels due at some stage. We\u2019ll also be watching the Bank of England today. It will try to buy \u00a31.17bn of long-dated UK government debt this afternoon, as part of its QE programme. Last week the Bank failed to meet its target, with investors unwilling to actually sell up. We\u2019ll know by 3pm whether the BoE did better this time.... Last night, the US stock market hit yet another record high. But shares in Europe are expected to dip when trading begins at 8am: Plus, mining groups Antofagasta and BHP Billiton and oil services firm Wood Group are reporting financial results today.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inflation rose to the highest level in 20 months in July, with the consumer prices index ticking up to 0.6% last month from 0.5% in June, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists warned of steeper prices rises in the coming months as the full impact of the weaker pound following the Brexit vote is felt. It was the highest rate of annual inflation since November 2014, and the first official snapshot of what has happened to prices since the EU referendum on 23 June. The pound has fallen by about 10% against the dollar since the vote, pushing up the price of imports. The main drivers of the Julyincrease in inflation were rising fuel and alcohol prices, and higher restaurant and hotel bills. Food prices also fell at a slower rate than a year ago. Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec, said inflation was likely to rise to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target by the end of 2016, reaching almost 3% in May 2017. The last time inflation was as high as 2% was December 2013. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pound\u2019s weakness was already reflected in the pickup in inflation in July. \u201cInflation\u2019s pickup, however, will gain strong momentum in 2017,\u201d he said. The consumer prices index (CPI) is the official measure of UK inflation and provides a monthly snapshot of the price movements of an average basket of goods and services. The ONS revises what goes into the basket once a year to make it as representative as possible of the latest consumer shopping trends. At the time of the last revision in March, items including pouches of microwave rice and computer game downloads were included, while cooked sliced turkey, CD-Roms and nightclub entry were out. The retail price index (RPI), which includes the cost of housing and is calculated differently from CPI, rose to 1.9% from 1.6%. The spike will affect rail commuters, because July\u2019s RPI figure is used to set rail fares from January. In further evidence of the effect the Brexit vote has had on imports, the prices UK industries pay for their raw materials and fuel jumped by 4.3% in the year to July, compared with a 0.5% fall in the year to June. The prices charged by UK firms for their goods as they left the factory gate rose at annual rate of 0.3% in July. It was the first rise in two years, and economist said the figure was a good early indication of what might follow for consumer price inflation. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: \u201cProducer price figures suggested that cost pressures in the goods sector are now building at the start of the production pipeline. Accordingly, we think that CPI inflation should break through the 2% target in early 2017 and near 3% by the end of that year.\u201d The pound rose 0.8% against the dollar to $1.2994 following the inflation figures, and strengthened against the euro after falling earlier in the day. Ben Brettell, a senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said rising inflation over the coming months was likely to be a temporary spike. \u201cAssuming sterling remains weak, the effect will fall out of the year-on-year calculation in the second half of next year. \u201cUnderlying inflationary pressure is hard to see, with Brexit-related economic uncertainty likely to dampen both consumer spending and wage growth in the short term.\u201d The Bank of England is expected to look beyond short-term price rises by keeping interest rates low or cutting them further to protect the economy from uncertainty caused by the referendum result. It cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% this month. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cHigher inflation squeezes consumer spending and increases cost pressures on businesses. However, if economic growth slows as many expect, then price rises are likely to be limited. Such a scenario will not dissuade the MPC from cutting interest rates further in the coming months.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 16 August to clarify that the retail price index includes the cost of housing",

      "bodyText": "Brexit effect? What Brexit effect? That is the obvious way of assessing the official inflation figures for July \u2013 the first to cover changes in prices for a period that fell entirely after the 23 June referendum. But appearances can be deceptive. Scratch a little beneath the surface and it is clear the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU had an impact on inflation last month. The effect came via the sharp depreciation of the pound, which was trading at just under $1.50 before the referendum to a low of just under $1.28 in early July. The cost of imports goes up when sterling goes down. Given the UK\u2019s record balance of payments deficit, the pound was going to fall eventually no matter what the result of the referendum. But a combination of shock, panic and uncertainty meant it came down a lot more rapidly than anybody was expecting. This fall manifested itself in two ways. A breakdown of the Consumer Prices Index \u2013 the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living \u2013 showed that dearer imported food and fuel were among the reasons for the slight pick up in the annual rise in inflation from 0.5% to 0.6%. But the real place to look for the Brexit effect was the Producer Prices Index, published by the Office for National Statistics at the same time as the CPI. The PPI shows how much UK firms are paying for their fuel and raw materials, and how much they charge for goods as they leave the factory gate. As such, it is a good guide to inflation coming down the pipeline. In the year to July, the prices paid by UK industry for fuel and raw materials were 4.3% higher than a year earlier, a big turnaround from the 0.5% fall in the year to June. Factory gate prices, down 0.2% in the year to June, were rising at an annual rate of 0.3% in July - the first increase in two years. So what happens now? The post-Brexit panic selling of sterling is over but the pound still looks a sell. That\u2019s because the Bank of England has made it clear it is less bothered about the prospect of inflation rising over the coming months than it is about growth and unemployment. In all probability, there will be a further cut in interest rates and there may be another dollop of quantitative easing. Both will weaken sterling, pushing CPI inflation above its 2% target next year. The spurt in inflation is likely to be temporary. Rising prices are unlikely to be matched by rising wages, leading to a squeeze on spending power that will prevent manufacturers and retailers passing on their higher costs to consumers. The immediate impact of the falling pound is inflationary but its longer-term impact is deflationary. As a result, the Bank is right not to let sterling affect its post-Brexit policy stance.",

A breakdown of the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/july2016\">Consumer Prices Index </a>\u2013 the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living \u2013 showed that dearer imported food and fuel were among the reasons for the slight pick up in the annual rise in inflation from 0.5% to 0.6%. </p> <p>But the real place to look for the Brexit effect was the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/producerpriceinflation/july2016\">Producer Prices Index</a>, published by the Office for National Statistics at the same time as the CPI. The PPI shows how much UK firms are paying for their fuel and raw materials, and how much they charge for goods as they leave the factory gate. As such, it is a good guide to inflation coming down the pipeline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-16T11:11:07/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK pound against dollar\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-16T11:11:07/embed.html\">UK pound against dollar</a> <figcaption>UK pound against dollar.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the year to July, the prices paid by UK industry for fuel and raw materials were 4.3% higher than a year earlier, a big turnaround from the 0.5% fall in the year to June. Factory gate prices, down 0.2% in the year to June, were rising at an annual rate of 0.3% in July - the first increase in two years.</p> <p>So what happens now? The post-Brexit panic selling of sterling is over but the pound still looks a sell. That\u2019s because the Bank of England has made it clear it is less bothered about the prospect of inflation rising over the coming months than it is about growth and unemployment. In all probability, there will be a further cut in interest rates and there may be another dollop of quantitative easing. Both will weaken sterling, pushing CPI inflation above its 2% target next year.</p> <p>The spurt in inflation is likely to be temporary. Rising prices are unlikely to be matched by rising wages, leading to a squeeze on spending power that will prevent manufacturers and retailers passing on their higher costs to consumers. The immediate impact of the falling pound is inflationary but its longer-term impact is deflationary. As a result, the Bank is right not to let sterling affect its post-Brexit policy stance. <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Australian gas is being shipped and sold to wholesale customers in Japan for 40% less than it is sold to Australian customers, despite the extra costs of liquefying and shipping the gas there. The commitment to exporting Australian gas has left fewer companies selling gas to the Australian market, meaning both retail and wholesale gas prices have risen sharply, pushing up local electricity prices up too. Those price rises are a result of a lack of competition and cartel-like behaviour, not any shortage of actual gas supply, according to finance and energy analyst Bruce Robertson from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The analysis comes just ahead of a meeting of state and federal energy ministers at the Coag Energy Council on Friday. Since May, the wholesale price of gas on the east coast of Australia overtook the price of gas in Japan. But because of long-term contracts signed by Santos, Shell and Origin Energy, the companies have been obliged to continue exporting to overseas markets, including Japan. \u201cBearing in mind the high costs of transport and liquefaction, it makes no sense that Australian gas should be cheaper in Japan, one of the highest-cost markets in the world. Australian consumers would be correct to question why this is the case,\u201d said Robertson. Robertson said all the available evidence suggested there was no shortage of gas locally but there was a severe lack of competition, he said. Gas companies are not obliged to release information about the capacity or production of their wells, so Robertson pointed to public statements about their supply levels. In 2012, for example, BHP Billiton\u2019s petroleum chief Mike Yeager was reported as saying that they had so much gas supply in eastern Australia they could supply those areas \u201cindefinitely\u201d. The comments were made when gas use was forecast to grow, and since then it has declined. Robertson said that means Australia must be \u201cswimming in gas\u201d supply. He said the remaining major players controlling the domestic market \u2013 BHP Billiton and ExxonMobil \u2013 were then allowed to cooperate in \u201cjoint marketing ventures,\u201d which Robertson said could be compared to a legalised cartel. The lack of competition in the east-coast gas market was examined by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in April. The commission released the results of the inquiry and chairman Rod Sims said: \u201cThere are currently very few constraints on monopoly pricing by pipeline operators.\u201d Since recent spikes in the price of electricity have been blamed on the rising price of gas, the new federal minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, indicated more gas was needed in Australia. \u201cWe need more gas supply and more gas supplies in Australia, and gas is an important part of the energy mix,\u201d Frydenberg told ABC\u2019s Lateline. Robertson said since the price hikes are a result of low competition rather than low supply, opening up new supplies that are owned by the same companies controlling current supply would do nothing to lower prices. But with little public information about gas supplies, Robertson said it was impossible for policymakers to make informed decisions about the supply of gas. \u201cYou have policymakers suggesting policy responses to a problem they can\u2019t see the dimensions of. And that\u2019s a very dangerous situation.\u201d That lack of available information was also highlighted by the ACCC\u2019s inquiry in April. \u201cThe lack of consistent, publicly available data on the sector is an impediment to participants, investors and policymakers,\u201d Sims said. Robertson said he was concerned that without more information the wrong decisions would be made at the Coag Energy Council meeting on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019ve set the agenda for more gas production and that ain\u2019t the solution,\u201d he said. Robertson was critical of the ACCC\u2019s report for recommending more gas supply be opened up, since that report itself pointed out there was a lack of information about current levels of supply. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling they suggest that solution when they have no bloody idea of the productive capacity of existing wells,\u201d said Robertson.",
