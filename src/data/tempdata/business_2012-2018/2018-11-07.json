The viral clip of sheepish chief executive Jeff Fairburn walking away from BBC Look North\u2019s cameras, and then protesting that it was \u201creally unfortunate\u201d to be asked about his \u00a375m bonus, was an instant classic in the living-in-a-bubble genre. He had to go. It\u2019s hard to know if Persimmon will improve its standing by ditching the boss. It could have refused to pay Fairburn his full whack, and invited him to sue for the balance, but few boards dare to defy their lawyers, especially when the woefully flawed pay scheme was approved by shareholders in the first place. More notably, Fairburn\u2019s temporary replacement, who is also a candidate to be a permanent appointment, is managing director David Jenkinson, who himself gained the thick end of \u00a340m from the same ludicrous 2012 long-term incentive plan, or LTIP, that became supercharged when former chancellor George Osborne launched his help-to-buy subsidies in 2013. Jenkinson actually surrendered a smaller proportion of his windfall \u2013 just \u00a33m \u2013 than Fairburn did. Maybe the new man will be able to memorise a PR script. Or maybe this saga will drag on and on. In his farewell comments, Fairburn displayed his usual lack of awareness of the wider picture. \u201cI had hoped that revealing my plans to create a charitable trust and to waive a proportion of the award would enable the company to put the issue of the 2012 LTIP behind it,\u201d he said. There are at least three reasons why \u201cthe issue\u201d was never likely to disappear so easily. First, Fairburn hasn\u2019t said how much he will donate to his trust. Second, his waiving of a quarter of the original \u00a3100m-ish award happened very late in the day: the former chairman and head of Permission\u2019s pay committee had already resigned at the end of last year out of shame over their own failure to put a cap on rewards at the outset. Third, the lower figure of \u00a375m didn\u2019t move the dial. It \u201cdoes not even get close to acceptable\u201d, Euan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April. A bigger cut, if volunteered happily at the outset, might have saved Fairburn \u2013 but he chose otherwise. The broader lesson for UK boards is that uncapped incentive schemes are a nonsense. In fact, most share-based LTIPs are a terrible way to measure performance. Winnings too often flow from luck or are overly determined by the timing of the grant. Not every set of executives enjoys the whoosh of a help-to-buy scheme, but lottery-like features are baked into most structures. Therein lies the other shame about this tale. It should have prompted a wider rethink over the use of LTIPs, as a handful of far-sighted fund managers have argued for ages. Instead, Persimmon has provided a vivid demonstration of how executives will cling to a rotten system and how the majority of City investors don\u2019t care. Remember the most stunning detail. At that same annual meeting in April, by which time the cat was fully out of the bag, some 51.5% of shareholders decided the bonuses were just fine.

    "webTitle": "Lion Air crash: Boeing tells pilots how to deal with faulty sensors", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boeing has sent instructions to airlines using its 737 Max jet about how pilots should react to erroneous readings from sensors, an issue investigators believe was a key factor in the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, in which all 189 people on board were killed. Aviation experts said the initial findings indicated that the the pilot and first officer of flight JT610 did not know at what speed they were flying, similar to the problem experienced on Air France flight 447, which plunged into the Atlantic sea in 2009. Boeing said it had issued an operations manual bulletin, advising pilots on how to deal with \u201cerroneous input from an angle of attack (AOA) sensor\u201d. The Federal Aviation Administration, the US aviation regulator, said it would order airlines to abide by the bulletin and would take \u201cfurther appropriate actions\u201d depending on the result of the investigation. The AOA sensor sends out information about the angle at which the aircraft is flying, which indicates to the captain and first officer whether the plane may be at risk of stalling. An AOA giving out erroneous data can lead to incorrect speed readings, potentially causing confusion among the flight crew and a rapid loss of altitude. An AOA had been changed by mechanics on the ground in Bali the day before the crash, after similar problems had occurred on previous flights, Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee said. Aviation safety expert David Gleave said this might lead to the captain and first officer seeing different speed readings and reacting poorly, particularly if they were inexperienced. \u201cQuickly after takeoff, you engage autopilot and the autopilot wouldn\u2019t know which speed is correct, so it says, \u2018Over to you chaps, this is what you get paid for\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe correct reaction is to work out which set of instruments is generating good info and which is generating bad info. The person with the good info displayed then flies the aeroplane manually. \u201cThe first thing you\u2019d need to do is relax and not overreact. Alarms may be going off, and the first thing to do is do nothing. The aeroplane was OK beforehand and will be OK for a little while until you figure things out.\u201d He said there were several checks that flight crew could perform that would help identify which airspeed reading was correct. But he warned that a fatal accident might ensue due to a \u201cstartled reaction\u201d from the pilot, or if flight crew were not sufficiently well trained to perform the required checks. Lion Jet\u2019s Boeing 737 Max8 crashed into the Java Sea just 13 minutes after takeoff, so the pilots would have had limited time to identify the issue and react correctly. On Monday, Indonesian accident investigators said an airspeed indicator on the crashed jet was damaged for its last four flights, but US authorities responded cautiously to suggestions of fleet-wide checks. While Boeing has issued a bulletin explaining how flight crew should react to erroneous readings, the power to ground aircraft and insist upon further checks rests with regulators such as the FAA in the US and the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. Boeing said: \u201cThe investigation into Lion Air flight 610 is ongoing and Boeing continues to cooperate fully and provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of government authorities investigating the accident.\u201d The Boeing 737 Max is the US aircraft manufacture\u2019s fastest-selling plane of all time, garnering about 4,700 orders from 100 customers in the first few years of its life. It is an upgrade to the 737, the most popular plane ever built, with added range that allows airlines to use it for long-haul flights, unlike its predecessor. John Strickland, director of independent transport consultancy JLS Consulting, said: \u201cThe 737 used to be a short-haul aircraft, but is now long-haul-capable and Norwegian, for example, is using it for that. \u201cIt has proven very popular with a number of airlines who previously wouldn\u2019t have taken a risk on some long-haul markets due to the larger capacity and poorer economics of previous-generation aircraft.\u201d Airlines using the 737 Max include Norwegian, Tui, the Singapore Airlines offshoot SilkAir, Garuda Indonesia and Canada\u2019s WestJet. It emerged on Thursday that another Lion Air plane was involved in a minor accident on Wednesday night on a runway in Bengkulu, on the island of Sumatra, when its wing rammed into a lamp post. The transportation ministry\u2019s acting director general told Indonesian media that the flight was cancelled and pilots grounded after the accident, subject to an investigation. No injuries were reported.",

      "bodyText": "Whether you will have enough money to retire in comfort is a major concern for many Australians, but a new report by the Grattan Institute suggests we might be worrying for nothing. The report argues that the current superannuation and age pension system will see most people have more than enough to retire on \u2013 in fact, so much so that they recommend not increasing the superannuation guarantee from 9.5% to 12%. Instead they argue it would be better to spend the money on rent assistance and reducing the means test taper for the aged pension. Clearly people are worried about their retirement. In the Grattan Institute\u2019s latest report, \u201cMoney in retirement: more than enough\u201d John Daley and Brendan Coates note that people\u2019s belief that they will have enough money to retire has fallen sharply recently: And yet they argue this is contrary to the reality. Despite people\u2019s concerns, most of us will have enough to retire on \u2013 more than 70% of the annual disposable income we had over the last 20 years of our working life, which is generally considered an adequate retirement level. The fact is we generally do not need as much money in our retirement as while working or raising a family, and so a 70% replacement rate is considered a level at which we would be able to live in much the same standard of living. The Grattan Institute forecasts that across all income ranges, households on average are able to reach that 70% level \u2013 in many cases well above: These finding have been criticised by Industry Super Australia, which argues that they assume people are making more voluntary superannuation contributions than occurs, and that people work continuously from 30 to 67 year of age. On the first point Coates notes that their model uses the most recent tax data and that \u201ceven if you assume no one makes voluntary super contributions then replacement rates for the median worker would fall from 91% of their pre-retirement earnings to just 88%\u201d. On the second point, Daley and Coates note that their model also assumes people do not work before 30 which in effect balances out the reality for people (especially women) who stop work in their 30s and 40s. The Grattan Institute has long been a champion of other ways of improving retirement incomes than increasing the superannuation guarantee, mostly because they argue the benefits accrue to the wealthy and it is also very costly to the budget \u2013 and more so than making changes to the pension. They calculate that increasing the superannuation guarantee to 12% will actually see almost no net benefit to those on less than median household incomes because of associated reductions in the age pension, while those in the 90th income percentile would see their retirement income increase by nearly 5%: And because of the cost of tax breaks associated with superannuation they argue the cost to the budget is vastly outweighed by the reduction in the age pension spending overall: The report shows that in terms of government assistance, the wealthy clearly do much better out of tax breaks to their superannuation than do low income earners from the aged pension: But while the current system, expensive though it is, does seem to be at least producing a good level of retirement incomes, there are major issues on the way, due mainly to lower home ownership. Daley and Coates found that housing costs for renters significantly outweighs that of home owners as people approach retirement age, because people generally have paid off their home by that stage: And as a result the level of financial stress is much higher for retirees who are renting than home owners. But crucially they find that financial stress for retirees regardless of whether they rent or own their home is much less than for those of working age: But with home ownership levels falling this divergence between owners and renters is going to become exacerbated. In 1996, nearly half of all 45-54 years old (ie those who are now just retired) owned their home outright; now that figure is just 17%: That suggests a wave of retirement problems coming down the track. The report found that those in their 40s who are renters will have a much lower retirement income compared to home owners across all levels of income: This is why the authors argue that increasing rent assistance by 40% would deliver much greater benefits for low income households than would increasing the superannuation guarantee. They also argue that median income households would be better off if the government loosened the taper of the aged pension means test. Currently the age pension is withdrawn at a rate of $3 per fortnight for each $1,000 of assets above the \u201casset free\u201d area; they argue this should be reduced to $2.25 in order to encourage people saving for retirement. They argue this new taper would on average see median household retirement income increase by 4.5% whereas increasing the superannuation guarantee will actually see a slight drop. And while increasing the guarantee would cost the budget $2bn in 2019-120, the change in the means test taper would cost just $0.75bn \u2013 much better bang for the government\u2019s buck: Less controversially the report also argues that were superannuation fees reduced and returns increased by 0.5% a year, the median household would be 3.8% better off. This finding very much concurs with that of the recent inquiry by the productivity commission into superannuation. Rather more controversially, the report recommends the government reinstate its policy of increasing the retirement age to 70, but it notes as well that the government should investigate \u201cwhether there should be a new regime for easier access to the pension for people aged over 60 years whose health has been so impaired that it is difficult to work\u201d. While the findings of this report certainly are challenged by the superannuation industry, it makes a valuable contribution to the political debate which has become somewhat stuck in a \u201csuperannuation will fix everything\u201d mode. There is more than one way to achieve a retirement income. This latest report is valuable if only for providing a very strong rebuke to the sense that superannuation is costless to the government \u2013 indeed given the level of tax breaks, age pensioners are arguably less of a burden to taxpayers, and the benefits are certainly not distributed to those who most need them. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have closed solidly higher tonight, as a wave of relief sweeps through trading floors. In London, the FTSE 100 has closed 76 points higher at 7117, up 1.1%. The German Dax gained 0.8%, the French CAC rose by 1.1%, and the Spanish IBEX jumped by over 2%. Gridlock, it seems, is good for stocks today. As David Madden of CMC Markets puts it: Historically, equity markets have performed well out of a divided Congress as traders feel the government finds it difficult to get new laws passed, and therefore not much changes. The US economy had positive momentum going into the midterms, and that is likely to continue. The rise in popularity of the Democrats could be construed as a vote against Trump\u2019s tough trade stance, and perhaps the White House might soften its position regarding China. There is speculation the Democrats are keen to improve infrastructure, and we are seeing a rally in Caterpillar. Mr Trump has set his sights on tech giants like Amazon, and the outcome of the midterms might make it more difficult for him to go after tech titans. The Dow is still 1.1% higher, the S&amp;P 500 is 1,3% higher, while the Nasdaq is now 2.2% up. Donald Trump is due to discuss the election results shortly, at a Washington DC press conference. My US colleague will cover it here: Goodnight! GW Wall Street is pushing higher, after the Republican\u2019s Senate leader suggested the next Congress could take a bipartisan approach. If that happened (and it\u2019s a big if, given the last two years) it could help to get tax reform and infrastructure legislation passed. Reuters has the details: U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday infrastructure and healthcare would be on the U.S. Senate agenda in 2019, after Republicans widened their majority in the Senate but lost control of the House of Representatives in Tuesday\u2019s elections. Speaking to reporters, McConnell said senators would likely tackle Obamacare fixes and prescription drug prices, but that changes to Medicare and Social Security were unlikely. Additionally, any new tax legislation would need bipartisan support, he said. This is neat: The US dollar is still under pressure, maintaining its earlier losses against the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen, and other major currencies. The dollar index is currently down 0.5% today, close to the two-week low hit earlier. This is a clear reaction to the Democratic wins in the House of Representatives last night. Investors are concluding that Donald Trump won\u2019t be able to get another big tax cuts package through Congress, meaning less inflation and consequently less pressure to raise US interest rates in 2019 and 2020. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy &amp; market research at FXTM, says: One of the more interesting trends to have monitored in the aftermath of the mid-term results is the acceleration in near-term Dollar weakness. This suggests that investors are descaling away from heavy US dollar buying positions and have potentially been put off holding onto their positions because of the consensus that the Liberal Democrats taking control of the House provides a potential roadblock to President Trump introducing further fiscal stimulus. Duncan Weldon, of UK investment firm Resolution Group, suggests that the midterm election results could trigger a heightened trade war with China: The Wall Street rally shows investors are relieved that the Democrats have control of the House of Representatives, and can block Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital says investors would welcome a bit of gridlock, after two wild years in Washington: \u201cAs widely expected, the US midterm elections have enabled the Democrats to take control of the House of Representatives, while the Republicans retained control of the Senate. This gridlock scenario has ramped-up the challenge for policymakers in seeking to pass major legislation. That said, investor sentiment should be positive in general as a split Congress suggests that Democrats will be unable to roll back tax cuts or reinstate financial regulations, while the status quo for both the economy and the markets should ultimately prevail. As such, global equities are mainly higher this morning as the passage of last night\u2019s events has likely removed an element of uncertainty from the marketplace. The Wall Street opening bell is ring-a-dinging.....and shares are rising. The Dow Jones industrial average, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq index have all posted solid gains, as traders react to the midterm elections. My US colleagues have launched a new liveblog covering all the reaction to the midterms.... including this typically presidential threat from Donald Trump: The US stock market is expected to rally when trading begins in around 70 minutes time. The Dow is being called up around 215 points, or 0.8%, as investors take the midterm results in their strides. Geoffrey Yu of UBS Wealth Management says investors may move money into riskier assets, now the US election is over. \u201cUS stock futures edged up this morning, signalling the market sees Republicans as having marginally outperformed. For once, the polls were pretty much on track, but the pundits have been careful to manage expectations after 2016\u2019s miscalculations, which on balance is probably a healthy development. \u201cFrom an economic standpoint, the more gridlock can be avoided the better. We will be interested to see whether certain sectors can benefit from this outcome, such as infrastructure. Investors around the globe are relieved that the Republicans lost their grip on the lower House of Representatives, says Jake Robbins, fund manager at Premier Global Alpha Growth Fund. A divided government has some positives for markets in that the more extreme policies of the Trump presidency will certainly see some push back which financial markets are clearly seeing as a positive. The great fear was a surprise hold by the Republicans in congress which would have allowed Trump\u2019s combative foreign and trade policies that have so unnerved markets to escalate further. Financial markets are breathing a sigh of relief that this is not the case. Those sectors hit hardest by tariffs such as basic materials, semis and industrials should see some respite, particularly given their underlying growth prospects have remained pretty good and after the selloff these sectors look attractively valued. Political gridlock also means there\u2019s little chance that Donald Trump\u2019s original tax reforms are reversed. Democrats on the Hill might want to repeal those tax cuts, but the Republican-controlled Senate surely won\u2019t allow it. There\u2019s another reason that shares are rallying today [the cuts to corporate tax boost company profits]. Mickey Levy and Roiana Reid of Berenberg explain: Financial markets are expected to take comfort with the split power in Congress: it was widely expected and will be perceived to allow for additional checks and balances on President Trump. The decent election results for Republicans in the Senate should lessen perceptions of a shift to the hard-left in the 2020 elections and ease concerns about a roll-back of pro-business policies. They also believe we\u2019ll see a lot more political rancour in Congress, but rather less meaningful legislation: We expect even more Congressional dysfunction \u2011 if that is possible \u2011 to lead to more convolutions in the already dysfunctional budget process and more threats of government shutdowns. Just in: The MSCI All-Country World Share Index, which tracks global stocks, has hit its highest level since 22 October. Paras Anand of Fidelity International has an optimistic take - Donald Trump could work with the Democrat-controlled House to push through a new infrastructure-spending package. He writes: During the 2016 Clinton election campaign, infrastructure spend was high on the Democrat\u2019s policy agenda (as it was for Trump). It is possible that with a bi-partisan focus on the pent-up need for domestic infrastructure investment, the Democrat view on the budget deficit may change from opposition (to tax cuts) to accommodation (spending on roads, hospitals, airports). \u201cAny development in this direction would further spur the overall economy, continue to push wages in an already tight labour market, and potentially challenge the current expectations around the Federal Reserve\u2019s activity for next year. Most political events have an underwhelming economic impact - could the US midterms prove the exception?\u201d The outcome of the US midterms has been met with relief by financial markets. says Silvia Dall\u2019Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management. However, it may not last long.. Equities and bonds rallied, while the US dollar weakened. Following the correction in equities markets in October, the lift of the uncertainty surrounding the US mid-term elections paves the way for a solid performance of financial markets into year-end. But that could change in 2019 as fundamentals look less supportive and prospects are more uncertain. She also reckons Donald Trump will face a tougher task getting reelected in 2020, as a Democrat-controlled House may launch new probes into the president: The most significant consequences of the US mid-term elections concern the domestic political landscape. Indeed, a divided Congress means President Trump will have a hard time to get his domestic policies approved; in particular, his promised new round of tax cuts will probably never see the light. In addition, Democrats controlling the House will probably use subpoena powers to widen investigation into issues such as Russian interferences in the 2016 elections. All this will make for a challenging environment for President Trump to operate in, lowering his chances of winning a second term in 2020. In the run-up to this week\u2019s elections, Donald Trump floated the idea of a new tax cut for America. The idea looked highly speculative at the time, and has now been washed away by the Blue Wave of votes for Democratic candidates. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, says the tax cut simply won\u2019t happen. That\u2019s good for US fiscal stability, and means Treasury bonds are rallying today (a tax cut would widen the deficit, meaning more government borrowing). If Donald Trump doesn\u2019t play ball with Congress, America could find itself facing another government shutdown. So warns Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics. He told clients this morning the risk of a shutdown has risen. Trump has issued plenty of threats to shutter the government in order to extract funding for his border wall or to rein in non-defence spending, and the risks are surely higher now that he can blame the Democrats. The first flashpoint could come in early December, Hunter explains, when the current government funding bill is due to expire. The big clash could arrive in early 2019, if Congress can\u2019t agree to raise the debt ceiling. Hunter says: The big risk would be a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling when the current suspension expires next spring, which would raise the possibility of a \u201ctechnical\u201d default. Mike Dolan of Reuters has created a neat chart, showing how asset prices have moved since America went to the polling booths yesterday. As you can see, global stock markets (in yellow) are higher, as are European shares (green) and most emerging market currencies (in orange). The dollar (blue) and US bond yields (red) are both down since Tuesday morning. This chart shows how the US dollar is the clear loser in the financial markets today, dropping against all major rivals: The US dollar is extending its earlier losses, and now down 0.6% against other major currencies as a new 12-day low. Bloomberg says: With Democrats winning the House of Representatives majority and Republicans clinching control of the Senate, President Donald Trump\u2019s party loses full control of Congress. The results dim chances for any major fiscal initiative from the administration that might have triggered yield gains and hence a stronger greenback. Mining giants are driving the London stock market higher, with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton both up almost 3%. They\u2019re benefitting from the weaker dollar, explains Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell: \u201cA decline in the dollar following the US midterm elections has given a welcome boost to the mining sector as it will be cheaper for many foreign companies to buy dollar-denominated commodities. There\u2019s also some optimism that Donald Trump might show us the Art of the Deal, and reach a trade agreement with China soon. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at wealth manager Quilter Cheviot, argues that the White House will want to boast about another win soon: Tariffs implemented in September are due to rise from 10% to 25% on the 1 January 2019, and the President has also raised the possibility of putting tariffs on the remaining $250bn of Chinese imports that he has so far left untouched. It may be that Trump adopts a softer stance in an attempt to get a deal on trade, thus allowing him to proclaim that he has \u2018solved\u2019 the China trade issue ahead of his 2020 re-election campaign. You can keep track of all the midterm election results here: Here are five lessons for investors from the midterm elections, from Neil Wilson of Markets.com: Gridlock tends to be good for the stock market, but in this case, it may not be as positive. To a degree the recent selloff in the stock market could be viewed as nervousness ahead of the mid-terms. Of course, the broader macro-economic outlook and US growth story is more important, but we must remember that the US boom is largely a function of Trumponomics \u2013 anything that curtails this will be at least mildly risk-off. A split Congress will, in all likelihood, not stop Trump from doubling down on tariffs with China. This could result in us getting all the anti-growth measures of Trump without more of the pro-growth reforms. Market impact may be relatively muted, although with a slight risk-off tone initially due to uncertainty about what it will mean vis-\u00e0-vis economic policy, tax cuts and deregulation. A lot would depend on how the Trade War progresses and how tax cuts 2.0 do in the face of a split Congress and use of executive orders. Likely bearish for the US dollar and so far seen some slight hints that this is playing out but for now the market reaction is not terrifically strong. It\u2019s going to be harder for Trump to pass more tax cuts, and it may be that reform of Dodd-Frank will die. Pharma stocks may well do well as a divided house probably makes reform of drug pricing off the agenda. Aaron Anderson, senior vice-president for research at wealth manager Fisher Investments, argues that the prospect of political gridlock is actually good for shares. Legislation was hardly flying through Congress before midterms. Now with Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, the GOP increasing its majority in the Senate and President Trump in the White House, it will be nearly impossible to pass anything remotely controversial. That will drive many people crazy, but markets love it. We should now have a long stretch where political risks go way down, which should be good for stocks.\u201d Shares are roaring ahead in early trading in Europe, as investors react to the midterm election results. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 80 points, or over 1%, to 7,119. The French CAC and German DAX are both also up around 1%. Some traders are concluding that gridlock on Capitol Hill could actually be good for America, if it stops Donald Trump driving up the US deficit. Simon French, chief economist at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, argues that the midterm result is \u201cas good as you could hope\u201d. Having the president\u2019s wings clipped by losing control of the House is helpful for avoiding the most obvious \u201cend of cycle policy mistakes\u201d - which in our view is pumping more deficit spending and protectionism into the economy, forcing the Fed to tighten at a faster rate. With the US dollar weakening fast, the pound has gained half a cent to $1.314 - a three week high. The euro has been lifted to a two-week high, at $1.147. Bart Hordijk, market analyst at Monex Europe, says the prospect of Trump and Congress acting like \u201cbickering inmates\u201d for the next two years is hurting the US dollar. \u201cNevertheless, domestic political unrest may throw a spanner in the works for the dollar, as Trump\u2019s relations with the Democrats will be essential in the coming months to determine the course of politics. Potentially Trump, who was once a member of the Democratic Party, may manage to come together with the Democrats and agree on broad tax cuts for the middle class. This could be a boost for the economy and the dollar, assuming markets don\u2019t start to fret about the increasing government deficit. Chances are higher that the Democrats will seize the opportunity to use their new control of certain commissions in the House to step up the investigations in Trump\u2019s tax dealings, relations with Russia and claims of hush money payments. The menacing club of government shutdowns will be the Democrats\u2019 to yield every time Trump goes too far out of line to their taste in the coming months. The dollar may, in the end, get the biggest whack from this.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US dollar is in retreat this morning after the Democrats won control of America\u2019s House of Representatives in a gripping night of election drama. The midterm elections saw a Blue Wave sweep through Congress\u2019s lower chamber, giving the Democratic party fresh power to control president Trump. Checks and balances are back -- although the Republicans did put up a better show in the Senate races, increasing their majority. My colleague David Smith reports from Washington: \u201cWe rebuked Trump and Trumpism at a critical moment,\u201d Ilya Sheyman, executive director of the grassroots organisation MoveOn wrote in a celebratory email. Many Democrats will be tempted to see the glass as half empty, engaging in self-flagellation over narrow defeats for some of its rising stars and a worse-than-expected loss of ground in the Senate. But the truth is that in the face of gerrymandering, voter suppression and an economy that continues to stay in the strong shape that Barack Obama bequeathed, the party reclaimed the House majority for the first time in eight years. That is no small achievement. Opinion polls had predicted that the Democrats would have a good night, so these results shouldn\u2019t shake the financial markets. But the US dollar is already coming under pressure, dropping by 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies to a two-week low this morning. Investors are calculating that there will now be gridlock on Capitol Hill; the House will be free to oppose Trump policies which Democrats don\u2019t agree with. This could prevent the White House forcing tax cuts and new spending on infrastructure such as transport and water systems. So if Trump can\u2019t give the US economy another jolt of fiscal stimulus, the economy may slow...meaning US interest rates might not rise as fast as feared. James Knightley, economist at ING, says president Trump will be feeling blue this morning: While not a great outcome for President Trump, it could have been worse. He clearly had plans to press on with infrastructure spending and further tax reform in the second half of his presidential term and while the policies are not dead, they are likely going to be curtailed or heavily revised by a Democrat-controlled House. Bi-partisanship will be required for progress to be made and for President Trump to generate a strong platform to defend his Presidency in 2020. However, the US economy will face an increasing number of challenges over the next couple of years as support fades from the fiscal stimulus and weaker global growth (contributed to by President Trump\u2019s trade protectionism), a stronger dollar and higher interest rates provide increasing headwinds. A weaker economy and potentially falling asset prices and household wealth would compound the problems for President Trump. We\u2019ll be mopping up financial reaction through the day.

Indeed, a divided Congress means President Trump will have a hard time to get his domestic policies approved; in particular, his promised new round of tax cuts will probably never see the light.</p> <p>In addition, Democrats controlling the House will probably use subpoena powers to widen investigation into issues such as Russian interferences in the 2016 elections.

Of course, the broader macro-economic outlook and US growth story is more important, but we must remember that the US boom is largely a function of Trumponomics \u2013 anything that curtails this will be at least mildly risk-off.</li> <li><strong>A split Congress will, in all likelihood, not stop Trump from doubling down on tariffs with China. </strong>This could result in us getting all the anti-growth measures of Trump without more of the pro-growth reforms.</li> <li><strong>Market impact may be relatively muted,</strong> although with a slight risk-off tone initially due to uncertainty about what it will mean vis-\u00e0-vis economic policy, tax cuts and deregulation. A lot would depend on how the Trade War progresses and how tax cuts 2.0 do in the face of a split Congress and use of executive orders.</li> <li><strong>Likely bearish for the US dollar</strong> and so far seen some slight hints that this is playing out but for now the market reaction is not terrifically strong.</li> <li><strong>It\u2019s going to be harder for Trump to pass more tax cuts</strong>, and it may be that reform of Dodd-Frank will die.

The business organisation said it had no knowledge of the reported plan, which suggested that both its director general Carolyn Fairbairn and the Japanese prime minister would endorse the Brexit deal, if and when it was secured. The trade body said it was not approached by anyone in government and made clear that it would not be blindly roped into any Downing Street communications strategy. \u201cThe CBI has no knowledge of this document \u2013 and will judge any deal on its merits,\u201d said a spokesman. The plan, which Downing Street has said is not current \u201cgovernment thinking\u201d, was widely leaked to the media on Tuesday. It laid out an apparent timetable for the month, starting with the cabinet meeting this Tuesday and culminating in a deal on 27 November. The intervening period would be filled with daily triumphant announcements on all aspects of Brexit including immigration, jobs and the economy, and the NHS. Pencilled in for 19 November was a May speech extolling the unifying impact of her deal. It went on: \u201cGovernment lining up 25 top business voices including Carolyn Fairbairn and lots of world leaders eg Japanese PM to tweet support for the deal.\u201d The CBI, which has been highly critical of Theresa May\u2019s strategy in the past, said the government needed to urgently focus on the deal and not PR. \u201cWith negotiations at a crucial phase, the UK government\u2019s focus at this time must be on the backstop that is key to unlocking the much-needed transition period and future talks. This is urgent. \u201cThe CBI has always been clear on what is needed to make a success of Brexit: a deal that delivers frictionless trade for goods, unprecedented access for services, an open and controlled immigration system, and a say over future rules.\u201d The CBI is deeply concerned about the damage the prospect of Brexit is already causing to it members. On Monday it released new research on business preparations which showed Brexit was having \u201ca negative effect on investment decisions for eight in 10 firms\u201d. Contingency plans were already being put into place which involved cutting jobs, adjusting supply chains, stockpiling goods and relocation of production and services overseas. According to the PR plan, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, and the academic Anand Menon, who has been leading a research programme on the impact of Brexit across a multitude of universities, were also pencilled in for support on 24 November. Downing Street was quick to distance itself from the leaked plan. A source said on Tuesday: \u201cThe misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn\u2019t represent the government\u2019s thinking. You would expect the government to have plans for all situations \u2013 to be clear, this isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d",

The staff were accused of gross misconduct in creating the photo, which was shared widely on various social media platforms, as well as being reported by major news outlets across the world. However, the budget airline later published a video from security cameras allegedly showing the crew moving to a corner of the crew room away from where they were originally sitting and lying down. One crew member then appears to take a photograph. The crew was grounded in the early hours of 13 October in Malaga airport, on the south coast of Spain, because of storms in the Portuguese city, Porto. Ryanair claimed there were no hotel rooms in Malaga available for staff because of the Hispanic Day national holiday, which falls on 12 October. Ryanair said its crew were in the crew room for \u201ca short period of time\u201d before moving to a VIP lounge in the airport. They returned to Porto the next day, and did not work on the flight back. Airline cabin crew are entitled to \u201cadequate\u201d rest before and during shifts, although the extent of rest required is often a point of contention between airlines and staff. Ryanair has faced significant issues with staff strikes. The Irish airline has officially recognised multiple European unions over the course of this year in a bid to improve relations. A Ryanair spokesperson said: \u201cAll six cabin crew members in Porto were dismissed on Monday 5 November for breach of contract on grounds of gross misconduct, after staging a fake photograph to support a false claim (widely reported in international media outlets) that they were \u2018forced to sleep on the floor\u2019 of the Malaga crew room.\u201d The airline described the photo as \u201cbehaviour which damaged their employer\u2019s reputation and caused an irreparable breach of trust with these six persons\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The John Lewis Partnership is searching for a new chair after it announced Sir Charlie Mayfield is stepping down in 2020. The group, which owns Waitrose and the John Lewis chain of department stores, said it would consider external candidates as well as insiders as replacements for Mayfield, who has held the post for 11 years. Likely internal candidates include Paula Nickolds, the managing director of the John Lewis department stores, Rob Collins, the head of Waitrose, and the group finance director, Patrick Lewis. Sources suggested that if John Lewis wanted to hire an external candidate unfamiliar with its democratic structures and employee-ownership model the company would have to change the role of the chair to make it less closely involved with the running of the company\u2019s two divisions. While it might be possible to hire former senior employees such as Andy Street, now Conservative mayor for the West Midlands, and Lord Price, now chair of the Fairtrade Foundation, both are thought unlikely to return to their alma mater as they focus on new careers. The new chair will not be announced until the second half of 2019. One person close to the company said that gave a long time to prepare a potential outsider for the role. Retail headhunter Moira Benigson, of the MBS Group, said John Lewis should consider bringing in an outsider with retail or consumer expertise such as former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King, former Boots boss Richard Baker who is now chair of Virgin Active, Allan Leighton who currently chairs the Co-operative Group, or Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV. \u201cIt would be good to have a fresh pair of eyes on the problem, which is first John Lewis\u2019s problem and then a general retail problem,\u201d she said. The search for a new chairman comes at a challenging time for the employee-owned business. Profits have fallen amid rising costs and a structural shift in the market towards online shopping which is leading troubled rivals to close stores or offer more discounts. House of Fraser is in a state of flux after being bought out of administration by Sports Direct while Debenhams has said it could close up to 50 stores, nearly a third of the chain. Mayfield\u2019s departure had been expected internally. The company\u2019s constitution states that a chairman\u2019s tenure can be renewed for three years after the first 10, but is only likely to be extended further in exceptional circumstances. Mayfield said: \u201cAlthough my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. It is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership.\u201d",

The huge payout \u2013 awarded for \u201coutstanding performance\u201d \u2013 unleashed a furore about executive excess, and on Wednesday Persimmon said Fairburn was stepping down at the request of the company because the controversy was having a negative impact on the reputation of the business. Fairburn\u2019s exit comes weeks after he walked out of a TV interview having refused to answer questions about his taxpayer-fuelled bonus. Fairburn told the BBC journalist it was \u201creally unfortunate that you\u2019ve done that [asked about the bonus]\u201d, before walking out of shot. The man stepping into Fairburn\u2019s shoes, managing director David Jenkinson, collected a bonus worth \u00a340.5m from the same long-term incentive plan (LTIP). The bonus scheme, believed to be most generous ever from a FTSE 100 company, paid out about \u00a3500m worth of shares to 150 senior staff. Fairburn had been in line for a \u00a3110m payout before it was scaled back in the face of political and public outrage. The vast bonuses result from a scheme linked to the housebuilder\u2019s share price, which soared thanks to the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme. About half of Persimmon\u2019s homes are bought with the assistance of the government scheme. Persimmon said that because it had asked Fairburn to leave it was legally prevented from asking for him to return any of his bonus. A spokesman conceded that had Fairburn left the firm of his own accord, he would have had to hand back \u00a39.7m. \u201cAs Jeff is leaving at the company\u2019s request, legal advice has confirmed that the company does not have any discretion to withhold or seek forfeiture [of the bonus shares],\u201d the company said. The revelation sparked fresh political anger on Wednesday. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said it was \u201cright that he\u2019s going, [but] wrong that he walks away with so much money\u201d. \u201cThis hugely excessive payout is not a reflection of his personal performance, it is a reflection of the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme which has fuelled the housing market,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe scheme was introduced to help people get on the housing ladder, not reward executives with multimillion-pound payouts. \u201cPersimmon does not pay the living wage and yet can afford obscene payouts for the chief exec,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is totally unjustifiable that they can afford to give one bloke \u00a375m but they say they can\u2019t pay their cleaners, security staff and people working in the canteen a living wage, which has to be topped up by universal credit\u201d. The company said it had signed up to pay the \u00a39 an hour living wage from January 2019. The average salary at the firm is \u00a335,600. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, demanded the government intervene to change executive pay rules. \u201cIt is a ridiculous situation when you can keep \u00a375m for being sacked,\u201d he said. \u201cHe ought to have gone a long time ago, it seems that the board has finally learned that it cannot overpay greedy executives. This situation cannot be allowed to happen again and other executives must understand from this \u2013 excessive greed is no longer tolerable.\u201d Fairburn, who has worked at York-based Persimmon for 29 years, attempted to dampen the controversy in February by stating that he would donate a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of his windfall to charity. Speaking on Wednesday, he said: \u201cI had hoped that revealing my plans to create a charitable trust and to waive a proportion of the award would enable the company to put the issue of the 2012 LTIP behind it. However, this has not been the case and so it is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down.\u201d Fairburn, 52, has repeatedly refused to state how much he intents to donate to charity or which causes he will support. The Guardian has previously calculated that his bonus could be used to help home all of the 760 homeless families in Yorkshire and Humber. Euan Stirling, head of stewardship at Standard Life Aberdeen, one of Persimmon\u2019s biggest shareholders, said: \u201cPersimmon\u2019s reputation has been tarnished by issues around Jeff Fairburn\u2019s pay.\u201d At the company\u2019s annual meeting earlier this year, Stirling launched an astonishing attack on the board for approving \u201csuch excessive\u201d payments. \u201cRegardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs them,\u201d Stirling said. \u201cToday\u2019s remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay.\u201d In its statement on Wednesday Persimmon admitted the pay row had become a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Garry White, chief investment commentator at investment manager Charles Stanley, said: \u201cJeff Fairburn won the equivalent of an LTIP lottery. The ticket was handed to him by George Osborne, but was bought for him by Britain taxpayers. About half the company\u2019s houses are sold via the government-backed help-to-buy scheme and the debacle demonstrates why LTIPs are a poor way to reward company executives. \u201cShare price moves can be gamed by corporate action such as share buybacks and the imperfect system introduced by Persimmon has given the impression of corporate looting. All such schemes should have an upper limit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest cash prizes in world economics has been launched to find \u201cradical ideas\u201d to reinvigorate the British economy. Launched against a backdrop of deep public distrust in politicians to revitalise the UK economy, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank has lined up an \u00a3150,000 prize fund to uncover fresh ideas. It comes after growth figures revealed at the budget show economic growth in Britain has dropped to among the lowest levels in the G7, while inequality has risen and there are growing pressures on the environment. Believed to be the third-biggest prize in international economics, the new IPPR prize will reward policy solutions to tackle these problems, while forcing a \u201cstep change in the quality and quantity of the UK\u2019s economic growth.\u201d It will include a single main prize of \u00a3100,000, placing it among the most lucrative prizes in the economics profession after the 9m Swedish krona (\u00a3760,455) Nobel award from the Swedish central bank and the \u00a3250,000 Wolfson prize, which was launched in 2011 by the Tory peer and Next chief executive Simon Wolfson. The IPPR economics prize \u2013 supported by the prominent Labour donor and Brexit campaigner John Mills \u2013 will also have a dedicated under-25s prize worth \u00a325,000, and a runners-up prize pot of \u00a325,000. Mills, who is the founder of the JML consumer products company, said that Britain faced a \u201ctoxic cocktail of issues that need fresh solutions,\u201d adding that growth has recently been 60% lower than the G20 average. \u201cWe are falling further behind every year. Our productivity is poor, levels of investment are meagre, and we cannot pay our way in the world,\u201d he added. According to opinion polling on the economy commissioned by the IPPR, almost four fifths of Britons would describe the current crop of \u201cleading politicians\u201d from across the political divide as stale and unimaginative. Fewer than a quarter of people in the poll, which was conducted from more than 1,400 Sky customers, said they were confident that the government could come up with new ideas required to boost economic growth. Fewer than a quarter of people were confident that the current government could come up with the right solutions, while more than 80% of those who voted either Conservative or Labour at the last election said UK politicians were unimaginative. Although launched by the centre-left IPPR, the winner of the new economics prize will be selected by a panel of senior business leaders and economists, chaired by Stephanie Flanders, the head of economics at Bloomberg. Mills will sit on the panel, alongside other judges including Helena Morrissey, the prominent City fund manager, Shriti Vadera, the chair of Santander UK, and John Eatwell, who is president of Queen\u2019s College, Cambridge. It comes after the IPPR\u2019s commission on economic justice, which included Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, called for a far-reaching and radical revamp of the UK economy to raise the standard of living of millions of workers. With a deadline of 6 January 2019, entrants for the economics prize will be asked to answer the question: \u201cWhat would be your radical plan to force a step change in the quality and quantity of the UK\u2019s economic growth?\u201d",
