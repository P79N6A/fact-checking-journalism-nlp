      "bodyText": "Private equity company 3i, which owns companies such as fashion chain Hobbs, has pledged to change its pay policies after shareholders staged a rebellion at the annual general meeting. The company, in which New York-based investment house Sherborne has built up a 5% stake, is to change the length of time over which its long-term bonuses pay out after more than one in three investors failed to support the remuneration report. Sir Adrian Montague, 3i's chairman, said the company had heeded concerns by institutional shareholders about a change to the vesting of long-term incentive plans made last year, which accelerated the timeframe over which the schemes paid out to top directors \u2013 including chief executive Simon Borrows who received \u00a32.5m in salary and bonuses last year. Directors would have to wait only three and half years rather than five. Montague said the change would be reversed and the bonus scheme pay out in future as it had done previously, with 50% vesting after three years and then 25% in each of the subsequent two years. The results of the vote of the annual meeting showed that 21% of investors voted against the remuneration report, a level of dissent which rises to 35% if deliberate abstentions are included. The rebellion took place despite attempts by the new management team to structure the business and pledge to hand shareholders up to 20% of the proceeds of any sales of the businesses in which it invests. Borrows, a former investment banker, was promoted from running 3i's investments to replace Michael Queen as chief executive last year. Shares in the company have risen more than 70% since the start of the year as it has begun to shift its business from pure private equity investments into more investments into infrastructure. Borrows has already cut 168 jobs and is scaling back on its offices around the world. In January, 3i disclosed that activist investment house Sherborne \u2013 run by the British-born Edward Bramson \u2013 had begun to amass a stake which has since reached 5%. Bramson is best known in the City for staging a boardroom coup at fund management company F&amp;C two years ago and his presence on the 3i shareholder register is likely to have also helped bolster the share price.",

The taxpayer might get a \u00a36bn-8bn bill for enhanced infrastructure around the airport.</p> <p><strong>The downside</strong> At least one of six villages nearby would be flattened. An extra 240,000 planes a year would fly over London and, while Heathrow claims planes will become quieter thanks to technological breakthroughs, opponents say noise would only increase.</p> <p><strong>Will it happen?</strong> The bookies' favourite. Heathrow has the most powerful voice in British aviation and is home to British Airways. If Davies accepts the hub airport theory, this is the easiest option. But it would be bitterly opposed by environmentalists and residents of west London.</p> <p>Gatwick and Stansted</p> <p><strong>The idea</strong> Gatwick has launched constant broadsides against Heathrow's argument that a single hub is the most desirable outcome for the country.</p> <p>It points out that 90% of passengers at London airports start or end their journey in the capital and most passengers prefer to fly direct to their destinations, instead of transferring to a connecting flight at a hub airport.</p> <p>. Global Infrastructure Partners, Gatwick's owner, believes that former owners BAA had little interest in developing a rival to Heathrow. GIP says proper investment is making Gatwick a genuine competitor. A new runway would let it grow further when it nears capacity in the next decade. To make a \"constellation\" of competing airports, it suggests giving Stansted a second runway, too.</p> <p><strong>The cost</strong> An estimated \u00a35bn, paid by the airport, although Gatwick has not made its submission public.</p> <p><strong>The downside</strong> About 17 listed buildings would be demolished, although the area is scantily populated compared with Heathrow.</p> <p><strong>Will it happen?</strong> 4-1 against. An agreement rules out new runways until 2019 and, for all the \"constellation\" talk, airlines pay through the nose to be at Heathrow rather than take up the empty space at Gatwick. Bar a radical shift in mindset or economics, there seems little rush to expand here.</p> <p>Hub to the east</p> <p><strong>The idea</strong> The London mayor agrees that one, bigger, hub airport is necessary. But Johnson is against expanding Heathrow, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of people already badly affected by aircraft noise. He says a new, four-runway hub could regenerate poorer areas to the east of London.</p> <p>His favoured scheme is the Lord Foster proposal on the Isle of Grain, although he has also submitted plans to the Davies commission for an alternative on an artificial island in the Thames estuary or for the substantial redevelopment of Stansted.</p> <p><strong>The cost</strong> At least \u00a323bn \u2013 but additional infrastructure such as new roads and railways pushes the cost past \u00a350bn. Johnson hopes for some private investment but his record with London's cable car and bike hire suggests taxpayers would foot most of the bill.</p> <p><strong>The downside</strong> Noise and air pollution would affect far fewer people than Heathrow does, but countryside would disappear and new towns would have to be developed to sustain the airport. Isolation would put greater pressure on surface links and mean longer journeys to the airport.</p> <p><strong>Will it happen? </strong>The Isle of Grain, not favoured by the bookies, looks more feasible than the Boris Island schemes. But it would have to deal with a range of issues including airspace congestion. The accompanying closure of Heathrow makes it an enormous political gamble.</p> <p>The regions</p> <p><strong>The idea</strong> Birmingham and Manchester airports have plenty of spare capacity but millions of passengers who live on their doorsteps travel down to London to get a plane. If these regional airports were talked up by the government and designated national airports, with supporting infrastructure and incentives, they believe more foreign airlines would use them. Between them, they could handle 56m more passengers, which is more than a third runway at Heathrow would bring.</p> <p><strong>The cost</strong> No new runways needed, although the HS2 railway (\u00a350bn) is a crucial ingredient in its success.</p> <p><strong>The downside</strong> More noise, but less upheaval. Birmingham has already started expanding its runway without demolitions, to fit the largest long-haul planes, and Manchester has two runways for the job now.</p> <p><strong>Will it happen?</strong> It could happen by default if Davies and the government shy away from building new runways in south-east England.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Stansted airport is expected to give the government the option of building a second runway there on Friday's deadline for submissions to the Davies commission on airport expansion. The owner of Stansted, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), will put in a \"flexible\" submission to the government's airports commission which would allow for the expansion at the Essex site that has been called for by London mayor Boris Johnson and even rival Gatwick. However, MAG will also argue that the government should make more use of existing capacity in the north of England rather than channel traffic through the southeast. Stansted is adding its submission to those of Heathrow, which this week published three alternatives for a third runway, and Gatwick, which has submitted plans for a second runway in 2019. Johnson has proposed two different sites in the Thames estuary or the transformation of Stansted into a new, four-runway hub airport, to replace Heathrow. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary made a submission on Thursday calling for extra runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, urging the government not to waste years and billions of pounds on \"Boris Island\". The prime minister, David Cameron, instigated the commission last year after pressure from his own MPs and business groups to reconsider the case for airport expansion in south-east England. Heathrow and others in the aviation industry have claimed that Britain's economic interests are harmed by insufficient space at the nation's main airport to meet pent-up demand for long-haul flights to emerging markets. The commission, led by former Financial Services Authority boss Howard Davies, will consider all the submissions and draw up a shortlist of feasible options to be announced by the end of this year in an interim report. It will issue its final recommendations in 2015. Heathrow: a third runway The idea Heathrow says the only airport capacity that matters is hub capacity. This means extra runways are needed at an airport big enough to host connecting flights whose passengers then transfer to long-haul services. The airport is 99% full and it has set out three possible locations for a third runway, although combinations of their plans could also allow a fourth or even fifth runway in the future. The cost Between \u00a314bn and \u00a319bn, paid for by Heathrow. The taxpayer might get a \u00a36bn-8bn bill for enhanced infrastructure around the airport. The downside At least one of six villages nearby would be flattened. An extra 240,000 planes a year would fly over London and, while Heathrow claims planes will become quieter thanks to technological breakthroughs, opponents say noise would only increase. Will it happen? The bookies' favourite. Heathrow has the most powerful voice in British aviation and is home to British Airways. If Davies accepts the hub airport theory, this is the easiest option. But it would be bitterly opposed by environmentalists and residents of west London. Gatwick and Stansted The idea Gatwick has launched constant broadsides against Heathrow's argument that a single hub is the most desirable outcome for the country. It points out that 90% of passengers at London airports start or end their journey in the capital and most passengers prefer to fly direct to their destinations, instead of transferring to a connecting flight at a hub airport. . Global Infrastructure Partners, Gatwick's owner, believes that former owners BAA had little interest in developing a rival to Heathrow. GIP says proper investment is making Gatwick a genuine competitor. A new runway would let it grow further when it nears capacity in the next decade. To make a \"constellation\" of competing airports, it suggests giving Stansted a second runway, too. The cost An estimated \u00a35bn, paid by the airport, although Gatwick has not made its submission public. The downside About 17 listed buildings would be demolished, although the area is scantily populated compared with Heathrow. Will it happen? 4-1 against. An agreement rules out new runways until 2019 and, for all the \"constellation\" talk, airlines pay through the nose to be at Heathrow rather than take up the empty space at Gatwick. Bar a radical shift in mindset or economics, there seems little rush to expand here. Hub to the east The idea The London mayor agrees that one, bigger, hub airport is necessary. But Johnson is against expanding Heathrow, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of people already badly affected by aircraft noise. He says a new, four-runway hub could regenerate poorer areas to the east of London. His favoured scheme is the Lord Foster proposal on the Isle of Grain, although he has also submitted plans to the Davies commission for an alternative on an artificial island in the Thames estuary or for the substantial redevelopment of Stansted. The cost At least \u00a323bn \u2013 but additional infrastructure such as new roads and railways pushes the cost past \u00a350bn. Johnson hopes for some private investment but his record with London's cable car and bike hire suggests taxpayers would foot most of the bill. The downside Noise and air pollution would affect far fewer people than Heathrow does, but countryside would disappear and new towns would have to be developed to sustain the airport. Isolation would put greater pressure on surface links and mean longer journeys to the airport. Will it happen? The Isle of Grain, not favoured by the bookies, looks more feasible than the Boris Island schemes. But it would have to deal with a range of issues including airspace congestion. The accompanying closure of Heathrow makes it an enormous political gamble. The regions The idea Birmingham and Manchester airports have plenty of spare capacity but millions of passengers who live on their doorsteps travel down to London to get a plane. If these regional airports were talked up by the government and designated national airports, with supporting infrastructure and incentives, they believe more foreign airlines would use them. Between them, they could handle 56m more passengers, which is more than a third runway at Heathrow would bring. The cost No new runways needed, although the HS2 railway (\u00a350bn) is a crucial ingredient in its success. The downside More noise, but less upheaval. Birmingham has already started expanding its runway without demolitions, to fit the largest long-haul planes, and Manchester has two runways for the job now. Will it happen? It could happen by default if Davies and the government shy away from building new runways in south-east England.",

I'm surprised more businesses haven't adopted something like this.\" So says Dave Forsey, chief executive of Sports Direct, where the share-based bonus scheme is showering rewards on the 2,000 or so employees who qualified for the 2009 plan and stayed with the business. Profit targets have been beaten every year and the imminent release of the latest batch of shares means some individuals will soon have received equity worth about \u00a3100,000 at today's share price. In part, the numbers are so impressive because the recovery in Sports Direct's shares has been so spectacular. The 2009 scheme used prices of 100p and 125p to calculate potential rewards as a percentage of salary; now that payday has arrived, the shares trade at 638p. But that's not a coincidence. As Forsey says: \"The schemes have been crucial to influencing staff behaviour and maximising the group performance.\" So why don't other retailers copy Sports Direct? Many operate share-based schemes but few do so on the scale of the sports retailer. The main reason, one suspects, is that companies believe only the officer class responds to the lure of a big bonus or can make a meaningful difference to performance. Sports Direct, let's hope, has demolished that prejudice. Mike Ashley, owner of 70% of the company, is not running a worker's co-operative. Nor was it an act of charity of his part when he set up the 2009 scheme. Ashley was pursuing the entirely commercial objectives of trying to reduce staff turnover and increase productivity. He was also making the straightforward calculation that issuing 21m new shares to staff (less than 5% of the share base) would be a bargain if profit targets were met. Now that Ashley has shown how it's done, others should follow. Indeed, City shareholders should insist on it: it might be in their own interests.",

    "webTitle": "Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble: Greece could get more help, but debt haircut talk must end - eurozone crisis as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here is analysis of today's visit from our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith: One cannot help thinking that German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s visit to Athens is long overdue. It should have happened somewhere near the start of the crisis, when the staggering nature of Greece\u2019s debt load first became apparent \u2013 and the tiny country on the edge of Europe needed all the help it could get. But back then, of course, Berlin was too busy excoriating Athens and meting out punishment for its fiscal recklessness to even contemplate such a thing. Now, nine months after the German chancellor Angela Merkel made a similar trip to the Greek capital, there is something deeply disconcerting about the Sch\u00e4uble visit. At best it rings hollow; at worst farcical. For the entire day Athens has resembled a ghost-town, its transit network closed down, its roads sealed off. In the capital where democracy was born there have been no major protest because nobody has been allowed to shout as much as \u201cHerr Schauble\u201d in public. (until his final press conference....) And that\u2019s a name everyone has wanted to bellow out of sheer frustration with the record levels of unemployment, disarray, poverty and angst the German finance minister is so exclusively identified with. Again and again we heard \u2013 mostly from the lips of the Greek finance minister and other senior government officials \u2013 that Sch\u00e4uble had come to Athens with a message of solidarity and \u201cto speak to the Greek people.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. Schauble did bear a message but it was for his own people (and the 500,000-strong Greek minority) in Germany ahead of elections this September. In a country now decimated by the medicine he has personally prescribed, the pledge for \u20ac100m in loans to kick-start business activity in a market made lifeless by lack of liquidity is nothing but a cynical drop in the ocean. The German finance minister\u2019s visit today was a PR stunt aimed not at placating Greeks but kidding Germans that all is well in the euro zone \u2013 when all is not. HS And on that note, I'm wrapping the blog up for the day. Thanks all , and goodnight. GW. Efforts to prevent protests against the German finance minister were not a total success. As reported at 4.54pm, a small group of people managed to reach the front of the finance ministry, to shout protests at Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Here are photos of them in action: With Wolfgang Schauble's visit over, there are reports that protests against the security clampdown will take place tonight: And there's plenty of concern that such measures were introduced at all: In the financial markets, Europe's stock markets have closed higher -- fuelled by the the optimism on Wall Street that has pushed shares to record intraday highs in New York (see 3.26pm). \u2022 FTSE 100: up 62 points at 6634, +0.95% \u2022 German Dax: up 82 points at 8337, +1% \u2022 French CAC: up 55 points at 3927, + 1.44% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 144 points at 7957, + 1.85% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 358 points at 16053, +2.23% Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, confirms that the decent US jobs data this afternoon had cheered the City: The FTSE 100\u2019s charge back to its highs for the year continued unabated this afternoon, after another drop in US employment claims emboldened investors and sent the index firmly through 6600. After a few days languishing in the summer sun, investors seem to have recovered their summer optimism, with even a second day of testimony from Ben Bernanke being unable to keep their exuberance in check. Fed chair Bernanke was testifying at the Senate today, but not really expanding on his appearance yesterday at Congress (comment from my colleague Heidi Moore) That's the key points from the second Sch\u00e4uble press conference of the day. The event is over, and the German finance minister is now making his way to the airport. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports that a few female protesters managed to get outside the entrance of the finance ministry to heckle the finance minister. It's not clear how they evaded the security cordon and reach the ministry, which overlooks Syntagma square. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras is also at the press conference with Sch\u00e4uble. He's just explained that the government's goal is to combine \"fiscal consolidation and economic growth\". Large numbers of people will suffer, and be left on the sidelines, if we fail, he adds. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble was pretty clear that Athens could be offered more help next year, but only if it earns it: If Greece (towards the end of 2014) has implemented its reforms and has reached a primary surplus then we will negotiate further measures if necessary. My advice is that everyone concentrates on ... doing what we have agreed because only if we implement what we agreed step by step, can we regain reliability, trust and through that growth. That's more conciliatory than his earlier comments that people should stop asking about a Greek debt cut now (see here) \u2013 although it adds up to the same message. The press conference continues.... Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is now speaking to the press in Athens -- beginning by telling reporters that Greece must solve its problems swiftly. He also repeated his point from earlier today that further aid measures could be discussed if Greece implements the reforms it's committed to, and returns to a primary budget surplus. More to follow.... From Athens, Helena Smith reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's \u20ac100m in loans for Greek firms, and his encouraging words about Greece's progress, have not deterred all of his critics. Helena writes: The conciliatory moves will do little to assuage public sentiment for the man most identified with the painful cutbacks inflicted on the nation in exchange for aid. In the hate stakes, Sch\u00e4uble is even more loathed than the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who made a similarly symbolic visit to Greece last October. With Greece at boiling point following the adoption of yet more internationally mandated austerity measures in the wake of parliament's vote to slash 25,000 jobs in the public sector, opposition leaders said it was wrong for Sch\u00e4uble to be visiting at all. \"For us he is persona non grata,\" said Panos Kammenos, leader of the vociferously anti-austerity Independent Greeks party as the 300-seat house debated the job losses. \"Has anyone mentioned to him that Germany still owes Greece war reparations?\" More here: Security tight in Greece as German finance minister Sch\u00e4uble arrives While Athens is unusually quiet, Wall Street is rocking. Both main stock indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500, have hit all-time record highs in the last few minutes. Forecast-beating financial results from Morgan Stanley helped trigger the rally. Two pieces of stronger-than-expected US economic data also pushed shares up: First, the weekly survey of America's labour market showed fewer people signing on for unemployment benefit for the first time. New claims dropped to 334,000 last week, down from 358,000. Secondly, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's index of business conditions came in much stronger than expected. It adds up to a stronger US economy \u2013 which would be welcome news for the eurozone as it tries to escape resesion. And while shares rose, the prices paid for US Treasuries (America's government debt) fell. Good economic news makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will slow its bond-buying programme later this year. Another shot of Athens today, showing the impact of the security clampdown that prevents people protesting in the centre of the capital. A remarkable transformation for Syntagma Square -- which we've seen filled with protestors on so many occasions in the last three years. All this, just for the visit of a finance minister.... Economist Shaun Richards has written an interesting piece on the Netherland's economic woes (I covered today's worrying Dutch jobs data and consumer confidence at 10.03am). He argues that the Dutch manufacturing sector has suffered from euro membership, while banks have been hit by a slump in property prices and unemployment has been climbing for a while. He concludes: Dutch banking sector is in danger of going so far underwater that it finds the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. What price bank lending then? In such a scenario it may not only be in Athens that the German Finance Minister will need 4,000 police deployed to protect him. Here's the full piece: Is the Netherlands suffering from a new Dutch Disease? Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble may be on a charm offensive but behind-the-scenes there is much talk of war reparations, reports our correspondent in Athens Helena Smith: Helena writes: War reparations are a neuralgic point that few German politicians can ever avoid and today, as finance minister Sch\u00e4uble held talks with prime minister Antonis Samaras and other officials in Athens' governing coalition, the main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras ensured it was raised. Meeting Greece\u2019s octogenarian head of state, Carolos Papoulias, barely a block away, the radical leftist repeated that it was wrong to sweep the issue of compensation for crimes committed during the Nazis\u2019 savage occupation of the country \u201cunder the carpet.\u201d A world war II veteran, Papoulias has strongly supported the compensation claim. Sch\u00e4uble has been one of the most fiercest critics of Greece\u2019s attempt to win further reparations from Berlin saying \u201cthe issue was settled a long time ago. Paying reparations is out of the question.\u201d His rejection has added to the sour mood between the two countries. In the war of words between Athens and Berlin over the issue, Tsipras hopes to at least have embarassed Sch\u00e4uble on his home turf. Next on Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's agenda was a session with prime minister Antonis Samaras, at the Maximon Mansion in Athens, where both men happily posed for the cameras. Sch\u00e4uble is then due to formally sign the cooperation agreement between Greece and the government-owned German bank KfW, unlocking \u20ac100m of loans, around 4pm local time (2pm BST). There are water cannons near the Greek parliament building, and close to the Ministry of Finance, as part of the security cordon imposed to protect Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble today. As well as the 4,000 police officers deployed, police buses have been parked to block traffic on some major streets. Several tube stations in the centre of Athens have also been closed. The security operation has left Syntagma Square, the scene of so many protests since the crisis began, eerily empty. Protests and demonstrations are outlawed until 8pm tonight (6pm BST) within the security cordon set up in the centre of Athens. This map, by Damian Mac Con Uladh of Enet English and the Irish Times, shows the extend of the clampdown, which also covers the route to and from the main Athens airport: The map's online here too. Here's the key quote from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, when he warned Greece to stop talking about another debt writedown (see 11.47am): My advice is not to continue this discussion. We have to stick to what we've achieved. Anything else is not in the best interest of Greece. Another haircut beyond the 53 percent for the private sector is not doable. (via Reuters) The 53% figure is a reference to the deal agreed in February 2012, when private creditors agreed to write off slightly more than half the value of their Greek bonds. The event is now over. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has urged an end to the speculation that Greece will soon require another debt restructuring to bring its borrowings to more sustainable levels. Asked about the possibily of a second haircut, the German finance minister said that such discussion is counterproductive for Greece at this stage. The Greek government must stick to what has been agreed, he insisted. Capital GR's Efthimia Efthimiou confirms: However, Sch\u00e4uble did offer the possibility of further aid in 2014 if Greece is meeting its targets and achieves a primary surplus. The fourth man on the stage, minister Kostis Chatzidakis, confirmed that Greece was creating an investment partnership with Germany's development bank. The deal is meant to help small Greek borrow at affordable rates, at a time when the eurozone's weaker members are suffering a credit crunch. Development Minister Kostis Hatzidakis is also attending the event. He warned that Greece faces the biggest battle in a generation, but it is determined to win it -- and the solidarity it shares with its European partners will help. Can Germany teach Greece a few lessons, a reporter asks? Sch\u00e4uble declines to fall into this trap, saying every country has its problems. Wolfgang Schauble also confirmed that Germany will provide funds (thought to be \u20ac100m) for loans to Greek firms. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras then spoke to the gathering, at the German-Hellenic Chamber. Looking in good spirits after last night's austerity bill vote, Stournaras welcomed Sch\u00e4uble to Greece -- saying that the things that unite Germany and Greece are far greater than those that divide them. Stourmaras said Europe needs \"deepening political and economic unification\" to ride out the crisis and return to growth. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble preached a message of 'progress made, but more progress needed', at the press conference which is currently underway (live feed). The German finance minister told reporters that \"Greece reform is showing the first signs of success\", although there was \"still a lot of work to do\". He also reminded the audience that Germany was \"the sick man of Europe\" a decade ago (true, but its symptoms were hardly as severe are Greece's today) Sch\u00e4uble said the goal for the eurozone was to \"help countries to help themselves\". The long-term challenge for the single currency region, he added, is healthy public finances and well-adjusted labour markets. Dimitris Bounias, a jourrnalists in Athens, sums it up: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is now speaking alongside his Greek counterpart Yannis Stournaras now, before an audience of Greek businessmen and journalists. It's being livestreamed here: (with Sch\u00e4uble translated into Greek). Highlights to follow.... Spain, meanwhile, has shrugged off the slush fund scandal swirling around prime minister Mariano Rajoy, and rumours of a credit rating downgrade. It raised just over \u20ac3bn, more than its official maximum target, through sn auction of several bonds this morning. Borrowing costs fell, showing investors aren't worrying that Spain's political crisis will turn into a financial one. Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy commented: The party finance scandal that's rocking the Rajoy government is, for the time being, a non-event as far as sentiment towards Spain is concerned. Investors' insouciance, coupled with cynicism and apathy on the part of Spanish voters, is playing into the hands of the government. But.... The scandal is not only severely undermining the authority of the Rajoy government, it is making it doubly difficult for Spain to push ahead with fiscal and structural reforms. It's also a reminder, if one were needed, that the biggest stumbling-block to shoring up the ill-managed eurozone is domestic politics. Another shot of the security cordon: And here's a shot of a few of the 4,000 police on the streets of Athens: Back to Greece, and Theodora Oikonomides tweets a photo of the security lockdown for Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's visit: The Netherlands, a key part of the eurozone's once-strong Northern core, continues to suffer. The Dutch unemployment rate has risen to 8.5% in June, Statistics Nethlands reported this morning, up from 8.3% in May and sharply higher than the 6.3% recorded in June 2012. No wonder consumer confidence is sliding, hitting -38 in July from -36 in June. Elsewhere in the eurozone, Spain's banks are increasingly burdened by toxic debts as the country's economy keeps shrinking. The Bank of Spain has reported that the ratio of bad debts across the banking sector rose to 11.2% of total credit in May, up from 10.9% in April. Another \u20ac3.1bn of debts fell into arrears during the month, taking the total to \u20ac170bn. Many will be property investments which turned sour once the Spanish construction bubble burst. The bad debt ratio is moving close to the 11.38% hit last November, before banks were able to transfer some debts to the new Spanish bad bank (details here). Athens journalist Efthimia Efthimiou flags up that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has touched down in Athens... Schauble has already ruled out a new haircut on Greek loans, telling Info Radio this morning that \"no one who understands a little bit\" of the issue believes a debt restructuring is needed now. However, 'further aid\" could possibly be considered in 2014, he added, if Greece continues to meet its targets. More here (in German) There's a heavy police presence in Athens today for Sch\u00e4uble's visit -- as Gavin Hewitt of the BBC notes: The Financial Times calls Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble's visit a 'demonstration of confidence' in the Athens govenrment. With a German election looming in the autumn, the finance minister must be keen to paint a picture of an improving eurozone. He's bearing a small gift for the Greeks -- a memorandum of understanding to provide \u20ac100m in loans to Greek firms, through Germany's development bank, called KfW. The FT's man in Berlin, Quentin Peel, explains: The precise details of KfW\u2019s Greek counterpart, a new fund called the Institute for Growth, are still months away from finalisation. It will be incorporated under Luxembourg law, and has yet to draw up a business plan, it is said in Berlin. The news that protests have been banned in the centre of Athens during Wolfgang Schauble's visit today has angered opposition MPs. Greek police have set up a cordon around the city center in which \"public gatherings and rallies\" are outlawed. It started at 9am local time (7am BST) and will run until 8:00 pm (6pm BST). Panos Skourletis, a spokesman for the left-wing main opposition party, Syriza, blasted the move, telling Associated Press: This action is fascist and undemocratic. It is inconceivable to have a demonstration and to exclude Syntagma Square. It is inconceivable for any European city. Now MPs have approved these latest austerity cuts, Greece will receive its next aid tranche from its Troika of lenders. The challenge, though, is in actually implementing the job cuts and other economic 'reforms'. That wil put Antonis Samaras's government under more pressure, and Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts it will collapse next year. Here's our latest news story on last night's vote: Greece simmers as Antonis Samaras government passes more austerity cuts Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. They came, they saw, they protested, but last night the thousands of people gathered outside the Greek parliament were unable to stop MPs narrowly voting in favour of legislation to lay off thousands of public sector workers. The session proved to be a narrow win for Antonis Samaras's government. Narrower than some had expected. A total of 153 MPs voted in favour of the measures, demanded by its Troika of lenders. Two government MPs failed to back the plan, following a week of protests. The legislation allows Greece to lay off 15,000 civil servants by the end of next year. It will also lead to 12,500 public-sector staff, mostly teachers and municipal workers, being placed in a 'mobility scheme' where they could be forced to take another job or be laid off. Yannis Stournaras, finance minister, had told the parliament that the government was pursuing the right strategy: I fully understand the hardship the Greek people are going through during the great crisis. But I am fully convinced that the path we have chosen is correct. The crowds outside the parliament (esimates range from 3,000 to 5,000) had chanted \"We will not succumb, the only option is to resist\", in a last attempt to see off the cuts. As Patra Hatziharalampous, a 52-year-old school guard in uniform, explained: After 12 years on the job, they fire us in one night. If they have any guts, they should say no to the bailout and take some of the bill's articles back. With the bill passed, Athens can now look forward to a visit today from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who many in Greece blame for pushing the tough cutbacks forced on the country in recent years. Sch\u00e4uble is expected to announce fresh financial help for Greek businesses (more on this shortly). And in an effort to prevent the trip turning nasty, public protests in central Athens have been banned today.... I'll be tracking events in Athens and beyond through the day...",

It should have happened somewhere near the start of the crisis, when the staggering nature of Greece\u2019s debt load first became apparent \u2013 and the tiny country on the edge of Europe needed all the help it could get. But back then, of course, Berlin was too busy excoriating Athens and meting out punishment for its fiscal recklessness to even contemplate such a thing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, nine months after the German chancellor Angela Merkel made a similar trip to the Greek capital, there is something deeply disconcerting about the&#xa0;Sch\u00e4uble visit. At best it rings hollow; at worst farcical. For the entire day Athens has resembled a ghost-town, its transit network closed down, its roads sealed off. In the capital where democracy was born there have been no major protest because nobody has been allowed to shout as much as \u201cHerr Schauble\u201d in public. (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jul/18/eurozone-crisis-greece-austerity-wolfgang-schauble#block-51e81857e4b020a832681843\">until his final press conference....</a>)</p> <p>And that\u2019s a name everyone has wanted to bellow out of sheer frustration with the record levels of unemployment, disarray,&#xa0;poverty and angst the German finance minister is so exclusively identified with. Again and again we heard \u2013 mostly from the lips of the Greek finance minister and other senior government officials \u2013 that&#xa0;Sch\u00e4uble had come to Athens with a message of solidarity and \u201cto speak to the Greek people.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Schauble did bear a message but it was for his own people (and the 500,000-strong Greek minority) in Germany ahead of elections this September. In a country now decimated by the medicine he has personally prescribed, the pledge for \u20ac100m in loans to kick-start business activity in a market made lifeless by lack of liquidity is nothing but a cynical drop in the ocean.</p> <p>The German finance minister\u2019s visit today was a PR stunt aimed not at placating Greeks but kidding Germans that all is well in the euro zone \u2013 when all is not. <strong>HS</strong></p> <p><strong>And on that note, I'm wrapping the blog up for the day.

A planning committee report on the project was due to be published on Thursday with a vote by the North York Moors National Park Authority expected on 29 July. But growing concerns about the impact of the project led to the company seeking more time to address the environmental and ecological issues. Earlier this week the company's shares slumped more than 20% after news that a report by consultants Amec included negative comments on the project. As the company announced the delay, its shares fell another 20% or so before recovering, and now stand nearly 5% higher at 22.5p. In a statement the Park Authority said it had \"reluctantly\" deferred a decision on the planning application for the third time. It said: The National Park Authority and its consultants have been advising York Potash of the need to undertake more environmental work since December 2012, and have continued to do so in the intervening months.
