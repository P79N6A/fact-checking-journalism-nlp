      "bodyText": "Spain and Slovenia have been given a stark warning by their eurozone partners to reform their economies rapidly or risk financial crisis. In a hard-hitting report on the countries facing macroeconomic imbalances, such as overvalued housing markets or hefty government debts, the European commission identified a total of 13 member states \u2013 including France, the Netherlands and Belgium \u2013 which it said should take urgent action to restore the health of their economies. The large number of countries involved underlined the growing scale of the eurozone crisis, which has been exacerbated by a deep recession in many of the single currency's 17 member states. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned on Wednesday of the emergence of a \"three-speed\" global economy, lumping the eurozone and Japan in the slowest lane among countries that \"still have some distance to travel\". The European commission's harshest criticism was reserved for Spain and Slovenia, which were warned to agree reform proposals with Brussels next month or face potential sanctions under the EU's new \"excessive imbalance procedure\". Slovenia, which has been forced to bail out its banking sector, has repeatedly been identified as the next domino to fall in the ongoing eurozone debt crisis, since Cyprus received a controversial bailout. The commission warned that the close connection between Slovenia's partly state-owned banks, which made reckless loans during the boom years, and the country's public finances could jeopardise financial stability. \"These challenges require urgent action in the areas of the financial sector, state-owned enterprises and microeconomic reforms in order to prevent a situation in which severe imbalances would steeply increase towards unsustainable levels,\" it said. Madrid also came under the spotlight. The commission warned that while the immediate threat of a full-blown international bailout had receded, the heavy debt hangover from Spain's pre-crisis boom continued to present a serious threat. The report formed part of the commission's new Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure, put in place in the wake of the financial crisis to identify problems within individual countries that could put the financial stability of the eurozone at risk. Brussels stepped up the pressure on France over declining exports and rising public debt, saying the country's \"public sector indebtedness represents a vulnerability, not only for the country itself, but also for the euro area as a whole\". The IMF recently warned that France could slip behind Italy and Spain if it failed to reform its struggling economy. The UK also came in for criticism from the commission, which warned that the hoped-for recovery in the housing market could halt a necessary \"correction\" in prices, and prevent a reduction in household borrowing levels. That could leave homeowners dangerously exposed in future if interest rates go up, it warned. \"As a consequence of a combination of high house prices and the widespread and growing use of variable-rate mortgages, households are particularly exposed to interest rate changes,\" it said, adding that the size of the UK economy meant future instability could, \"generate spillovers to the other European economies\". The Commission's verdict came as details began to leak of the conditions Cyprus could face in exchange for its \u20ac10bn bailout. Nicosia is expected to be forced to sell \u20ac400m-worth of gold reserves as part of the deal.",

Bentley, owned by Volkswagen, performed even better with a 26% increase in first quarter deliveries worldwide. The two companies also did well in the UK \u2013 with sales up 14% at JLR and 60% at Bentley \u2013 bucking a wider trend that expects to see overall British automotive sales close to flat in 2013. Over 115,000 Jaguar cars were sold worldwide in the first quarter of 2013, while Land Rover notched up over 95,000, giving the latter marque the best performance in its 65-year history. \"Jaguar Land Rover has had a record breaking start to the year reflecting the continued interest in our two great brands and our commitment to delivering desirable products that resonate with customers across the globe,\" said Phil Popham, a group sales director. Meanwhile Bentley said its sales growth was led by a strong US market and \"outstanding\" performance in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Europe, all helped by the opening of a eight new dealerships. \"Although conditions in some markets are becoming more challenging, we are continuing to increase our market share thanks to our growing global presence and growth in key new markets such as Russia,\" said Kevin Rose, Bentley's board member for sales.

The truth of the matter is that the country never had a cathartic reckoning after the banking calamity. In its absence - and after the Financial Services Authority's limp report on Royal Bank of Scotland - the plain-speaking displayed by the commission on banking standards has been welcomed as an honest account of how badly things went wrong. And, given the \"colossal failure,\" it's not surprising that the voters expect the baubles and some of the personal fortunes to be returned. The business lobby may be horrified by the notion that a knighthood may not be for life, but the outside world, still paying the cost of the disasters, is amazed that individuals who failed in important positions can continue to lead charmed careers and enjoy generous pensions. It's a good thing that this tension may be closer to being resolved. If the process is messy and sometimes arbitrary, that's unfortunate \u2013 but better that the principle of accountability is applied partially rather than not at all. The constituency that is queasy about \"banker bashing\" makes one very valid point: that the causes of the crisis were far more complicated than the incompetence of a few individuals at the head of HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland. Absolutely right: cheerleading politicians and inadequate regulation also played major roles. And we wait to see what the commission says about the role of auditors \u2013 KPMG was inspecting HBOS' books \u2013 in its final report. So how far should the ripples run? In the spirit of looking beyond the bankers and the friendless Sir James Crosby, Lord Stevenson and Andy Hornby, consider the senior regulators at the time. It is now established that the \"light-touch\" regime established and encouraged by New Labour was a disaster. Even within the context of inadequate rules, though, the commission's verdict on the FSA's supervision of HBOS was damning. \"The picture that emerges is that the FSA's regulation of HBOS was thoroughly inadequate,\" the report said. And: \"From 2004 until the latter part of 2007 the FSA was not so much the dog that did not bark as a dog barking up the wrong tree.\" And further: \"Too much supervision was undertaken at too low a level \u2013 without sufficient engagement of the senior leadership of the FSA.\" The only qualification is the commission still concluded that \"ultimate responsibility for the bank's chosen path\" lay with the board of HBOS \u2013 a judgment that must be correct since boards of directors set and implement policies. Even so, who were the \"senior leadership\" of the FSA? Well, the chairman of the FSA was Sir Callum McCarthy, who completed at the end of last year a stint as a non-executive director on the board of the Treasury, an appointment that now looks astonishing. Then there's John Tiner, who was chief executive of the FSA and soon hopes to lead a bid to buy 316 branches from RBS. Before that arrangement is allowed to proceed, it might be useful if Tiner explained why he thinks he'll be better at spotting risks at a bank he chairs as opposed to one he regulated.",

      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve officials are increasingly split over chairman Ben Bernanke's $85bn-a-month stimulus programme, according to the minutes of their latest meeting. The minutes, mistakenly released hours earlier than planned, show officials debated at the March meeting whether or not to begin winding down the bond-buying after the middle of the year. \"All but a few\" Fed officials agreed that the programme should continue \"at least through midyear\". But a larger split is emerging among officials over how the Fed should proceed after that. The central bank accidentally sent the market-sensitive minutes to an email list of congressional staffers and trade lobbyists on Tuesday. When the mistake was discovered, the Fed put out the minutes at 9am on Wednesday, instead of waiting for the usual 2pm release time. According to the minutes, \"several participants\" continue to believe that the benefits of the massive bond-buying programme exceed the costs, and that \"additional purchases would be necessary to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.\" \"In contrast, a couple of participants indicated that the committee could best foster its dual objectives and limit the potential costs of the program by beginning to taper its purchases before midyear or by ending purchases altogether,\" the minutes said. The Federal Open Markets Committee's (FOMC) participants were generally more upbeat about the economy but noted that fiscal policy, in the wake of the so-called sequester budget cuts, had become more restrictive. \"Participants judged that the economy had returned to moderate growth following a pause late last year, and a few noted that the downside risks may have diminished,\" according to the minutes. Housing and the jobs market both appeared to be on the mend, members noted. In a note to clients Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, noted that Fed officials were concerned not only about the effectiveness of the bond programme in driving down unemployment but by \"the risks and costs of purchases\". Some Fed officials, including St Louis Fed president James Bullard, have suggested the Fed should scale back its massive buying programme. The Fed meeting came before March's disappointing jobs figures. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US added just 88,000 new jobs in March, less than half the figure economists had been expecting. The number has fueled fears of a \"spring swoon\" \u2013 a slowdown in the economic recovery following a pick-up over the winter. The US has experienced similar swoons in the past three years. Greenhaus said: \"In the end though, we know that the Fed is going to taper asset purchases, the only question is when. If these minutes are to be believed, then sometime over the next several meetings, this process could begin (presumably by the end of the summer). \"However, the degree to which recent data weakening has reversed some of the tapering momentum remains to be seen. If the data picks back up, and no spring swoon materializes, it seems fair to say that by the end of the summer, the Fed will be buying less than $85bn in securities each month.\"",

Among other points, he predicts more alarm in the eurozone this year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The revelation (although hardly new) in the latest FOMC minutes that some members would favour at least a tapering of QE by the end of the year has refocused attention on the role that Fed buying has been playing in keeping Treasury yields low. (See US section below.)</p> <p>The conventional wisdom appears to be that 10-year Treasury yields are only likely to remain below 2% if the US central bank maintains its current pace of buying. In fact, the launches of successive bouts of quantitative easing have seen yields rise, rather than fall. Instead, the prospects for Treasuries depend mainly on the outlooks for short-term interest rates, inflation expectations, safe haven demand and other overseas buying, which together should keep yields low for at least another year.</p> <p>At first sight, it might seem obvious that the Fed\u2019s purchases of government bonds under QE3 have been a key factor keeping their yields low, and hence that any scaling back of these purchases would inevitably see yields surge. But the reality is more complicated. Indeed, Treasury yields actually rose during most of the period when the Fed was buying government bonds during QE1 and QE2, and are higher now than when the Fed launched QE3.</p> <p>There are several ways in which large-scale central bank purchases of government bonds can put upward pressure on their yields. One is by raising long-term expectations for inflation. Another is by improving the prospects for the real economy and increasing the appetite for risk, thus encouraging investors to buy assets such as equities or industrial commodities rather than safe-haven government bonds. (Correspondingly, these riskier assets might be the major casualties if the Fed stops buying Treasuries, rather than Treasuries themselves.) To the extent that QE succeeds in restoring confidence, it might lead investors to revise up their expectations for the average level of short-term interest rates over the life of the bond too. </p> <p>The upshot is that we would not necessarily expect a sustained rise in Treasury yields even if the Fed, perhaps mindful of the implications for its balance sheet and eventual exit strategy, does scale back its purchases later in the year. These concerns may matter less for \u201cconventional\u201d monetary policy and high unemployment would still be likely to keep official interest rates on hold near zero. There is also now more room for inflation expectations to drop again, especially if commodity prices continue to fall.</p> <p>&#xa0;Finally, other investors might simply step up to take the Fed\u2019s place. In particular, we expect a renewed escalation of the euro-zone crisis in the second half of the year to boost safe haven demand for Treasuries. And at the margin, the fact that the Bank of Japan will now be buying a lot more JGBs may encourage (or even force) some Japanese institutions to increase their purchases of Treasuries instead. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51657a73b5798271e588364a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-10T14:42:59.730Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Esther George</strong>, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, could well be the member who wanted to start unwinding America's bond buying programme.</p> <p>There are 12 members of the open market committee, and the minutes (<a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20130320.pdf\">reminder: there are here</a>) don't identify individual views.</p> <p>But it was George who, last week, described the Fed's current policies as \"overly accommodative\".

In a context of catching up, high foreign capital inflows contributed to the overheating of the domestic economy and a booming housing sector.</p> <h2>Denmark</h2> <p>The continuing adjustment in the housing market and the high <br>level of indebtedness in the household and private sector as well as drivers of external competitiveness, deserve continued attention.</p> <p>More specifically, there has been a weak export performance linked to a rise in unit labour costs due to high wage growth and, in particular, weak productivity growth.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>Export performance and the underlying loss of competitiveness as <br>well as high public indebtedness in an environment of subdued growth deserve continued attention in a broad reform agenda in order to reduce the risk of adverse effects on the functioning of the Italian economy and of the Economic and Monetary Union, notably given the size of the Italian economy.</p> <p>More specifically, in a context of elevated risk aversion in financial markets, Italy's high public debt weighs on the country's growth prospects through several channels, in particular the high tax burden needed to service the debt, funding pressures for Italian banks and thus for the private sector, increased macroeconomic uncertainty and a severely limited margin for countercyclical fiscal policies and growth-enhancing public expenditure.</p> <h2>Hungary</h2> <p>On-going adjustment of the highly negative net <br>international investment position, largely driven by private sector deleveraging in a context of high public debt and a weak business environment continue to deserve very close attention so as to reduce the important risks of adverse effects on the functioning of the economy.</p> <h2>Malta</h2> <p>The long-term sustainability of the public finances warrants attention <br>while the very large financial sector, and in particular, the strong link between the domestically-oriented banks and the property market poses challenges for financial stability and deserves continued monitoring.</p> <p>More specifically, the long-term sustainability of public finances is at risk due to the high projected cost of ageing and other sizeable contingent liabilities.</p> <h2>The Netherlands</h2> <p>Macroeconomic developments regarding private sector debt and deleveraging pressures, also coupled with remaining inefficiencies in the <br>housing market deserve attention.</p> <p>Although the large current account surplus does not raise risks similar to large deficits, the Commission will also continue monitoring the developments of the current account in the Netherlands.</p> <p>More specifically, rigidities and distortive incentives have built up over decades to shape house financing and sectorial savings patterns.</p> <h2>Finland</h2> <p>The substantial deterioration in the current account position and the weak <br>export performance, driven by industrial restructuring, as well as cost and non-cost competitiveness factors, deserve continued attention.</p> <p>More specifically, the loss in competitiveness weakens the country's economic position and risks compromising future prosperity and living standards, especially as population ageing already poses a challenge in this regard.</p> <p>Finland has rapidly lost world market shares and the current account balance has been on a downward trend, and even turned into a deficit in 2011, which is forecast to widen.</p> <h2>Sweden</h2> <p>Macroeconomic developments regarding private sector debt and <br>deleveraging, coupled with remaining inefficiencies in the housing market deserve continued attention.</p> <p>Although the large current account surplus does not raise risks similar to large deficits in other countries, the Commission will continue to monitor developments of the current account in Sweden.</p> <h2>The UK</h2> <p>Macroeconomic developments in the areas of household debt, linked to the high levels of mortgage debt and the characteristics of the housing market, as well as unfavourable developments in external competitiveness, especially as regards goods exports and weak productivity growth, continue to deserve attention.</p> <p>More specifically, the UK faces tensions between the needs for deleveraging, maintaining financial stability and avoiding compromising investment and growth</p>

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a closing summary. \u2022 The scale of the financial troubles in Cyprus have been laid out by an official debt sustainability assessment. It predicts that its GDP will tumble this year, and not start growing until 2015 (see 4.20pm onwards). \u2022 Cyprus will also sell around \u20ac400bn of its gold reserves (see 4.12pm). \u2022 There was embarrassment at the Federal Reserve after it was forced to publish the minutes of its last meeting 5 hours early. The minutes show that one member of its monetary policy committee wanted to start slowing its QE programme now (see 2pm onwards) \u2022 The Fed has launched an inquiry, admitting that it accidentally sent the minutes out yesterday (see 2.44pm) \u2022 Christine Lagarde has claimed tonight that the global economy is a little less dangerous than six months ago. She warned, though, that global growth in 2013 will be little better than 2012 (see 5.30pm) \u2022 The European Commission has warned that Spain and Slovenia's economies are significantly imbalanced. Another 11 countries also contain worrying imbalances, including France - who was urged to make more rapid and deeper reforms (see 12.17pm onwards). \u2022 Spanish industrial output data showed that its manufacturing base endured another dire month in February, shrinking by 6.5%. Italy also suffered a fall in industrial production. See 8.43am onwards. Thanks all - I'll be back tomorrow. Goodnight, and thanks. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund,has declared tonight that the global economy looked slightly less menacing today than last autumn. She warned, though, that economic growth this year is unlikely to be much stronger than in 2012. Speaking in New York right now, Lagarde said: Thanks to the actions of policymakers, the economic world no longer looks quite as dangerous as it did six months ago. But she also pointed out that the 'real economy' had not yet felt the benefits of the improvements in the financial world. In present circumstances, it makes sense for monetary policy to do the heavy lifting in this recovery by remaining accommodative. That 'accomodative' policy has seen central banks swell their balance sheets and the monetary base, but Lagarde claimed that the risks \"appear under control.\" She also touched on the eurozone crisis, saying that euro area countries need 'collective policy solution' to strengthen their banks. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has raised its rating on Cyprus from negative to stable, and suggested that it believes the country will remain in the eurozone. Europe's stock markets have rallied strongly today. They were helped by rumours that Portugal and Ireland would be granted more time to pay back their bailout loans (see 1.24pm), and strong import data from China overnight. Here's the closing prices: FTSE 100: up 74 points at 6387, +1.17% German DAX: up 173 points at 7810, +2.27% French CAC: up 72 points at 3743, +2% Spanish IBEX: up 263 points at 8,136, +3.35% Italian FTSE MIB: up 492 points at 15,928, + 3.1% The Cypriot debt sustainability assessment also warns that the cost of fixing its banks could rise, due to the sharp slump in GDP forecast for this year and 2014. Dow Jones Newswires has the details: Europe's loans to Cyprus will have an maximum average maturity of 15 to 20 years, Reuters adds. Cyprus's economy will tumble by a jaw-dropping 8.7% this year, according to the Debt Sustainability Assessment that just hit the wires (I don't have a copy, but Reuters and Dow Jones are flashing the details). The economy is then expected to keep shrinking in 2014, before returning to growth the next year. The DPA also reckons that the country's budget deficit will peak at close to 8% next year. Here's the projections for GDP: 2013: - 8.7% 2014: -3.9% 2014: +1.1% And for budget deficits: 2013: 6.0% 2014: 7.9% 2015: 5.7% 2016: 2.15% Pretty gloomy, but some in the financial markets fear it is not realistic enough: Back to the eurozone, and Cyprus is planning to raise \u20ac400m by selling some of its gold reserves. The plan is contained in the official Debt Sustainability Assessment of the country's financing needs, prepared by the EC, which is emerging this afternoon The document also shows that Cyprus will raise over \u20ac10bn through winding up Laiki Bank and imposing a haircut on Bank of Cyprus's large deposits. It should also raise around \u20ac600m from raising corporation tax and capital gains tax. More to follow Here's some analysis from Julian Jessop of Capital Economics on today's minutes from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting last month. Among other points, he predicts more alarm in the eurozone this year. The revelation (although hardly new) in the latest FOMC minutes that some members would favour at least a tapering of QE by the end of the year has refocused attention on the role that Fed buying has been playing in keeping Treasury yields low. (See US section below.) The conventional wisdom appears to be that 10-year Treasury yields are only likely to remain below 2% if the US central bank maintains its current pace of buying. In fact, the launches of successive bouts of quantitative easing have seen yields rise, rather than fall. Instead, the prospects for Treasuries depend mainly on the outlooks for short-term interest rates, inflation expectations, safe haven demand and other overseas buying, which together should keep yields low for at least another year. At first sight, it might seem obvious that the Fed\u2019s purchases of government bonds under QE3 have been a key factor keeping their yields low, and hence that any scaling back of these purchases would inevitably see yields surge. But the reality is more complicated. Indeed, Treasury yields actually rose during most of the period when the Fed was buying government bonds during QE1 and QE2, and are higher now than when the Fed launched QE3. There are several ways in which large-scale central bank purchases of government bonds can put upward pressure on their yields. One is by raising long-term expectations for inflation. Another is by improving the prospects for the real economy and increasing the appetite for risk, thus encouraging investors to buy assets such as equities or industrial commodities rather than safe-haven government bonds. (Correspondingly, these riskier assets might be the major casualties if the Fed stops buying Treasuries, rather than Treasuries themselves.) To the extent that QE succeeds in restoring confidence, it might lead investors to revise up their expectations for the average level of short-term interest rates over the life of the bond too. The upshot is that we would not necessarily expect a sustained rise in Treasury yields even if the Fed, perhaps mindful of the implications for its balance sheet and eventual exit strategy, does scale back its purchases later in the year. These concerns may matter less for \u201cconventional\u201d monetary policy and high unemployment would still be likely to keep official interest rates on hold near zero. There is also now more room for inflation expectations to drop again, especially if commodity prices continue to fall. Finally, other investors might simply step up to take the Fed\u2019s place. In particular, we expect a renewed escalation of the euro-zone crisis in the second half of the year to boost safe haven demand for Treasuries. And at the margin, the fact that the Bank of Japan will now be buying a lot more JGBs may encourage (or even force) some Japanese institutions to increase their purchases of Treasuries instead. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, could well be the member who wanted to start unwinding America's bond buying programme. There are 12 members of the open market committee, and the minutes (reminder: there are here) don't identify individual views. But it was George who, last week, described the Fed's current policies as \"overly accommodative\". She argued that such a large bond-buying programme actually threaten long-term growth by creating financial instability and driving up long-term inflation expectations. More here. Reuters also reckons George is the one: One member, likely Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who dissented at the meeting, judged the pace of purchases should be slowed immediately, the minutes said. The early release of the Federal Reserve's minutes has not caused much alarm in the markets. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a new intraday record high. It gained 7.62 points to 1,576.23, up 0.5% today. All the major markets are up today, while commodities are down. So is volatility: There must be some seriously red faces at the Federal Reserve today, after its minutes were accidentally punted to various workers at Congress and at trade bodies. A whole day early. US Treasury bonds have weakened in value slightly today, pushing up the yield on its 10-year debt by around 3 basis points (to 1.779%). Not a big move -- but, heck, any market move means profits or losses for someone. The Fed has said that its Inspector General has been asked to investigate the early release of minutes, and that it does not know if any insider trading rules have been breached.... The mistake has caused much excitement in the markets... Here's some early reaction to the Federal Reserve's minutes (and their early release) Chris Beauchamp of IG Index: Those Fed minutes have rather caught markets on the hop, but it is perhaps unwise to attribute too much importance to them in the wake of Friday\u2019s job numbers. Any comments about reducing QE before the end of the year now look somewhat out of place following the surprise weakness in the US economy. The Fed's minutes show that one member of its committee wants its quantitative easing bond-buying programme to slow down now. Several more suggested that this should happen this summer.... Here's the key quote: In light of the current review of benefits and costs, one member judged that the pace of purchases should ideally be slowed immediately. A few members felt that the risks and costs of purchases, along with the improved outlook since last fall, would likely make a reduction in the pace of purchases appropriate around midyear, with purchases ending later this year. As things stand the Fed's policy is to buy $40bn of mortgate-backed securities per month, and $45bn of longer-term Treasury securities. However -- this meeting took place before the latest, disappointing, US jobs data was released. The outlook doesn't look quite so improved today. You can download the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting - rushed out five hours early after that leak - by clicking here (pdf). Just in - the Federal Reserve has rushed forward the release of the minutes of its last meeting -- apparently after accidentally leaking them. They were due at 7pm BST (2pm Eaastern time), but instead the Fed will release them at 2pm BST. So right now... It appears that the minutes were released yesterday to around 100 Congressional staffers and trade lobbyists. Curious... Over in Brussels, officials are briefing the media about the next meeting of European finance ministers, on Friday. The FT's Peter Spiegel is tweeting the highlights: Sounds like we'll see a few parliamentary votes* on the Cyprus bailout next week: * - not in Cyprus, of course.... The conditions of Cyprus's bailout deal have been agreed, according to the German government. Reuters has the details: A final memorandum of understanding between Cyprus and international creditors on the island's bailout has now been finalized, a German finance ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. Martin Kotthaus also told a regular news conference he expected the bailout package to remain at 10 billion euros. Curiously, Finnish finance minister Jutta Urpilainen had suggested this morning that the Cyprus bailout programme could be tweaked, when EU finance ministers meet in Dublin on Friday and Saturday. Urpilainen told reporters: I think the final outcome is good and sustainable, and I think it is good to go forward with this but it is good to note that some details might still be changed on Friday. There are also reports that ministers will be advised to extend the maturity on certain loans given to Portugal and Ireland by seven years. According to Reuters, the Troika of international lenders believes it is right to lower both countries' debt repayment burdens by spreading payments over a longer time. (more here). Here's a chart from Barclays comparing economic growth in Ireland, Greece and Portugal against Germany: The other 10 countries identified as imbalanced by the EC (click through for full details) are Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the UK. The full report is here - here's the top-line reasons for each: Belgium: Macroeconomic developments in the areas of external competitiveness of goods, and indebtedness, especially concerning the implications of the high level of public debt for the real economy, continue to deserve attention. More specifically, Belgium has experienced a long-term decline in its export market shares due to persistent losses in both cost and non-cost competitiveness. While Belgian goods exports are gradually being reoriented towards more dynamic regions, the specialization in cost-sensitive intermediate products is intensifying... Bulgaria The impact of deleveraging in the corporate sector as well as the continuous adjustment of external positions, competitiveness and labour markets deserve continued attention. More specifically, Bulgaria rapidly built up imbalances during the boom phase that coincided with its accession to the European Union. In a context of catching up, high foreign capital inflows contributed to the overheating of the domestic economy and a booming housing sector. Denmark The continuing adjustment in the housing market and the high level of indebtedness in the household and private sector as well as drivers of external competitiveness, deserve continued attention. More specifically, there has been a weak export performance linked to a rise in unit labour costs due to high wage growth and, in particular, weak productivity growth. Italy Export performance and the underlying loss of competitiveness as well as high public indebtedness in an environment of subdued growth deserve continued attention in a broad reform agenda in order to reduce the risk of adverse effects on the functioning of the Italian economy and of the Economic and Monetary Union, notably given the size of the Italian economy. More specifically, in a context of elevated risk aversion in financial markets, Italy's high public debt weighs on the country's growth prospects through several channels, in particular the high tax burden needed to service the debt, funding pressures for Italian banks and thus for the private sector, increased macroeconomic uncertainty and a severely limited margin for countercyclical fiscal policies and growth-enhancing public expenditure. Hungary On-going adjustment of the highly negative net international investment position, largely driven by private sector deleveraging in a context of high public debt and a weak business environment continue to deserve very close attention so as to reduce the important risks of adverse effects on the functioning of the economy. Malta The long-term sustainability of the public finances warrants attention while the very large financial sector, and in particular, the strong link between the domestically-oriented banks and the property market poses challenges for financial stability and deserves continued monitoring. More specifically, the long-term sustainability of public finances is at risk due to the high projected cost of ageing and other sizeable contingent liabilities. The Netherlands Macroeconomic developments regarding private sector debt and deleveraging pressures, also coupled with remaining inefficiencies in the housing market deserve attention. Although the large current account surplus does not raise risks similar to large deficits, the Commission will also continue monitoring the developments of the current account in the Netherlands. More specifically, rigidities and distortive incentives have built up over decades to shape house financing and sectorial savings patterns. Finland The substantial deterioration in the current account position and the weak export performance, driven by industrial restructuring, as well as cost and non-cost competitiveness factors, deserve continued attention. More specifically, the loss in competitiveness weakens the country's economic position and risks compromising future prosperity and living standards, especially as population ageing already poses a challenge in this regard. Finland has rapidly lost world market shares and the current account balance has been on a downward trend, and even turned into a deficit in 2011, which is forecast to widen. Sweden Macroeconomic developments regarding private sector debt and deleveraging, coupled with remaining inefficiencies in the housing market deserve continued attention. Although the large current account surplus does not raise risks similar to large deficits in other countries, the Commission will continue to monitor developments of the current account in Sweden. The UK Macroeconomic developments in the areas of household debt, linked to the high levels of mortgage debt and the characteristics of the housing market, as well as unfavourable developments in external competitiveness, especially as regards goods exports and weak productivity growth, continue to deserve attention. More specifically, the UK faces tensions between the needs for deleveraging, maintaining financial stability and avoiding compromising investment and growth The EC's message to France is basically that its economy just isn't competitive enough. Wages have risen fast and put pressure on prices and firms' profitability. The low and decreasing profitability of private companies, in particular in the manufacturing sector, have not only weighed on their indebtedness, but more importantly may have hampered their ability to innovate and to strengthen their non-price competitiveness. Other factors, including the decreasing number of exporting firms have aggravated these competitiveness issues. The EC has also warned France that it needs to go further to reform its economy. Today's report on macroeconomic imbalances points to France's poor growth and rising debt levels. The EC fears that the eurozone's second-largest economy poses risks to the rest of the region. The report says: France\u2019s public sector indebtedness represents a vulnerability, not only for the country itself, but also for the euro area as a whole. So while Francois Hollande is refusing to slow down (see 11.51am), the EC wants him to move faster.... Spain and Slovenia's economies are both worryingly imbalanced, the European Commission has warned in its official report into macroeconomic imbalances in the EU. Both countries were picked out as having \"excessive' imbalances. Spain, the EC said, still suffers from \"very high domestic and external debt levels continue to pose serious risks for growth and financial stability.\" For Slovenia, it risks financial sector instability because of \"corporate indebtedness and deleveraging\". The EC also pointed to the close links with public finances -- a nod to the face that most Slovenian banks are state-owned. You can download the full report here. Another 11 countries still show macroeconomic imbalances (just not as excessive as Spain and Slovenia). This excludes Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus - all now in bailout programmes. I'll pop a list up... French president Francois Hollande has declared that he will not change his economic plans and announced a new attack on tax havens. Hollande, buffeted by a tax scandal, (and the news that his camel has been devoured by a family in Mali*) pledged to stay on his fiscal course - despite seeing his popularity slide in recent months. In a speech in Paris this morning, Hollande insisted that he was delivering a \"serious budget\", while sparing France from true austerity. He claimed that the fiscal measures underway would allow France to help lead Europe back to growth. It is by pursuing this policy, the reforms that have been initiated...that France will be best placed to redirect the focus on Europe growth. (quote via Reuters) Hollande also announced that French banks will be forced to declare all subsidiaries worldwide, part of a new clampdown on corruption. * - about that camel. It's a sad tale - the beast was awarded to Hollande in recognition of France's role in repelling Islamic rebels this year. It was entrusted to a family in Timbuktu, and most unfortunately they killed and ate it. However, it's not all bad news (except for the camel) - Mali is sending a replacement. A \"bigger and better-looking camel\" too, so that should stop Hollande getting the hump (You're fired. Ed.) Heads-up: the European Commission will release its latest report into the European economy at 11.30am BST. Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg prime minister and former president of the Eurogroup, has urged European leaders to ease the pace of fiscal reforms in struggling members of the eurozone. Speaking in the Luxembourg parliament, Juncker warned that Greece, in particular, should be cut more slack. Bloomberg has the details: Juncker also warned that the eurozone recession would continue (perhaps he saw this morning's dire economic data from Spain and Italy). Luxembourg is also bowing to pressure to open up its financial system; after criticism that it allows wealthy depositors to avoid paying tax in their home countries. From the start of 2015 it will exchange information about foreign bank account holders from the European Union with other EU countries, Juncker confirmed: We can, without great damage, introduce automatic exchange of information as of Jan 1, 2015. Here's Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy in the Spanish Parliament this morning, where he updated MPs on the last EU council meeting (last month) (see 9.12am). Italy's industrial output also shrank in February, data just released shows, in another sign that the eurozone periphery is suffering badly. Industrial output fell by 3.8% year-on-year on a seasonally-adjusted basis (compared to Spain's 6.5% slump), but was down 7.6% in unadjusted terms. Output was 0.8% lower than in January - worse than economists had expected - showing that the Italian economy continued to weaken. Spain's prime minister has again urged Europe to use \"all the tools\" available to drag the region back to economic growth, in a speech at the Madrid parliament this morning. Mariano Rajoy told MPs that: We must prevent Europe falling behind. We must do everything we can with all the tools we have. El Pais has more details here (in Spanish). Rajoy also appears to have criticised Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem for saying last month that Cyprus's bailout showed how future bank rescues could be structured: Hopefully have the full details soon... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. The economic crisis in Spain continues. Data released this morning showed that industrial production in the country tumbled by 6.5% in February, compared with a year ago. That's the 18th monthly contraction in a row. The slump was driven by a double-digit decline in production of durable goods for consumers, who are suffering badly as Madrid implements its austerity programme. But production was also down across the board, from other consumer goods to large-scale industrial equipment: Many Spanish factories have closed since the financial crisis struck, creating a vicious circle of rising unemployment and falling demand. One example, thousands of people were employed at a door factory in the town in Villacanas, south of Madrid. In the good days they churned out products for Spain's property boom - but the plant is now closed, along with most of of the Villacanas industrial park: No wonder Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has been urging European policymakers to do more to drive growth (details here). The picture is slightly better in France this morning, where industrial production only fell by 2.8% year-on-year in February, and actually picked up by 0.7% compared with January. I'll be tracking the reaction to today's data, and watching developments across the eurozone -- particularly Slovenia (whose PM yesterday rejected speculation that a bailout would be needed), and Cyprus (where time is running out to agree its bailout).",

Pascal Lamy, the WTO's director-general, urged progress on the stalled Doha round of trade liberalisation talks as a bulwark against protectionist pressures after cutting his organisation's forecast for global trade growth this year. \"As long as global economic weakness persists, protectionist pressure will build and could eventually become overwhelming\", Lamy said after announcing that the WTO had cut its forecast for 2013 global trade growth from 4.5% to 3.3%. \"The threat of protectionism may be greater now than at any time since the start of the crisis, since other polices to restore growth have been tried and found wanting. To prevent a self-destructive lapse into economic nationalism, countries need to refocus their attention on reinforcing the multilateral trading system, \" he added. The WTO said global trade had increased by 2% in 2012, down from 5.2% in 2011 and the second weakest performance since records began in 1981. Only in 2009, when manufacturing production and exports collapsed during the deepest global slump since the second world war, has world trade been as weak as it was last year. Lamy said that the risks to the WTO's forecast were heavily skewed to the downside, with the improved outlook for the US and the end of the dispute between China and Japan outweighed by the continued bad news from the eurozone. Despite the hope of quickening trade this year and a provisional forecast of 5% in 2014, the annual rises are expected to stay below the historical trend of long-term growth, which was 6% for the 20 years leading up to the financial crisis.",
