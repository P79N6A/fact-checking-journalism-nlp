      "bodyText": "Bank customers and pensioners in Scotland would be less well protected if the country voted to leave the UK, a report warned on Monday. The analysis, part of the Treasury's look at devolution's impact, says an independent Scotland could have significant difficulties providing standalone protection to match the current Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protect deposits in UK banks up to \u00a385,000. An independent Scottish retail banking sector would be dominated by two large banks \u2013 Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland. If one of these were to fail, the report suggests, almost all of the costs for compensating depositors would fall on the remaining firm, and that could lead to more concern among deposit-holders. The report \u2013 the Scotland Analysis Paper on UK Consumer Protection \u2013 says: \"As was clear from the 2008 financial crisis, where there are doubts about the ability of the sector to meet claims through the compensation scheme, it can be necessary for governments to step in to guarantee deposits in order to prevent deposit flight.\" The Treasury also warns that the UK's Pension Protection Fund (PPF) would not cover Scottish pension-holders post-devolution. Such schemes are mandatory under EU law, so an independent Scotland could need to create a guarantee fund. The report says this would be difficult as Scotland is home to only a small number of the UK's defined benefit schemes, which help fund the PPF through a levy. In conclusion, the report argues it would be less efficient and cost-effective for Scotland to replicate current UK consumer protection schemes. \"Should Scotland become independent, it would be more expensive to achieve a level of consumer protection equivalent to that which currently exists,\" the report says. This is the Treasury's third foray into the implications of Scottish independence. Last month it questioned if a formal currency union with an independent Scotland would suit all the UK. George Osborne suggested a new sterling currency union could be too risky, prompting SNP leader Alex Salmond to tell to tell the chancellor to \"grow up\".",

      "bodyText": "Sue Jones is disappointed. She always treats herself to a Marks &amp; Spencer roast chicken sandwich when she makes one of her occasional shopping trips from her home high in a Welsh valley to the city of Newport. Not today. M&amp;S moved from the city centre earlier this year to a retail park on the outskirts. \"That's a real shame,\" says Jones. \"I hadn't heard it had gone. Every city centre needs an M&amp;S. That's really depressed me. It was always one of my little treats. I'll have to go to McDonald's instead.\" Jones feels a loyalty to Newport. \"I always used to come here with my mum and I've enjoyed it. But it's not the place it used to be. You walk around now and notice all the empty shops.\" Nearly one in five shops across Wales's high streets and malls are closed, a new survey has found, and a stroll along High Street and Commercial Street in Newport confirms Jones' observations that there are an awful lot of empty stores here. Next door to where M&amp;S used to sell its chicken sandwiches is an empty shop, which was occupied by the menswear chain Burton. In the same row, the jewellers shop Paul Gentile has shut down and moved to the new town of Cwmbran, where there is a popular shopping centre with a huge free car park. Topman and Topshop have moved out and Monsoon is no longer represented here. A notice on Monsoon's former shopfront suggests would-be buyers head to the much more glitzy St David's shopping centre 15 miles down the M4 in Cardiff \u2013 or go online. More than 20 premises along High Street and Commercial Street were empty when the Guardian visited on Saturday. Many others had been taken over by charity shops, bargain stores and pawnbrokers. Just off Commercial Street, John Frost Square (named after one of the leaders of the Chartist movement) is even more empty. Work is due to start soon on demolishing the vacant shops here and building a new retail centre and cinema complex, Friars Walk. Debenhams is confirmed as the \"anchor store\", and the hope is that the likes of M&amp;S will return when this opens. But for the moment the square is almost shop-less. An upbeat city council billboard on one of the empty buildings declares: \"Newport open for business.\" Someone has scrawled \"lies\" underneath the slogan. Rob Porter, owner of independent men's clothing shop Wardrobe in the corner of the square, says it is important the building begins soon, as the development has been a painfully drawn-out process. \"We do need a boost. When shops like M&amp;S go it is a big blow to the place,\" he said. Porter thinks the problem is that many of the buildings are owned by wealthy outside speculators and investors, who do not care what happens to Newport. The company that owns the Cwmbran centre is much more pro-active, he added. \"They don't let shops stay empty. They make sure they are filled quickly.\" Almost all the shops in the lovely Market Arcade off High Street are also closed. Kev, the owner of Kev's Lucky Tattoos, is one of the few survivors. \"I sometimes wonder if we are in some sort of weird experiment to see if we can keep going no matter how hard they make it,\" he said. \"I don't think the government has any idea about how life is for people in places like this.\" Kev describes problems such as lengthy roadworks to \"unpedestrianise\" the area near his shop and believes there has been a move to turn his part of town into a zone for nightlife. \"But of course the economy is the biggest problem.\" Newport is the fourth most deprived authority in Wales. \"I think the government should cut taxes, get people spending again.\" Still, Kev remains defiant. \"I've been here 15 years and I'm not going anywhere, I'll be here forever.\" Jonathan Powell, who runs the Kiosk newsagents, also remains impressively upbeat. He had to move out of his nice old wooden kiosk when it was knocked down as part of another redevelopment and is based in a temporary metal cabin. \"It's true we've seen a drop in footfall since the closure of shops like Marks &amp; Spencer,\" he said. \"I think lots of businesses are fed up with the business rates and moving out.\" But like Kev, Powell refused to be downhearted. \"We hear this statistic that 25% of the shops in Newport are empty. I prefer to think that 75% are open. There's always two ways of looking at these things.\"",

      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of the Co-operative Group endured a tense annual general meeting on Saturday, as he faced questions over the group's beleaguered bank. Around 250 delegates from across the country filed into New Century House to meet Euan Sutherland, the one-time head of the Kingfisher group they hope will guide them to safety. The meeting at New Century House, Manchester, was held behind closed doors, with delegates unusually tight-lipped as they arrived. A significant absentee was the Co-operative's outgoing chief executive, Peter Marks. Company PRs acknowledged that a departing chief executive would normally have attended, but a spokeswoman said: \"He and the board agreed it was best for the organisation to focus on the future. He was due to be there, but there was a change of plan\". She declined to comment when asked whether Marks had absented himself because he was now considered \"damaged goods\", following the collapse of Co-operative Bank's deal to buy 632 branches from Lloyds. Sutherland, who has no formal experience of banking, addressed the delegates for a little over 15 minutes. He used part of his speech to explain why he took the job, highlighting \"the specialness of the operation\" and \"the way it holds a special pla~ce in the hearts of the public\". In a briefing mid-way through the meeting, an aide said: \"He acknowledged that there were challenges ahead, but that there were also opportunities and potential.\" Sutherland's speech was \"very well received\", she claimed. The resolutions put to the meeting had been submitted a number of weeks ago. None of them addressed the difficulties that have beset the bank over the past fortnight, including the failure of the Lloyds deal, the resignation of the Co-operative Bank CEO Barry Tootell, and a downgrade to junk status from ratings agency Moody's. Instead, delegates could only voice their anxieties about the bank's predicament in a question-and-answer session that followed the main business. The Co-operative declined to release a copy of Sutherland's speech. Instead, it released a single quote: \"Traditional capitalist models are not providing the answer to the concerns of people today. People are looking to us, the Co-operative Group, to find the alternative\". Marks is stepping down after more than 40 years in the co-operative movement. He has been at the helm during a period of rapid expansion for the group, including the acquisitions of Somerfield and Britannia Building Society. One of Sutherland's first tasks will be to inject confidence into the banking arm. The Moody's downgrade forced the Co-operative to reassure customers on its finances, with the bank saying: \"We haven't sought, nor do we need, government support.\" Marks, who has run the member-owned group since 2007, drove its \u00a31.6bn takeover of supermarket chain Somerfield in 2008 and the 2009 rescue of Britannia, then Britain's second-biggest building society. But the Britannia deal proved a step too far, with toxic commercial property and home loans it inherited dragging its banking arm to losses of \u00a3662m in 2012. That pushed the group to statutory losses of \u00a3599m in 2012, from \u00a3373m profits a year earlier. Moody's said the Co-operative under-estimated the risks of the Britannia acquisition, especially against the backdrop of weak economic conditions. It said: \"Moreover, the bank's ability to generate the earnings needed to replenish capital, if higher losses materialise, is diminished by its slow progress in realising merger-related revenue and cost benefits.\" There has been speculation that the Co-operative faces a \u00a31bn shortfall in its capital position, which it is tackling by disposing of assets, such as its life and general insurance businesses.

      "bodyText": "TalkTalk has renewed its \u00a320m-plus deal to sponsor ITV's The X Factor as it ups the advertising ante in the battle against rivals including BT, BSkyB and Virgin Media to win customers to its new YouView-based TV service. The telecoms and broadband operator, which last week became the fastest-growing new TV business in the UK after adding 150,000 subscribers in the first quarter, has struck a three-year deal to use ITV1's flagship entertainment show as a key strand in the marketing of TalkTalk TV. TalkTalk's latest sponsorship deal, struck with ITV and co-producers Syco and FremantleMedia, is thought to be of a similar value to the approximately \u00a320m paid in 2010. The company believes that Simon Cowell's talent show is the perfect vehicle with which to hit its target market of perhaps 8m Freeview digital terrestrial TV households that cannot record programmes on their set-top boxes and are \"value-seeking customers who want a little more TV, not a lot\". Three-quarters of TalkTalk's 4 million-plus customer base have Freeview, and a similar percentage of the 230,000 who have signed up to its new TV service had either Freeview or Freesat, the satellite TV joint venture between ITV and the BBC. \"You could say it is a Freeview assault, it is the perfect property to be engaged with to drive our TV service,\" said Tristia Clarke, commercial director at TalkTalk. \"One of the original reasons for the launch of YouView was a way to enhance Freeview. The sheer scale of X Factor is of course very important, it is the biggest show on UK TV, but it also allows proper engagement with customers. You can make offers, such as tickets, and drive customer engagement in a way you can't sponsoring, say, drama.\" The X Factor has lost some of its heat since TalkTalk struck its last three-year deal in 2010, months after the show hit a new ratings high with Joe McElderry's win drawing 15.5 million average audience. The X Factor final in December was watched by just over 11 million viewers, the lowest audience for a series finale since 2006. TalkTalk tends to get significant mileage from its 12-week sponsorship of the show. The company's short idents will air for almost an hour in total across the series of The X Factor and the same for the US version of the show broadcast on ITV2, which the sponsorship also covers. Given the premium prices that ITV can charge for TV advertising during The X Factor, the airtime the idents take up would be worth more than \u00a310m at rate card value. TalkTalk has been significantly ramping up its advertising spend as it seeks to battle rivals including BT, BSkyB and Virgin Media in the scrap for pay-TV customers. In the year to the end of March TalkTalk spent \u00a351m on all advertising, excluding TV sponsorship, almost double the \u00a326.7m spent in the previous 12-month period according to figures from Nielsen. TV advertising has seen a 34% increase (to \u00a39m), press up 69% (to \u00a39.2m), outdoor up 358% (to \u00a36.8m), internet up 45% to \u00a34.4m, and radio up 102% (to \u00a31.4m). TalkTalk has sponsored the show for eight years. Carphonewarehouse, its former parent company, sponosred the first two years of The X Factor's now decade-long life as a TV franchise.",

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer under fire over online tax arrangements", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has become the latest in a string of UK companies to face criticism from tax campaigners over the way it structures its online sales to Europe \u2013 with one describing its sales operation as similar to that of the internet retail giant Amazon. The British retailer has been expanding its online operations to several countries across Europe with a new marksandspencer.eu site, hoping to grow its business in a difficult economic climate. But internal M&amp;S documents seen by the Guardian show the firm's structure involves shipping goods from one country \u2013 the UK \u2013 while invoicing the transaction to another \u2013 Ireland. Orders made through the site by customers from France, Germany, Ireland or other countries are shipped from M&amp;S's UK warehouses \u2013 but the transactions are all made with, and charged to, Marks &amp; Spencer (Ireland) Limited, a subsidiary located in the Republic of Ireland, which has the lowest corporation tax rates in Europe. M&amp;'s UK branch is paid a wholesale price for the goods it ships by M&amp;S Ireland, and this is subject to UK corporation tax, but the rest of the retail markup is subject to Ireland's much lower corporation tax rate of 12.5%. This process of using internal billing between countries in order to ship goods from one country when doing business in another is referred to as \"transfer pricing\", and while perfectly legal is the practice highlighted by tax campaigners who object to Amazon. However, M&amp;S only uses this structure for sales outside of the UK: all sales in UK stores and online to UK addresses are processed through the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax. A specification document prepared last year when the site was being designed specified that \"[t]he corporate tax structure will be aligned to that of the Irish website\". The document then detailed how, while the goods would be shipped from the UK, M&amp;S UK would only receive a wholesale \u2013 not retail \u2013 price: \"Goods issue from Hardwick DC [distribution centre] in the UK at cost price \u2026 intercompany invoice at cost price in GBP with a variable mark-up % by country (of order) plus UK VAT\". Earlier this year, after George Osborne announced a further cut to UK corporation tax in his 2013 budget, an M&amp;S employee sent an email to a superior questioning the need for the complex operation of Marks &amp; Spencer's international site, giving their personal view as to why the structure existed: \"Given that it was developed as a means to avoid UK corporation tax when it stood at 26% it now seems appropriate to reassess this,\" it read. \"Corporation tax will be 21% by next year. Does this not render many of the advantages of having an Irish company obsolete? \"From a tax management perspective there may have been advantages in avoiding the UK 26% tax rate but the process and IT overhead with the additional VAT complexity may negate these advantages. Needless to say there is also the reputational damage to M&amp;S should it be seen to be avoiding UK tax in the current climate, as seen with recent examples such as Starbucks [and] Amazon.\" The revelations come amid mounting cross-party political focus on corporate tax avoidance, as Ed Miliband pledges to act unilaterally to tackle tax avoidance, just days after the public accounts committee chair, Margaret Hodge described Google's tax structure as evil. Tax avoidance has also been made a central component of next month's meeting of the G8 economic summit by David Cameron and George Osborne. Marks &amp; Spencer said Ireland was used to host the website as it was the largest international market for M&amp;S, and therefore the logical host for the EU site. It said: \"M&amp;S is a major UK taxpayer, contributing over \u00a3800m to the UK exchequer in 2011/12. \"We pay UK corporation tax on all profits generated by UK sales and comply with the tax laws of all jurisdictions in which we operate. We conduct our tax affairs in a transparent and legally compliant manner that is consistent with our longstanding values and complies with the tax laws of all jurisdictions in which we operate. \"Our European websites are owned by M&amp;S Ireland. This is made clear to all customers shopping on our European websites. Ireland is our largest international online market, taking over 50% of our online European sales, which is why we structure our other European websites around it. It would not make good business sense for us to set up anew in every market we enter. \"These are not UK sales, these sites do not serve UK customers and there are no sales made in sterling. All tax is legally and fairly paid both in the UK and in Ireland.\" But tax campaigners have been angered by the revelations of how M&amp;S operates its international division, accusing it of trading off its British reputation. \"Given that Marks &amp; Spencer portrays itself as a British institution, it is disgraceful that it is choosing to avoid paying tax in this country,\" said Suzy Blackwell of UK Uncut, which has pushed for changes to the law to cut down on legal tax avoidance measures. \"The government must stop letting companies like Marks &amp; Spencer dodge tax which could go towards funding vital public services. It's an outrage that the government is allowing this behaviour to continue while making devastating cuts across the country.\" Richard Murphy, an accountant who writes for the UK Tax Justice Network, agreed. \"There is no doubt that this is Marks &amp; Spencer is 'doing an Amazon' by setting up an arrangement in a low tax jurisdiction where little or nothing happens to avoid tax where the trade really takes place. \"As Ernst &amp; Young told the public accounts committee last week, such arrangements are common. But what that means is big business is now used to playing games with tax authorities, who appear to have meekly accepted there is nothing they can do about it. That has to change.\"",

However, M&amp;S only uses this structure for sales outside of the UK: all sales in UK stores and online to UK addresses are processed through the UK and are subject to UK corporation tax.</p> <p>A specification document prepared last year when the site was being designed specified that \"[t]he corporate tax structure will be aligned to that of the Irish website\".</p> <p>The document then detailed how, while the goods would be shipped from the UK, M&amp;S UK would only receive a wholesale \u2013 not retail \u2013 price: \"Goods issue from Hardwick DC [distribution centre] in the UK at cost price \u2026 intercompany invoice at cost price in GBP with a variable mark-up % by country (of order) plus UK VAT\".</p> <p>Earlier this year, after George Osborne announced a further cut to UK corporation tax in his 2013 budget, an M&amp;S employee sent an email to a superior questioning the need for the complex operation of Marks &amp; Spencer's international site, giving their personal view as to why the structure existed:</p> <p>\"Given that it was developed as a means to avoid UK corporation tax when it stood at 26% it now seems appropriate to reassess this,\" it read. \"Corporation tax will be 21% by next year. Does this not render many of the advantages of having an Irish company obsolete?</p> <p>\"From a tax management perspective there may have been advantages in avoiding the UK 26% tax rate but the process and IT overhead with the additional VAT complexity may negate these advantages. Needless to say there is also the reputational damage to M&amp;S should it be seen to be avoiding UK tax in the current climate, as seen with recent examples such as Starbucks [and] Amazon.\"</p> <p>The revelations come amid mounting cross-party political focus on corporate tax avoidance, as Ed Miliband pledges to act unilaterally to tackle tax avoidance, just days after the public accounts committee chair, Margaret Hodge described Google's tax structure as evil.</p> <p>Tax avoidance has also been made a central component of next month's meeting of the G8 economic summit by David Cameron and George Osborne.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer said Ireland was used to host the website as it was the largest international market for M&amp;S, and therefore the logical host for the EU site. It said: \"M&amp;S is a major UK taxpayer, contributing over \u00a3800m to the UK exchequer in 2011/12.</p> <p>\"We pay UK corporation tax on all profits generated by UK sales and comply with the tax laws of all jurisdictions in which we operate. We conduct our tax affairs in a transparent and legally compliant manner that is consistent with our longstanding values and complies with the tax laws of all jurisdictions in which we operate.</p> <p>\"Our European websites are owned by M&amp;S Ireland. This is made clear to all customers shopping on our European websites. Ireland is our largest international online market, taking over 50% of our online European sales, which is why we structure our other European websites around it. It would not make good business sense for us to set up anew in every market we enter.</p> <p>\"These are not UK sales, these sites do not serve UK customers and there are no sales made in sterling. All tax is legally and fairly paid both in the UK and in Ireland.\"</p> <p>But tax campaigners have been angered by the revelations of how M&amp;S operates its international division, accusing it of trading off its British reputation.</p> <p>\"Given that Marks &amp; Spencer portrays itself as a British institution, it is disgraceful that it is choosing to avoid paying tax in this country,\" said Suzy Blackwell of UK Uncut, which has pushed for changes to the law to cut down on legal tax avoidance measures.</p> <p>\"The government must stop letting companies like Marks &amp; Spencer dodge tax which could go towards funding vital public services. It's an outrage that the government is allowing this behaviour to continue while making devastating cuts across the country.\"</p> <p>Richard Murphy, an accountant who writes for the <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/front_content.php?idcatart=2&amp;lang=1\" title=\"\">UK Tax Justice Network</a>, agreed. \"There is no doubt that this is Marks &amp; Spencer is 'doing an Amazon' by setting up an arrangement in a low tax jurisdiction where little or nothing happens to avoid tax where the trade really takes place.</p> <p>\"As Ernst &amp; Young told the public accounts committee last week, such arrangements are common. But what that means is big business is now used to playing games with tax authorities, who appear to have meekly accepted there is nothing they can do about it. That has to change.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan faces an angry shareholder revolt this week as investors attempt to strip boss Jamie Dimon of the chairmanship of the banking giant. The revolt in the wake of last year's $6.2bn (\u00a34bn) London Whale trading loss has been aggravated by a decision to cut off dissident shareholders' access to voting information ahead of the bank's annual meeting on Tuesday. Last year a proposal to split Dimon's roles as chairman and chief executive gained 40% of the vote. But that vote came before the magnitude of the incident was clear and ahead of regulatory and internal reports that have been highly critical of the failures of oversight at the bank. A vote to strip Dimon of the chairman's job, while not binding, would be a heavy blow and there have been reports that he has considered resigning if he does not keep both titles. Shareholders also intend to vote against the reelection of several other directors over their role in the trading fiasco. Last year's vote was sponsored by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) pension fund. This year support for the vote has grown and AFSCME has been joined by employee retirement plans for New York city and the state of Connecticut, as well as the UK's Hermes fund managers. The split has the backing of major investors and the influential advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis &amp; Company. But Dimon has fans too. The T Rowe Price group, one of the firm's top 10 investors, has publicly backed Dimon ahead of the meeting, an unusual move for a large shareholder. Prof Peter Henning of Wayne State University in Detroit said he expected the roles would not be split. He said the bank's financial returns had been exemplary, though \"hubris\" had clearly played a part in the London losses. \"There are good reasons why the roles should be split that have nothing to do with the Whale. This shouldn't be a referendum on Dimon,\" he said. \"The problem is that there is no guarantee that an independent chair would give any greater degree of oversight.\" But Prof Charles Elson, corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, said it was clear the roles should be split. \"The chairman of the board is there to monitor the CEO. A good CEO recognises that,\" he said. \"Titles have meaning.\" Last week the split's backers were denied access to a running tally of how the vote was going. Broadridge, the firm that collated the votes, was asked to restrict access by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main lobby group. As the banks are its clients, Broadridge said it was contractually obliged to comply. The split's supporters argue JP Morgan has been handed an unfair advantage in the final stages of the fight. Large index funds, for example, often wait until the last 48 hours to cast their vote. The Council of Institutional Investors, whose members manage $3tn of assets in total, is now lobbying for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the situation. Shares of JP Morgan Chase have been broadly flat since December 2006, when Dimon assumed the chairmanship. But the bank has significantly outperformed its peers and Dimon is credited with steering the bank through the credit crisis with aplomb. Dimon initially dismissed the Whale losses as a \"tempest in a teapot\" but the losses rattled Washington and led Barack Obama to push for tighter regulation of Wall Street. Dimon's thinking on the situation seems to have evolved too. In April he told shareholders the loss was the \"stupidest and most embarrassing situation I have ever been part of\".",

      "bodyText": "Last week, I was waiting in the queue at the butcher while an elderly lady was being served. Clearly, she was not that well-off and chose the cheapest cuts of meat. When she was done, the butcher asked the assistant serving her how much the bill came to. Told that it was \u00a311, he whispered: \"Make it \u00a38.\" It was a small example of generosity made all the better by the butcher taking care that his customer was unaware of what he was doing. It was also a far cry from the world of big business in a week that saw dawn raids on Shell and BP for alleged price-fixing and Google accused by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge of doing evil. Stung by the attack from the chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, mounted a defence in the Observer. Tax is a mightily complex matter for multinational companies, he said. The global system could do with reform. It was up to politicians to set the rules, but they had to recognise the dangers if profit became a dirty word. All credit to Hodge for flushing Schmidt out. He likes to portray himself as the new sort of boss of a new sort of company, the ones that boast of their non-hierarchical structures, their dress-down policies and their chill-out zones. But the row about tax has shown that the people running these new-wave behemoths are not hippy capitalists, they are robber barons in chinos. Nor should we expect otherwise. The dominant form of corporate organisation in the west is the joint stock company, the purpose of which is to deliver profits for its shareholders. Almost all these companies pay lip-service to corporate social responsibility. The companies selling booze say they are firmly committed to tackling problem drinking. The betting shop chains say they want to see responsible gambling. The fast food companies and the soft drinks industry sponsor sporting events in the hope that nobody notices how they are contributing to obesity. But they are in business to maximise profits for their shareholders. Period. The intellectual justification for the profit-maximising company can be traced all the way back to Adam Smith, who famously said in the Wealth of Nations: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the baker or the brewer that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\" The pursuit of profit, in other words, creates wealth from which we all benefit. The Theory of Moral Sentiments, an earlier work by Smith, contained a rather different message, namely that there are good human qualities such as generosity and the desire to be seen worthy of the approval of others. Many problems, Smith thought, would be solved if only people could hold up a mirror and see themselves \"in the light in which others see us\". Corporate social responsibility is supposed to address this point. Businesses like to be held in high esteem by their customers, but many of them have missed the crucial part of Smith's message: curbing the instinct to behave badly was not seen as being driven by commercial ends but by natural instincts. The real world is somewhat different. More than 30 clothing retailers have signed the Bangladesh Safety Accord for regular independent safety inspections of garment factories, but only after the deaths of 1,127 workers in the collapse of the Rana Plaza works exposed them to reputational risk. Smith, at a guess, would have been horrified \u2013 if not entirely surprised \u2013 to find that the European commission had launched dawn raids on Shell and BP amid allegations of price-fixing; that the European head of Google was being accused of doing evil by Hodge; and that Britain's big banks had been fingered for a string of offences from the mis-selling of protection payment insurance to money laundering. Nor would Smith have expected Google, Amazon or Starbucks to voluntarily pay more tax than they were legally obliged to for the simple reason that he distrusted enterprises which wielded monopoly or oligopoly power. His objection to a company such as Amazon would have been that it is using its market power to eliminate competition and would be in a position, once all the other booksellers had been driven out of business, to charge higher prices. The fact is, of course, that the world has moved on since Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations. There are examples of businesses that operate \"in the light in which others see us\", but as a general rule of thumb they tend to be small, local, non-transnational, non-PLC and open to the full blast of competition. But perfect competition does not exist. The corporate world is not dominated by small shopkeepers who worry what their customers might think about them, but by large corporations generating revenues that get channelled upwards to executives and shareholders. Companies will only change for one of three reasons: they are forced to do so legally; they are forced to do so by their customers; or because they spontaneously decide that they want to operate in accord with Smith's moral sentiments. Changes to the international tax system will be on the agenda when the G8 meets in Northern Ireland for its annual summit next month, and there has probably never been a better time to crack down on tax havens, aggressive tax planning and transfer-pricing schemes. In part this is because of the egregious nature of the corporate scandals and in part because governments are badly in need of tax receipts in a time of weak growth. Tax threatens to become to the 2010s what debt relief was to the 1990s: the focus of a global campaign for reform. In the end, though, the success of any campaign will depend on how the public behaves. If we don't like the current state of affairs, we can do one of two things. We can put pressure on governments to break up monopolies and inject more competition. We can call for a new business model, based on \"for benefit\" organisations, to challenge the domination of the joint stock company.

When she was done, the butcher asked the assistant serving her how much the bill came to. Told that it was \u00a311, he whispered: \"Make it \u00a38.\"</p> <p>It was a small example of generosity made all the better by the butcher taking care that his customer was unaware of what he was doing. It was also a far cry from the world of big business in a week that saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/may/16/sfo-alleged-price-fixing-oil\" title=\"\">dawn raids on Shell and BP for alleged price-fixing</a> and Google accused by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge of doing evil.</p> <p>Stung by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/16/google-told-by-mp-you-do-do-evil\" title=\"\">the attack from the chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee</a>, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, mounted a defence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/18/google-tax-reform-eric-schmidt\" title=\"\">in the Observer</a>. Tax is a mightily complex matter for multinational companies, he said. The global system could do with reform. It was up to politicians to set the rules, but they had to recognise the dangers if profit became a dirty word.</p> <p>All credit to Hodge for flushing Schmidt out. He likes to portray himself as the new sort of boss of a new sort of company, the ones that boast of their non-hierarchical structures, their dress-down policies and their chill-out zones. But the row about tax has shown that the people running these new-wave behemoths are not hippy capitalists, they are robber barons in chinos.</p> <p>Nor should we expect otherwise. The dominant form of corporate organisation in the west is the joint stock company, the purpose of which is to deliver profits for its shareholders. Almost all these companies pay lip-service to corporate social responsibility. The companies selling booze say they are firmly committed to tackling problem drinking. The betting shop chains say they want to see responsible gambling. The fast food companies and the soft drinks industry sponsor sporting events in the hope that nobody notices how they are contributing to obesity. But they are in business to maximise profits for their shareholders. Period.</p> <p>The intellectual justification for the profit-maximising company can be traced all the way back to Adam Smith, who famously said in the Wealth of Nations: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the baker or the brewer that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\" The pursuit of profit, in other words, creates wealth from which we all benefit.</p> <p>The Theory of Moral Sentiments, an earlier work by Smith, contained a rather different message, namely that there are good human qualities such as generosity and the desire to be seen worthy of the approval of others. Many problems, Smith thought, would be solved if only people could hold up a mirror and see themselves \"in the light in which others see us\".</p> <p>Corporate social responsibility is supposed to address this point. Businesses like to be held in high esteem by their customers, but many of them have missed the crucial part of Smith's message: curbing the instinct to behave badly was not seen as being driven by commercial ends but by natural instincts. The real world is somewhat different. More than 30 clothing retailers have signed the Bangladesh Safety Accord for regular independent safety inspections of garment factories, but only after the deaths of 1,127 workers in the collapse of the Rana Plaza works exposed them to reputational risk.</p> <p>Smith, at a guess, would have been horrified \u2013 if not entirely surprised \u2013 to find that the European commission had launched dawn raids on Shell and BP amid allegations of price-fixing; that the European head of Google was being accused of doing evil by Hodge; and that Britain's big banks had been fingered for a string of offences from the mis-selling of protection payment insurance to money laundering.</p> <p>Nor would Smith have expected Google, Amazon or Starbucks to voluntarily pay more tax than they were legally obliged to for the simple reason that he distrusted enterprises which wielded monopoly or oligopoly power. His objection to a company such as Amazon would have been that it is using its market power to eliminate competition and would be in a position, once all the other booksellers had been driven out of business, to charge higher prices.</p> <p>The fact is, of course, that the world has moved on since Smith wrote the <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/wealth-of-nations\" title=\"\">Wealth of Nations</a>. There are examples of businesses that operate \"in the light in which others see us\", but as a general rule of thumb they tend to be small, local, non-transnational, non-PLC and open to the full blast of competition.</p> <p>But perfect competition does not exist. The corporate world is not dominated by small shopkeepers who worry what their customers might think about them, but by large corporations generating revenues that get channelled upwards to executives and shareholders.</p> <p>Companies will only change for one of three reasons: they are forced to do so legally; they are forced to do so by their customers; or because they spontaneously decide that they want to operate in accord with Smith's moral sentiments.</p> <p>Changes to the international tax system will be on the agenda when the G8 meets in Northern Ireland for its annual summit next month, and there has probably never been a better time to crack down on tax havens, aggressive tax planning and transfer-pricing schemes. In part this is because of the egregious nature of the corporate scandals and in part because governments are badly in need of tax receipts in a time of weak growth. Tax threatens to become to the 2010s what debt relief was to the 1990s: the focus of a global campaign for reform.</p> <p>In the end, though, the success of any campaign will depend on how the public behaves. If we don't like the current state of affairs, we can do one of two things. We can put pressure on governments to break up monopolies and inject more competition. We can call for a new business model, based on \"for benefit\" organisations, to challenge the domination of the joint stock company. We can force them to introduce sales taxes to avoid profits migrating offshore. Alternatively, we can vote with our feet, and stop patronising the companies that exploit loopholes in the tax system, even though that might mean higher prices and less choice. If we are not prepared to do one of these two things, we will have to lump it.</p> <p>After the events of the past few years, it would be naive to expect the initiative to come from the boardroom.

      "bodyText": "The outgoing governor of the Bank of England has called on the British people not to \"demonise\" bankers for the financial crisis. Sir Mervyn King said on Sunday that the failings of the financial and regulatory system were the root cause of the turmoil which struck the world economy almost six years ago. King, who leaves the Bank this summer, told Sky News's Murnaghan programme that there was widespread risk-taking in the runup to the credit crunch, and it had been a mistake to give the banking sector such a lofty status in the good times. \"Where the banks contributed to the problem was that they themselves had taken too many risks on their balance sheet and they simply didn't have enough capital to absorb the losses that were likely to come along and people took fright, they lost confidence in the banks, they didn't provide money to the banks so the banks couldn't lend to businesses or households. \"I would say to people though, don't demonise individuals here. This wasn't a problem of individuals, this was a problem of failure of a system. We collectively allowed the banking system to become too big, we gave them far too much status and standing in society, and we didn't regulate it adequately by ensuring it had enough capital.\" Asked if he regretted not doing more to prevent the crisis, King said he and the Bank had issued warnings. Conservative MP Brooks Newmark said King could not escape some responsibility for the errors that helped to cause the biggest financial crisis in generations. \"He is the Governor of the Bank of England, it sort of says it on the tin what he is responsible for,\" Newmark told Murnaghan. Lord Myners, the former City minister, agreed that King had failed to see the problems building-up in the runup to 2007, and had become \"hung up on moral hazard\" once the banking sector was being bailed out. \"The judgement of history which with Governors is written about a hundred years later, will say that he failed in two very major respects and also a third one, that he failed to modernise the Bank,\" Myners added. King also expressed concern over Britain's new Help to Buy scheme, which involves the government guaranteeing up to 15% of a mortgage on properties worth up to \u00a3600,000. The scheme, which begins in January 2014, is due to run for three years. King warned that there is \"no place\" for a permanent scheme of this kind. \"This scheme is a little too close for comfort to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages. We had a very healthy mortgage market with competing lenders attracting borrowers before the crisis, and we need to get back to that healthy mortgage market. \"We do not want what the United States have, which is a government-guaranteed mortgage market, and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position. \"So, we mustn't let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme. Now when is the right time to terminate it will depend on economic conditions at the time.\" King also warned that the struggling eurozone economy remains the largest threat to the UK, and criticised European leaders for driving their economies into a \"downward spiral\". Britain's \"modest recovery\" could be derailed, he warned, if the single currency region remains trapped in recession or only achieves low growth. \"It is very difficult to see that they will be growing quickly for a long while, and that downward drag on exports from the UK to Europe, they account for almost half of our exports, and the fact that our banks still have some exposure to the euro here is undoubtedly the single biggest factor dragging down on our economy.\" The eurozone economy has now been shrinking for the past 18 months, with sharp recessions in countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece where tough spending cuts and tax rises have been imposed.",
