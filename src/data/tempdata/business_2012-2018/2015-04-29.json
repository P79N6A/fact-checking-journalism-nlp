      "bodyText": "\u201cTransitory factors\u201d are to blame for the recent slowdown on the US economy, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. In a statement released after the latest two-day meeting the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) the central bank brushed off recent bad news and left open the possibility of raising interest rates, a hike that would be the first in almost a decade. The Fed meeting ended as the Commerce Department announced that US gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to a crawl in the first quarter. After growing at an annual rate of 2.2% in the last three months of 2014 it slowed to just 0.2% in the first three months of 2015. Last month the Labor Department announced the US added just 126,000 new jobs in February, half what had been expected. The latest jobs report is out next Friday. The extreme winter weather, strong dollar and collapsing oil prices that have stalled the US\u2019s energy boom contributed to the slowdown. \u201cEconomic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors,\u201d the Fed said. While growth and employment had slowed officials said they expected a return to a modest pace of growth and that the job market could continue to improve, \u201cwith appropriate policy accommodation\u201d. Dan Greenhouse, chief strategist at broker BTIG, noted that the Fed had removed a sentence it used in its last statement that said there was unlikely to be a rate hike after the next meeting. \u201cWithout that sentence, the June meeting is theoretically \u2018live\u2019 although we doubt, given the downbeat tone in the first paragraph, that a hike in June is forthcoming,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. US stock markets are at or close to record highs with economists arguing much of those gains have been driven by the Fed\u2019s policy of keeping rates close to zero and its giant economic stimulus program. In 2013 stock markets threw a \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d when the Fed chairman suggested he could end the quantitative easing (QE) stimulus program earlier than expected. QE is now over but some market watchers fear markets could be rocked again if and when the Fed moves to raise rates. \u201cGiven the importance of the first rate hike, which would be the first policy tightening in almost a decade, the conventional wisdom is that the Fed would then wait until at least September, which would be the next FOMC meeting with a scheduled press conference,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief US economist wrote in a note to clients. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t completely rule out a late July hike, however, since Fed chair Janet Yellen could use her semi-annual congressional testimony in mid-July to flag such a move ahead of time. Either way, we still think the Fed will start to raise rates in the second half of this year and, as wage growth and price inflation rebound, we anticipate that rates will rise much more rapidly next year than either the markets or the Fed currently expect.\u201d",

The chief executive of HRG, John Walden, said he was considering opening even more in future. Sales at established Argos stores slid 5% in the eight weeks to 28 February after a difficult Christmas. But an overall rise in sales at the chain for the year to 28 February lifted group sales by 1% to \u00a35.7bn. Pre-tax profits rose by nearly 15% to \u00a3129.5m. The company lifted its full year dividend by 15% which Walden said was a mark of \u201cconfidence in the underlying performance of the business\u201d. Walden said he hoped that consumer confidence would pick up in the second half of the year. \u201cThe key indicators are pointing to starting to see benefits coming through,\u201d he said. The CBI\u2019s survey of the retail sector, published on Wednesday, said DIY retailers had benefited from the advent of spring. The arrival of sunny weather lifted sales at clothing, furniture and carpet retailers in April, offsetting falling grocery sales. It said the overall picture was one of weak growth, although shops reported that May was likely to be a better month.",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to Barclays, John McFarlane, here\u2019s what life has to offer: a fresh \u00a3800m provision for rigging currency markets, taking the running total to \u00a32bn. The new chairman won\u2019t be surprised by this turn of events, but you can understand why the old one, Sir David Walker, closed his speech at the annual meeting last week by thanking shareholders for their patience. The tide of provisions at Barclays has been so strong since 2012 that investors are weary of ever seeing the cleaned-up, technologically savvy bank the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, keeps talking about. McFarlane, with a newcomer\u2019s zeal, pledged at the same meeting to hurry things along. \u201cWe need to get the errors of the past behind us,\u201d he declared, bemoaning the fact that Barclays\u2019 shares still trade below book value. Full marks for ambition, but one has to wonder whether, even in a year\u2019s time, a shiny new Barclays will be visible. First, it is the regulators who dictate the speed and scope of settlements. A complication in the foreign exchange case was the entry of Benjamin Lawsky, the head of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services. That prompted Barclays to opt out of a deal in the US, UK and Switzerland agreed by six other banks last year. A new multi-bank mega-settlement, this time including the US Department of Justice, is said to be due next month. But no deadline is hard in this field. Nor is it clear whether Barclays will be able to settle all the allegations in a single job-lot. The second challenge is that the regulatory headaches extend well beyond forex. As Barclays\u2019 annual report reminds investors, the Serious Fraud Office is still investigating the terms of the Qatari fundraising in 2008; and the DoJ and the US Securities and Exchange Commission are looking at compliance with US bribery laws. Then there is an entirely separate investigation into Barclays\u2019 handling of \u201cdark\u201d, or private, trading pools. The list goes on. In the chairman\u2019s seat at the insurer Aviva, McFarlane struck like a whirlwind. Businesses were sold, capital was reallocated and a big cost-cutting plan was drawn up. Barclays, under Jenkins, has a similar strategy but is still dragging about \u00a365bn of non-core assets. McFarlane sounds impatient, which is a good place to start, but Barclays is not Aviva. Let\u2019s see if he is so fizzy after a year in the regulatory wringer. Next has a spring in its step. M&amp;S should take note Normal service is resumed at Next: sales in the first three months of the year were ahead of forecasts. It was always the way to bet. The chief executive, Lord Wolfson, may have been \u201cvery cautious\u201d last month about the year ahead, but a touch of spring sunshine always helps a well-run clothing retailer. Next shareholders will get a 60p special dividend because the share price remains well above the self-imposed buy-back limit, currently \u00a368.27. Rival Marks &amp; Spencer should take note of that latter point. Next month it will give an update on returns to shareholders. M&amp;S hasn\u2019t had the luxury of boosting investors\u2019 returns meaningfully for a while, and it may be that initial plans are confined to the ordinary dividend. But, if M&amp;S has greater ambitions, it should copy Next\u2019s approach. Admit that buy-backs can\u2019t be justified at any price. Put a cap on the price you will pay, and explain your calculations. Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders must be kept in the loop Here\u2019s a question that doesn\u2019t crop up often. If you are a FTSE 100 company and your chief executive has been sentenced to two years in prison in Egypt should you inform your shareholders? The company is Sainsbury\u2019s and the Times revealed that Mike Coupe was convicted, in his absence, of embezzlement last September in bizarre proceedings related to the supermarket chain\u2019s short-lived business in north Africa 14 years ago. The case is farcical, it hardly needs saying. Coupe was in London on 15 July last year when it is claimed he seized cheques in the Egyptian city of Giza. Sainsbury\u2019s lawyers will surely get the case quashed. All the same, a conviction is a conviction and Coupe had to travel to Egypt last weekend to enter an appeal. Should companies disclose such facts? Sainsbury\u2019s says it was advised there was no need to utter a word. OK, but commonsense says that, if it was safe for Coupe to put in a weekend appearance in Egypt, it would have been polite to let shareholders know about the legal judgment, even if it is ridiculous.",

    "webTitle": "Shock as US economy grows just 0.2%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, the disappointing US GDP data has sent markets tumbling. The weakness in the US economy, if sustained, poses problems for global growth but also means an imminent increase in US borrowing costs is very unlikely. That has hit the dollar, and by extension pushed the euro higher which has undermined European markets. The export heavy Dax has been hit particularly hard, while the FTSE 100 has closed below 7000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. There were also the usual uncertainties surrounding the continuing attempts to avoid Greece defaulting and the forthcoming UK election. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 1.2% or 84.25 points to 6946.28 Germany\u2019s Dax was down 3.21% at 11,432.72 France\u2019s Cac closed2.59% lower at 5039.39 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 2.28% to 22,995.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.97% at 11,378.9 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 135 points or 0.75% lower. So on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Oil prices are moving higher after US crude stocks rose less than expected last week. Inventories climbed by 1.9m barrels compared to analysts expectations of a 2.3m barrels increase, suggesting higher than forecast demand. Brent crude is currently up more than 1% at $65.35 a barrel. Back to Greece and how are those negotiations going? More US data, this time for housing and this time a little better than expected. Pending home sales - contracts to buy previously owned US homes - rose to their highest level since June 2013 in March, the third monthly rise in a row. The National Association of Realtors said its sales index rose 1.1% to 108.6 last month, compared to forecast of a1% gain. The association\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said more buyers than usual had entered the spring market: Demand appears to be stronger in several parts of the country, especially in metro areas that have seen solid job gains and firmer economic growth over the past year,. But Yun warned: Demand in many markets is far exceeding supply, and properties in March sold at a faster rate than any month since last summer. This in turn has pushed home prices to unhealthy levels \u2014 nearly four or more times above the pace of wage growth in some parts of the country. Simply put, housing inventory for new and existing homes needs to improve measurably to improve affordability. Earlier, official figures showed German inflation picked up to 0.3% in April, the second month of price growth after deflation in Januaury and February. And Belgium also exited deflation. Looks like the European Central Bank\u2019s policy is working. It launched a \u00a360bn a month quantitative easing programme in March to fight deflation. The rollercoaster of US GDP readings continues, says Richard de Meo, managing director of foreign exchange boutique Foenix Partners. He notes that the last four readings have ranged between a fall of 2.1% and a rise of 5%. Yellen\u2019s assurances that the Fed would simply respond to data in making policy decisions has re-focused investors on US economic indicators, exaggerating market sensitivity to data as interest rate expectations fluctuate accordingly. Weeks of softer data now capped by disappointing GDP figures have come at a bad time for the dollar, left languishing at eight week lows today in anticipation of a shift in tone from the FOMC tonight. A dovish tone would see traders nodding in approval and self-congratulation as recent dollar selling becomes justified. However, a status quo from the Fed tonight suggests investors have misread how the softening of US data might affect the dot forecasts. It is difficult to see anything other than an end to the dollar sell-off. Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, has looked at what this means for the dollar, which hit an eight-week low after the GDP figures. The dollar index, which measures its value against six major currencies, fell for the sixth day in a row to its lowest level since early March. Q1 US GDP was well below expectations with the economy growing only fractionally in the first quarter. Together with the improving lending trends out of Europe this morning the divergence between the US and eurozone is now stark and it is no surprise that the dollar has breached 1.10 against the euro after this data. Expectations for the first US interest rate increase will only be pushed out further \u2013 but on a positive note a weaker dollar will benefit emerging markets where valuations are nowhere near as extended as developed equities. So it looks like the eurozone will outperform both the UK and the US in terms of economic growth. Here\u2019s a useful breakdown of the GDP numbers, courtesy of Marc Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services International. Personal consumption - just above forecasts at 1.9% vs. forecast 1.7% and Q4 4.4% - definitely weather impacted, and in some senses weather may have been more of a drag than Q1 2014, last year\u2019s bad weather was severe but short sharp snaps, while Q1 2015 was very protracted A big drag from business investment in atructures at -23.1% q/q, both energy/energy related sector (e.g. transport &amp; machinery) and weather related Another big drag from net exports - but I would disagree with a dollar strength based rationale, and point the finger rather at the West Coast port strike A big add from inventories at 0.74 ppts, which had been signalled by the steep rise in the inventories to sales ratio, which leaves a large overhang for Q2 and implies less immediate potential for a rebound in manufacturing production Housing investment was a small positive (but we knew that) at 1.3% q/q Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: Most Fed officials appear to share our view that this is a temporary slowdown, albeit a more severe deceleration than we previously anticipated. Accordingly, while it might delay the timing of the first rate hike, we still anticipate a lift-off later this year.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Financial markets had been braced for a slowdown in activity following brutal winter weather but had not been braced for the scale of the decline reported by the Commerce Department in Washington. After growing at an annual pace of 2.2% in the final three months of 2014, economists had been forecasting a slowdown to 1% in the January to March period of 2015 - a period in which blizzards and a strike affecting West Coast ports stifled activity. The official data showed that the drop in oil prices had affected investment in the US oil and gas sector but cheaper energy bills had yet to boost consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending slowed to an annual increase of 1.9% in the first quarter, down from 4.4% in late 2014 and the weakest for a year. Construction output was badly hit by the poor weather, leading some analysts to predict that the US would bounce back quickly in the second and third quarters of 2015 as it did in 2014. But recent data for retail sales, housebuilding and business investment has not been strong, suggesting that the rebound will be less vigorous this time. Policymakers at the US Federal Reserve are expected to shrug off the economic slowdown as temporary in their statement following the meeting tonight. However, while at the start of the year many economists were expecting the first rate hike in June, most now think this is unlikely to happen before September. The pound hit an eight-week of $1.5415 after the poor US GDP figures. ING economist Rob Carnell is relatively relaxed about the US GDP figures, which come a couple of hours before the Fed meets to discuss monetary policy. On initial reflection, this is not so much news, as confirmation of what we already knew about the first quarter. And to be honest, it could have been worse, at least it had a plus sign \u2013 just. Consumer spending was if anything a little better than anticipated at 1.9%, though only by 0.1% or so. Business investment was basically flat from the previous quarter, also in line with expectations, and there was an unhelpful drag from state and local government spending. Looking forward to the second quarter... we might well expect a positive bounce from the combination of net exports and inventories, perhaps adding half a percent back. Some stronger business investment and consumer spending will also help. So rather than a figure close to zero, we might reasonably look for something quite a bit stronger than 3% in the second quarter. In a couple of hours, the Federal Reserve will meet to discuss the timing of the first rate hike. No doubt they will discuss this release. But for most of them, the more important question will be, what is future growth going to be like? Though it takes a leap of faith to say that the second quarter will see the bounce we are anticipating, this latest GDP figure provides no reason for undue pessimism. We think the Fed will have to give the economy the benefit of the doubt, and as such, it will be hard for them to categorically rule out a June hike, even though the odds are currently stacked against one. Bad weather affected consumers\u2019 willingness to go out and spend at the start of the year, so the shock GDP number could be a blip. Disruption at ports on the West Coast \u2013 the labour dispute has now been resolved \u2013 and the strong dollar also affected the numbers. The dollar weakened after the data was released, and the FTSE 100 index in London fell some 30 points, but has recovered somewhat and is now trading at 6982.05, down nearly 50 points, or 0.7%. The Dax in Frankfurt has lost nearly 170 points, or 1.4%, to 11,643.21 while the CAC in Paris is down almost 70 points, or 1.3%, at 5104.01. Chris Williamson, economist at financial data provider Markit, says: A stalling of US economic growth at the start of the year rules out any imminent hiking of interest rates by the Fed. The slowdown looks temporary, as a rebound from the first quarter weakness is already being signalled by forward-looking survey data, but the sustainability of any upturn is by no means convincing yet. As such, policymakers will probably want to see how the economy performs in the second quarter before passing judgement on whether the time is right to start the process of normalising policy. That leaves September as the first realistic possibility of rates being hiked, providing of course that the economy bounces back in coming months. US GDP is a bit of a shocker: the economy grew at an annualised rate of just 0.2% in the first quarter, the weakest in a year. Wall Street economists were expecting a slowdown to a 1% to 1.2% growth rate, from 2.2% in the previous quarter. Euclid Tsakalotos, the Oxford-educated economics professor who now heads up the Greek negotiating team in debt talks, has just made statements saying Greece has to keep to its \u201cred lines\u201d and that any \u201careas of compromise\u201d should be within the \u201cpolitical plan\u201d. More from Helena Smith in Athens. The Greek finance minister has broken his silence issuing a long statement about last night\u2019s incident. Varoufakis said it was his artist wife, Danae, who saved the day. Contrary to the conjecture that has been heard, it was not an organised attack or attempt at seriously injuring us, provocation or part of the much wider effort to politically \u201cdeconstruct\u201d me in recent days. I have the impression that their goal was not to hurt us, because if they had wanted to hurt us, they had the opportunity and \u2018arithmetic\u2019 supremacy to do so. I think their aim was to force me to flee with a few light humiliating swipes. This, however, will never be known because Danae, before the anti-establishment protestors [and before I could stop her], could get to us, stood up and hugged me hard, turning her back towards them so that they would have to hit her before me.\u201d The finance minister said he attempted to speak to protestors after the incident. Exharchia, the area where the incident took place in central Athens, is regarded by anarchists and the extreme left as their stomping ground. The protestors were reportedly incensed when the finance minister who lived in the neighbourhood until 2006 showed up to eat there. A Greek journalist, who spoke to Varoufakis earlier, quotes the finance minister as saying that had he had security with him Exharchia would have gone up in flames. Meanwhile Greek bank deposits fell to a ten year low in March, as savers continued to worry about the country\u2019s finances and the continuing impasse over releasing bailout funds. They dropped 1.36% month on month to \u20ac138.55bn from \u20ac140.47bn, the sixth monthly fall in a row albeit at a slower pace than in February. But the European Central Bank has reportedly raised the amount of emergency liquidity available to Greek banks, as reported by Bloomberg. It lifted the cap on Emergency Liquidity Assistance by \u20ac1.4bn to \u20ac76.9bn, after an increase of around \u20ac1.5bn last week. Back with Greece, and more signs the country\u2019s government is indeed considering calling a referendum, according to statements by deputy prime minister Giannis Dragasakis. Helena Smith reports: The Greek people will have the last word in the event of negotiations ending in deadlock, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister and chief economics policy maker said this morning. Speaking to the Kokkino radio station, Dragasakis said he foresaw the country finally sealing a deal with its creditors in the first few days of May. But, he warned, it would only be a \u201cminimum agreement\u201d to unlock rescue funds Greece now desperately needed to avoid default. The difficult work would begin after that. \u201cNow we are going to a minimum agreement with actions that can be taken immediately,\u201d he said of the package of reforms the Syriza-dominated government is preparing. \u201cBut [in the long-term] not just any solution will suffice. The solution has to be viable. After the interim agreement a long discussion about the debt, primary surpluses, investment and growth will follow,\u201d he said adding that the interim accord would be the building block \u201cfor an interim space.\u201d Dragasakis, who is widely seen as a moderate, described the government\u2019s decision to reshuffle its negotiating team \u201cas the result of the experience that we have had so far.\u201d Earlier the European Commission reported that economic sentiment had slipped in April. The index dipped from 103.9 in March to 103.7 for the eurozone, slightly worse than analysts\u2019 expectations of an unchanged figure. For the EU as a whole the figure was 106.4, up 0.3. The commission said; The stabilisation of euro-area sentiment resulted from increasing confidence in the services sector being offset by opposite developments in the construction sector and among consumers. German 10 year bond yields are set for their biggest daily rise since December 2013, according to Tradeweb. They are currently up around 9 basis points to 0.25%, on the back of hopes for a Greek resolution if the new reforms hit the target, as well as a weak German auction which sold \u20ac3.274bn worth of 5 year bonds. Still with the UK, and retail sales growth slowed unexpectedly in April according to the CBI. The business group\u2019s distributive trades index showed a retail sales balance of +12, up from +18 in March but lower than expectations of a rise to +25. But optimism about sales in the coming month rose sharply. Sales in most sectors rose but grocery sales declined, according to the survey. Barry Williams, chair of the survey, said: With shopping habits changing so dramatically in the last few years, underlying consumer confidence is hard to read. But both retailers and wholesalers are optmistic there will be a spring in their customers\u2019 steps, and therefore their sales, in the near future. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: Despite April\u2019s modestly softer CBI survey, the prospects for retail sales and consumer spending look largely bright: Consumer confidence is relatively elevated, employment is high and rising, inflation is negligible and earnings growth is trending up. Consumer confidence in Britain has fallen this month for the first time since December \u2013 disappointing news for David Cameron ahead of next Thursday\u2019s general election. Polling firm YouGov and economics consultancy CEBR said their measure of consumer confidence fell to 113.1 in April from 113.9 in March. That\u2019s more than a point lower than it was this time last year. The news comes after official GDP figures yesterday showed economic growth slowed sharply in the first three months of the year. With the election just over a week away, the dip in confidence has come at \u201cexactly the wrong time for the government,\u201d said Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports. He added: As the GDP figures slow down, it is clear that consumers still feel as though the recovery is fragile and that many of them are not feeling it in their wallets. Italy has sold \u20ac6bn of bonds, hitting the top end of its \u20ac4bn-\u20ac6bn targeted range. Extraordinary scene outside the Athens finance ministry this morning, with boss Yanis Varoufakis being mobbed by scores of journalists as he arrived for work. Word of his encounter with an anarchist group last night has spread fast, as Helena Smith reports. If Varoufakis has been sidelined, he has definitely not lost the interest of media at home and abroad. Waiting for him as he turned up for work on his powerful motorbike - without a security detail as he has done from his first day in office - the finance minister was assailed by scores of journalists wanting to ask him about his run-in in Athens last night. Rucksack on back, Varoufakis smiled broadly for the cameras but was uncharacteristically silent - perhaps not wanting to further inflame passions amongst the anarchist bloc and extreme left with which the governing Syriza party has long had ties. Varoufakis may be Europe\u2019s most vocal anti-austerian but to this day has not signed up to Syriza unlike the new man coordinating Athens\u2019 negotiating team Euclid Tsakalotos, who was shadow finance minister when Syriza was in opposition and is a member of the party\u2019s central committee (both however are university economic professors). Last night\u2019s incident in Exharcheia - with Varoufakis, his wife and a female friend being rounded on by a group of around 30 masked protestors - has sent tremors through the government with some officials fearing it could be a warning sign of worse to come. European stock markets have turned positive. Germany\u2019s Dax, France\u2019s CAC and Spain\u2019s Ibex are all up around 0.2%, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has nearly 0.5% ahead. The FTSE 100 index is up less than 4 points now, at 7035.33. Independent City analyst Louise Cooper has looked at this morning\u2019s corporate results. We\u2019ve had a significant update from corporate UK and so what does it tell us? she asks. If you\u2019re positioned well on the high street, then business is good as Britons are spending. Greggs the baker has reported strong like for like sales, up 5.9%. It talks of a \u201csupportive consumer income environment\u201d which is what Whitbread mentioned yesterday. Greggs is low priced food, sold to the masses. It therefore says something about how confident that demographic is feeling. Investors are pleased and the stock is up 2%. Next also issued a trading statement with sales +4.1% of which +3.2% are full price. As it gets bigger and is now No 1 in UK women\u2019s clothing market, growth becomes more difficult. Even so its numbers have pleased the market and the stock price is up 3%. Shares in Home Retail Group - owner of Argos and Homebase - are up 3% on slightly better than forecast earnings. Don\u2019t get too carried away as sales at \u00a35.7bn are still below the \u00a36bn achieved in 2010. And benchmark profits at \u00a3135m are almost half the comparable figure in 2010 of \u00a3290m. But what I thought was fascinating in the results was the growth and now dominance of digital. Argos: \u201cInternet is now 46% total sales including mobile which grew 38% to represent 25% of total sales.\u201d Wow. If a retailer selling commoditised product is not good at selling online and the logistics of delivery, then it may as well give up now. If you sell a crap product then nothing is going to help. Cigarette maker BAT: \u201ctrading environment remains challenging due to continued pressure on consumers\u2019 disposable income worldwide\u201d. I just think the firm is making excuses and that actually selling a toxic product that kills you is never good business. Not toxic but unpleasant, Thorntons has issued yet another poor trading performance, barely growing sales. The share price in 1989 was \u00a31.50, now its 83p. Its just horrible chocolate. The rule of retail it to get the product right. I much prefer Lindt which is beyond delicious (and the reason why I need to jog for an hour to burn off the calories). Reuters is also reporting that Greece will present a draft reform bill to its international creditors today, according to government officials \u2013 in an effort to show it is serious about its pledges. However, the bill is not expected to offer major new concessions, beyond those already discussed with creditors. It does include details on measures to clamp down on corruption and tax evasion: Tax and public administration reforms, a tax on television broadcasting rights and TV ads. Tourists on popular Greek islands will be required to use a credit card for transactions over \u20ac70, in a bid to tackle tax evasion. One official also said Athens would push back plans to raise the minimum wage, a move opposed by creditors. However, Greece\u2019s deputy labour minister made clear on Mega TV that Athens will not agree to demands for further pension cuts. The draft bill is set to be debated at a cabinet meeting in Athens on Thursday. Once approved, it would then be debated in parliament. Tsipras and German chancellor Angela Merkel agreed in a telephone conversation on Sunday to maintain close contact during the debt talks, a Greek government official has told Reuters. The official was quoted as saying: During their communication, they expressed their common will for a steady communication throughout the course of negotiations in order to have a mutually beneficial solution soon. Greece is trying to negotiate a deal that will unlock \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds. The Greek impasse is weighing on European stock markets this morning. The FTSE 100 index in London has edged some 8 points higher to 7039.23, a 0.1% gain. The Dax is now down 8 points , or 0.07%, at 11,806.57after opening 0.5% higher. The CAC in Paris has shed nearly 5 points to 5168.54. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras reshuffled the team handling crucial talks with the country\u2019s international creditors on Monday, but the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis denied he had been sidelined. The European Central Bank has raised the cap on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) that Greek banks can draw from the country\u2019s central bank by \u20ac1.4bn, taking the ELA ceiling to \u20ac76.9bn, Reuters reported, citing a banking source. Mike Coupe has an unshakeable alibi in his fight against two years in an Egyptian jail - from ITV\u2019s business editor, Joel Hills: Some more thoughts on Varoufakis\u2019 run-in with anarchists. It is not the first time a wife has leapt to her husband\u2019s defence. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s wife Wendi Deng \u2013 a volleyball player in her school days \u2013 was hailed as a new national role model in China after she pushed away a British comedian who threw a foam pie at Murdoch while he was being questioned by a UK parliamentary select committee, and then threw the plate at him. Over in Greece, the government will re-launch public broadcaster the Hellenic Broadcasting Croporation, ERT, and rehire employees \u2013 two years after its controversial closure in June 2013. The previous conservative government\u2019s decision to shut down ERT caused an uproar, both within and outside the country. The relaunch was one of the leftist Syriza party\u2019s main election pledges. Around 1,500 permanent staff, of the 2,595 previously employed by the broadcaster, will be rehired. We\u2019ve just spotted another retail story (thanks to retail analyst Nick Bubb). Former Tesco man Tim Mason \u2013 its marketing guru who went on to run its doomed Fresh &amp; Easy chain in the US \u2013 then re-emerged in the UK as chairman of discount fashion chain Bonmarch\u00e9 when it floated in 2013. He has just stepped down and been replaced by veteran retailer John Coleman. Bubb asks: Does this mean that he has a job lined up back in food retail? No doubt all will be revealed in due course... Coleman, who currently chairs Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s remuneration committee, is a former chief executive of House of Fraser and Texas Homecare and previously ran Dorothy Perkins, Top Man and Top Shop. Back to corporate news: almost $5m was fraudulently taken from one of Ryanair\u2019s bank accounts, the budget airline said. Ryanair confirms that it has investigated a fraudulent electronic transfer via a Chinese bank last week. The airline has been working with its banks and the relevant authorities and understands that the funds \u2013 less than $5m \u2013 have now been frozen. The airline expects these funds to be repaid shortly, and has taken steps to ensure that this type of transfer cannot recur. The Irish Times broke the story, reporting that the fraud came to light last Friday and the Criminal Assets Bureau in Dublin was asked to help recover the money with its counterpart agencies in Asia. Ryanair uses dollars to buy fuel for its aircraft and these funds are believed to have been targeted, the newspaper said. The Associated Press has more details of Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s run-in with a group of Greek anarchists last night: Yanis Varoufakis said Wednesday he and his wife were in the Exarhia district, a neighborhood popular with extreme leftists and anarchists, Tuesday night when a group barged into the restaurant. The group, who had their faces covered, demanded the minister leave the area and threw glass objects at the couple, Varoufakis said, without either of them being hurt. He said that when some of the group moved in a threatening manner against him, his wife embraced him so that the potential attackers could not get at him without hitting her first. Maybe Danae Stratou should accompany her husband at the next Eurogroup meeting.... Several retailers have put out numbers this morning. Next has posted better-than-expected sales in its first quarter after the early launch of the fashion chain\u2019s summer brochure, which \u201chelpfully\u201d coincided with much warmer weather this month, it said. Temperatures rose as high as 25C in southern England but have dropped in recent days. Total sales for the 13 weeks to 25 April were 4.1% ahead of last year, because of a longer winter end-of-season sale and a bigger mid-season sale in the Next catalogue. The retailer, run by Tory peer Lord Wolfson, is paying a further special dividend of 60p a share on 3 August. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb says: Given the fashion range problems this spring and worries about slowing Directory [catalogue] sales growth, the City will be pleased to see Directory sales looking strong at +7.0 (+9% including the Sale). With tough comps ahead in Q2, Next haven\u2019t changed their full-year guidance and, apart from confirming another 60p special dividend, the statement says nothing else about the outlook. He adds: Of the other companies reporting today, Greggs is the best-looking statement. Greggs, known for its sausage rolls, has credited the popularity of its breakfast meal deals and healthier sandwich ranges for a 5.9% rise in like-for-like sales in the 16 weeks to 25 April. It will pay shareholders a \u00a320m special dividend (20p a share). Home Retail has seen like-for-like sales growth at Argos and Home for the second year running (Argos is up 0.6% while Homebase is 2.3% ahead). Full-year pretax profits have climbed to \u00a393.8m from \u00a371.2m, with sales up 1% to \u00a35.7bn. The group has rolled out its \u2018hub &amp; spoke\u2019 distribution network at Argos, enabling same-day collection of 20,000 products, and has 60 digital Argos stores up and running. To quote Bubb again: The Home Retail results are in line, but there is no comment on current trading and only a vague comment about hopes for a better economic outlook after the election. The N Brown finals are, as expected, disappointing, but management express confidence in the future. Thorntons\u2019 third quarter to 25 April was mixed: despite a good Easter and Valentine\u2019s Day, retail like-for-like sales were only flat over the last 15 weeks (presumably Mother\u2019s Day went less well). Commercial sales fell 6.1%, with one unnamed supermarket customer having reduced orders. Fashion chain N Brown saw statutory profits before tax fall 21% to \u00a376.3m, with revenues flat at \u00a3818m. Chief executive Angela Spindler said: Step-changing the way the business operates and goes to market in some key areas proved more disruptive than anticipated and this, combined with a weak autumn trading period across the sector, led to a profit performance below expectations. We are, however, improving the sustainability of future profit growth and look to the year ahead with confidence. European commission Pierre Moscovici has apparently welcomed the shake-up of Greece\u2019s bailout team. And in case you missed it, here\u2019s our profile of new head negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos: The oddest story of the morning is that Mike Coupe, CEO of supermarket group J Sainsbury, has been sentenced to two years in an Egyptian jail. A Giza court convicted Coupe of embezzlement after he allegedly tried to seize cheques from an Egyptian businessman, Amr El Nasharty, whom Sainsbury\u2019s worked with back in 1999. The Times broke the story overnight, saying: Mike Coupe was forced to attend a court hearing in Giza last Sunday in an attempt to overturn a conviction for embezzlement. The case relates to claims that last July Mr Coupe tried to seize cheques connected with the collapse of a business it invested in 16 years ago, in contravention of Egyptian bankruptcy law. Remarkable stuff. And Sainsbury has responded this morning, saying it \u201cstrongly refutes\u201d the allegations, saying the cheques bounced and Coupe wasn\u2019t anywhere Egypt on the day in question: They told the City: When Mr El Nasharty bought our interest in the Egyptian joint venture we had with him in 2001, he paid us with cheques that were dishonoured. Mr El Nasharty is now claiming that Mike was in Egypt on 15th July 2014 and seized these cheques, which is an impossibility. Mike Coupe was in London carrying out his normal duties that day. In September 2014 Mike Coupe was convicted, without notice of the proceedings against him and in his absence, in an Egyptian Court. We have taken all necessary steps to appeal against these groundless claims and will continue to do so. Reports of the demise of the British housing boom may have been overstated. According to the Nationwide building society, prices rose by 1% month-on-month in April, and the annual growth rate edged up to 5.2% in April from 5.1% in March. That\u2019s the biggest monthly increase since last June. But the market isn\u2019t too rosy, with mortgage approvals around 20% lower than their long-term average: Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, says: \u201cThe strength of the economy and relatively subdued pace of activity in the housing market remains something of an anomaly. It is possible that heightened uncertainty ahead of the election is weighing on activity, though there is no compelling evidence from previous UK elections to suggest a strong impact. And that annual price rise is more moderate than last summer: Will it never end? Barclays has announced it is setting aside a total of \u00a3950m to cover the cost of the forex-rigging scandal, and the misselling of payment protection insurance. CEO Antony Jenkins says he\u2019s still cleaning up the mistakes of the past: Resolving legacy conduct issues is also an important part of our plan to transform Barclays. We are working hard to expedite their settlement and have taken further provisions of \u00a3800m this quarter, primarily relating to Foreign Exchange. Statutory pre-tax profits at Barclays fell by 26%, to \u00a31,337m . As if being kicked around by the eurogroup last week wasn\u2019t bad enough, Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis apparently ran into trouble with a group of anarchists last night. The Greek finance minister was out with his wife, installation artist Danae Stratou, when a large group of youths wanted a word. Varoufakis, though, deployed his strongest weapon...and talked his way out of trouble. Greek Reporter has the details: The Greek Finance Minister was initially insulted by the group for his political actions and then they both left the restaurant to continue arguing outside of the premises. There were no reports of violence, but first witnesses reported that the talk was definitely not in a friendly tone. Finally Varoufakis managed to calm the group down and left the area. The Greek government is working on a new bill outlining some economic reforms including strengthening tax collection, according to the Kathimerini newspaper overnight. The move might possibly persuade creditors to hand over some funds. However that seems unlikely, as it\u2019s not expected to include pension reforms or increases to VAT rates -- two key demands from lenders. Also, the Eurogroup said last Friday that Greece wouldn\u2019t get its aid paid in tranches. It\u2019s all or nothing... Kathimerini explains: The cabinet is expected to meet Thursday to discuss the details of a reform multi-bill the government is preparing in the hope that it will accelerate the conclusion of negotiations with lenders and the disbursement of further bailout funding. The government would like to bring the multi-bill to Parliament as soon as possible because it believes this could help secure at least the \u20ac1.9bn euros in profits from the European Central Bank\u2019s SMP scheme. However, this will depend on the outcome of the Brussels Group talks, which are due to begin on Wednesday and run through Saturday at the earliest. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up... after yesterday\u2019s surprise drop in UK growth, it\u2019s America\u2019s turn to report GDP data. And economists predict that US growth also slowed, from an annualised rate of 2.2% to just 1% (or a measly 0.25% in pure quarter-on-quarter terms). A weak reading could give investors a dose of the jitters, as CMC Market\u2019s Michael Hewson explains: A lower number would raise bigger concerns that it could get revised even lower. This is because US GDP does have a habit of getting revised lower, and any further weakness could well raise additional concerns about how well the US economy is actually doing. US GDP is released at 1.30pm BST, or 8.30am East Coast time. It sets the scene for the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest monthly meeting, tonight. Over in Greece, officials will be racing to agree reforms that might satisfy its creditors in time, and scrabbling for funds to meet wage and pensions due at the end of the month. German inflation data is released at 1pm BST, showing if the European Central Bank\u2019s QE programme is dragging the region away from deflation. There\u2019s also a new survey of eurozone economic confidence at 10am BST. A swathe of UK companies are reporting financial results this morning, including Barclays, Next and Home Retail. And Nationwide should be releasing its latest house price data this morning too. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

The weakness in the US economy, if sustained, poses problems for global growth but also means an imminent increase in US borrowing costs is very unlikely. That has hit the dollar, and by extension pushed the euro higher which has undermined European markets. The export heavy Dax has been hit particularly hard, while the FTSE 100 has closed below 7000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. There were also the usual uncertainties surrounding the continuing attempts to avoid Greece defaulting and the forthcoming UK election. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 1.2% or 84.25 points to 6946.28</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax was down 3.21% at 11,432.72</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed2.59% lower at 5039.39</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 2.28% to 22,995.63</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.97% at 11,378.9</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 135 points or 0.75% lower.</p> <p><em>So on that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening.

Looking forward to the second quarter... we might well expect a positive bounce from the combination of net exports and inventories, perhaps adding half a percent back. Some stronger business investment and consumer spending will also help. So rather than a figure close to zero, we might reasonably look for something quite a bit stronger than 3% in the second quarter.  In a couple of hours, the Federal Reserve will meet to discuss the timing of the first rate hike. No doubt they will discuss this release. But for most of them, the more important question will be, what is future growth going to be like? Though it takes a leap of faith to say that the second quarter will see the bounce we are anticipating, this latest GDP figure provides no reason for undue pessimism.

Temperatures rose as high as 25C in southern England but have dropped in recent days. Total sales for the 13 weeks to 25 April were 4.1% ahead of last year, because of a longer winter end-of-season sale and a bigger mid-season sale in the Next catalogue. The retailer, run by Tory peer Lord Wolfson, is paying a further special dividend of 60p a share on 3 August.</p> <p>Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the fashion range problems this spring and worries about slowing Directory [catalogue] sales growth, the City will be pleased to see Directory sales looking strong at +7.0 (+9% including the Sale). With tough comps ahead in Q2, Next haven\u2019t changed their full-year guidance and, apart from confirming another 60p special dividend, the statement says nothing else about the outlook.</p> </blockquote> <p>He adds:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of the other companies reporting today, Greggs is the best-looking statement.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Greggs</strong>, known for its sausage rolls, has credited the popularity of its breakfast meal deals and healthier sandwich ranges for a 5.9% rise in like-for-like sales in the 16 weeks to 25 April. It will pay shareholders a \u00a320m special dividend (20p a share).</p> <p><strong>Home Retail</strong> has seen like-for-like sales growth at Argos and Home for the second year running (Argos is up 0.6% while Homebase is 2.3% ahead). Full-year pretax profits have climbed to \u00a393.8m from \u00a371.2m, with sales up 1% to \u00a35.7bn. The group has rolled out its \u2018hub &amp; spoke\u2019 distribution network at Argos, enabling same-day collection of 20,000 products, and has 60 digital Argos stores up and running. </p> <p>To quote Bubb again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Home Retail results are in line, but there is no comment on current trading and only a vague comment about hopes for a better economic outlook after the election. The N Brown finals are, as expected, disappointing, but management express confidence in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thorntons</strong>\u2019 third quarter to 25 April was mixed: despite a good Easter and Valentine\u2019s Day, retail like-for-like sales were only flat over the last 15 weeks (presumably Mother\u2019s Day went less well). Commercial sales fell 6.1%, with one unnamed supermarket customer having reduced orders.</p> <p>Fashion chain <strong>N Brown</strong> saw statutory profits before tax fall 21% to \u00a376.3m, with revenues flat at \u00a3818m. Chief executive Angela Spindler said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Step-changing the way the business operates and goes to market in some key areas proved more disruptive than anticipated and this, combined with a weak autumn trading period across the sector, led to a profit performance below expectations. We are, however, improving the sustainability of future profit growth and look to the year ahead with confidence.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55407f70e4b0b2b9b6f4e04f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-29T07:04:20.994Z\">8.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Moscovici hails Greek reshuffle</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European commission Pierre Moscovici has apparently welcomed the shake-up of Greece\u2019s bailout team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/statuses/593306072473063424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>* EU&#39;s Moscovici says reshuffle of Greek negotiating team is a &quot;good sign&quot; - RTRS</p>&mdash; Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/593306072473063424\">April 29, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/593305455595761664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Moscovici says departure of Varoufakis a good signal, pace of talks still not fast enough; Greek negotiating team more coherent ~<a href=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk\">@livesquawk</a></p>&mdash; Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/593305455595761664\">April 29, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And in case you missed it, here\u2019s our profile of new head negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/28/euclid-tsakalotos-greece-debt-bailout-varoufakis\">Euclid Tsakalotos: from Oxford to Greece's lead bailout negotiator</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55407c80e4b03fd319c95983\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-29T06:50:30.707Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sainsbury's hits back over CEO's Egypt jail term</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b35c50151f77178f57ef15241e57f896175ec159\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430290203941/6f3872a0-468f-4f09-a6b1-984a7512d186-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Coupe.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GRAHAM FLACK      07747 015131/Sainsbury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The oddest story of the morning is that Mike Coupe, CEO of supermarket group J Sainsbury, has been sentenced to two years in an Egyptian jail.</strong></p> <p>A Giza court convicted Coupe of embezzlement after he allegedly tried to seize cheques from an Egyptian businessman, Amr El Nasharty, whom Sainsbury\u2019s worked with back in 1999.</p> <p><strong>The Times broke the story overnight, saying:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mike Coupe was forced to attend a court hearing in Giza last Sunday in an attempt to overturn a conviction for embezzlement.</p> <p>The case relates to claims that last July Mr Coupe tried to seize cheques connected with the collapse of a business it invested in 16 years ago, in contravention of Egyptian bankruptcy law.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Remarkable stuff. </strong>And Sainsbury has responded this morning, saying it \u201cstrongly refutes\u201d the allegations, saying the cheques bounced and Coupe wasn\u2019t anywhere Egypt on the day in question:<br></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/sainsbury-j--plc--sbry-/rns/clarification-on-egyptian-legal-case/201504290716256483L/\">They told the City:</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Mr El Nasharty bought our interest in the Egyptian joint venture we had with him in 2001, he paid us with cheques that were dishonoured.

      "bodyText": "Fears of an early rise in US interest rates dwindled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve responded to news that growth had come to a virtual standstill by saying it would need to see a stronger economic performance before sanctioning an increase in borrowing costs. Announcing its decision to leave interest rates on hold just hours after official data showed the world\u2019s largest economy barely grew in the first three months of the year, the US central bank said only some of the weakness was due to one-off factors. The Fed made it clear to Wall Street in a statement that it was in no hurry to act. The announcement left the financial markets convinced that it would be September at the earliest before the key US interest rate was raised from its current range of 0-0.25%. Winter weather was in part to blame for the US\u2019s sluggish performance in the first quarter of 2015, when the annualised growth rate slid to just 0.2%. But the Fed stressed in its statement that the slowdown was only partly due to \u201ctransitory\u201d factors. In its health check on the economy since its last meeting in March, the Fed said: \u201cThe pace of job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate remained steady. A range of labour market indicators suggests that underutilisation of labour resources was little changed. \u201cGrowth in household spending declined; households\u2019 real incomes rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices, and consumer sentiment remains high. Business fixed investment softened, the recovery in the housing sector remained slow, and exports declined.\u201d Interest rates have been pegged at barely more than zero in the US for almost six-and-a-half years, but the Fed\u2019s open market committee said it would only \u201cbe appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labour market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term\u201d. Financial markets had been braced for a slowdown in activity after brutal winter weather but not of the scale reported by the Commerce Department in Washington. After the economy grew at an annual pace of 2.2% in the final three months of 2014, economists had been forecasting a slowdown to 1% in the subsequent quarter \u2013 a period in which blizzards and a strike affecting west coast ports stifled activity. The official data showed that the drop in crude prices had affected investment in the US oil and gas sector but that cheaper energy bills had yet to boost consumer spending. Growth in consumer spending slowed to an annual increase of 1.9% in the first quarter, down from 4.4% in late 2014 and the weakest for a year. Construction output was badly hit by the poor weather, leading some analysts to predict that the US would bounce back quickly in the second and third quarters of 2015, as it did in 2014. But recent data for retail sales, housebuilding and business investment has not been strong, suggesting the rebound will be less vigorous this time. Earlier this year, Wall Street had been anticipating that the Fed would start raising interest rates in June, but concerns about the sluggishness of growth mean that the expected date for a move by the central bank has been pushed back to September. \u201cA stalling of US economic growth at the start of the year rules out any imminent hiking of interest rates by the Fed,\u201d said Chris Williamson of financial data provider Markit. Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cMost Fed officials appear to share our view that this is a temporary slowdown, albeit a more severe deceleration than we previously anticipated. Accordingly, while it might delay the timing of the first rate hike, we still anticipate a lift-off later this year.\u201d Speculation that the Fed would delay a rate rise pushed the dollar lower against the euro, with knock-on effects on share prices in Europe. The German Dax index closed 378 points lower at 11,432.72, a drop of more than 3.2% in the expectation that a stronger euro would make German exports dearer. The main share index in France was down by 2.6%. The Fed has provided unprecedented amounts of stimulus to the US economy since it plunged into recession in 2008 \u2013 keeping interest rates unchanged at barely above zero and creating trillions of dollars of new electronic money through the process known as quantitative easing. Even so, the recovery has been the weakest in the country\u2019s recent history.",

    "webTitle": "The demise of the Boeing 747 is a sign of changing flight patterns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dreamed up in another age, the 747 was in the skies before Concorde, before man reached the moon, and when the president of the United States was a child. Boeing\u2019s most famous plane has been up there ever since, redefining the language of aviation as the original jumbo jet, carrying twice as many passengers as most other aircraft. Hundreds criss-cross the globe every day, and new 747s still slowly gestate on the production line. But it is now almost 18 months since the last order from a passenger airline, and the long flight of the 747 appears to be firmly in its descent. Boeing insists it has a future: even the president still wants it, for a revamped Air Force One. But, White House aside, its demise has been long-signalled after more than 1,500 orders since it first entered service in 1970. Total aircraft orders have only broken into double figures once in the eight years, through a single Korean Airlines purchase, since rival Airbus delivered its first A380. The European manufacturer\u2019s bigger, more efficient plane promised to out-jumbo the jumbo, extending the distinctive bump of the 747\u2019s prow along the fuselage into a full double-decker. Yet the A380\u2019s own mixed fortunes \u2013 317 have been ordered since it launched but interest is dwindling \u2013 suggest plus-sized planes are out of fashion. Only Emirates, the deep-pocketed Gulf carrier whose Dubai base has been remodelled around its superjumbo-shaped business plan, has kept the A380 sales figures respectable. In its slightly sniffy annual forecasts, Boeing claims the widebody, or twin-aisle, sector of the aircraft market will be of dwindling importance, with the A380 unlikely to succeed. Whether both jumbos will be taken down by similar forces is a moot point: Tim Clark, the chief executive of Emirates, says the A380 chiefly suffered by being launched during the financial crisis, when few would risk such a new investment. On that Boeing might privately agree: the 747\u2019s early years, after it entered commercial service in 1970, were dogged by a weak global economy. And Boeing itself expects demand for its largest planes to pick up with the global economy. But only its freight version, a windowless 747 with a hinged nose to allow oversized cargo on board, is selling right now \u2013 though only two were sold in 2014. In 2015, only the Azerbaijan cargo carrier Silk Way has bitten. Production of 747s has slowed to 1.5 a month; with just 35 more planes on the order books, which equates to two more years\u2019 manufacturing. British Airways was once the world\u2019s biggest operator of 747-400s, the longer-range variant developed in the 1980s, but has started retiring its fleet in favour of more fuel-efficient planes: A380s now, the upcoming A350, and Boeing\u2019s smaller 787 Dreamliner. BA insists that the 747\u2019s day is far from done. The plane remains \u201cthe much-loved workhorse and backbone of our long-haul fleet\u201d, according to a spokesperson, with 42 747s in operation. They will be flying for BA until at least 2020. Some have been sold in their entirety, others for parts; BA also retains some 747s as part donors for the active, ageing fleet. What will kill the 747? Specifically, progress in engine manufacture: the 747\u2019s four engines look increasingly redundant and expensive as reliable, efficient iterations allow longer routes and more passengers to be flown on two. Boeing\u2019s upcoming twin-engine 777X will carry 400 seats. The high fuel costs and narrow profit margins that characterised much of the previous ten years made an underoccupied jumbo economically unviable, and airlines have taken to scheduling multiple slots on popular routes to meet consumer demand, rather than one big take-off. Another factor hastening the 747\u2019s departure, at least from British skies, is noise. In one office at Heathrow, reports of the death of the 747 are welcome. John Holland-Kaye, the airport\u2019s chief executive, says: \u201cIt\u2019ll be great to have those replaced. It fits in with our plans for making Heathrow cleaner and quieter. I\u2019m sure there will be a few people that will be a misty-eyed about it leaving service, in the same way as Concorde: they are one plane that you can always recognise.\u201d But, Holland-Kaye says, the difference in noise between the 747 and a new plane such as the A350, which comes into service this year, is stark: \u201cIt\u2019s far quieter \u2013 less of a screeching noise and that\u2019s really welcome for local communities. They have a sense for how much better life will be when the 747s have gone.\u201d Heathrow expects that to occur within a decade; meanwhile it is raising charges on 747s for its NOx pollutants as well as noise. Landing a 747-400 will next year cost around \u00a33,650 in environmental tariffs compared with just over \u00a31,000 for a 787. Others will though mourn its passing. Mark Vanhoenacker, a BA first officer and author of Skyfaring: A Journey with a Pilot, has flown the 747 for eight years. \u201cAs a kid it was the airplane I looked up to \u2013 literally and in every sense. The phrase you hear about the 747 from pilots is that it just looks right. If you talked about the hump in the front it wouldn\u2019t necessarily sound appealing but it works well. Joseph Sutter, the lead designer, was obsessed with birds, and I guess it looks like the head of a bird.\u201d He says it is an extraordinary plane to fly, \u201cboth for the sense of stateliness and the manoeuvrability, like an expensive German car. If you\u2019re talking about engineering, those are two qualities that are quite opposing and hard to combine. When you\u2019re flying it and turning, it feels like a very small plane, but you don\u2019t feel turbulence in the same way.\u201d Pilots also enjoy its creature comforts: at BA the 747s are known as the ensuite fleet. \u201cOur little bedroom is within the cockpit: you can stick your pyjamas on and clean your teeth without anyone seeing you. And coming out the bunk when you wake up, it\u2019s a different light and you\u2019re in a plane cockpit in the sky,\u201d he says. A number of those pilots will leave the skies when the 747 does. \u201cSome captains probably think that to retire from the 747 is as good as it gets; I can understand that.\u201d In fact, the fading dominance of the 747 has already impacted on Vanhoenacker and his colleagues, with pilots only normally flying one model and three long-haul alternatives now in play. \u201cOne of the sad things is that if you wanted to see the world, the 747 was the plane: being a trained 747 pilot you\u2019d be connecting to all the major cities. Our individual worlds will always be smaller, because the planet has been divided into four different plane types.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Dreamed up in another age, the 747 was in the skies before Concorde, before man reached the moon, and when the president of the United States was a child. Boeing\u2019s most famous plane has been up there ever since, redefining the language of aviation as the original jumbo jet, carrying twice as many passengers as most other aircraft. Hundreds criss-cross the globe every day, and new 747s still slowly gestate on the production line. But it is now almost 18 months since the last order from a passenger airline, and the long flight of the 747 appears to be firmly in its descent. </p> <p>Boeing insists it has a future: even the president <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/new-boeing-model-replace-air-force-one\">still wants it</a>, for a revamped Air Force One. But, White House aside, its demise has been long-signalled after more than 1,500 orders since it first entered service in 1970. </p> <p>Total aircraft orders have only broken into double figures once in the eight years, through a single Korean Airlines purchase, since rival Airbus delivered its <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7061164.stm\">first A380</a>. The European manufacturer\u2019s bigger, more efficient plane promised to out-jumbo the jumbo, extending the distinctive bump of the 747\u2019s prow along the fuselage into a full double-decker.</p> <p>Yet the A380\u2019s own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/28/airbus-a380-future-in-doubt\">mixed fortunes</a> \u2013 317 have been ordered since it launched but interest is dwindling \u2013 suggest plus-sized planes are out of fashion. Only Emirates, the deep-pocketed Gulf carrier whose Dubai base has been remodelled around its superjumbo-shaped business plan, has kept the A380 sales figures respectable. In its slightly sniffy annual forecasts, Boeing claims the widebody, or twin-aisle, sector of the aircraft market will be of dwindling importance, with the A380 unlikely to succeed. </p> <p>Whether both jumbos will be taken down by similar forces is a moot point: Tim Clark, the chief executive of Emirates, says the A380 chiefly suffered by being launched during the financial crisis, when few would risk such a new investment. On that Boeing might privately agree: the 747\u2019s early years, after it entered commercial service in 1970, were dogged by a weak global economy. And Boeing itself expects demand for its largest planes to pick up with the global economy. </p> <p>But only its freight version, a windowless 747 with a hinged nose to allow oversized cargo on board, is selling right now \u2013 though only two were sold in 2014. In 2015, only the Azerbaijan cargo carrier Silk Way has bitten. Production of 747s has slowed to 1.5 a month; with just 35 more planes on the order books, which equates to two more years\u2019 manufacturing. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a4970e7b114ecd2d5e3cbe213470a04a30869d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/29/1430329325656/09c772c4-3751-413d-9974-be9774f9accb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A BOAC Boeing 747 takes off from Heathrow airport in 1971.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A BOAC Boeing 747 takes off from Heathrow airport in 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox Photos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>British Airways was once the world\u2019s biggest operator of 747-400s, the longer-range variant developed in the 1980s, but has started retiring its fleet in favour of more fuel-efficient planes: A380s now, the upcoming A350, and Boeing\u2019s smaller 787 Dreamliner. </p> <p>BA insists that the 747\u2019s day is far from done.

      "bodyText": "A bankrupt former multimillionaire has dropped the keys of his luxury South Dublin home on to the desk of the Bank of Ireland\u2019s chief executive in a final symbolic protest against the repossession of his seaview mansion. Just before the noon deadline to vacate his family\u2019s property on a road populated by Irish rock stars including U2\u2019s Bono, Brian O\u2019Donnell interrupted the bank\u2019s annual general meeting at University College Dublin and handed back the keys. They were on a printed background stating: \u201cThe Bloody Keys\u201d. On Tuesday the Irish supreme court announced it would not grant an 11th-hour order preventing the Bank of Ireland from seizing the Gorse Hill property, a sprawling residence with a swimming pool, sauna and tennis court in the fashionable Killiney area. The court also noted that there was no basis in law for an appeal to the European court of justice. The O\u2019Donnells owed the Bank of Ireland \u20ac71.5m (\u00a351.2m) after the family borrowed heavily during the Celtic Tiger boom years to play the global property market, buying office properties in London, two Canary Wharf skyscrapers, and Washington DC. But the global financial crash left their empire in ruins and the bank demanded the property back as it clawed back the family\u2019s debts. In their bizarre battle with the bank, the O\u2019Donnells enlisted the unlikely support of a radical anti-repossession group in an attempt to hang on to their home, which was once valued during the boom at \u20ac30m. In a near two-month standoff with the Bank of Ireland, the New Land League, a group that models itself on an anti-landlord grassroots movement from 19th century, patrolled the mansion and prevented bailiffs from entering the property. Before the AGM at O\u2019Reilly hall (named after the former newspaper tycoon Sir Tony O\u2019Reilly), O\u2019Donnell told the media: \u201cWe vacated the property this morning and we are extremely disappointed in relation to the decision by the supreme court.\u201d At the AGM, the bank\u2019s governor, Archie Kane, referred to its approach to supporting mortgage customers in financial difficulty, insisting that \u201cwe strive to help them\u201d. On hearing this, O\u2019Donnell shook his head while Kane continued: \u201cIt is critical to us that we adopt a consistent approach when dealing with any customers who may be in difficulty.\u201d The O\u2019Donnell family had started packing up from Gorse Hill on Tuesday night and were seen carrying bags from the property on Wednesday morning. Their departure marks the end of a long legal battle over their debts and the Bank of Ireland. New Land League members remained at the property until the O\u2019Donnells left but confirmed that their protest there was over. The original Land League was the created by Michael Davitt, a former member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood jailed in 1870 following a failed uprising against British rule. After a second famine in Ireland in 1879, poor tenant farmers could not meet rent demands from landlords and faced the prospect of eviction. Davitt helped found the Land League, which organised physical resistance against evictions. Some commentators in Ireland have questioned whether Davitt and the original founders of the Land League movement would support a global property dealer such as O\u2019Donnell.",
