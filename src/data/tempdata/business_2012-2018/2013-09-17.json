Women have been paid 77\u00a2 for every dollar paid to men since 2002, with two minor exceptions: in 2003, women were paid 76\u00a2 for every dollar paid to men, and in 2007, women were paid 78\u00a2 for every dollar. Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, said: \"The persistence of the gender-based wage gap is a blot on our nation's commitment to civil rights and equal opportunity. These new data should give Congress and the administration even more reason to make addressing it a priority. In doing so, both have the opportunity to set an example for employers, and to demonstrate a true commitment to improving the well-being of America's families.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to stop. Here's a reminder of the main events \u2022 The slump in Europe's car market continues, with sales falling again in August. Declining demand in key markets such as Germany and France mean 2013 has been the worst year since records began in 1990. \u2022 EC president Jose Manuel Barroso has declared that Greece can see better times ahead. Speaking in Brussels alongside Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, Barroso claimed that the country's recession was nearly over. But there was also no let-up in the pressure for reforms. \u2022 As the talks took place, there were fresh protests in Athens. Social service workers and municipal police officers held demonstrations, while doctors began a three-day walkout. A larger strike begins tomorrow. \u2022 UK inflation fell. At 2.7%, the consumer prices index showed that prices rose at a slightly slower rate in August. However, new data also showed house prices rising faster, with English prices at a new record high. \u2022 The British government hailed the sale of part of its sale in Lloyds Banking Group as a milestone in escaping the financial crisis. The sale, announced last night, made a profit of \u00a360m \u2022 Italy's former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has delayed the release of a video message outlining his political plans following a conviction for tax fraud. It should be released tomorrow, the same day that a Senate committee is due to decide whether he should be expelled from the upper house of parliament..... \u2022 The US Federal Reserve began its two-day monetary policy meeting. Ben Bernanke could announce that the Fed will start tapering its bond-buying programme tomorrow night. Or he might not..... \u2022 ....and the uncertainty helped to push shares down in Europe. I'll be back tomorrow for more of the same. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for all the comments. GW One more story to flag up... European Commissioner Olli Rehn told Italian politicians some home truths today, warning that political instability and slow progress on fiscal cutbacks threatens to reignite the crisis. The FT has a good write up: By stepping directly into a fiercely political debate in expressing Brussels\u2019 opposition to Rome\u2019s decision to scrap an unpopular property tax, Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, risks fuelling tensions between the main parties in Italy\u2019s fragile coalition government over its budget for 2014. Mr Rehn reminded a news conference on Tuesday that Italy\u2019s borrowing costs on debt markets had overtaken Spain\u2019s this month for the first time in more than a year. \u201cTo my mind this is a warning sign to Italy to ensure political stability and fiscal sustainability,\u201d he commented. European stock markets closed mostly lower, as traders prepared for tomorrow's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve (5.38pm) The only markets to rise were Italy (where Silvio Berlusconi's much-anticipated video message is expected tomorrow), and Greece. Otherwise, it's been quiet. Brenda Kelly of IG sums up the action in London: Lloyds Bank has been the worst casualty, falling 3.3% after the government sold 6% of its stake in the bailed-out bank. Barclays was also under water, with news announcing that it is facing a \u00a350 million fine for breaching market listing rules. The failure to break through yesterday\u2019s highs, despite the UK CPI easing to 2.7% in August as expected, suggests that investors are wary and less inclined to establish new long positions. The profit-taking that we are seeing is an attempt to drain what may be the final dregs of the rally. Since markets are, for the most part, expecting a tapering decision, any delay could be construed as a lack of US Federal Reserve confidence in the US economic recovery and may add some volatility and downside risk for equities. In America, the Federal Reserve has begun its two-day meeting as speculation mounts that chairman Ben Bernanke is preparing to announce cut-backs on the US's $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme. Tapering could be just around the corner, writes our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe: Bernanke will hold a press conference Wednesday to discuss the Fed's plans. The event comes amid speculation that he will announce his resignation: Bernanke has made clear he will not seek a third term as chairman and Barack Obama is now assessing replacements. The Fed's third round of bond buying, known as quantitative easing, was announced last September and has so far pumped about $800bn into the bond markets in an attempt to kick-start investment and keep interest rates down. In June, Bernanke announced some \"tapering\" of policy could begin later this year if the economy continued to improve. The Federal Reserve's open markets committee (FOMC), however, is split on QE with some concerned about the unintended consequences of the massive programme. In previous FOMC meetings some members have made clear they want an early end to the programme. More here: Federal Reserve begins two-day meeting as stimulus taper looms Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the Daily Telegraph has delivered a masterful response to German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, which is well worth a read. Writing in the Financial Times today, Sch\u00e4uble declared that the eurozone economic recovery was well underway, and taunted those who had claimed Europe had lost the plot. The nub of his point is that Europe's policymakers had implemented sensible policies, whose effectiveness was proven in recessions through the ages. Here's a flavour: What is happening turns out to be pretty much what the proponents of Europe\u2019s cool-headed crisis management predicted. The fiscal and structural repair work is paying off, laying the foundations for sustainable growth. This has taken critical observers aback. It should not have, because, in truth, we have seen it all before, many times and in many places. Despite what the critics of the European crisis management would have us believe, we live in the real world, not in a parallel universe where well-established economic principles no longer apply. Further down in the article, Sch\u00e4uble wins more friends by claiming that Europe's public have been protected from the worst of the storm. The European safety nets have provided a well-calibrated mix of incentives and solidarity to cushion the pain. I\"m not completely convinced that those who argued for a change of plan are now lying broken and discredited under the wheels of Europe's revival (tho anyone who insisted the eurozone would break up by now looks a little daft). And over at Telegraph Towers, AEP seems to agree, in a classic column. Again, here's a taste: I apologise for mentioning that unemployment is 27.8% in Greece, 26.3% in Spain, 17.3% in Cyprus, and 16.5% in Portugal, or for pointing that it would be far worse had it not been for a mass exodus of EMU refugees. Nor was is proper to mention that Greek youth unemployment in 62.9%. These are trivial details. I apologise for pointing out that the EU-IMF Troika originally said the Greek economy would contract by 2.6% in 2010 and then recover briskly, when in fact it contracted by roughly 23% from peak-to-trough, and will shrink another 5% this year according to the think-tank IOBE. This slippage is well within the normal margin of error. I apologise for mentioning that the debt trajectories of Spain, Greece, Italy, and Ireland have accelerated upwards under the austerity plans, and therefore that the policy has been self-defeating. It was quite uncalled for to point out that Italy\u2019s debt ratio has jumped to 130% of GDP, or to so suggest that debt cannot keep rising on a contracting nominal GDP bas, and I will wash my mouth with soap if I ever utter the words \u201cdenominator effect\u201d again. It is shabby to use such cheap language. My grovelling apology to Herr Sch\u00e4uble Back in the UK, chancellor George Osborne has been hailing the sale of some of the government's stake in Lloyds. Here's a video clip from earlier today: I'd missed this .... (thanks IfigEusLannuon!) A reminder that my colleagues on GuardianWitness want to hear from people who have splashed out on a new bike this year, following the news that bicycle sales outstripped demand for new cars in Spain in 2012. Just go here to learn more. And here's an example: Talk of 'light at the end of the tunnel' may infuriate Greek citizens struggling to cope with the country's economic plight. Issues such as record unemployment and sliding retail sales are well documented. But government cutbacks are hurting the public in other ways, as Yannis Zabetakis flags up from Athens. He tells me that primary schools are now closing at 13.30pm, rather than 4pm, which is a \"massive problems for working parents\". He blames cutbacks on teachers, reporting that some schools don't even have enough teachers to cover morning classes. The full text of Jose Manuel Barrosa's comments to Antonis Samaras in Brussels earlier are now online, here. It shows that Barroso twice described Samaras as a \"dear friend\", congratulating him on saving Greece from crashing out of the euro. Here's the key section about 'light at the end of the tunnel': On the economy now: I want to say that I very much support Greece's efforts in implementing the financial assistance programme. Prime Minister Samaras has once again assured me of his clear commitment to see it through. The Commission continues to believe that this is essential to secure Greece's future growth and jobs, and it is already giving positive results. I really want to congratulate you, Prime Minister, dear friend, for your leadership and determination. I believe it is key for the success of the programme. I know that the Greek citizens are operating in extremely challenging and difficult circumstances, but I believe now we can say there is light at the end of the tunnel. In fact, we expect a gradual return to growth in 2014 after six years of recession; government bond spreads haven fallen markedly since their peak in June 2012; economic sentiment has improved; the current account deficit has fallen over the last three years and Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio is set to start declining next year and fall below 120% by 2021. All these are encouraging signals when you think of the doubts that were expressed some time ago concerning Greece. Barroso also repeated a theme from last week's State of the Union speech -- next year's European Parliament elections, which will be a battleground between eurosceptics and pro-Europeans. In May, people will head to the polls to vote in the European Parliament elections, and it is very important that we make these elections a moment of European democracy. Critics of Europe's handling of the crisis, though, might remind Barroso that technocratic (unelected) leaders briefly ran both Greece and Italy in the last couple of years -- not exactly democracy's finest hour..... The WSJ's Matina Stevis was also at the Barroso-Samaras press conference in Brussels, and reports the key lines: Jose Manuel Barroso also gave Greece the 'hurry-up' on its state asset sales, saying that its privatisation programme needs to be \"sped up\". The FT's Peter Spiegel reports that prime minister Antonis Samaras nodded at this point. Worth noting that the two men were also all smiles for the cameras before today's press conference: Jose Manuel Barroso and Antonis Samaras are fielding questions on what additional help Greece will need next year when its bailout programme runs out. Barroso tried to duck the question, saying he need to see the verdict of Greece's lenders (who return to Athens next Monday) first. Samaras was merely hopeful that Greece's economy might perform better than some economists fear. The FT's Peter Spiegel has the quotes: Samaras went on to insist that \"The sacrifices of the Greek people are producing tangible results,\" and offered the prospect of the country finally escaping recession during its EU presidency (January-June 2014). Samaras says the answer to Greece's problems is \"more growth\" (no argument there) and \"more Europe\" (which might be more controversial). Now Greek PM Antonis Samaras is speaking in Brussels, declaring that the country's' recession is nearly over. Samaras also said Greece is close to posting a primary surplus (a budget surplus, ignoring debt repayment costs), and even boasts that the threat of leaving the eurozone has receded. Today there is no more talk about the infamous Grexit. Barroso's message didn't cheer Yiannis Mouzakis (who blogs as Prodigal Greek from Cyprus): EC president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has declared that there is light at the end of the tunnel for Greece. Speaking at the press conference with prime minister Antonis Samaras in Brussels, Barroso said that the long sacrifices suffered by the Greek people would be rewarded next year when the country finally returns to growth. Barroso also reached out to the Greek population, saying the Commission continues to \"stand by\" them at this time.... ...before insisting that Greece must continue to swallow its medicine by implementing the measures which have been agreed (and which some public workers are protesting about today). Associated Press's Brussels correspondent, Jurgen Baetz, has the key quotes: Heads-up: Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is about to take part in a press conference in Brussels, with European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso: US inflation data for August has been released, setting the scene for the Federal Reserve's meeting today and tomorrow. As in the UK this morning, there was a drop in the rising cost of living -- to just 1.5% annually, slightly below expectations. On a month-on-month basis, prices were just 0.1% higher. Greek doctors also started a three-day walkout today, as Associated Press explains: Greek hospital doctors have embarked on a three-day strike, joining high school teachers who walked off the job a day earlier in a week of public sector strikes protesting planned job cuts. The doctors walked off the job Tuesday, ahead of a two-day civil service strike that is expected to affect public services across the country, including schools, hospitals and some transport systems. Under government plans, 25,000 public sector employees are to be suspended this year and 15,000 must be fired in the next 15 months as part of efforts to trim the bloated public sector and meet the conditions of Greece's international bailout. The country has been depending on rescue loans from the International Monetary Fund and other European countries that use the euro currency since May 2010. Fresh anti-austerity demonstrations have been taking place in Greece today, involving social security workers and municipal police. Both groups were protesting about plans to cut thousands of public sector jobs, and force others into a 'mobility pool' on lower wages. As these photos show, social security employees demonstrated outside the Labor Ministry in Athens, and held a sit-down protest in the road. It's the second day of a five-day strike. ....and tangled with police offices as they tried to enter the building. However, there are no reports of repeats of yesterday's teargassings (after which three people were treated in hospital). Elsewhere in Athens, the municipal police officers staged a protest march that ended at the Ministry of Administrative Reform: Tomorrow, the civil servant union ADEDY begins a 48-hour strike, which will show the current depth of feeling over Greece's austerity programme. There's also plenty of speculation about what Berlusconi's video message might contain, as Open Europe analyst Vincenzo Scarpetta explains: The content of the video message remains a mystery. The latest reports in the Italian media suggest that Berlusconi may use it to attack judges, while reiterating his support for Enrico Letta\u2019s government. But the truth is no-one really knows. Reuters also reckons Berlusconi's video message is delayed until tomorrow -- perhaps to give him a clear run at the spotlight? Sources in Berlusconi's current People of Freedom (PDL) party, which replaced Forza Italia in 2008, said the pre-recorded message would now be transmitted on Wednesday. They gave no clear reason although there was speculation the master communicator did not want to fight for air time with the successful operation to raise the wrecked Costa Concordia liner from rocks off the Tuscan coast on Tuesday. Just hearing from Italy that Silvio Berlusconi's eagerly awaited video message (see 12.19pm) won't be released until Wednesday. talian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reckons it's been postponed so he can make some last-minute tweaks to the message. If it's really held back till tomorrow, it will hit the TV screens as the Italian Senate\u2019s Immunities Committee holds its first vote on whether to expel him from the Senate. Oh, the suspense.... It seems that more bicycles were sold than cars in Spain last year \u2013 just one sign of Europe's wider economic malaise. Wherever you live in Europe, if you've bought a new bicycle in the last year \u2013 or you've given up your car in favour of cycling or walking \u2013 we'd like to hear from you. To take part, please show us a picture of your bike via GuardianWitness and tell us why you bought it and how your life has changed as a result. We'll feature some of your stories on the Guardian business live blog. Tension is growing in Italy ahead of the release of a video message from Silvio Berlusconi. The disgraced former prime minister, facing possible imminent expulsion from the Senate, has recorded two addresses, and is expected to release the first one today. No sign of it yet, though. A Senate committee will decide tomorrow whether to boot Berlusconi out of the Senate over his tax fraud conviction. Berlusconi could retaliate by withdrawing his support its coalition. However.... there's speculation that the video message could actually be a show of support for prime minister Enrico Letta. Renato Brunetta, floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies for Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party (PDL) tweeted this morning that Berlusconi \"Will make a very important announcement about Forza Italia (Go Italy), aiming to inspire everybody.\" Forza Italia is Berlusconi's original political vehicle, which was superceded by the PDL. This cartoon questions whether Berlusconi could possibly rise again: The big question, though, is how Berlusconi reacts if he is expelled from the Senate (which would require a vote on the floor of the Senate) As Reuters puts it: Some sources said on Tuesday that Berlusconi was considering resigning before a full Senate vote to expel him, but this could come in a second video message after the committee vote on Wednesday night. Berlusconi appears to be using the resurrection of his original Forza Italia party to try to seize back the political initiative following the damaging conviction, which has condemned him either to a year's house arrest or community service. Citigroup has stuck its neck out this morning, predicting that the FTSE 100 will hit 8,000 points by the end of next year. That would be a rise of over 20% (even putting London's house price inflation in the shade), from today's 6598 points. My colleague Nick Fletcher reports that Citi expects the FTSE will hit 7,500 by next summer -- meaning it would finally break through the 7,000 points barrier for the first time. Here's Citi's reasoning, based in part on a recovery in Europe: We stay bullish on UK and European equities over the coming 12-18 months: 1) better macro, 2) better earnings, 3) rising risk appetite. There may be better near-term entry points, but we see healthy 25% returns to the end of 2014. In Europe, we expect a GDP and earnings inflection in 2014 versus 2013. Negative GDP and earnings growth to be replaced by positive growth, in our view. More here: Citigroup forecasts FTSE 100 could reach 8000 by the end of 2014 In other economic news, rising exports have helped to widen the euro zone's trade surplus. Eurostat reported that the eurozone ran a surplus of \u20ac18.2bn in July, up from \u20ac13.9bn a year ago. Exports were 3% higher year-on-year, while imports were flat. And there's no prizes for guessing which country ran the latest trade surplus in the first half of the year. Concerning the total trade of Member States, the largest surplus was observed in Germany (+\u20ac98.0bn in January-June 2013), followed by the Netherlands (+\u20ac28.0bn), Ireland (+\u20ac18.6bn) and Italy (+\u20ac12.3bn). France (-\u20ac38.0bn) registered the largest deficit, followed by the United Kingdom (-\u20ac31.7bn) and Greece (-\u20ac9.7bn). The data's online here Interestingly,the eurozone ran a broadly flat trade balance until the crisis began (although there were large differences between member states). Once it plunged into recession, imports began to slide as the painful austerity-driven \"rebalancing\" began. Here's Katie Allen's news story on today's UK inflation data: UK inflation dips as rise in cost of fuel and clothing eases Some early reaction to today's UK inflation data: Jens Larsen, economist at RBC: Absent a shock in petrol or utility prices, inflation may come down quicker than the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) thinks. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce: The fall in inflation will ease pressure on businesses and consumers at a time when earnings growth is only around 1%, and the government is still pressing ahead with cutting the budget deficit. Our forecast remains that inflation will fall gradually over the next year, but unexpected surges in energy and food prices remain a risk. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First: We are getting growth in the UK, but without huge improvements in unemployment and it seems without too many price pressures either.... The slack in the UK economy following years of weak performance will take time to improve and with that comes fairly benign price activity. Recent strength in sterling markets has also helped offset increase in oil prices that occurred during the escalation of tensions around the Syrian conflict. Unfortunately, while this will be good news for Mark Carney and the team at Threadneedle Street given the inflationary caveats to their forward guidance plan, to the man on the street, who are seeing wage increases at only 1%, this still means that life and spending decisions remain tough, and in reality, talk of a recovery remains merely talk.\u2026 Back on UK inflation, Labour\u2019s Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson has chastised the government for allowing wages to lag behind the cost of living. Here's her response: With prices still rising much faster than wages the cost of living crisis under David Cameron continues. After three damaging years of flatlining, working people are worse off by almost \u00a31,500 a year under this Tory-led government. But rather than helping ordinary families David Cameron is so out of touch he has given a huge tax cut to millionaires instead. We need action now to help people struggling with the rising cost of living. That's why Labour is calling for a lower 10p starting rate of tax to help millions on middle and low incomes and action to tackle soaring energy bills - not a tax cut for millionaires. Meanwhile in Germany, the ZEW index of investor confidence has risen this month, and by more than expected, driven by an improved eurozone outlook It has jumped to 49.6, up from 42 in August, in a sign that German analyst and investors are more upbeat about prospects. It's the highest reading since April 2010 (according to Reuters) Clemens Fuest, president of the ZEW thinktank, explained: The financial market experts hold the view that the German economy is still gaining momentum. In particular, the experts\u2019 economic optimism has increased due to the improved economic outlook for the euro zone. You can read the ONS's data yourself, here: \u2022 Consumer Price Index Inflation for August \u2022 House price index for July London house prices are up 9.7% over the last 12 months.... Crucially, the rising cost of living continues to outstrip wages. Whether you take CPI (2.7%) or RPI (3.3%), inflation continues to devour the meagre salary increases doled out to Britain's workers. Wages are up by just 1% annually. Melanie Bowler, economist at Moody's Analytics, warns that wages are unlikely to catch up: Fiscal austerity, job security concerns ensuring wage demands remain restrained, and weak wage growth\u2014public sector wages are frozen\u2014are helping to anchor inflation expectations. The Treasury broke off from counting the takings from the Lloyds share sale to welcome today's inflation data. Here's the official response: Inflation has fallen, and is nearly half of its peak of 5.2 per cent. The economy is turning a corner, but the recovery is in its early stages and risks remain. The only way to deliver a sustained improvement in living standards is to tackle the economy\u2019s problems head on and deliver a recovery that works for all. The Government knows that times are tough and that is why we have taken action to help with the cost of living including increasing the tax-free personal allowance, introducing tax-free childcare and freezing fuel duty and council tax. While the CPI measure of inflation fell to 2.7% last month, the Retail Prices Index (a wider measure of the cost of living) rose to 3.3%, from 3.1%. The Bank of England's job is to keep CPI close to 2% (a task which it traditionally struggles), and today's drop makes an interest rate rise less likely. But a rising RPI suggests less relief for the public. Economist Shaun Richards isn't impressed to see the RPI rising: UK house prices are still just below the peak of January 2008, according to the ONS's new data (see graph above). However, the England House Price Index is now 0.9% higher than at the previous peak in January 2008. That's not going to puncture fears of a house price bubble.... However.... the ONS is also reporting that UK house price inflation rose in July. However, while English house prices are romping ahead to a new record high, they fell back in Scotland. Again, here's the key points: In the 12 months to July 2013 UK house prices increased by 3.3%, up from a 3.1% increase in the 12 months to June 2013. House price growth remains stable across most of the UK, although prices in London are increasing faster than the UK average. The year-on-year increase reflected growth of 3.7% in England and 1.8% in Northern Ireland, offset by falls of 2.0% in Scotland and 0.7% in Wales. Here's the key points of today's UK inflation data, from the Office for National Statistics: The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) grew by 2.7% in the year to August 2013, down from 2.8% in July. The largest contributions to the fall in the rate came from the transport (particularly motor fuels and air transport) and clothing sectors. These were partially offset by an upward contribution from furniture, household equipment &amp; maintenance. The other main inflation measures were unchanged between July and August: CPIH grew by 2.5% and RPIJ grew by 2.6%. These latest numbers continue the trend of broadly steady inflation seen since spring 2012. Breaking news: UK inflation fell last month. The Consumer Prices index was 2.7% in August, down from July's 2.8%. Details and reaction to follow.... Shares in European carmakers have fallen this morning, as investors balk at the news that sales during 2013 have been the lowest on record (see opening post for the details). Peuguet Citreon is the biggest casualty, with its shares skidding by 3.5% this morning. It had a particularly grisly August, with sales dropping by -17.3% in August 2013 versus 2012. Renault shares have fallen 1.6% this morning (its sales are down 2% in 2013) Fiat shares have dropped 0.9% (its sales are down 8.6% this year). The UK government made a profit of \u00a360m through the sale of \u00a33bn worth of Lloyds shares last night (see 8.07am), my colleague Jill Treanor reports: In a significant turnaround for the bailed out bank \u2013 and five years to the day since Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS to create the enlarged group \u2013 the government body tasked with selling the shares said it had reduced the taxpayer stake to 32.7% from 38.7%. Chancellor George Osborne has declared that the sale will help repair the economy - and even took his message to Twitter: Osborne later added: If you look at what has happened over the last 12 hours with Lloyds, you have investors from around the world investing in a British bank. That is a sign the British economy is turning a corner.\" \"Five years ago the previous government forced British taxpayers to put a huge sum of money into bailing out the banks. That was a big ask of the British public. I have been determined ever since I became Chancellor to get that money back for taxpayers. European stock markets are all down this morning, as yesterday's rally runs out of steam. Spain and Italy have the biggest losses, with the IBEX and FTSE MIB indices down almost 0.5%: Earlier, Japan's Nikkei fell 93 points, or 0.65%, to 14,311. World markets rose yesterday on the prospect of the dovish Janet Yellen taking over at the Federal Reserve. She certainly looks like the front-runner. As my US colleagues Dan Roberts and Dominic Rushe wrote last night: Rebel Democrats on Monday threw their weight behind a growing campaign for Janet Yellen to take over the US Federal Reserve, as their successful revolt against White House pick Larry Summers emboldened those calling for tougher policy toward Wall Street. But while Yellen is seen as more supportive of economic stimulus than Summers, she might also take a harder line on bank regulation.... More here: Democrats push for Janet Yellen as Fed chair after Summers withdrawal Shares in Lloyds Banking Group are down 2% this morning, from 77.3p to 75.6p , following the sale of part of the UK taxpayers stake in the bank. Makes sense, given the Treasury sold its shares for 75p each. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, reckons Lloyds shares should be popular with investors betting on a British recovery (as its operations are mainly based in the UK): Rundle said: Many will see this as a symbol of the UK\u2019s financial system returning to health as institutional investors snapped up the shares on offer, an indication that the market feels far more comfortable with the UK banking sectors\u2019 prospects given the upswing we are seeing in the UK economy. Lloyds itself is a leveraged play on the UK economy for investors \u2013 if you believe in the UK recovery, Lloyds is the likely long play versus the likes of riskier banks RBS and Barclays. Also coming up today.... \u2022 We get the latest UK inflation data at 9.30am BST (10am CEST). Economists expected a slight drop in the rising cost of living, with the consumer prices index falling from 2.8% to 2.7%. \u2022 The German ZEW survey will show economic sentiment in Europe's biggest economy, at 10am BST (11am CEST) \u2022 Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras is visiting Brussels to meet with top officials, to discuss its upcoming EU presidency and its bailout package. Details are vague at this stage, as Matina Stevis of the WSJ flags up: \u2022 European stock markets are expected to drop back after yesterday's rally \u2022 The Federal Reserve will begin its monthly meeting, although we don't get its decisions until tomorrow The other big news this morning is that the UK government successfully sold part of its stake in Lloyds Banking Group overnight, beginning the process of returning the bank to the private sector. UK Financial Instruments reported that it found buyers for 6% of Lloyds' shares, raising \u00a33.2bn. The shares were placed at 75p each, slightly over the 73.6p at which the taxpayer bought into the bank during the height of the financial crisis. It cuts the government's total stake from 38.7% to 32.7%, as reported last night. The sale feels like another milestone in the road back from the crisis, coming five years after the week in which the collapse of Lehman Brothers shook the financial world. We'll have more details shortly... Another sign of Europe's malaise... in Spain, sales of bicycles apparently overtook car sales in 2012. That's according to The Times this morning, which writes: Spaniards bought more bicycles than new cars last year as the economic crisis, which has left at least a quarter of the workforce unemployed, strengthened its grip on the country. The lure of a free means of transport led about 780,000 Spaniards to buy a bicycle last year, an increase of 4 per cent from the year before. Sales of cars fell by 31.4 per cent to 700,000. Spanish car sales are down another 3.6% so far this year, according to today's data. Today's data (which is online here), also shows that austerity continues to chew away at consumers in the European periphery. Sales in Cyprus have tumbled by 40% so far this year -- showing the impact of its bailout, and capital controls which restrict how much money they can take out from the bank. In Ireland, sales are down 7.7%, while Greek car sales fell by another 4.5% compared with the first eight months of 2012 -- a time in which the country was gripped by fears that it would crash out of the eurozone. Hyundai Europe chief executive Allan Rushforth reckons that Europe's mid-market carmakers are being crunched by market pressure. He told Reuters: What we're seeing right now in the European car industry is a squeezed middle German premium brands are coming down through the market while Hyundai is moving up (and) making life very difficult for European volume brands rooted in the mainstream. Hyundai's sales are down 2% so far this year, less than that 5% industry average. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Breaking news to start the day -- Europe's car industry has suffered another dire month as sales in its troubled automobile industry slumped to an alltime low. Eight months into the year, fewer cars have been sold than in any year since 1990, according to new data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. It reports that new registrations have fallen by 5.2% since January, to just 7,841,596 units across the whole of Europe. Many of Europe's big name manufactures continue to see sales slide. ACEA admitted that August (never a great month for car sales) had been particularly tough, as the \"downturn prevailed across significant markets\". This graph shows the damage in 2013, with sales rising in just two months (April and July). New passenger car registrations declined by 5.0% in August compared with a year ago, reversing a 5% jump in July. Demand dropped in all major markets, denting hopes that the worst was over. The UK was the only major market to post growth in August, with sales jumping by 10.9%. Otherwise, it's another dire picture - with Germany contracting by 5.5%, and Italian sales down 6.6%. French car sales suffered a double-digit decline, falling by 10.5%, while the Spanish market was rough -- tumbling by 18.3%. Some European manufacturers have had a year to forget. \u2022 Peugeot Citreon's sales are down by 12.3% so far this year. \u2022 Fiat are down 8.6% \u2022 Volkswagen sales have dropped by 4.6% Jaguar Land Rover, though, bucks the trend with a +10.0% rise in sales between January and August. Not a great start to the day, and a cautionary tale to those who reckon Europe's economic woes are over. Reaction to follow, along with other details of the day ahead....",

Since markets are, for the most part, expecting a tapering decision, any delay could be construed as a lack of US Federal Reserve confidence in the US economic recovery and may add some volatility and downside risk for equities.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5238823be4b0706f2d49f1ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-17T16:38:19.944Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In America, the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>&#xa0;has begun its&#xa0;two-day meeting as speculation mounts that chairman Ben Bernanke is preparing to announce cut-backs on the US's $85bn-a-month economic stimulus programme.</p> <p><strong>Tapering</strong> could be just around the corner, writes our Wall Street correspondent <strong>Dominic Rushe</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bernanke will hold a press conference Wednesday to discuss the Fed's plans. The event comes amid speculation that he will announce his resignation: Bernanke has made clear he will not seek a third term as chairman and Barack Obama is now assessing replacements.</p> <p>The Fed's third round of bond buying, known as quantitative easing, was announced last September and has so far pumped about $800bn into the bond markets in an attempt to kick-start investment and keep interest rates down. In June, Bernanke announced some \"tapering\" of policy could begin later this year if the economy continued to improve.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve's open markets committee (FOMC), however, is split on QE with some concerned about the unintended consequences of the massive programme. In previous FOMC meetings some members have made clear they want an early end to the programme.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>More here:&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/17/federal-reserve-stimulus-meeting-quantitative-easing-taper\">Federal Reserve begins two-day meeting as stimulus taper looms</a></strong></h2> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-17T16:48:22.159Z\">at 5.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52387b3ae4b0ea3d39a66c70\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-17T16:24:26.235Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ambrose, you excel yourself......</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ambrose&#xa0;Evans-Pritchard</strong> of the Daily Telegraph has delivered a masterful response to German finance minister <strong>Wolfgang&#xa0;Sch\u00e4uble, </strong>which is well worth a read<strong>.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e88c842a-1c67-11e3-a8a3-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2fAMbBSLc\">Writing in the Financial Times today</a>, Sch\u00e4uble declared that the eurozone economic recovery was well underway, and taunted those who had claimed Europe had lost the plot.</p> <p>The nub of his point is that&#xa0;Europe's policymakers had implemented sensible policies, whose effectiveness was proven in recessions through the ages.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What is happening turns out to be pretty much what the proponents of Europe\u2019s cool-headed crisis management predicted. The fiscal and structural repair work is paying off, laying the foundations for sustainable growth. This has taken critical observers aback. It should not have, because, in truth, we have seen it all before, many times and in many places. Despite what the critics of the European crisis management would have us believe, we live in the real world, not in a parallel universe where well-established economic principles no longer apply.</p> </blockquote> <p>Further down in the article,&#xa0;Sch\u00e4uble wins more friends by claiming that Europe's public have been protected from the worst of the storm.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The European safety nets have provided a well-calibrated mix of incentives and solidarity to cushion the pain.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\"m not <em>completely</em> convinced that those who argued for a change of plan are now lying broken and discredited under the wheels of Europe's revival (<em>tho anyone who insisted the eurozone would break up by now looks a little daft</em>).</p> <p>And over at <strong>Telegraph Towers,</strong> AEP seems to agree, in a classic column. Again, here's a taste:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I apologise for mentioning that unemployment is 27.8% in Greece, 26.3% in Spain, 17.3% in Cyprus, and 16.5% in Portugal, or for pointing that it would be far worse had it not been for a mass exodus of EMU refugees. Nor was is proper to mention that Greek youth unemployment in 62.9%. These are trivial details.</p> <p>I apologise for pointing out that the EU-IMF Troika originally said the Greek economy would contract by 2.6% in 2010 and then recover briskly, when in fact it contracted by roughly 23% from peak-to-trough, and will shrink another 5% this year according to the think-tank IOBE. This slippage is well within the normal margin of error.</p> <p>I apologise for mentioning that the debt trajectories of Spain, Greece, Italy, and Ireland have accelerated upwards under the austerity plans, and therefore that the policy has been self-defeating.</p> <p>It was quite uncalled for to point out that Italy\u2019s debt ratio has jumped to 130% of GDP, or to so suggest that debt cannot keep rising on a contracting nominal GDP bas, and I will wash my mouth with soap if I ever utter the words \u201cdenominator effect\u201d again.

The Commission continues to believe that this is essential to secure Greece's future growth and jobs, and it is already giving positive results. I really want to congratulate you, Prime Minister, dear friend, for your leadership and determination. I believe it is key for the success of the programme. I know that the Greek citizens are operating in extremely challenging and difficult circumstances, but I believe now we can say there is light at the end of the tunnel.</p> <p>In fact, we expect a gradual return to growth in 2014 after six years of recession; government bond spreads haven fallen markedly since their peak in June 2012; economic sentiment has improved; the current account deficit has fallen over the last three years and Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio is set to start declining next year and fall below 120% by 2021. All these are encouraging signals when you think of the doubts that were expressed some time ago concerning Greece.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barroso also repeated a theme from last week's State of the Union speech -- next year's European Parliament elections, which will be a battleground between eurosceptics and pro-Europeans.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In May, people will head to the polls to vote in the European Parliament elections, and it is very important that we make these elections a moment of European democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Critics of Europe's handling of the crisis, though, might remind Barroso that technocratic (unelected) leaders briefly ran both Greece and Italy in the last couple of years -- not exactly democracy's finest hour....</em>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52385e08e4b0706f2d49f1cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-17T13:51:45.549Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The WSJ's Matina Stevis</strong> was also at the Barroso-Samaras press conference in Brussels, and reports the key lines:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/statuses/379961474107445248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EU&amp;src=hash\">#EU</a> Barroso: If Needed, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Greece&amp;src=hash\">#Greece</a>&#39;s Program Will Be Adapted, doesn&#39;t want to add to extra financing speculation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23euro&amp;src=hash\">#euro</a></p>&mdash;

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is entitled to claim a few political points from the sale of a 6% slice of Lloyds Banking Group. After all, a year ago few people thought it would be possible to sell any shares above the state's purchase price of 73.6p. But it was outrageously cheeky of the chancellor to talk about the last Labour government having \"forced\" British taxpayers into bailing out the banks. Would Osborne have refused to write the cheque? Would he have declared that taxpayers (and non-taxpayers, for that matter) could choose whether to inject billions? Of course not. Conservative policy towards banks was all over the shop in 2008/09 but nobody was suggesting that Alistair Darling had any real alternative to holding hold his nose and saving the UK banking system. And, lest we forget, in the case of Lloyds, the Labour government did the public purse a huge favour by allowing \u2013 or encouraging \u2013 the Black Horse to swallow HBOS, the source of huge post-deal write-offs. The rescue merger was catastrophic for Lloyds shareholders (who are understandably bitter to this day) but it was terrific news for the state that the bank's chairman, Sir Victor Blank, and chief executive, Eric Daniels, were so keen to own the pox-ridden HBOS. The deal saved the rest of us a few bob; without it, the bailout bill might have been even larger. Osborne is on stronger ground when he says the sale of Lloyds shares is a major milestone in \"further normalising\" the banking sector. It is true that the regulatory system is improved; that few mourn the death of the Financial Services Authority; and that banks are better capitalised these days. On the other hand, one has to ask why Lloyds shares, which have trebled in value since January 2012, are suddenly so popular with investors. There are two positive reasons: the UK economy is less sick and Lloyds, under chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, is better managed. But a third reason, surely, is that investors realise that the UK's banking system will continue to be an oligopoly in which the biggest player \u2013 Lloyds \u2013 can't fail to make a lot of money one day. Even after shedding 631 branches as TSB, Lloyds still has a 25% share of the current market and still owns the Halifax, which it absurdly describes as a \"challenger\" brand. That is a mighty strong position to enjoy, especially when all talk of a competition inquiry has gone cold and the government's hopes of giving the mutual sector an invigorating tickle look laughable after events at the Co-op Bank.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the boss of Lloyds Banking Group, is in line for a bigger than expected bonus after the government sold off the first tranche of its stake in the bailed-out bank for a \u00a360m profit. The Lloyds chief executive stands to collect more than \u00a32.2m if the shares stay above 73.6p \u2013 the price paid by taxpayers for their stake during the 2008 bank bailouts \u2013 for 30 consecutive days or if the government sells off a third of its stake above 61p, the price the shares were trading at during the bailouts. His bonus, when it was awarded in March, was originally worth \u00a31.5m but it has steadily increased in value as the 3m shares he was awarded have risen from 49p to 74.65p \u2013 the level they closed at on Tuesday night after the government sold off 15% of its holding. He will receive the shares in 2018 if the requirements are met. The share sale, which leaves the taxpayer with a 32.7% stake, down from 38.7%, prompted George Osborne to claim the economy had turned a corner and to insist he would get back the entire \u00a365bn of taxpayers' money ploughed into the banks to keep them afloat in 2008- 2009. The share sale came five years to the day after Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS to create the enlarged group. UK Financial Investments, the government body that looks after the stakes in the bailed-out banks, said the 6% stake \u2013 some 4.2bn shares, worth \u00a33.15bn \u2013 was placed with major investors at 75p a share. Some \u00a345bn of the \u00a365bn bailout cash was used to prop up Royal Bank of Scotland but a sale of the taxpayer's 81% stake is being delayed by a review of whether to hive off a bad bank. Osborne tweeted: \"Confirm have sold 6% of Lloyds shares at 75p. Profit for taxpayer &amp; important step in plan to get their money back and repair economy.\" He later spent part of the day with Horta-Os\u00f3rio at one of Lloyds' operations in Birmingham. \"If you look at what has happened over the last 12 hours with Lloyds, you have investors from around the world investing in a British bank. That is a sign the British economy is turning a corner,\" he said. \"Five years ago the previous government forced British taxpayers to put a huge sum of money into bailing out the banks. That was a big ask of the British public. I have been determined ever since I became chancellor to get that money back for taxpayers.\" The chancellor said the money would be used to reduce the national debt by \u00a3586m, based on the 61p value of the Lloyds stake in the nation's accounts. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the government may now be able to sell off its entire stake before the May 2015 general election. He said: \"Many aspects of government/Bank of England policy \u2013 [such as] the 'Funding for Lending' scheme, which caused the collapse of retail savers' interest rates, and overt support for the housing market through the 'Help to Buy' scheme \u2013 have been distinctly positive for Lloyds\". The biggest block of buyers for shares was saidHalf the shares are understood to have been sold to UK investors, with 30% going to the US and 20% to other international buyers. The government has promised not to sell off any more Lloyds shares for 90 days and there is little expectation of a quick sale of RBS while the review into whether to a create a bad bank is under way. But analysts at Jefferies reckoned it might yet be possible. \"UKFI's sale of 6% of Lloyds in a simple manner is unequivocally positive for that bank and also for RBS, in our view.\"",

He will receive the shares in 2018 if the requirements are met.</p> <p>The share sale, which leaves the taxpayer with a 32.7% stake, down from 38.7%, prompted George Osborne to claim the economy had turned a corner and to insist he would get back the entire \u00a365bn of taxpayers' money ploughed into the banks to keep them afloat in 2008- 2009.</p> <p>The share sale came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/lloydstsbgroup.hbosbusiness2\" title=\"\">five years to the day after Lloyds TSB rescued HBOS to create the enlarged group</a>. UK Financial Investments, the government body that looks after the stakes in the bailed-out banks, said the 6% stake \u2013 some 4.2bn shares, worth \u00a33.15bn \u2013 was placed with major investors at 75p a share. Some \u00a345bn of the \u00a365bn bailout cash was used to prop up Royal Bank of Scotland but a sale of the taxpayer's 81% stake is being delayed by a review of whether to hive off a bad bank.</p> <p>Osborne tweeted: \"Confirm have sold 6% of Lloyds shares at 75p. Profit for taxpayer &amp; important step in plan to get their money back and repair economy.\"</p> <p>He later spent part of the day with Horta-Os\u00f3rio at one of Lloyds' operations in Birmingham. \"If you look at what has happened over the last 12 hours with Lloyds, you have investors from around the world investing in a British bank. That is a sign the British economy is turning a corner,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Five years ago the previous government forced British taxpayers to put a huge sum of money into bailing out the banks. That was a big ask of the British public. I have been determined ever since I became chancellor to get that money back for taxpayers.\"</p> <p>The chancellor said the money would be used to reduce the national debt by \u00a3586m, based on the 61p value of the Lloyds stake in the nation's accounts.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said the government may now be able to sell off its entire stake before the May 2015 general election.</p> <p>He said: \"Many aspects of government/Bank of England policy \u2013 [such as] the 'Funding for Lending' scheme, which caused the collapse of retail savers' interest rates, and overt support for the housing market through the 'Help to Buy' scheme \u2013 have been distinctly positive for Lloyds\".</p> <p>The biggest block of buyers for shares was saidHalf the shares are understood to have been sold to UK investors, with 30% going to the US and 20% to other international buyers.</p> <p>The government has promised not to sell off any more Lloyds shares for 90 days and there is little expectation of a quick sale of RBS while the review into whether to a create a bad bank is under way.</p> <p>But analysts at Jefferies reckoned it might yet be possible. \"UKFI's sale of 6% of Lloyds in a simple manner is unequivocally positive for that bank and also for RBS, in our view.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Economists are predicting that pressure on British households eased only slightly last month as inflation stuck above the government's target for the 45th straight month. The headline consumer price measure of inflation (CPI) is expected to ease to 2.7% in August from 2.8% in July, according to a Reuters poll of economists ahead of an official announcement on Tuesday morning. The cost of living measure has been above the 2% target since December 2009. Fresh data on Monday underlined the strains on Britons' budgets as pay growth fails to keep pace with price rises for essential goods such as food and household energy bills. A key measure of pay, total labour costs per hour, was up by just 0.5% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. That was well below average consumer price inflation of 2.7% over the same April to June period. Recent analysis by the TUC suggests that Britain's workers are suffering the most protracted squeeze on their incomes since the long depression of the 1870s and are now well into their fourth year of falling real wages. Economists underlined the pressure on households, noting that labour costs excluding bonuses and arrears actually fell 0.8% year on year in the second quarter. Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight, expects any improvement for real incomes to be a slow process. \"Earnings growth may well pick up over the coming months, but the increase seems likely to be gradual as companies look to contain their costs in a still very competitive environment and still appreciable labour market slack limits workers' ability to push for higher pay,\" he said. Still, Tuesday's inflation numbers may well bring some relief to new Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who last week was forced to defend his forward guidance regime for interest rates. Under the scheme, Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee have said that so long as inflation stays under control they would only consider pushing interest rates to more normal levels once unemployment fell to 7%. Rates are at a record low of 0.5%. If August headline inflation does indeed come in at 2.7% on Tuesday, that will mean the expected moderation in price pressures is slightly ahead of where the BoE forecast at the time of its inflation report in August, according to economists at Investec. Economists at the thinktank Capital Economics also predict inflation will have slowed in August thanks in part to downward pressure from petrol prices, which rose by less than in August in 2012.
