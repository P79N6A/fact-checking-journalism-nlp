      "bodyText": "The minister for resources, Matt Canavan, says he is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by BP\u2019s decision to not proceed with its controversial plan to drill for oil in the commonwealth marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight. He said the Turnbull government was still confident the region could be developed, and he would be speaking to other oil and gas companies in coming days. He criticised environmental groups that have campaigned against BP\u2019s project, saying their celebratory response to the decision showed the \u201cugly side of green activism\u201d. \u201cWe think up to 100 workers will be impacted, and those workers I\u2019m sure went to bed last night a little restless ... but we had other people in this country popping the champagne corks and celebrating that fact,\u201d Canavan said on Wednesday. BP announced on Tuesday it would scrap its $1.4bn drilling program in the Great Australian Bight, off South Australia, citing commercial reasons. The announcement was applauded by green groups, coming after repeated requests for more information from the Australian regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, and mounting public concerns about the impact the drilling and any potential oil spill would have on the pristine waters of the bight. BP had previously boasted the bight had the potential to be as big an oilfield as the Gulf of Mexico, where there are now more than 4,000 oil rigs. Karoon Gas Australia, which announced its plans to explore for oil last week, has said the bight holds \u201cthe world\u2019s last underexplored Cretaceous basins\u201d. Canavan told ABC radio on Wednesday he was bitterly disappointed . He said BP had been allowed to explore for oil in the marine reserve after making almost half a billion dollars worth of commitments to do work in the area, and now it was walking away from them. He said he now expected BP to \u201cmake good\u201d some of those commitments in other ways. \u201cI\u2019ll be very interested in discussing with them in coming days what those plans might be,\u201d he said. He criticised environmental groups that campaigned against the project. \u201cWhat does frustrate me is sometimes the workers in these industries, who tend to be fairly quiet, reticent types of people, aren\u2019t the ones on the radio or in the media telling their stories,\u201d he said. The government still believed the region could produce large amounts of oil and gas, he said. \u201cObviously there is still a lot of uncertainty about the area, but we remain confident of its long-term prospectivity and I\u2019ll be talking to some of those other companies about their plans in coming days,\u201d he said. Canavan was also asked about the effectiveness of the petroleum resource rent tax, after reports that just 5% of oil and gas projects operating in Australia are paying the tax. The Tax Justice Network has warned that Australia is set to blow another resources boom, forgoing billions of dollars in potential tax revenue, because the PRRT is failing to collect adequate revenue from the explosion in liquefied natural gas exports. \u201c[The PRRT] is a profits-based tax and what happens, of course, is that resource developments take large upfront costs, particularly some of these LNG developments \u2026 that take some time before profits are realised,\u201d Canavan said. \u201cThis tax has delivered billions to the federal government over a number of decades, and it has underpinned the development of a massive industry in this country. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to be very careful about making any changes, particularly to people that make massive investments. We\u2019ve got to attract this investment to our country.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Changes to pensions brought in since 2010 could cost the public purse about \u00a35bn annually by 2034-35 despite providing a small benefit in the medium term, the government\u2019s spending watchdog has found. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) found that changes to the way pensions and savings are taxed have made private pensions less attractive than other forms of savings to many workers \u2013 particularly those on high wages. A paper published by the OBR on Tuesday examined a series of changes to taxation for private pensions and savings, along with freedoms given to workers to access their retirement nest eggs from the age of 55, that were introduced by former chancellor George Osborne. Other changes include lowering the amount workers can put into a pension each year without incurring tax to \u00a340,000, with a \u00a31m lifetime cap. At the same time, the maximum amount that can be put into a tax-free individual savings account (Isa) has been raised significantly to \u00a320,000 a year. The OBR said the government had made several \u201csignificant changes\u201d to the way private pensions and savings were taxed, as well as bringing in a variety of government top-ups on certain savings products. \u201cIt has generally shifted incentives in a way that makes pensions saving less attractive \u2013 particularly for higher earners \u2013 and non-pension savings more attractive, often in ways that can most readily be taken up by the same higher earners,\u201d the report said. The OBR found that the \u201csmall net gain\u201d to the public finances from Osborne\u2019s changes over the medium-term becomes a net cost in the long term. The gains from the reforms would peak at \u00a32.3bn in 2018-19 before turning negative from 2021-22, rising in cash terms to hit \u00a35bn by 2034-35. As a share of GDP \u2013 a better way to determine whether that sum is affordable \u2013 the OBR expects the net cost to rise to just over 0.1% of GDP by that time. It warns that the \u201cseemingly small cost would add 3.7% of GDP to public sector net debt\u201d over a 50-year period. However, the report also points out that the relatively slow pace at which the changes would affect the public finances would let future governments tweak policy if necessary. A Treasury spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government wants to ensure people can save in a way that works for them, for both the short and the long term. That\u2019s why we continue to support pension saving and savers through new initiatives such as the personal savings allowance, the lifetime Isa and Help to Save.\u201d The findings were released on the same day that the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and the Pensions Regulator called for increased powers to prevent companies from dodging their obligations to savers in the light of the BHS scandal. The call came in evidence to a parliamentary inquiry about the oversight of pension schemes, kicked off after BHS collapsed with a near \u00a3600m hole in the funding of its pensions scheme. The plight of the Tata Steel pension, the future of which was thrown into doubt when its Indian owner decided to sell up, and of the Bernard Matthews pension pot, which is expected to receive just 1p in the pound under a controversial rescue package for the poultry processor, have also highlighted the limitations of pensions regulation. The PFF, which acts as a lifeboat for failing retirement schemes, said the Pensions Regulator should be given the power to fine employers who seek to dump pension scheme obligations. The regulator itself said it should be given enhanced investigatory powers, under which it could compel parties to give evidence with civil penalties for refusal to divulge information and the ability to \u201cseize and sift\u201d relevant documents. It said companies should be compelled to justify that their actions are in the interests of the pension fund, shifting the burden of proof that behaviour is prudent and appropriate to the companies rather than the watchdog. Such a move would make it easier for the regulator to step in. \u201cIn our view, the subjectivity in legislation, specifically around what \u2018prudence\u2019 or \u2018appropriate\u2019 mean, can be a barrier to the regulator achieving acceptable outcomes from our interventions,\u201d the watchdog wrote in evidence to the work and pensions select committee. It also wants mandatory clearance for certain corporate activities that might weaken the company, such as a sale, dividend payments, change of control, share buy-backs and loans. That idea has already been promoted by Barbara Judge, chair of the Institute of Directors. At present, companies involved in takeovers are able to approach the Pensions Regulator about their plans on a voluntary basis. Judge said that in future the regulator should investigate sales of companies with turnovers of at least \u00a3200m and where the pension fund covers more than 2,000 employees. The regulator noted that mandatory clearance should be handled with care: \u201cThis has the potential to be a significant burden on employers and impact on corporate activity. Therefore we believe any such a proposal would require further discussion and engagement with stakeholders and should only be taken forward in a targeted and proportionate way. Clear criteria as to when approval should be sought would be necessary.\u201d Frank Field, chair of the committee, said the latest evidence gave a \u201cuseful steer\u201d on potential reform. He has previously said: \u201cWe cannot have firms changing ownership at the price of pensions being dumped with the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 such dumping involves promises being broken, and the cuts in benefit that result.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. Sterling recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u2019s single market free trade area. Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then. A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55. However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the rapid decline in the pound, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars. Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee (MPC) in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union. Saunders said the current account, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum. Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling. \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d Saunders told MPs on the treasury select committee. Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU. \u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern,\u201d he said. Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added. \u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well contained, I would expect the MPC to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote. A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending. Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access. But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions. Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News that: \u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top bankers have warned that Brexit could force their industry to shift jobs out the City, as a senior policymaker at the Bank of England warned the loss of such high-paid roles could knock a hole in the UK\u2019s budget. Anil Kashyap, a newly appointed figure at the Bank, said the UK would lose out from taxes paid by City workers if jobs moved out of the capital as a result of a hard Brexit. Appearing before MPs on the Treasury select committee, Kashyap was asked about his expectations for the value of the pound if the UK were to exit the EU quickly and without access to the single market. The pound has sunk 15% since the 23 June referendum. Citing figures that 3.7% of UK employment is in financial services, which provides 11.5% of the country\u2019s tax take, Kashyap said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lose much of that before you cause a hole in the budget that could be meaningful and that, I think, would have some knock on effects for the exchange rate. \u201cThe one point I haven\u2019t seen stressed as much in this debate is just the pure fiscal cost to the budget. If you\u2019re going to lose, then, a bunch of financial services jobs that are going to migrate back, the fiscal consequences of that is non-trivial, just because those jobs are so high paying and [they pay] so much tax.\u201d Kayshap, an academic at the University of Chicago, has been appointed to the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, which was set up shortly after the 2008 banking crisis to look for risks to financial system. He gave his evidence to the MPs as London-based bankers of major US financial firms outlined the implications of Brexit if the UK did not secure a deal to retain access to the remaining members of the EU. Rob Rooney, head of UK operations at Morgan Stanley, told a conference that operations would have to shift out of the country. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27,\u201d he said in quotes reported by Reuters. James Bardrick, who runs the UK operations of US bank Citi, said decisions about moving roles could be made next year \u2013 when Theresa May suggested she would trigger article 50 and formally begin the process of exiting the EU. \u201cHow do we and when do we start making decisions \u2026 knowing the plan is ready to go \u2026 it could be in the first quarter of 2017,\u201d Bardrick said according to Reuters. The City minister, Simon Kirby, told the audience that \u201can absolute priority\u201d for the government was keeping the UK\u2019s as \u201cone of the best financial centres\u201d. Some City firms have been concerned about the fate for employment in the EU , but Kirby said: \u201cWe fully expect that the legal rights of EU nationals already in the UK will be properly protected.\u201d Kashyap\u2019s admission to MPs about the fiscal costs of Brexit followed a report in the Times that leaked government papers showed Treasury coffers could take a \u00a366bn annual hit if there was a hard Brexit. However, Downing Street distanced itself from the figures, saying they were not new. Meanwhile, a report by Oliver Wyman, for the lobby group CityUK, the UK\u2019s financial services industry, has warned hard Brexit could put 35,000 jobs at risk. Kashyap also told MPs about that weakness in banks across the EU could hurt major players in the UK. \u201cI am particularly worried about contagion from stress coming from the European banks and whether there might be linkages \u2013 perhaps indirect \u2013 between them and the largest UK banks,\u201d Kashyap said. He did not expand on those comments in the hearing but said in written evidence: \u201cFor example, rumours about the health of various large European banks have been reported by the media on and off for the last few months \u2026 If any were to need a substantial recapitalisation is possible their lenders will reassess exposures to all their counterparties\u201d. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares have been pushed to 30-year lows on concerns that it could face a $14bn (\u00a310.5bn) settlement with the US justice department over a decade-old mis-selling scandal. Kashyap said the penalties could appear \u201ca little bit arbitrary\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s my colleague Philip Inman\u2019s summary of today\u2019s drama: The pound endured another day of pressure from investors on Tuesday after continued jitters on the foreign exchange markets pushed it down more than two cents to $1.21. Sterling recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote as a Bank of England official said he expected the pound to fall further in the coming weeks, driven by the referendum result and the UK\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world. The exchange rate with the US dollar stood at $1.30 last week when Theresa May opened the Conservative party conference and appeared to put regaining control of immigration above staying inside the EU\u2019s single market free trade area. Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then. A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55. However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the rapid decline in the pound, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars. Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union. Saunders said the current account, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.

A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending. Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access. But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions. Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News that: \u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward.\u201d And that\u2019s all for tonight. Do tune in tomorrow for more coverage of the pound, the financial markets, the global economy and more.... Remember, tonight\u2019s ructions aren\u2019t JUST about Brexit. The dollar has hit an eight-month high against a basket of currencies, on speculation that US interest rates are heading higher soon: Some more thoughts from Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: The FT\u2019s John Gapper is concerned that parliament doesn\u2019t have its eye on the ball.... This is a positively grim day for the pound, which just stuck its nose below the $1.21 mark as today\u2019s relentless selloff continues. More reaction to the pound\u2019s recent slump. Except, your average emerging market currency has performed an awful lot better than the pound this year. Brazil\u2019s Real, for example, has surged by almost 25%. Sterling is struggling to find a floor tonight \u2013 it just touched $1.2107, a decline of almost 2.5 cents against the US dollar today alone. Kathleen Brooks, Research Director at City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty. She told BBC News tonight that: The weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook. They think Brexit is going to be very negative for the UK economy, and UK GDP could contract going forward. If we have many more days like today, then talk of a Sterling Crisis won\u2019t seem far-fetched. So let\u2019s quickly recap, as City traders take a breather. The pound has suffered another day of heavy losses, shedding two cents against the US dollar to $1.214, and one euro cent to \u20ac1.098. The selloff was triggered by fresh worries about the cost of a hard Brexit, after leaked Treasury papers suggested leaving the single market would ultimately cost \u00a366bn in lost tax receipts. That forecast has been criticised by pro-Brexit ministers, who accuse the Treasury of scare-mongering. Labour, though, fear that \u201cjobs, livelihoods and public services\u201d are at risk. Two leading bankers, from Citi and Morgan Stanley, have warned they could start to move jobs out of London in 2017. Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley International, was blunt about the consequences fo a hard Brexit: It really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27. And two Bank of England policymakers have issued warnings about the impact of Brexit. Michael Saunders, of the Monetary Policy Committee, predicted that the pound could fall further. And Anil Kashyap of the Financial Policy Committee warned that Britain could suffer a budgetary black hole if well-paid City jobs move overseas. The weak pound did push shares in London up briefly, to a new all-time high. But then a late selloff sent the FTSE 100 into the red. Analysts say the pound is also being squeezed by the recent strength of the US dollar, which is benefitting from speculation that Hillary Clinton will win next month\u2019s presidential election. Paresh Davdra, CEO of RationalFX, predicts a lot more volatility for sterling... \u201cIn the short term, I think we will see the pound continue to slide. A lot of what has been happening has been in reaction to political events, namely any update on Brexit that comes from the government. This week we have seen the first evidence from the Prime Minister that Britain is heading for a clean break from the EU \u2013traditionally the least desirable option for the economy \u2013which has been a major factor behind the pound\u2019s slump. As we get closer to Article 50 being invoked, I think we will see the pound continue to fall further. In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU. But once we overcome that, we should begin to see the trend reverse. Until then however, it will likely continue to a bumpy ride for the UK\u2019s currency.\u201d The pound is also suffering a late rout against the euro, as Brexit fears thump sterling again. It\u2019s fallen by one euro cent, or around 1%, to \u20ac1.098. Crumbs, make that $1.2153 -- which means the pound has lost two cents against the US dollar today! The pound is ploughing new lows, and is now down 1.75 cents at $1.2177. That\u2019s a new 31-year low, if you exclude the odd flash-crash last Friday... Sterling is now at an eight-year low against a basket of major currencies. And if it weakens much further, we could hit 40-year lows, according to Reuters journalist Jamie McGeever. Today\u2019s selloff means the pound has suffered its worst four-day run since late June, and the aftermath of the EU referendum vote. Back then, sterling was worth around $1.48. It has now shed around 17.5% of its value since. The selloff has intensified since Theresa May declared that she\u2019ll trigger article 50 by the end of March. The pound has dropped by 7 1/2 cents, or nearly 6%, since the start of the Conservative Party conference, from $1.2975 to $1.22-ish. That\u2019s a really sharp decline, as investors have faced up to the prospect of Brexit taking place by spring 2019. May\u2019s promises of immigration controls also pushed the pound down, as traders anticipated a Hard Brexit, which would deprive UK firms of membership of the single market. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty has written a scorching piece about the sterling slump. Here\u2019s a flavour: So let\u2019s have some ugly facts. First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain does not pay its way in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them. That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come. Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad. True, but that is to overestimate the bag of bones that is the British manufacturing sector 30 years after the Thatcher revolution. Back over in Dublin, the Irish government has unveiled a series of measures designed to protect the economy from a Brexit shock. It aims to protect foreign investment, boost tourism and reduce the exposure of farmers in the wake of the collapse of sterling. Under the \u201cGetting Ireland Brexit Ready\u201d programme, announced by the finance minister, a \u201crainy day fund\u201d will be built up from surplus budgets for use as a contingency for public services in the event of a shock to the economy after Brexit Day, expected in 2019. A special \u20ac150m loan fund to help farmers with cash flow and short term borrowings is to be established amid concern many are struggling to cope with the sharp decline in the value of their exports to the UK, A special tax relief programme designed to help foreign investors with the smooth movement of staff from the US and elsewhere is to be extended until the end of 2020. This programme will allow employers to relocate state from overseas offices with minimal tax complications. A reduced nine per cent VAT rate is to be retained in the tourist sector to assist the competitiveness of the hospitality sector which is heavily dependent on UK tourists. The government says: \u201cThe measure acts to secure and embed investment, which can lead to sustainable growth and strengthens Ireland\u2019s innovative capabilities.\u201d At the same time the government has released a sector by sector analysis of the impact Brexit could have on trade with Britain, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner. Agri-food and computer services are among the most exposed sectors. The Revenue commissioners have also been asked to scope out how potential customs with the UK and with Northern Ireland would work. Unveiling the package, finance minister Michael Noonan said the Brexit vote posed \u201cimportant challenges for the Irish economy\u201d and it needed to \u201cprotect the progress\u201d made to the economy since the crash of 2010. Breaking: Britain\u2019s stock market has failed to hit a new closing high, as the City frets about the costs of a hard Brexit. A late afternoon selloff sent the FTSE 100 down by 0.38%, or 26 points, to 7070 points. It had earlier hit a new all-time high of 7129 points (as covered here). Retail stocks rallied, with Next up 4% and Marks &amp; Spencer up 3.2%. But mining stocks fell, as the strengthening US dollar pushed down commodity prices. Now, in theory, the weak pound should have driven the FTSE 100 higher. But it appears that Brexit worries have pushed shares price down, especially predictions that leaving the single market would create a fiscal black hole. Top bankers from Citi and Morgan Stanley also dented confidence, by warning they could quit the City of London next year. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: A lunchtime surge saw the FTSE smash through to 7129; now it\u2019s back hovering below 7100, that midday burst of energy proving to be brief. Perhaps reports that both Citi and Morgan Stanley have stated they will leave London if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit have weighed on investors\u2019 appetite for the UK index; perhaps it was a bout of profit-taking. Either way the FTSE couldn\u2019t hold onto its highs for long. Wall Streeet is also in the red, with the Dow down around 1% after aluminium firm Alcoa disappointed the markets. Chris Beauchamp of IG says investors are also driving the US dollar higher, because they expect American interest rates to rise before Christmas. The blame for the general \u2018risk off\u2019 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December The pound is hitting new lows against the US dollar in late London trading. It has now shed almost 1.5 cents today, to just $1.221. That partly reflects fears over hard Brexit. It\u2019s also due to the fact the US dollar is strengthening against most currencies. Worth noting that the euro is also having a bad week. Traders are piling into the US dollar in anticipation that American interest rates might rise in December. Fujitsu says that its 1,800 planned job cuts are not a response to the Brexit vote, and it remains committed to the UK (that\u2019s hot off the Reuters terminal) The pound is taking another pummelling, now down its lowest point of the day at $1.223. It was briefly lower on Friday, during the flash crash that drove sterling to fresh 31-year lows. Bad news for UK workers at Fujitsu. The Japanese electronics firm is planning to cut up to 1,800 jobs as part of a \u2018transformation programme\u2019. That\u2019s via the Press Association. No word if it\u2019s Brexit-related.... Global stock markets are turning a little sour now, dragging the FTSE 100 away from today\u2019s record high. US aluminium firm Alcoa has disappointed investors, by missing revenue and profit forecasts today. That\u2019s a downbeat start to the latest earnings season, leaving Wall Street traders unimpressed. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says: Expectations were that we will finally get a quarter when we can be confident to say that earning season will give us a number which will make the foundation a little more stronger for the US economy. But the number released from Alcoa was simply just a disaster and has made investors angry who are willing to liquidate their position. So, all the main markets are now in the red: The pound is still looking weak, too, down almost one cent today at $1.228 The government won\u2019t be lured on whether we\u2019re in a full-blown sterling crisis, or not, reports Paul Waugh of Huffington Post. Personally, I think $1.20 might be the trigger point for some serious \u201cSterling Crisis\u201d headlines; so we\u2019re still a few cents away. Two senior bankers have warned that they could start moving jobs out of the City, perhaps next year, if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit. Speaking at a London conference today James Bardrick, the boss of Citi\u2019s UK operation, said his bank could trigger its contingency plan by early next year. Bardrick said: \u201cHow do we and when do we start making decisions ... knowing the plan is ready to go ... it could be in the first quarter of 2017.\u201d Rob Rooney, CEO of Morgan Stanley international, gave a blunt warning that jobs would have to move back into the EU, if Britain quit the single market. As Rooney put it: \u201cIt really isn\u2019t terribly complicated. If we are outside the EU and we don\u2019t have what would be a stable and long-term commitment to access the single market then a lot of the things we do today in London, we\u2019d have to do inside the EU 27.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes). This is what Bank of England policymaker Anil Kashyap was banging on about this morning, when he predicted a \u201cnon-trivial\u201d impact on the UK\u2019s fiscal plans if lots of well-paid City jobs moved overseas. Today\u2019s stock market surge is only a \u2018hollow victory\u2019, argues Laith Khalaf of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown. He says it\u2019s being driven by currency movements rather than a fundamental improvement in UK companies. Nonetheless UK investors will still be cheered to see a boost to their pension pots and ISA valuations, as it represents a genuine increase to their wealth in pounds and pence. The concern will be that a reversal in fortunes for the currency could see the gains wiped off as quickly as they appeared. That may well be the case, though it\u2019s hard to see anything in the foreseeable future that\u2019s going to propel the pound back to its former glory. Having smashed through the intraday record high, City traders are now wondering if the FTSE 100 will do the double and close at a record high. And with two and a half hours to go, it\u2019s nip and tuck, frankly. The Footsie has dipped back a little, since hitting 7129 points two hours ago. It\u2019s now just 7097, compared to an alltime closing high of 7104 points. This is good, from the Press Association: The Irish government also warned that the Brexit vote is \u201ca real risk\u201d to the Republic\u2019s economy, due to the close trade ties. Dublin has already trimmed its growth forecast for 2017, as this statement from today\u2019s 2017 Budget explains: During the delivery of his budget to the Dail (Irish parliament) this lunchtime Ireland\u2019s Finance Minister Michael Noonan was quite bullish in defending the Republic\u2019s controversial low corporation tax regime. Despite the EU ruling that Apple owed billions in tax thanks to the taxation policy in Ireland, Noonan told the Dail: \u201cIreland\u2019s 12.5% corporation will not be changed and nobody in Europe or anywhere else is asking for it to be changed.\u201d On the Republic\u2019s international tax strategy, Noonan says it: \u201crestates our commitment to meet international tax principles and how our corporate tax regime remains fair but competitive into the future.\u201d Overall he has announced around \u20ac300m in tax cuts mainly for the lower paid. Around \u20ac1.7bn will be allocated to extra spending for the public services. Back in Dublin, crash barriers have been erected to prevent any surge of protestors demonstration over today\u2019s Irish budget 2017. So far there has been little sign of many demonstrators unlike in the days of the last recession when thousands congregated in Molesworth Street over austerity cuts and deals to recapitalise Ireland\u2019s busted banking system. (via US student Keela Sweeney) Neil Wilson of ETX Capital agrees that the weak pound is the main factor driving the FTSE 100 to an all-time high today. Brexiters might point to the FTSE\u2019s rise as a sign of strength but this is very much a story of sterling weakness boosting foreign earnings \u2013 which account for around two-thirds to three-quarters of FTSE 100 company revenues. Having said that today\u2019s gains largely come from UK-focused stocks like Next, Whitbread, Marks &amp; Spencer, Travis Perkins and Taylor Wimpey. He also believes that Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders may have helped push shares higher, during his testimony to MPs (highlights are here) We also got comments today from one Bank of England policymaker that the MPC would not be too fussed if inflation overshoots \u2013 the market seems to have taken this as a clear indication that rates are staying on the floor for a while yet. A weak pound and lower-for-longer interest rates is generally good for equities. Duncan Weldon, head of research at City firm Resolution Group, points out that the FTSE 100 isn\u2019t a great barometer of the UK economy. The index\u2019s 10 biggest companies are (in order), Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, Unilever, BP, British American Tobacco, GlaxoSmithKline, BHP Billiton, AstraZeneca, Vodafone and Diageo. That\u2019s two oil giants, two pharmaceuticals firms, a global bank, a tobacco firm, a consumer goods titan, a major mining company, an international drinks business and a major telecoms group. Ben Chu of the Independent is tweeting some interesting graphs about the FTSE: We\u2019re calling it a record high... but The Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham points out that the Footsie is 6% down this year, when priced in US dollars. That means UK shares are attractive for American investors, another factor that has driven the market up since the Brexit vote. Boom! The pound is falling further as lunchtime approaches in the City, driving shares in London up to their highest ever level. The FTSE 100 index has just smashed through to a new all-time intraday high, up 30 points at 7129. That breaks the previous record set in April 2015. It\u2019s being driven by retailers such as Next (+4.2%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (+3.1%), plus building companies. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more UK focused companies, has gained 0.7% - close to the record high struck last week. But there is a proviso.... share prices are partly being driven up by the weakness of the pound (which makes overseas earnings more valuable). And the pound is continuing to slide today, now down another cent at $1.225. This graph, from Bloomberg, shows how the FTSE 100 has pushed higher as the pound has weakened since June: Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, says the weak pound is \u201cworking its magic\u201d on share prices again. UK investors will once again be cheering the impact of a falling pound, as the drop in sterling once again works its magic on the FTSE 100. The index has hit its all-time high, although this will doubtless bring out the legions armed with their charts of the FTSE rebased into a variety of currencies to paint the index in a less flattering light. Of course, most UK investors will simply be pleased to see their portfolios rise, and will worry about the currency later. Good numbers from luxury firm LVMH have helped Burberry to rise steadily this morning, with the stock touching its highest level since August 2015. There are also protesters outside government buildings in Ireland today, ahead of the budget: A local entrepreneur and founder of a Irish startup company called Parkio has welcomed Dublin\u2019s decision to halve capital gains tax for entrepreneurs, to 10%, to help cushion the impact of the Brexit vote. His accountant had estimated he was going to be paying approximately 33%. (thanks to journalism student Lucas Nolan) Back in Ireland, the government\u2019s new budget is now expected to contain some measures to counteract and indeed exploit the impact of Brexit. There will be additional funding for the Republic\u2019s Industrial Development Authority, which over four decades has attracted multi-national corporations from Dell to Apple, Microsoft to Google to the country. The extra money for the IDA will enable it to try and woo even more global hi-tech giants to low corporation tax Ireland (12.5%) especially those companies who are worried that the UK out of Europe means Britain is no longer a beachhead into the EU single market. It is part of moves to portray Ireland globally as the only English-speaking country still in the the EU and mainly for the benefit of American hi-tech multi nationals in particular. One potential \u2018Brexit shock absorber\u2019 in this year\u2019s budget is the dramatic halving of capital gains tax for home-grown entrepreneurs from 20% to just 10%. This is another move designed to boost indigenous Irish firms to cope with any potential collateral damage Brexit could cause to the Republic\u2019s economy. Anil Kashyap refuses to say whether he thinks the pound is likely to suffer further falls over the next few years. I\u2019d have to resign from the University of Chicago if I started forecasting currency moves, Kashyap tells the Treasury committee -- we\u2019re known for our position that the market sets these prices. The newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Policy Committee adds: Until we see what the relations are between the UK and the EU, it\u2019s very hard to know where any of this is going to settle Q: But what about if we knew we were getting a hard Brexit? Then the pound would probably weaken further, Kashyap. But it still depends exactly what \u2018hard Brexit means\u2019. Q: Hard Brexit is taken to mean a swift exit from the EU, and a fallback to WTO rules..... Kashyap replies that this could have serious consequences for the Treasury: If you lose a bunch of financial services jobs... then the fiscal consequences of that is non-trivial, as those jobs are so high paying, and [generate] so much tax. 3.7% of total UK employment is in financial services, and 11.5% of fiscal revenues come from financial services, he adds. You don\u2019t have to lose lots of that before you have a hole in the budget that could be meaningful. And that could have some knock-on effects for the exchange rate. Reminder: A leaked Treasury paper has predicted that the UK could eventually lose \u00a366bn of tax revenues after Brexit: The Treasury Committee is now questioning Anil Kashyap, a US academic who is joining the Bank of England\u2019s Financial Stability Committee. They\u2019re not best pleased that Kashyap is planning to miss one FPC meeting due to teaching commitments at the University of Chicago (but to be fair, he\u2019s squeezing his teaching commitments into just 10 weeks). Kashyap is also being quizzed about the huge fine hanging over Deutsche Bank. Is that a threat to financial stability? Kashyap argues that letting banks get away with malpractice would be a bigger threat to stability. And he denies that the problems in the European banking system start with US fines. He blames low growth, and badly capitalised banks -- such as in Italy. If the size of the problem in Italy was as small as some people have claimed, they\u2019d have fixed it by now, Kashyap adds. And that\u2019s the end of Michael Saunders\u2019 session at parliament, to rubberstamp his appointment to set interest rates on the Monetary Policy Committee. The big news is that Saunders thinks the pound could extend its recent losses since the Brexit vote. He told MPs that: \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely.\u201d Also: He thinks the Bank will \u2018look through\u2019 the inflationary consequences of the weak pound. He\u2019s not terribly worried by the speed of the pound\u2019s decline, arguing that the currency is adjusting to the reality of Brexit. He thinks the slump in sterling could push import prices up by 13%, potentially pushing inflation up by 1.5 percentage points a year. He thinks the UK economy will grow faster over the next few quarters than previously thought, but this doesn\u2019t tell much about the long-term. Saunders said: I think the economy will do better over the next few quarters. I don\u2019t think that tells you about the long run effects. It\u2019s important not to make judgements on the long run based on the short run view. What the economy does in the next few years is crucial. Q: Is the Bank of England now \u2018out of ammunition\u2019 to stimulate the economy? Saunders says not. Interest rates could be cut again (although they\u2019re already only 0.25%), and the Bank could also boost its asset purchase scheme (buying bonds with newly created money). We\u2019ve still got tools, if needed, he insists. Michael Saunders say the UK economy will probably perform better than expected over the next few quarters (echoing a point he made in a speech last week). But that doesn\u2019t tell us much about the long-term effects of Brexit. Q: Were the Bank of England\u2019s warnings before the EU referendum justified? Saunders only joined the Bank of England this summer, so he was still working in the City during the Brexit vote. He says most City experts expected a Brexit vote to lead to a weaker currency and lower growth, but no-one knew if this would lead to financial instability. So as a player in the market, Saunders was reassured by Mark Carney\u2019s comments -- as it showed the Bank would act to stabilise the markets. The Brexit vote isn\u2019t the only thing pushing the pound down, Michael Saunders adds. The UK\u2019s current account deficit (around 6% of GDP) is also weighing on sterling. And Saunders admits that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the pound fall further! He also explains that a 20% drop in the pound (slightly more than what we\u2019ve seen since June) would probably push import prices up by 12-13%, which would add 4 percentage points to inflation over a few years. That could mean inflation is 1.5 percentage points higher than otherwise at its peak (so 3.5% rather than 2%, for example). And Saunders thinks the Bank of England could \u2018look through\u2019 this, rather than raise borrowing costs to squeeze it out. Q: Are you worried about the recent volatility in the pound? Michael Saunders says sterling is adjusting to the reality that Britain is leaving the European Union, and the likely impact on growth. If the speed at which the currency falls creates ripples in other asset markets, then that is a problem. But...if we are just adjusting to a new equilibrium, then the speed of the adjustment is not a problem. Saunders also insists that the Bank does not have any target for the pound, or a level where it would intervene to support sterling. The Bank has \u201clong ago learned its lesson\u201d here, he smiles (a reference to Black Wednesday in 1992 when speculator George Soros forced the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism). Over in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders is being questioned by the Treasury Committee. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Saunders has been asked about Theresa May\u2019s recent criticism of the BoE\u2019s stimulus policies, for making people who own assets richer, but penalising savers and the poor. He defends the current policy of record low interest rates, plus a quantitative easing programme. I don\u2019t think we at the Bank of England can tackle the distributional effects of monetary policy. We can\u2019t set interest rates for different groups. If the Bank raised interest rates to support savers, then the economy would be weaker, unemployment would be higher, asset prices over time would be weaker, and over time, interest rates would eventually be lower too, Saunders claims. Q: So should you set QE and monetary policy blind to the distributional effects? Yes, Saunders replies, unless those distributional effects obstruct the impact of monetary policy. Big news out of South Korea: Samsung is \u201cpermanently halting production of its Galaxy Note 7. Killing off the smartphone is a \u201cdrastic step\u201d, says Bloomberg, after several customers reported that replacement devices have caught fire. Bloomberg explains: After halting sales of the new versions of the large-screen smartphone that failed to fix exploding batteries, Samsung finally pulled the plug on a key product that was supposed to compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and other high-end smartphones during the U.S. holiday shopping season. Production will stop, Samsung said in a statement Tuesday. At $1.229, the pound has shed almost seven cents against the US dollar since Theresa May announced she\u2019d trigger article 50 by next March. That\u2019s a fall of around 5%, in less than seven trading days, and means the pound is now 17% lower than on referendum day. Reuters reckons the pound is suffering its worst four-day run since immediately after the Brexit vote. That\u2019s bad for import prices, and Brits heading abroad. But Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, believes exporters should soon benefit. A Brexit is definitely not the end of the world. Moreover, the devalued pound will see exports gain momentum within the next few month. Over in Germany, investor confidence has risen this month: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, has responded to the warning that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d could cost the Treasury \u00a366bn a year in tax revenues. \u201cLosing access to the single market would be devastating for jobs, livelihoods and our public services yet the Tory government are prepared to take this desperate step, despite being warned by their own experts of the consequences. The British people voted to leave the European Union and all sides must respect that decision, but what they certainly didn\u2019t vote for was economic misery and the loss of jobs.\u201d After coming tantalisingly close to a new alltime high, the FTSE 100 has now shed all those early gains. Despite today\u2019s selloff, sterling isn\u2019t the worst-performing currency today. That honour has been grabbed by the South African rand, which just tumbled by 3% against the US dollar. There are reports that finance minister Pravin Gordhan has been issued with a summons for fraud, over a surveillance unit which was set up when he led the national tax agency. South African government bonds, and bank shares, are also falling in value. Over in parliament, MPs on the Business Committee are holding a session on Britain\u2019s industrial strategy. They\u2019ll hear from former chancellor George Osborne, former deputy PM Lord Heseltine and Sir Vince Cable, who ran the BIS department before the last election. Our Politics Live blog is tracking the action: The UK jobs market is also suffering from the Brexit vote, according to recruitment firm PageGroup. Gross profits at its UK division fell by 4.7% in the last three month, it told the City today. PageGroup blames on \u201cfragile market conditions\u201d following June\u2019s referendum, particularly in the financial services sector. Steve Ingham, PageGroup\u2019s CEO, says: In the UK, confidence levels remained fragile and below levels seen earlier in the year.... With the prevailing uncertainty in the UK, the challenges in some of our other larger markets and the unpredictable nature of the current cycle, we remain cautious in our short-term outlook. The official unemployment data since the Brexit vote has been quite encouraging, with the jobless rate still just 4.9%. But the claimant count did rise in August, suggesting some weakness. It\u2019s been a while since we last had a full-blown currency crisis, everyone panicking because the pound is falling through the floor. Well, we\u2019re having one now. So says John Humphrys, Today Programme presenter, with a certain amount of relish. But is it really a crisis? Gerard Lyons, former chief economic advisor to Boris Johnson, says it\u2019s not. He believes we should welcome the cheaper pound. Sterling has been seen as overvalued for some time - and the scale of the current account deficit, at 7%, is huge. In an era of low inflation and low growth, a weaker pound is a good thing, Lyons adds. But Ngaire Woods, professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford, is much more concerned. The cost of importing machines, or medical equipment for the NHS, from the US has immediately gone up, she says, and that will hurt the economy down the road. Firms also face new uncertainties --over the future of foreign workers, and the UK\u2019s future trade links \u2013 says Woods, adding: Here at Oxford University we have top international professors saying they might not move to Oxford.... It\u2019s budget day in Ireland and the first for the new coalition led by Fine Gael but propped up by Independent members of the Dail, and supported for the first time in terms of the national financial plans by the main opposition party Fianna Fail. Irish budgets of recent past have been cost-cutting austerity driven events as the last Fine Gael-Labour government sought to restore the black hole in Irish public finances caused by the banking crash and the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy. In recent years Ireland has been the leading country in the EU in terms of growth but the state is still borrowing heavily on international markets to pay for its public services. There are some small give-away measures in this year\u2019s budget and they include: An extra \u20ac5 per week for the nation\u2019s pensioners. An additional \u20ac900 per year to each child if he or she is in 40 hours of childcare per week. Extra spending for an additional 1,000 nurses and 800 more garda officers. A 50 eurocent hike in the price of cigarettes.  A reduction of \u20ac5 in the cost of prescription charges for the over 70s. All in all they are modest adjustments and extra spending indicating the cautious approach taken by Finance Minister Michael Noonan. He presents his budget to the Dail at 1pm and it will be interesting to see if he introduces any other measures aimed at absorbing future shocks to the economy caused by Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union. With the UK still Ireland\u2019s largest trading one commentator in Dublin yesterday even called for the creation of an Irish Minister in charge of Brexit-affairs given the impact the British leaving the UK may have on the Republic\u2019s economy. Neil Wilson of City firm ETX Capital is alarmed by the \u201csharp moves\u201d in the value of the pound this morning. He fears that Brexit angst could drive sterling down to $1.20. GBP/USD crashed through the $1.23 handle to around 1.2284, its lowest level since last week\u2019s gyrations. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think that ferocious flash crash was just a very tentative toe in the water and the pound is now plunging headlong into the abyss. Sterling seems to be looking for a level and it\u2019s really unclear where that could be and so bargain hunting is a risky game to play at the moment. The $1.20 handle earmarked by many before the referendum is definitely in play as everyone seems to be short sterling at present. The weak pound is helping to drive the London stock market close to record highs. The FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has risen by almost 20 points, or 0.25%, to 7118 points. That would be a record closing high, and is only 6 points away from the all-time intraday high. Exporters, such as fashion firm Burberry, are benefitting from the cheapness of sterling. It\u2019s also good for mining companies, who earn their money in dollars. Sterling is now at its weakest level since the financial crisis broke out, when measured against a basket of other top currencies. Reuters has the details: Trade-weighted sterling hit a nearly-eight-year low of 74.0 at the Bank of England\u2019s first morning print of the index, which measures the pound\u2019s broader strength. It was also half a percent weaker at 90.51 pence per euro. Some traders cited a Financial Times report that Russian bank VTB may move its European hub to Frankfurt, Paris or Vienna as having added to worries of financial sector cutbacks inLondon due to Brexit. \u201cThere is nothing to go on on the data front today, but concerns surrounding our ever increasing current account deficit have reignited discussion around the widespread impact such a hole can create,\u201d said Tobias Davis, head of corporate treasury sales at Western Union in London. Kit Juckes, currency expert at Societe Generale, fears that the weakness of the pound could spread to other assets, such as government bonds and shares. In real effective terms, sterling is 10% lower than it was in 1992 after leaving the ERM and is now weaker than it was after Lehman. Press comment is now shifting to embracing the positive effects of a weak pound and in due course that\u2019ll be true but any further weakness from here might simply reflect loss of confidence and be bad for UK assets (gilts, equities, house prices, you name it...) in general. Although a weak pound means Britain is poorer, it could also help the economy ride out the Brexit storm. Ashoka Mody, the IMF\u2019s former deputy-director for Europe, has told the Daily Telegraph that we should be celebrating sterling\u2019s slump. Mody argues that the pound was overvalued before June\u2019s vote, and has simply dropped to a more suitable level. \u201cIt is desirable from every point of view. The idea that Britain is in crisis or is on its knees before the exchange rate vigilantes is ludicrous. \u201cThe UK economy is rebalancing amazingly well. It is a stunning achievement that a once-in-fifty-year event should have gone to smoothly.\u201d More here. The pound\u2019s weakness is being exacerbated by traders piling into the US dollar. The dollar is in demand, as Donald Trump is seen as increasingly unlikely to become US president in November. Tape recordings of Trump boasting about groping women have dealt another blow to his campaign, prompting more top Republicans to withdraw their endorsements: Kathleen Brooks of City Index says Trump\u2019s \u201ccrash and burn\u201d is boosting the dollar, The latest election polls in the US suggest that Hillary Clinton is extending her lead over Donald Trump, which is considered dollar positive. The most senior Republican in Congress, Paul Ryan, has abandoned Trump after the latest debate against Clinton, further signs that his campaign is losing momentum at this crucial stage of the election race. It\u2019s looking like another bad morning for sterling, as the British currency continues to weaken in the face of Brexit worries. The pound has dropped by over half a cent this morning to $1.229 -- which would be a 31-year low, if you ignored the flash crash that sent sterling tumbling on Friday. Sterling has also lost fresh ground against the euro, down 0.33% to \u20ac1.106. This latest selloff follows reports that Britain could lose \u00a366bn of tax revenues each year if the UK takes the plunge with a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 Here\u2019s the story: Leaked government papers suggest that leaving the single market and switching to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules would cause GDP to fall by up to 9.5% compared with staying in the EU. The draft cabinet committee paper seen by the Times is based on forecasts from the controversial study into the predicted impact of quitting the EU published by George Osborne in April during the referendum campaign. Although the then chancellor faced widespread criticism over the report, the Treasury stands by its calculations, according to the Times. The documents says: \u201cThe Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4% and 9.5% of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement, with a central estimate of 7.5%. Some pro-Brexit ministers have dismissed the report, saying the Treasury is being unduly pessimistic and going over the top. Sam Coates, the Times journalist who broke the story, explains that the report uses the same Treasury forecasts produced in April. This may heighten concerns among businesses that they could be locked out of the single market by March 2019.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today.... Brexit fears continues to swirl around the City this morning, as the pound continues to be buffered by concerns over Britain\u2019s exit strategy from the EU. Overnight, Russia\u2019s VTB Bank has become the first big lender to publicly say it will move its European headquarters out of the UK. Herbert Moos, deputy chairman, told the Financial Times that VTB is now eying up Frankfurt, Vienna and Paris as alternative sites for its European hub. Moos says: \u201cWe did have bigger plans for the London office, but after Brexit we are scaling them down and building them up elsewhere. \u201cOur board will decide where by the end of the year.\u201d More here: Brexit pushes VTB\u2019s Europe HQ out of London That kind of talk is likely to weigh on UK assets, as all the major banks plan their own strategies... Brexit will also be on the minds of MPs on the the Treasury Select Committee. They will be questioning Michael Saunders, the new member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, from 10am. They\u2019ll then hear from Anil Kashyap, who is joining the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee. Saunders has already said that the UK economy has performed better than the Bank expected, since the Brexit vote. Also coming up.... Tech giant Samsung is in a full-blown crisis, after pulling all its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from sale around the globe. Several customers have reported that replacement devices have overheated, or caught fire: The oil price has hit a one-year high overnight, after Russia backed the output curbs proposed by the Opec cartel. Oil ministers are gathering in Istanbul this week for the World Energy Conference, so further developments are possible. Ireland\u2019s government is presenting its budget today; the first since Britain voted to leave the EU. And European stock markets are expected to dip in early trading, after London\u2019s FTSE 100 closed at a 15-month high last night. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Investors took fright at the prospect of a hard Brexit and the currency has declined more than 6% against the dollar since then.</p> <p>A flash crash last Thursday, when the pound fell by 6% in 10 minutes, heightened concerns that investors had lost faith in sterling as a major currency. A year ago a pound bought $1.55.<br></p> <p>However, the pound\u2019s decline had the opposite effect on the UK\u2019s leading share index. The FTSE 100 touched a new intra-day record of 7,129.83 during afternoon trading, although it closed nearly 60 points lower after a late bout of selling, below the record closing figure of 7,104 reached last year. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/10/pound-continues-to-fall-against-dollar-and-euro-amid-hard-brexit-fears\">rapid decline in the pound</a>, which has boosted the value of companies that earn much of their revenues in dollars.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, a former investment banker who joined the monetary policy committee in August, said Britain\u2019s large current account deficit was adding to the anxiety about the ability of the nation to pay its way once it quits the European Union.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/oct/04/weak-post-brexit-growth-forecast-likely-wrong-bank-michael-saunders\">Saunders said the current account</a>, which measures the balance of trade, cash transfers and investment income with other countries, was already undermining confidence in the UK\u2019s ability to pay its way before the EU referendum.</p> <p>Speaking to MPs on the treasury select committee, Saunders warned it was now a major issue and compounding the already weak sentiment on currency markets towards sterling.</p> <p>Saunders told MPs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Saunders, who joined the MPC from the US investment bank Citi, where he was chief economist, said investors were weighing up the implications of Britain leaving the EU.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe work done by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD suggests that the long-run effects of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU is that growth will be lower. If all we are doing is adjusting to a new equilibrium, that is not a concern.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Only if the pound plummets or triggers falls in other markets would the Bank of England need to consider cutting rates to bolster confidence and growth, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf such a scenario were to materialise then, provided inflation expectations and pay growth remain well-contained, I would expect the mpc to largely look through any such direct effects on inflation of sterling weakness, even if they extend for several years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But the lower pound, which reduces the cost of UK goods and services sold abroad, could boost exports and offset much of the anxiety caused by the Brexit vote.</p> <p>A fall in imports would also help to reduce the current account deficit, he said, adding that the government could take advantage of the current depressed situation to boost growth with extra spending.</p> <p><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2016/oct/09/theresa-may-rules-out-commons-vote-on-single-market-exit\">Several Tory MPs, including supporters of the Leave campaign, have warned that leaving the single market</a> will harm the economy and have demanded ministers make every effort to negotiate continued access.<br></p> <p>But the hardline taken by Downing Street and an equally robust response from European leaders, who have emphasised the free movement of labour as a pillar of the single market, have heightened concerns in the City that Britain will eventually leave all the EU\u2019s major institutions.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial betting firm City Index and Forex.com, says traders fear the UK could be dragged back by Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>She told BBC News that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe weakness in the pound is really a sign that investors don\u2019t have confidence in a post-Brexit UK economic outlook.

In addition, we face added uncertainty over the US Election -there is a strong chance that if Hilary comes into power the US Dollar could gain a lot of strength on the back of that. In regards to the long-term, I think we could see the pound make a recovery, as we begin to see what a post-Brexit UK looks like. The biggest obstacle for the poundcurrently is the uncertainty and anxiety that surrounds the nature of divorce proceedings from the EU.

First of all, the crash in the pound is a reminder of one overriding danger that some of us have been warning about for years: Britain <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21557494\">does not pay its way</a> in the world. It buys far more goods and services from other countries than it sells to them.</p> <p>That deficit is made up entirely by what Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/mark-carney-fails-to-rule-out-eight-year-term-at-bank-of-england\">the kindness of strangers</a>\u201d. Which is fine, for as long as those foreign strangers consider London a safe haven for their cash. That shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted now that Britain is about to take a giant political and economic leap into the dark \u2013 and sterling has already plunged further this year than the Argentinian peso. Remember, Whitehall is only beginning to think seriously about the mechanics of leaving the EU: years of this mayhem are still to come.</p> <p>Ah, we\u2019re told: but all this currency weakness is just brilliant for British exporters. It makes their goods so much cheaper to sell abroad.

Sometimes it\u2019s better, for the health of the UK economy, that the pound loses value against the currencies of our major trading partners. The UK\u2019s financial position, regardless of the vote for Brexit, was screaming out for a devaluation. The current account deficit, a measure of our balance of payments with the rest of the world, was 5.9% in the second quarter of this year. If sustained for too long \u2013 and the UK has running such deficits for years \u2013 a day of reckoning was bound to arrive eventually. Brexit has been the trigger. Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, was right to sound sanguine on Tuesday. \u201cGiven the scale and persistence of the UK\u2019s current account deficit, I would not be surprised if sterling falls further, but I am fairly agnostic as to whether any further depreciation is likely,\u201d he said. Consider the reverse position. What if the UK had voted to stay in the European Union and sterling, at $1.50 at the time, had risen to, say, $1.60 or $1.70? There is every chance the UK would have headed towards negative inflation, bringing a knotty set of challenges for policymakers and intensifying the imbalance between imports and exports. None of above, of course, should be taken as meaning that Brexit will benefit the UK economy. Sterling is falling because investors believe the UK\u2019s prospects are poorer outside the EU, and definitely bleaker if we also end up outside the single market via a hard Brexit. That judgment, at least for the short and medium term, seems entirely correct. It is hard to see how exiting a trading bloc after 40 years of membership could be a painless process. There will be a shock, as sensible members of the leave camp conceded all along as they spoke of long-term opportunities. It is only ideologues like David Davis, the Brexit minister, who can make the ludicrously bald claim that \u201cthere will be no downside to Brexit, only a considerable upside\u201d. Davis cannot possibly know how the UK economy will adjust to whatever arrangements follow. But the point about the advantage of a weaker sterling still holds. A lower pound will ease the transition, even if it implies lower living standards for a while. \u201cIf all that is happening is that we are adjusting quickly to a new equilibrium, to me that is not a cause for concern\u201d, said Saunders, again correctly. He added that he wouldn\u2019t want to see \u201cripples\u201d in other classes of assets. Fair point. A weaker sterling would become a problem if it forced up the government\u2019s borrowing costs. The 10-year gilt yield has risen from 0.7% to 1% this month, which has gained a lot of attention but 1% hardly screams crisis. All bets are off, however, if gilt yields were to explode. That world would look very different \u2013 and, conceivably, could even humiliate the government into softening its negotiating stance on Brexit (which would be very welcome). But, as matters stand, sterling at $1.21 is simultaneously newsworthy and expected. Why Pure Gym looked too pumped up Where\u2019s your stamina? Pure Gym has pulled its stock market float blaming \u201cthis period of market volatility\u201d, an odd excuse given share prices appear to be in rude health. We can concede, of course, that excitement in stock markets is centred on big multinationals with overseas earnings, rather than UK operators of low-price gyms. All the same, markets look no more volatile than they were four weeks ago when Pure Gym announced its intention to list. True, Spanish group Telefonica has pulled its float of its infrastructure subsidiary but that hardly indicates that investors in stock market flotations are on strike. Misys, the banking software firm, hasn\u2019t been deterred from trying to return to the public markets. One suspects there\u2019s a simple explanation for why fund managers viewed Pure Gym\u2019s rumoured pricetag of \u00a3500m as too pumped up. There is already a quoted low-cost gym operator called Gym Group. If Pure Gym wouldn\u2019t price its shares at a clear discount, why should investors buy? Will May fold? The cabinet is split on Theresa May\u2019s plan to put workers on boards, reports the FT. Given the fierce lobbying against the idea by business groups, divisions are not surprising. But May has made the proposal central to her governance reforms. If she were to make it voluntary to appoint workers to boards, as the Institute of Directors suggests by way of compromise, 99% of companies wouldn\u2019t bother. May either has to go all-in or fold; the latter course would be astonishingly weak for a new prime minister.",

However, Mind Candy said it was instead forced to negotiate \u201creduced capital repayments\u201d from July to December. Full repayments are due to be made from January, but the company has said it cannot afford to pay at the high level of interest. The terms of the original loan \u2013 Mind Candy took out a further \u00a3684,000 loan last year \u2013 is for full payment by next June. \u201cManagement has prepared cash flow projections for the 2016 and 2017 financial years. These projections indicate that the company requires an extension to the payment terms of the existing long-term loan,\u201d Mind Candy said in Companies House filings. \u201cThe company has a good relationship with the lender and will look to renegotiate the repayment schedule towards the end of 2016. In the event that the negotiations are not successful, or that the company cannot generate sufficient revenues, then there exists a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d Mind Candy\u2019s directors said they were confident they could secure further financial support if necessary but there were \u201cno binding agreements in place\u201d. The company, which makes most of its money from subscriptions to the online game and licensed toys, has struggled to diversify its business after a \u201crapid softening\u201d of the popularity of Moshi Monsters on the web as children shift to new technology and platforms such as apps and mobiles. Mind Candy, which relaunched Moshi Monsters this year, is trying to build the product into an \u201cevergreen children\u2019s entertainment brand\u201d. Last year, subscription and membership card revenue halved from \u00a35.7m to \u00a32.8m and licensing revenue plummeted from \u00a33m to \u00a3855,000. Product revenue from the sale of merchandise based on its games dived from \u00a32.3m to \u00a3189,000. Mobile revenue rose from \u00a32m to \u00a33m. The company also makes World of Warriors and Petlandia, \u201cwhere pets and pop culture collide\u201d. \u201cMobile gaming is an extremely competitive space and is particularly challenging for an under-13-year-old audience as the dominant business model, in app purchase, is not suitable for children,\u201d the company said. \u201cChildren\u2019s brands can grow extremely quickly but they can come down just as fast. To counter some of these challenges we have been developing brands and products that appeal to a broader family audience.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sunderland faces the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d loss of tens of thousands of jobs unless Theresa May gives urgent assurances to Nissan over trade tariffs, a local MP has warned. Julie Elliott, the Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said the city and wider region could suffer job losses \u201con a scale not seen since the closure of the shipyards and coal mines\u201d due to Brexit uncertainty. In a letter to the prime minister, Elliott said the looming threat of EU export tariffs had already jeopardised the future of Sunderland\u2019s Nissan car plant and the 35,000 jobs it supports. \u201cTens of thousands of jobs in Sunderland, over 100,000 jobs in the north-east and many hundreds of thousands of thousands of jobs across the UK are at risk as a direct result of the potential introduction of trade tariffs,\u201d Elliott wrote. Britain\u2019s booming motor industry faces an uncertain future in the wake of the Brexit vote, with Europe the destination for almost 60% of the cars made in the UK. For some plants, such as Nissan\u2019s factory in Sunderland and Toyota\u2019s in Derbyshire, the figure is as high as 80%. Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, warned a fortnight ago that it was delaying new investments in its Sunderland plant until the UK had concluded Brexit negotiations, raising the possibility that new models would be built overseas if the UK was hit with tariffs. Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory produces more than half a million cars a year and is due to decide in the first quarter of next year where it will produce the new Qashqai, its popular small SUV model. Elliott warned that a 10% tariff on each vehicle sold into the EU would put Sunderland at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d to the car giant\u2019s other European plants. Around 35,000 people in the north-east, many of whom live in Sunderland, are employed either by Nissan or one of the many companies in its supply chain. \u201cThe Brexit negotiations present an opportunity for us to create an environment for companies to flourish, feel confident to invest and be able to create even more jobs. If the prime minister fails to take urgent action now, however, we risk job losses on a scale not seen in Sunderland since the shipyards and coal mines closed a generation ago,\u201d Elliott said. Elliott, who was careful not to issue such stark warnings of job losses before the referendum, denied she was scaremongering but said: \u201cWe have to be realistic about what the consequences will be. \u201cTerrifyingly, the future of Sunderland\u2019s Nissan plant has been jeopardised,\u201d she said. In the letter to May, Elliott added: \u201cThis is not a political issue but a practical matter concerning the future of UK manufacturing, a sector of strategic significance to our economic security. I urge you to take immediate action to address these issues in order to protect my region and prevent UK manufacturing being eliminated.\u201d Nissan is not the only giant in Britain\u2019s motor industry to have issued warnings about trade tariffs since the referendum on 23 June. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s has biggest car maker by units, said trade barriers would \u201cnot only affect what we sell but what we buy, and it will ultimately damage our business and British jobs\u201d. Earlier on Tuesday George Osborne said the government must urgently respond to the motor industry\u2019s concerns and seek the \u201cclosest possible economic relationship\u201d with its former EU partners. Giving evidence to MPs on the business select committee, the former chancellor said: \u201cThis government and this parliament have got to make the UK the place to make cars in Europe \u2013 as it has been in recent years. \u201cWe have got to make sure that the future for the automotive industry is very successful, that this is an environment where people want to come and build their cars, where there\u2019s access to a skilled workforce, where the tax regime is right and the local economy can support the car plant and they can export those cars into the continent of Europe. \u201cWe are a European base for car manufacturing. We produce more cars out of that plant in Sunderland than the whole of Italy. That\u2019s got to be something we focus on in the coming years, and overcome the challenges that present us.\u201d",

The government said the move would boost tourism and trade opportunities for the UK, and create vital links for a post-Brexit Britain. Up to 100 passenger flights a week each way will now be allowed, instead of 40, with no limit on cargo flights. Restrictions on destinations within each country have also been lifted. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said it was a \u201cbig moment\u201d for the UK: \u201cStrong connections with emerging markets like China are vital for us if we are to continue competing on the global economic stage. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people visit the UK every year, spending hundreds of millions of pounds. \u201cRaising the number of permitted flights between the two countries will provide massive opportunities for our businesses, helping increase trade, create jobs and boost our economy up and down the country.\u201d Visits from China increased by 46% from 2014 to 2015 to almost 270,000, with Chinese tourists spending \u00a3586m. Earlier this year, Manchester launched the first direct route between the UK and China from an airport outside of London. Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, said the new agreement would boost the north, adding: \u201cPassenger numbers on these services have exceeded expectations, with the flights between Beijing and Manchester operating 90% full over the summer.\u201d The final decision on additional flights is a commercial one for airlines, which have not always found success in China. British Airways launched a daily route to the Chinese industrial centre of Chengdu from Heathrow in September 2012 but reduced the frequency in 2014 after disappointing ticket sales. Adam Marshall, acting director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, saidthe latest move was an important step in encouraging investment: \u201cRelaxing the rules on flights with China sends a positive signal to current and potential global trading partners.\u201d But, he added: \u201cWe need more aviation capacity in the UK for this to be effective. It is therefore vital that the government\u2019s long-overdue decision on airport capacity in the south-east works to boost growth in both the near and long term.\u201d",

Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people visit the UK every year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/02/uk-retail-chinese-tourists-golden-week-surge-tills\">spending hundreds of millions of pounds</a>. </p> <p>\u201cRaising the number of permitted flights between the two countries will provide massive opportunities for our businesses, helping increase trade, create jobs and boost our economy up and down the country.\u201d</p> <p>Visits from China increased by 46% from 2014 to 2015 to almost 270,000, with Chinese tourists spending \u00a3586m. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Manchester launched the first direct route between the UK and China from an airport outside of London.

It is therefore vital that the government\u2019s long-overdue decision on airport capacity in the south-east works to boost growth in both the near and long term.\u201d</p>",

But the market could not sustain its initial rise and after touching the new peak of 7,129.83, it fell during the course of the afternoon as Wall Street opened sharply lower. The FTSE 100 closed at 7,070.88, down 26.62 points on the day, after US markets were undermined by poor third quarter figures from metals specialist Alcoa, which in turn sent mining shares lower. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trader IG, said: \u201cA poor start to the session in the US caused the index to pull back ... from the highs of the session. The blame for the general \u2018risk off\u2019 mood can be attributed partly to Alcoa, whose disappointing figures have put US markets on the defensive, but overall the equity rally is being knocked by a rising US dollar, as traders rush back to the greenback thanks to soaring expectations of a move by the Fed in December.\u201d Earlier the index climbed about 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7,129.83 , beating the previous intraday high of 7,122 in April last year and well above its highest close of 7,103, achieved on the same day. The driving force for the UK market\u2019s recent surge has been the rapid decline in the pound, down 0.8% against the dollar at $1.22. Sterling has suffered its worst four-day period since the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU on 23 June, even leaving aside the flash crash on Friday, after Theresa May suggested Britain would prioritise immigration control over single market access. The FTSE 100 is dominated by companies that make substantial sales and profits abroad. Those profits rise when they are converted back into sterling. Exporters have also gained, as a fall in sterling makes their goods cheaper for foreign buyers and increases their profits. Neil Wilson, a markets analyst at ETX Capital, said: \u201cThe index jumped as the pound took another leg lower on mounting concerns about what a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 will look like.

Who are the losers and the winners in sterling\u2019s plunge? Losers Drivers: Expect a surge in petrol prices in the next fortnight towards 120p a litre as motorists are hit by the double whammy of a fall in the pound and a rise in the price of crude on world markets, which are traded in dollars. \u201cMotorists can expect increases of up to 4p or 5p per litre by the end of the month,\u201d said the Petrol Retailers Association. Retailers: The sharp drop in the pound raises the prices retailers pay for imports, with the British Retail Consortium warning that shops face a challenging time. But, so far, there is little hard evidence of price rises; mysupermarket.com said the average cost of groceries fell again in September, and are 3% cheaper than this time last year. Holidaymakers: HSBC reckons the pound will hit parity against the euro, but for some holidaymakers that is already reality. Airport bureaux de change are offering tourists less than \u20ac1 for each \u00a31 \u2013 just 97 cents in some cases. Fortunately, few British tourists head abroad at this time of the year, although it\u2019s downhill for ski operators with prices in Alpine resorts 20% higher than this time last year, and even more in the Rockies. Overseas pensioners: About a third of the 300,000 Brits living in Spain (and similar numbers who have retired to Ireland) draw a UK pension, whose spending power is shrivelling day by day. The \u00a3119.30 a week basic state pension was worth as much as \u20ac170 a week last year, but is now worth just \u20ac131.80 a week. Winners Stock market investors: The FTSE 100 is up 22% since the lows in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, boosting the value of pension pots and investment Isas. The biggest risers have been commodity stocks, such as BHP Billiton and Anglo American, which make most of their profits in dollars, which are now much higher when translated into sterling. Exporters: Britain has the worst balance of payments deficit of any major economy, and the falling pound will make British-made goods much cheaper abroad. But the impact is slow; the UK\u2019s trade deficit in goods and services with the rest of the world widened in August as exports continued to rise but imports grew at a faster rate. Foreign property buyers: According to Juwai, which claims to be the biggest international property website for Chinese investors, inquiries were up 12% in August to a record high as the renminbi-rich scout around for bargain buys in London.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Southern rail and the general secretary of the RMT have agreed to hold face-to-face talks on Wednesday in an effort to break the deadlock in the long-running dispute on Britain\u2019s worst-performing rail network. Passengers suffered fresh disruption on Tuesday, the first day of a series of three-day strikes, as overrunning engineering works on the Brighton mainline compounded problems for commuters. Rush-hour trains from the south coast were cancelled or delayed by up to an hour, with only about three in five trains on the normal timetable scheduled to run for the rest of the day. The owners of the troubled franchise, Govia Thameslink Railway, had earlier ruled out further talks with the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers\u2019 union (RMT), whose members went on strike over proposed changes to the role of conductors. The RMT called for immediate face-to-face talks on Tuesday, prompted by comments on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme by the GTR chief executive, Charles Horton, apparently guaranteeing a second staff member on all trains that currently have a conductor \u2013 a sticking point in the dispute. The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said in a letter to Horton that this contradicted what he had been told by Southern executives last week. Horton said he would meet Cash, and asked the union to call off this week\u2019s strike to show serious intent and allow productive talks to take place. However, the rail company said that Cash was deliberately distorting Horton\u2019s comments, and that there was no change in its position, dampening any prospect of a successful resolution in any fresh talks. The strike was set to continue on Wednesday despite the agreement to meet, with the RMT mounting picket lines again outside stations including London Victoria and Brighton. On Tuesday, Southern had been intending to run about 61% of its normal timetable, before the additional problems caused by engineering work. Network Rail apologised for a breakdown that meant the railway between Gatwick and Brighton only reopened to trains at 7.20am. Rush hour at Victoria, Southern\u2019s biggest hub, was quieter than usual as trains failed to arrive, station staff said. Speaking on a picket line outside the station, Paul Cox, the RMT\u2019s regional organiser, claimed commuters remained sympathetic, despite the disruption. He said: \u201cThis is only our 10th day of strike action and they know the reality on Southern \u2013 they see through the myth of unofficial industrial action.\u201d Earlier, Horton had told Today that the reasons for the dispute had ended. The company claims the union told its conductor members to accept a deal last week. The RMT said it has advised individuals to accept new contracts to rebrand conductors as onboard supervisors, as they were otherwise threatened with dismissal. Paul Maynard, the rail minister, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that passengers once again face needless and unjustified strike action by the RMT after the union advised its members to accept the new roles being offered by the operator. The union leaders have continually rejected a deal that protects jobs and ensures that conductors will carry on delivering safe, accessible and more reliable rail services. I call on RMT to put passengers first and stop this damaging action.\u201d But at Victoria, Cox warned: \u201cThe strikes are just going to continue until they come to their senses. They\u2019ve put a hardline management in place and we\u2019ve just got to break them down.\u201d Some Conservative MPs have called on the government to take action, but Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is believed to be reluctant to get directly involved, believing a direct public confrontation would only benefit the RMT. But more rail franchises are expected to mandate fewer staff on trains to reduce costs, potentially spreading the row over the safety role of guards throughout the railway. The RMT on Tuesday made a fresh demand that the Merseytravel authority abandon \u201creckless\u201d plans to introduce driver-only trains on Merseyrail.",

      "body": "<p>The boss of Southern rail and the general secretary of the RMT have agreed to hold face-to-face talks on Wednesday in an effort to break the deadlock in the long-running dispute on Britain\u2019s worst-performing rail network.<br></p> <p>Passengers suffered fresh disruption on Tuesday, the first day of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/10/southern-rail-in-court-bid-to-stop-rmt-strike\">series of three-day strikes</a>, as overrunning engineering works on the Brighton mainline compounded problems for commuters. Rush-hour trains from the south coast were cancelled or delayed by up to an hour, with only about three in five trains on the normal timetable scheduled to run for the rest of the day.</p> <p>The owners of the troubled franchise, Govia Thameslink Railway, had earlier ruled out further talks with the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers\u2019 union (RMT), whose members went on strike over proposed changes to the role of conductors.</p> <p>The RMT called for immediate face-to-face talks on Tuesday, prompted by comments on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme by the GTR chief executive, Charles Horton, apparently guaranteeing a second staff member on all trains that currently have a conductor \u2013 a sticking point in the dispute. The union\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said in a letter to Horton that this contradicted what he had been told by Southern executives last week.</p> <p>Horton said he would meet Cash, and asked the union to call off this week\u2019s strike to show serious intent and allow productive talks to take place. However, the rail company said that Cash was deliberately distorting Horton\u2019s comments, and that there was no change in its position, dampening any prospect of a successful resolution in any fresh talks.</p> <p>The strike was set to continue on Wednesday despite the agreement to meet, with the RMT mounting picket lines again outside stations including London Victoria and Brighton. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Southern had been intending to run about 61% of its normal timetable, before the additional problems caused by engineering work. Network Rail apologised for a breakdown that meant the railway between Gatwick and Brighton only reopened to trains at 7.20am. Rush hour at Victoria, Southern\u2019s biggest hub, was quieter than usual as trains failed to arrive, station staff said.</p> <p>Speaking on a picket line outside the station, Paul Cox, the RMT\u2019s regional organiser, claimed commuters remained sympathetic, despite the disruption. He said: \u201cThis is only our 10th day of strike action and they know the reality on Southern \u2013 they see through the myth of unofficial industrial action.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Horton had told Today that the reasons for the dispute had ended. The company claims the union told its conductor members to accept a deal last week. The RMT said it has advised individuals to accept new contracts to rebrand conductors as onboard supervisors, as they were otherwise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/03/southern-rail-issues-ultimatum-to-rmt-over-role-of-conductors\">threatened with dismissal</a>. </p> <p>Paul Maynard, the rail minister, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that passengers once again face needless and unjustified strike action by the RMT after the union advised its members to accept the new roles being offered by the operator. The union leaders have continually rejected a deal that protects jobs and ensures that conductors will carry on delivering safe, accessible and more reliable rail services. I call on RMT to put passengers first and stop this damaging action.\u201d</p> <p>But at Victoria, Cox warned: \u201cThe strikes are just going to continue until they come to their senses. They\u2019ve put a hardline management in place and we\u2019ve just got to break them down.\u201d</p> <p>Some Conservative MPs have called on the government to take action, but Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is believed to be reluctant to get directly involved, believing a direct public confrontation would only benefit the RMT. </p> <p>But more rail franchises are expected to mandate fewer staff on trains to reduce costs, potentially spreading the row over the safety role of guards throughout the railway. The RMT on Tuesday made a fresh demand that the Merseytravel authority abandon \u201creckless\u201d plans to introduce driver-only trains on Merseyrail.</p>",

Unveiling the new Sainsbury\u2019s in south London, its first to feature both a Habitat and an Argos \u2013 bought nearly six weeks ago in the \u00a31.4bn acquisition of Home Retail Group \u2013 Mike Coupe said supermarkets needed to be flexible to compete in a rapidly changing market. \u201cWhatever has has happened in the last five years will be speeded up and happening faster again in the next five years,\u201d he said. Coupe said the rise of online shopping and a move towards buying food regularly at small local stores meant big supermarkets had to do more to persuade people to visit. Last month, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed a 1.1% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to the end of September as it was forced to cut food prices in the latest round of an ongoing industry price war. \u201cWe are never going to be John Lewis or go down that road but we have tried to change our look and feel so that we are less like a supermarket and more like a department store,\u201d he said. At the new site in Battersea, Sainsbury\u2019s Tu clothing brand has 9,500 sq ft of space set out to look like a high street store, and there is also a sushi counter run by Sushi Gourmet, separate counters for fresh meat, cheese, cakes and pizza, Habitat and Argos concessions and an Explore Learning children\u2019s tuition centre. A Starbucks coffee shop is set to open in the store soon. Coupe said that in a traditional supermarket sales of clothing were driven by price but now Sainsbury\u2019s was able to sell premium products that were stylish and fashionable. It dropped a collection designed by Gok Wan this season but will continue to work with the TV stylist who will pick recommendations from the Tu range, to be highlighted in stores and online. Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to install five Habitat outlets in its stores by Christmas, including in St Albans and Solihull. John Rogers, the new boss of Argos, said the group could potentially open tens more outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s stores and was also mulling whether to open new standalone stores. Coupe said: \u201cHabitat is extending traditional supermarket prices to places customers wouldn\u2019t expect. You can\u2019t just sell products in isolation, you have to sell them in the right environment.\u201d The Sainsbury\u2019s department store model also includes the installation of Argos outlets, 14 more of which will go into stores by Christmas taking the total to 30. Coupe said he hoped all Sainsbury\u2019s stores would eventually include at least some space for Argos, even if it was just a pick-up point for goods ordered online. The company has even experimented with temporary Argos pop-ups at festivals. But Sainsbury\u2019s has yet to reveal how many Argos outlets it will relocate from the high street to its supermarkets although it has said that 200 to 300 store jobs are likely to be eliminated through relocations. So far just one store \u2013 in Oldham \u2013 has relocated and Coupe said all Argos staff had transferred. The average length of the lease on an Argos store is just four years, and Rogers said some were much shorter. But he said no firm decision on closure of Argos outlets had yet been taken.",

The airline will lose its Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) \u2013 which allows it to fly package holiday passengers \u2013 at midnight on Wednesday if it does not secure a deal. The UK airline industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has already granted Monarch a 12-day extension from the original deadline of 30 September to show it had the money to stay afloat. Losing the licence would make it far harder for Monarch to recover its finances because it would lose passengers on Atol-protected package deals, though it could still carry passengers who had booked a flight only. But an agreement between Monarch, its majority owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the airline\u2019s banks is expected to be tied up on Wednesday. The package is expected to involve a revision of the terms of Monarch\u2019s 2014 order for 45 new planes from Boeing. Under the agreement, which has yet to be finalised, Boeing would convert the order into lease deals, meaning Monarch could still use the planes but would have more cash to prove to the CAA that it can fund itself. It is not clear whether all 45 plane orders would be converted into leases. Greybull would also inject fresh money as part of a package worth a combined \u00a3165m, which it has said would be the largest investment in the company\u2019s 48-year history if it goes ahead. The rescue deal is designed to help Monarch survive difficult trading conditions due to ongoing international security concerns and the weakness of sterling. Monarch has suffered particularly badly from a downturn in package holidays to Turkey and Egypt, amid terrorism fears, while air traffic control strikes in France have exacerbated its woes.",

    "webTitle": "Osborne's austerity not the reason for borrowing forecast error, OBR says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The independent watchdog responsible for the government\u2019s economic forecasts has blamed the eurozone crisis and high oil prices for its failure to foresee a \u00a358bn overshoot in state borrowing during George Osborne\u2019s tenure as chancellor. In an assessment of its own forecasting record, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said much weaker than expected tax revenues had resulted in a budget deficit of \u00a376bn in 2015-16, \u00a358bn bigger than it had predicted when the coalition government came to office in 2010. The OBR said it did not believe the austerity policies implemented by Osborne when he was at the Treasury were the reason for the forecasting error because it had known that fiscal policy \u2013 decisions related to tax and spending \u2013 would be tougher from 2010 onwards. \u201cWe consider the more plausible explanation for the pattern of our growth errors across recent years to be the deterioration and subsequent improvement in confidence and credit conditions, largely associated with the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area,\u201d the OBR said in its 2016 forecast evaluation report. \u201cThe oil-price driven rise in inflation in 2011 that reduced households\u2019 real incomes was also an important explanation at the start of the period.\u201d The OBR said the deficit in 2015-16 had been higher than forecast despite four factors that had been helpful in reducing borrowing: debt interest payments that were \u00a323bn lower than predicted; a \u00a36bn reduction in expected welfare spending; and lower spending on running costs and investment by Whitehall departments worth a combined \u00a31.2bn. However, these windfalls for the Treasury were more than offset by weaker tax receipts, which were \u00a385bn lower in 2015-16 than the OBR anticipated in 2010. The OBR said \u00a370bn of the shortfall in receipts was due to weaker growth, with the remaining \u00a315bn caused by the fact that the state was getting less tax for every pound of economic output. With employment growth concentrated in low-pay sectors, the exchequer has not been receiving the income tax and national insurance contributions that were expected six years ago. Osborne set up the OBR in one of his first moves as chancellor, saying he wanted to remove the risk of political interference from forecasts for the economy and for government finances. But the slowdown in the economy during the first half of the last parliament caught the OBR unawares, it admitted. \u201cOver the five years of our June 2010 forecast, real GDP growth has been weaker than expected, with the shortfall focused in the first half of that period. In expenditure terms, the error can be explained by weaker-than-expected investment and net trade.\u201d The evaluation report added: \u201cThe continued weakness in productivity growth has been very unusual by historical standards and is responsible for a large part of our error in forecasting real GDP growth. This error was only partly offset by stronger-than-expected growth in employment.\u201d In a separate working paper, the OBR said the government had lost hundreds of millions of pounds in revenue by pre-announcing changes to property taxes such as stamp duty, giving nimble homebuyers time to speed up or delay transactions to take advantage of lower rates. It said by far the most expensive of the six separate incidents studied was the November 2015 announcement of a 3% surcharge for second-home buyers, which was not implemented until March 2016. \u201cThe latest data suggest that around 40,000 transactions were brought forward to beat this increase, with an average tax-saving of \u00a37,560 and a total cost to government of around \u00a3300 million. This was a considerably larger effect than the OBR had assumed when forecasting its impact.\u201d The OBR said the four-month gap gave buyers and sellers plenty of time to bring forward their transactions, noting that even when the window was as short as 11 hours, some buyers were still fleet-footed enough to beat the tax authorities. It said Osborne had announced changes to stamp duty in his autumn statement in 2014 that reduced the tax on sales over \u00a3937,500 but reduced it on all cheaper properties. Although potential buyers only had 11 hours to finalise deals, four times as many transactions took place than usual, costing the exchequer \u00a35m and saving someone buying a \u00a31.5m property \u00a392,000 on average.",

With employment growth concentrated in low-pay sectors, the exchequer has not been receiving the income tax and national insurance contributions that were expected six years ago.</p> <p>Osborne set up the OBR in one of his first moves as chancellor, saying he wanted to remove the risk of political interference from forecasts for the economy and for government finances.</p> <p>But the slowdown in the economy during the first half of the last parliament caught the OBR unawares, it admitted. </p> <p>\u201cOver the five years of our June 2010 forecast, real GDP growth has been weaker than expected, with the shortfall focused in the first half of that period.

    "webTitle": "EU petition on Barroso's Goldman Sachs job signed by more than 150,000", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 150,000 people have signed an EU staff petition demanding that the former European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso loses his pension for taking a job at Goldman Sachs. A delegation will present the petition on Wednesday to the main EU institutions: the commission, parliament and council, which represents EU governments. Nearly 152,000 people have put their name to the declaration, which accuses Barroso of \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d behaviour over his decision to join the US investment bank. Since its launch by a handful of EU employees in July, the petition has spread far beyond Brussels staff, becoming a lightning rod for concerns about senior politicians taking lucrative private sector jobs. The petition comes ahead of a keenly awaited investigation by an EU ethics committee into Barroso\u2019s job. A three-person panel, comprising an ex-EU judge, ex-MEP and ex-official, will advise the commission on whether Barroso broke the EU\u2019s code of conduct, which states that ex-commissioners must act with \u201cintegrity and discretion\u201d during and after they have left office. Barroso, who led the commission for a decade until 2014, took a job at Goldman Sachs in July to advise the bank\u2019s clients on Brexit. The current commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, questioned his predecessor\u2019s decision, saying he did not have a problem with Barroso \u201cworking for a private bank \u2013 but maybe not this bank\u201d. The New York-based bank has come under fire for its role in helping the Greek government hide the extent of its budget deficit, as well as selling sub-prime mortgages, a trigger of the global financial crisis. Barroso and the bank have strongly refuted claims of any unethical behaviour. Such claims are \u201cbaseless and wholly unmerited ... discriminatory against me and against Goldman Sachs\u201d, Barroso wrote to Juncker in September. Goldman Sachs has also stressed that it followed \u201cstrict rules\u201d set by global regulators. \u201cJos\u00e9 Manuel took the role after an 18-month restriction period following the end of his term at the European commission, a longer period than that imposed by most European institutions\u201d. The EU staff, who have drafted the petition, are calling for tighter rules on politicians moving into the corporate sector, once they have left their EU jobs. These calls have been broadly backed by the EU ombudsman, Emily O\u2019Reilly, who has argued that the right to work should be balanced by \u201cthe public right to an ethical administration\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian and European newspapers recently, she said: \u201cYou could have a much stronger code of conduct pour encourager les autres.\u201d O\u2019Reilly, who has also served as Ireland\u2019s national ombudsman, argues the EU should eventually set up an independent body to oversee appointments of ex-officials, similar to Ireland\u2019s Standards in Public Office Commission. \u201cThat is the natural progression, that it moves away from the commission and other institutions themselves.\u201d She predicted the Barroso case would have a permanent impact on the EU institutions. \u201cNothing has ever been so big, or has captured the public imagination in the same way. I think eventually this [case] will make the commission deal with the revolving doors issue in a more serious way.\u201d One of the petition organisers suggested their action had set a precedent that would make ex-politicians think twice before taking certain corporate jobs. \u201cIt is a precedent, in the culture of the EU institutions this will remain.\u201d The official said it was the first time EU staff had publicised criticism of their former bosses for actions, which they argue, have tarnished the EU\u2019s image. \u201cWe are deeply committed to the European Union and we want to defend it.\u201d The petition organisers, who wish to remain anonymous, will be represented at handover by a group of retired EU officials and staff unions. At the same time, campaigners from Transparency International and the Alliance for Lobby Transparency and Ethics Regulation, will deliver a separate petition criticising the \u201crevolving door between the European commission and big business\u201d. The commission\u2019s ethics panel is also investigating Neelie Kroes, the former EU competition commissioner, who failed to declare a directorship in an offshore firm, in breach of commission rules. The panel is expected to take around six to eight weeks to reach a conclusion on both cases.",

      "bodyText": "Japanese technology giant Fujitsu has announced plans to cut up to 1,800 jobs in Britain, more than a tenth of its UK workforce . Fujitsu said the cuts were part of a \u201ctransformation programme\u201d aimed at streamlining operations \u201cin order to remain competitive in the market\u201d. It added that the plan, which will see the first workers leave next year, was not linked to the Brexit vote. The company employs 14,000 people in Britain. The job losses will be spread across Fujitsu\u2019s UK offices, which include London, Belfast, Bracknell, Crewe, Derry, Manchester, Stevenage, Wakefield and Warrington. The firm mainly operates IT systems for big public and private corporations but also provides air conditioning units. A spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need to reduce the cost base for our customers.\u201d He said the company had started consulting employees on Tuesday and that it was too early to say where the cuts would be made. Most of the redundancies are likely to come next year but they could stretch into 2018. Fujitsu also plans up to 400 job reductions in Finland, where it employs 2,500 people. Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest trade union, described the job losses as a \u201chammer blow\u201d to Fujitsu employees and the wider UK economy. Ian Tonks, a Unite national officer, said: \u201cIt is not good news for the UK economy as the company says that it intends to offshore many of these jobs, with increased automation also responsible for job losses. \u201cFujtsu\u2019s main UK subsidiary made \u00a385.6m profit last year and we see no reason for these job losses. Unite will be doing its utmost to fight for these jobs, as well as giving our members maximum support at this very worrying time.\u201d The news came as Fujitsu workers in Manchester voted in an industrial action ballot over pay, pensions and job security. Unite claims the company has been cutting pay rates for years despite healthy profits, and said that it had failed to tackle a significant gender pay gap. The strike ballot result is expected next Wednesday. The company has also given notice to terminate its UK works council, Fujitsu Voice, from January 2017. The union is fighting the move. Fujitsu employs 1,500 people in Bracknell, 701 in Northern Ireland, 693 in Stevenage, 636 in Manchester, 572 in London and 511 in Warrington. The firm said in a statement: \u201cFujitsu is planning a transformation programme that will enable it to better support customers in the era of digital transformation. The company today advised its employee representative forum of plans to restructure the organisation in order to provide better service and respond more quickly to customer needs. \u201cAs part of the programme, Fujitsu plans to streamline operations in order to remain competitive in the market. Proposed measures include changes which would result in a reduction of up to 1,800 jobs in the UK. All affected employees will be offered guidance and support and Fujitsu is establishing a consultation process with elected employee representatives.\u201d The IT company confirmed a few days ago that it was in talks to sell its computer business to Chinese tech company Lenovo. Lenovo has become one of the biggest players in the computer market alongside US rival HP, after acquiring IBM\u2019s PC business in 2005. Tatsuya Tanaka, Fujitsu\u2019s president, had warned ahead of the EU referendum that a vote to leave the EU would be a \u201chuge negative\u201d for the IT firm\u2019s business in the UK. Other Japanese companies such as Nissan and Hitachi have expressed strong concerns over the UK\u2019s departure from the EU and the prospect of higher tariffs. Carlos Ghosn, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, recently sounded a warning over potential new investments in the UK\u2019s biggest car factory in Sunderland and demanded compensation from the government for any tariffs that may be imposed after Brexit. Nissan is due to decide early next year on where to build its next Qashqai sport utility vehicle. Julie Elliott, the Labour MP for Sunderland Central, warned on Tuesday that the city and wider region faced the threat of tens of thousands of job losses \u2013 \u201con a scale not seen since the closure of the shipyards and coal mines\u201d. She urged Theresa May to give assurances to the Japanese carmaker over trade tariffs.",

The FTSE 100, having reached an intraday record of 7129.83, is now down around 8 points at 7089. An opening fall on Wall Street has not helped, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 94 points or 0.5% after a disappointing update from Alcoa. But one of the main factors for the decline is a fall in gold and silver as the dollar continues to climb on the basis that US interest rates may soon be increased. More clues could come from the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting, due to be released on Wednesday. So Mexican miner Fresnillo has fallen 41p to \u00a316.44, Randgold Resources is down 165p to \u00a369 and, in the mid-cap index, the top three losers are Hochschild, 14.4p lower at 252.8p, Egyptian gold miner Centamin, down 7.6p at 147.8p and Africa\u2019s Acacia Mining, off 14.1p at 461.8p. Meanwhile the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 remains Old Mutual, down 11.5p at 197.8p on disappointment with its presentation to City investors, as well as a fall in the rand after South Africa\u2019s finance minister was ordered to appear in court next month. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex said: After the excitement of a fresh all-time intraday peak for the FTSE things have calmed down somewhat, the US open bringing in a wave of investors who aren\u2019t purely Brexit-focused. A lunchtime surge saw the FTSE smash through to 7129; now it\u2019s back hovering below 7100, that midday burst of energy proving to be brief. Perhaps reports that both Citi and Morgan Stanley have stated they will leave London if Britain appears to be heading for a hard Brexit have weighed on investors\u2019 appetite for the UK index; perhaps it was a bout of profit-taking.

    "webTitle": "Southern rail strike and engineering works compound commuter misery", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Union leaders have said there is no prospect of industrial action on Southern ending soon, as passengers on Britain\u2019s worst-performing rail network suffered fresh disruption on the first day of a series of three-day strikes. Overrunning engineering works on the Brighton mainline compounded problems for commuters as rush-hour trains from the south coast were cancelled or delayed by up to an hour. The owners of the troubled franchise, Govia Thameslink Railway, made a fresh appeal for unions to end their dispute after a last-minute legal challenge failed, but leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers\u2019 union (RMT) said the company was \u201cpeddling lies\u201d and vowed to continue their action. Its members went on strike at midnight in their long-running dispute over proposed changes to the role of conductors. Southern had been intending to run about 61% of its normal timetable, before the additional problems caused by engineering work. Network Rail apologised for a breakdown that meant the railway between Gatwick and Brighton only reopened to trains at 7.20am. Rush hour at Victoria, Southern\u2019s biggest hub, was quieter than usual as trains failed to arrive, station staff said. Speaking on a picket line outside the station, Paul Cox, the RMT\u2019s regional organiser, claimed commuters remained sympathetic, despite the disruption. He said: \u201cBased on what I\u2019ve seen today, people taking our leaflets, they don\u2019t blame the union. This is only our 10th day of strike action and they know the reality on Southern \u2013 they see through the myth of unofficial industrial action.\u201d Earlier, Charles Horton, the chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when the RMT are going to stop striking. They should stop striking now. The reasons for the dispute have ended.\u201d The company claims the union told its conductor members to accept a deal last week. The RMT has advised individual members, who are otherwise threatened with dismissal, to accept new contracts that GTR is sending out to rebrand conductors as onboard supervisors. Horton apologised to passengers for what he accepted had been an \u201cextremely challenging period\u201d for Southern. He said: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly sorry for passengers who have suffered months of misery as a result of the ongoing industrial action. The railway on this part of the network is going through a huge upgrade programme to tackle some of the longer-term issues which need to be resolved here in terms of providing more capacity, introducing new trains and improving the punctuality and reliability of services.\u201d He added: \u201cWe also need to modernise the way in which our staff deliver service for customers and that is what is at the heart of this dispute here.\u201d The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cOnce again this morning Southern have been peddling the lie that this dispute is about who opens and closes the doors when, in fact, it\u2019s about the retention of a guaranteed second safety-critical member of staff, with the full range of safety competencies, on all current services. Despite all the spin and bluster, the company refuse to give that guarantee.\u201d Paul Maynard, the rail minister, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that passengers once again face needless and unjustified strike action by the RMT, after the union advised its members to accept the new roles being offered by the operator. The union leaders have continually rejected a deal that protects jobs and ensures that conductors will carry on delivering safe, accessible and more reliable rail services. I call on RMT to put passengers first and stop this damaging action.\u201d But at Victoria, Cox warned: \u201cThe strikes are just going to continue until they come to their senses. They\u2019ve put a hardline management in place and we\u2019ve just got to break them down.\u201d Some Conservative MPs have called on the government to take action, but Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is believed to be reluctant to get directly involved, believing a direct public confrontation would only benefit the RMT. But more rail franchises are expected to mandate fewer staff on trains to reduce costs. On Monday the Rail Safety and Standards Board and Southern were forced to reiterate the safety organisation\u2019s independence after the RMT circulated a briefing memo showing Horton\u2019s links to the RSSB and a report that discussed the economic benefits of making guards redundant. The row over the safety role of guards looks set to continue throughout the railway, underlined on Tuesday as the RMT made a fresh demand that the Merseytravel authority abandon \u201creckless\u201d plans to introduce driver-only trains on Merseyrail.",

      "body": "<p>Union leaders have said there is no prospect of industrial action on Southern ending soon, as passengers on Britain\u2019s worst-performing rail network suffered fresh disruption on the first day of a series of three-day strikes. </p> <p>Overrunning engineering works on the Brighton mainline compounded problems for commuters as rush-hour trains from the south coast were cancelled or delayed by up to an hour.</p> <p>The owners of the troubled franchise, Govia Thameslink Railway, made a fresh appeal for unions to end their dispute after a last-minute legal challenge failed, but leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers\u2019 union (RMT) said the company was \u201cpeddling lies\u201d and vowed to continue their action. Its members went on strike at midnight in their long-running dispute over proposed changes to the role of conductors. </p> <p>Southern had been intending to run about 61% of its normal timetable, before the additional problems caused by engineering work. Network Rail apologised for a breakdown that meant the railway between Gatwick and Brighton only reopened to trains at 7.20am. Rush hour at Victoria, Southern\u2019s biggest hub, was quieter than usual as trains failed to arrive, station staff said.</p> <p>Speaking on a picket line outside the station, Paul Cox, the RMT\u2019s regional organiser, claimed commuters remained sympathetic, despite the disruption. He said: \u201cBased on what I\u2019ve seen today, people taking our leaflets, they don\u2019t blame the union. This is only our 10th day of strike action and they know the reality on Southern \u2013 they see through the myth of unofficial industrial action.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Charles Horton, the chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when the RMT are going to stop striking. They should stop striking now. The reasons for the dispute have ended.\u201d</p> <p>The company claims the union told its conductor members to accept a deal last week. The RMT has advised individual members, who are otherwise threatened with dismissal, to accept new contracts that GTR is sending out to rebrand conductors as onboard supervisors. </p> <p>Horton apologised to passengers for what he accepted had been an \u201cextremely challenging period\u201d for Southern.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly sorry for passengers who have suffered months of misery as a result of the ongoing industrial action. The railway on this part of the network is going through a huge upgrade programme to tackle some of the longer-term issues which need to be resolved here in terms of providing more capacity, introducing new trains and improving the punctuality and reliability of services.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe also need to modernise the way in which our staff deliver service for customers and that is what is at the heart of this dispute here.\u201d</p> <p>The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: \u201cOnce again this morning Southern have been peddling the lie that this dispute is about who opens and closes the doors when, in fact, it\u2019s about the retention of a guaranteed second safety-critical member of staff, with the full range of safety competencies, on all current services. Despite all the spin and bluster, the company refuse to give that guarantee.\u201d </p> <p>Paul Maynard, the rail minister, said: \u201cIt is disappointing that passengers once again face needless and unjustified strike action by the RMT, after the union advised its members to accept the new roles being offered by the operator. The union leaders have continually rejected a deal that protects jobs and ensures that conductors will carry on delivering safe, accessible and more reliable rail services. I call on RMT to put passengers first and stop this damaging action.\u201d</p> <p>But at Victoria, Cox warned: \u201cThe strikes are just going to continue until they come to their senses. They\u2019ve put a hardline management in place and we\u2019ve just got to break them down.\u201d</p> <p>Some Conservative MPs have called on the government to take action, but Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is believed to be reluctant to get directly involved, believing a direct public confrontation would only benefit the RMT. But more rail franchises are expected to mandate fewer staff on trains to reduce costs. </p> <p>On Monday the Rail Safety and Standards Board and Southern were forced to reiterate the safety organisation\u2019s independence after the RMT circulated a briefing memo showing Horton\u2019s links to the RSSB and a report that discussed the economic benefits of making guards redundant.</p> <p>The row over the safety role of guards looks set to continue throughout the railway, underlined on Tuesday as the RMT made a fresh demand that the Merseytravel authority abandon \u201creckless\u201d plans to introduce driver-only trains on Merseyrail.</p>",

The upmarket British fashion brand, which does not advertise, said on Tuesday that pre-tax profit increased by a fifth to \u00a321.5m in the 28 weeks to 13 August, while revenue was up 14.4% to \u00a3259.5m. \u201cTed Baker continues to perform well across all distribution channels despite challenging trading conditions across our markets,\u201d said Ray Kelvin, the brand\u2019s founder and chief executive. The clothing and accessories retailer said revenue rose 8.5% in its UK and Europe division, to \u00a3131.2m, \u201cdespite tough trading conditions and recent events in northern Europe\u201d. Investors responded positively to the results, with shares in the company up 5%. Reaction to its new autumn/winter collection had been pleasing, the company said, but \u201cexternal factors\u201d in markets including the US meant trading continued to be difficult. The consumer backdrop was also challenging in Asia, but the company said it was positive about the long-term opportunities in the region. It added: \u201cWhile the group has had a good start to the financial year, our results for the full year will, as always, be dependent on the second half trading period. Underpinned by the strength of the Ted Baker brand, our business model and balanced distribution channels, we remain confident of delivering continued growth and development.\u201d Profit was boosted in the first half of the year by a \u00a31.2m foreign currency gain on its overseas earnings resulting from the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June. The British Retail Consortium warned on Tuesday that a weak pound was likely to drive up companies\u2019 import costs. Ted Baker said sales over the first half were helped by investment in news stores and online performance, with internet sales up almost 30% at \u00a329.7m. The company has 470 stores, concessions and outlets worldwide, with 186 in the UK. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the results were encouraging. \u201cAny aspirational fashion brand that can consistently grow sales across five continents without advertising is doing something right. \u201cThis is the company\u2019s first update since Brexit, and is a strong showing in tougher trading conditions. The second half of the year is more important to Ted Baker than the first; nonetheless, the news that sales growth remains robust provides reassurance that the group can continue to thrive, even in challenging times.\u201d",

The FTSE 100 is currently up 6.51 points at 7104.01 and although it is off its best levels and has failed to reach an intra-day high, if it ends at this level it will be a new closing record. The main risers are a mixed bunch, with overseas earners such as mining groups edging back on a touch of profit taking. But some domestic stocks are on the rise, with housebuilders lifted by comments from retirement home specialist McCarthy &amp; Stone, which said business had returned to move normal levels after the immediate slowdown after the Brexit vote. McCarthy is up nearly 8% at 175.4p, helping Barratt Developments climb 7.6p to 478.4p and Taylor Wimpey move 2.2p higher to 146p. A number of retailers have been boosted by a British Retail Consortium survey showing a rise in takings last month, albeit with a cautious outlook. Next is up 132p to \u00a346.66 while Marks &amp; Spencer has added 4.7p to 326.2p. Burberry is 43p better at \u00a315.22, also lifted by hopes the weak pound will help its overseas business. Clothing retailers were also lifted by a better than expected update from Jacamo and SimplyBe business N Brown, up 18.5% at 208.5p. It said first half profits had fallen 19.8% but it reported strong growth in online sales and was on track to meet market expectations for the full year. But Dixons Carphone has dipped 2p to 335.9p. Andy McLevey, head of dealing at stockbroker Interactive Investor said: Investors pause for breath after yesterday\u2019s gains with the FTSE 100 index now nudging higher in early trading having initially opened in the red in a narrow trading range. While sterling remains under pressure having slipped 0.6% against the dollar a trade group survey showed UK retail sales rose in September providing some respite for retail stocks. Old Mutual is the leading faller, down 3% at 202.6p ahead of a meeting with City investors later in the day. But Shore Capital\u2019s Eamonn Flanagan remained positive: Although showcasing the various parts of which group, much attention is likely to focus on the progress of and implications for the forthcoming demerger of the company into its constituent parts, namely Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Nedbank and OMAM. An adjusted NAV of 193p as at June 2016, up 8% in H1 16, forms the starting point for this process, with the stock still offering good upside potential from the current 1.1 times level.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest gym operator, Pure Gym, has abandoned plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, blaming weak investor enthusiasm for new public listings. Less than a month after announcing plans for a stock market listing, the no-frills fitness chain said current market volatility meant it was no longer in the long-term interests of the company. Humphrey Cobbold, the chief executive, said: \u201cGiven the challenging IPO market conditions, the board has decided not to proceed with a listing despite the strong interest shown by potential investors.\u201d The private equity-owned company had been hoping to raise \u00a3190m from the listing to pay off debts and fund expansion. Sources said that although the group had received sufficient orders to cover the initial public offering, the level of support was not as strong as hoped and the challenging market conditions convinced the board to pull the plug on the plans. Last month Spain\u2019s Telefonica cancelled plans to float its infrastructure business Telxius following weak investor demand for the shares. The Leeds-based Pure Gym business was founded in 2008, and following a period of rapid expansion it is now the UK\u2019s largest gym operator with 169 gyms and 820,000 members across the UK. Last year it bought the rival chain LA Fitness and struck up a partnership with Olympian Sir Chris Hoy, who is a \u201cspecial adviser and brand ambassador\u201d to Pure Gym. Cobbold said Pure Gym was still well positioned for growth: \u201cThis year alone we have opened 35 new Pure Gyms and had over 150,000 new members join. Current trading is strong giving us further confidence that we can capitalise on the significant market opportunity and encourage even more people to become fitter and healthier.\u201d Pure Gym says its members benefit from affordable fees without being tied into fixed-term contracts. Gyms are accessible at any time of day and night, and the lack of swimming pools, saunas and cafes helps to reduce the company\u2019s fixed costs.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s biggest gym operator, Pure Gym, has abandoned plans to float on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/londonstockexchangegroup\">London Stock Exchange</a>, blaming weak investor enthusiasm for new public listings. </p> <p>Less than a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/pure-gym-to-float-on-london-stock-exchange\">announcing plans for a stock market listing</a>, the no-frills fitness chain said current market volatility meant it was no longer in the long-term interests of the company.</p> <p>Humphrey Cobbold, the chief executive, said: \u201cGiven the challenging IPO market conditions, the board has decided not to proceed with a listing despite the strong interest shown by potential investors.\u201d</p> <p>The private equity-owned company had been hoping to raise \u00a3190m from the listing to pay off debts and fund expansion.</p> <p>Sources said that although the group had received sufficient orders to cover the initial public offering, the level of support was not as strong as hoped and the challenging market conditions convinced the board to pull the plug on the plans.</p> <p>Last month Spain\u2019s Telefonica <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-telefonica-telxius-ipo-cancel-idUKKCN11Z2BH\">cancelled plans to float its infrastructure business Telxius</a> following weak investor demand for the shares.</p> <p>The Leeds-based Pure Gym business was founded in 2008, and following a period of rapid expansion it is now the UK\u2019s largest gym operator with 169 gyms and 820,000 members across the UK.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/29/pure-gym-buys-la-fitness\">it bought the rival chain LA Fitness</a> and struck up a partnership with Olympian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/chrishoy\">Sir Chris Hoy</a>, who is a \u201cspecial adviser and brand ambassador\u201d to Pure Gym.</p> <p>Cobbold said Pure Gym was still well positioned for growth: \u201cThis year alone we have opened 35 new Pure Gyms and had over 150,000 new members join. Current trading is strong giving us further confidence that we can capitalise on the significant market opportunity and encourage even more people to become fitter and healthier.\u201d </p> <p>Pure Gym says its members benefit from affordable fees without being tied into fixed-term contracts. Gyms are accessible at any time of day and night, and the lack of swimming pools, saunas and cafes helps to reduce the company\u2019s fixed costs. </p>",
