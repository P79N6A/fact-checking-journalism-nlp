      "bodyText": "A bar not 300 metres from Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps. Two Russian women \u2013 they could be mother and daughter \u2013 sip aperitivi. A couple speaking Brazilian Portuguese wait for sandwiches at the counter, while a boisterous party of Chinese makes its way past the glass door, shut against the sweltering heat. Rome is as good a place as any to observe trends in global tourism, and what the Romans have experienced in recent years is a Bric [Brazil, Russia, India and China] through the window. People from countries whose languages had seldom before been heard on the streets of the Eternal City \u2013 Turkey is another \u2013 have been arriving in Rome in steadily mounting numbers. Their presence is the visible evidence of a surge in international tourism, driven by the newly acquired prosperity of the G20 giants, that has confounded predictions of moderate growth in the wake of the global financial crisis. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation, arrivals have exceeded the long-term average in each of the past five years. In 2014, international tourist traffic grew by 4.7%, which was above the top end of the range envisaged by UN forecasters. Such a flood of humanity sloshing around the planet raises many issues. The environmental challenges have been extensively debated. But there are others relating to equity and discrimination that have so far been barely touched upon. In absolute numbers, Europe is far and away the biggest destination: 588 million tourists poured across its international frontiers in 2014. But the soaring numbers are a global phenomenon. If there is such a thing as a \u201ctypical tourist\u201d, he is no longer an American in a floral shirt with a Panama on his head and a camera round his neck. He \u2013 or she \u2013 is now a member of the burgeoning middle-class of the nation that now rivals the US for global economic supremacy. UNWTO estimates that since 2012, China has been supplying the global market with more international holidaymakers than any other nation. And most of them travel not to Miami or Paris, but to other nations in Asia. Like their much-caricatured American predecessors in the postwar era, the behaviour of China\u2019s new travellers is not always sensitive to local Asian traditions and beliefs. In February, there was outrage in Thailand over evidence that a tourist, presumed to be Chinese \u2013 a video taken at the time shows him speaking Mandarin \u2013 had rung and then kicked the bells of a 14th-century temple in Chiang Mai. Not that the Chinese have a monopoly on grossly offensive behaviour. Last August, residents came out in spontaneous protest in Barcelona after three Italian tourists wandered naked through the La Barceloneta district. Last month, a British woman was arrested in Malaysia for posing naked on top of a sacred mountain. This month, it was the turn of a Bulgarian footballer on holiday in Rome, who was fined for gouging his initials into the fabric of the Colosseum. Such incidents are extreme. But they focus attention on whether tourism on the scale that the world is now experiencing is the axiomatic benefit it has traditionally been depicted to be. Does it, in fact, broaden the mind, erode people\u2019s belief in national stereotypes and introduce them to other ways of thinking? It is hard to make that case for much of the tourism to be found in Magaluf, Phuket or Canc\u00fan. But, as UNWTO and the travel trade point out, their industry does generate jobs and prosperity. \u201cOver the past years, tourism has proved to be a surprisingly strong and resilient economic activity and a fundamental contributor to the economic recovery,\u201d UNWTO\u2019s secretary-general, Taleb Rifai, said in January. \u201cThis has been true for destinations all around the world, but particularly for Europe as the region struggles to consolidate its way out of one of the worst economic periods in its history.\u201d Nowhere has that been truer than in the countries that have suffered most from the crisis in the eurozone. In the past five years, southern Europe has consistently been among the sub-regions where tourism growth has been strongest. The turning of the Arab spring into a violent and chaotic winter should ensure the bonanza continues. Holidaymakers who might otherwise have gone to Egypt and Tunisia or more adventurous destinations such as Yemen and Syria have opted for southern Europe instead. One of the more bizarre aspects of the recent crisis in Greece was the contrast between the air of impending financial apocalypse and the mobs of carefree tourists on the streets of Athens. Directly opposite parliament, on the far side of Syntagma Square, is Ermou Street. Day after day and night after night, as Greece\u2019s MPs wrangled over whether to defy the European institutions and risk exit from the euro, a torrent of holidaying humanity was pouring down Ermou Street to the main youth assembly point of Athens, Monastiraki Square. Crisis? What crisis? By the time the banks were closed down, it was all but impossible to get a hotel room in the capital. Michael Massourakis, chief economist at the Greek employers\u2019 association, SEV, said tourism in the opening four months of the years had been doing \u201cbrilliantly\u201d. After the true situation became painfully visible and long queues began to form at ATMs throughout the country, tour operators and hotel owners reported a wave of cancellations. But that will only pour yet more people into Italy, Spain and Portugal. Which is where this tidal wave of holidaymaking humanity is beginning to run up against the first flood defences. In many other parts of the world, people have begun to ask: when does good become just too much? But it is in Mediterranean Europe \u2013 paradoxically, an area exceptionally dependent on tourism \u2013 that public indignation is starting to translate into political action. So far, the most radical step has been taken in Barcelona. The city\u2019s new mayor, the anti-eviction activist Ada Colau, has imposed a 12-month moratorium on the granting on new licences for tourist accommodation. In Seville and some other Spanish cities, groups of local activists have succeeded in blocking the conversion of historic buildings into luxury hotels. The municipal authorities in Venice are considering curbing the number of tourists. One proposal would force visitors to buy an entry ticket and put a ceiling on the number of people allowed in at any one time. Venice is exceptional. Its biggest problem is made up of the 11 million or so day trippers who visit the city every year, putting an intolerable strain on Venice\u2019s services yet contributing almost nothing to its finances. The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by a new generation of super-cruiseliners, which also represent an affront to the senses, dwarfing the architecture of the city as they make their way past St Mark\u2019s Square. Venice, though, is just as susceptible as any other tourist city to a new complication. Until a few years ago, the authorities had a hold on the number of people who could stay in their city: hotels, guest houses and other forms of accommodation had to be licensed. All the authorities had to do to limit the numbers of overnight visitors was stop giving out licences. Then along came the internet, bringing with it couchsurfing and Airbnb.com. The licensing has remained. But it has become increasingly meaningless. The municipal authorities in Rome estimate that there are now 5,000 unregulated establishments offering a bed for the night. All of which argues in favour of a second plan being proposed for Venice. This would involve putting up turnstiles around St Mark\u2019s Square, the \u201cmust-see\u201d for most of the tourists who go to the city. Entry would be by means of a card. And cards would only be given out to residents, day trippers who paid and overnighters staying in registered establishments. The growing popularity of unlicensed accommodation also raises doubts about Ada Colau\u2019s initiative in Barcelona. It was a response to the virtual colonisation of the old city, the Ciutat Vella, and particularly of Barcelona\u2019s Gothic quarter, by mainly young tourists. But it is a fair bet that, like those who pack Monastiraki square at the other end of the Mediterranean, a high proportion are staying informally in other people\u2019s flats and houses. They are unlikely to be deterred by a halt in the construction of a new Four Seasons hotel, which is among the reported consequences of the ban. All of which sharpens the focus on the ethical issues cited earlier. Efforts to limit numbers of tourists are going to have to involve selection of some kind \u2013 and the easiest way to do that without inviting accusations of discrimination is to price out some tourists, but not others. In that context, young or poor becomes bad, while older and richer becomes good. If, for example, the turnstile solution were to be applied to St Mark\u2019s Square, rich Japanese CEOs in their five-star hotel on the Grand Canal would be able to drift in and out at leisure while their backpacking compatriots might have difficulty scraping together the funds for a single visit. As the curbs and bans bite, more-over, they will pose questions similar to \u2013 though less vital than \u2013 those raised by the debate over global warming. Indians and Chinese understandably balk at the idea of restrictions on the burning of carbon, arguing that the western nations were able to pollute \u2013 and prosper \u2013 freely for more than a century before discovering their environmental consciences \u2013 and deciding that still-poor nations needed to abide by them too. The same argument can be applied to tourism, and particularly the kind that brings Koreans to admire the glories of Versailles and Kenyans to marvel at the art in the Uffizi. Is it fair to deny, or restrict, access to cultural treasures that we westerners have been able to enjoy for decades? In the case of global warming, the conclusion has been that we cannot afford to be anything but unfair. And that may be the only way to ensure that historic cities and coastlines all around the world remain worth visiting by anyone.",

      "bodyText": "Formula One reaches the midway point of the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday: but the real action will not be on the track but off it as the race for ownership of the sport revs up. The title battle looks to be between just two drivers \u2013 Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. However, behind the scenes the bidding war for F1 is much less clear-cut, with the latest names to enter the fray being Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and RSE Ventures, owner of the Miami Dolphins NFL team. They have made a joint approach to buy the 35% controlling stake in Formula One\u2019s parent company owned by the private equity firm CVC. New research shows that any investor might struggle to match the investment group\u2019s return, however, even if it persuades CVC to sell. The private equity house has made more from F1 than any other owner in the sport\u2019s 65-year history, including Bambino, the family trust of its chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone. Formula One has a mighty cash-generating engine under its bonnet. The research shows that it has made more than $14bn (\u00a39bn) for its various owners \u2013 driven by the sale of shares, dividends and a $1.4bn bond issue in 1999 \u2013 since the first stake in the sport\u2019s parent company was sold in 1999 to investment bank Morgan Grenfell. CVC is a relative newcomer to the race, having bought its stake in 2006 in a leveraged buyout funded with two loans \u2013 $965.6m from its Investment Fund IV and $1.1bn from RBS. Over the past decade CVC has halved its stake to 35% and reaped a $4.4bn reward. That has given it a return on investment (ROI) of 351.8% and its remaining 35% stake controls the voting rights of F1\u2019s Jersey-based parent company, Delta Topco. This gives the stake a valuation of up to $8bn \u2013 and if CVC achieves that price, it will push ROI to over 1,000%, making it the most profitable deal in the investment house\u2019s 34-year history. Not everyone has done so well. In 2001, impressed by the huge audiences in Germany that seven-time champion Michael Schumacher was attracting to the sport, German media giant Kirch borrowed $1.6bn from three banks to acquire a 75% stake in F1. State-owned German bank BayernLB loaned nearly $1bn, with Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan each providing $300m. However, Kirch\u2019s access to F1\u2019s fortunes was restricted, as the terms of the 1999 bond issue prevented the business from paying a dividend. By the time Kirch collapsed under the weight of its debts in 2002, it had not made any money from F1 and to this day remains its only shareholder not to have generated a return from the sport. The loans from the trio of banks were secured on the Formula One stake and when Kirch went into administration they took over the shareholding. However, in the vacuum, they were unable to exercise control over the business and sued Bambino. When CVC bought F1 from the banks, it ensured that the mistake was not repeated. Buried in Delta Topco\u2019s articles of association is the revelation that CVC\u2019s shares entitle it to appoint representatives, known as \u201cI Directors\u201d, who can \u201cexercise one vote more than the total number of votes exercised by the other directors.\u201d The articles add that the purpose of this is \u201cto ensure that the I Directors will always have sufficient votes to pass a resolution of the board\u201d. It puts a huge premium on CVC\u2019s stake and those riches were unlocked with a debt refinancing which allowed dividends to be paid. Last year alone, F1 made underlying profits of $266.6m on revenue that rose 4.2% to a record $1.4bn, boosted by new races in Russia and Austria. Indeed, F1 is so profitable that it was one of the few assets retained by Lehman\u2019s estate to pay off creditors after the bank went under. CVC has already owned Formula One for double its typical holding period of five years. Last year it was in discussions about selling to media mogul John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global and broadcaster Discovery; the talks stalled and the duo invested in the electric racing series Formula E. Now Qatar and RSE are in pole position to acquire the CVC stake \u2013 but still far from the prize. CVC\u2019s co-chairman, Donald Mackenzie, recently said there was no need to sell. \u201cThere is no end date. We have 12-year funds, which we have to return the original money [to]. We have already done that. So the pressure\u2019s off. We like owning it; we don\u2019t want to sell it. There are always some people who\u2019d like to buy it: it\u2019s a very good business.\u201d For CVC it could prove to be the best.",

      "body": "<p>Formula One reaches the midway point of the season at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday: but the real action will not be on the track but off it as the race for ownership of the sport revs up.</p> <p>The title battle looks to be between just two drivers \u2013 Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. However, behind the scenes the bidding war for F1 is much less clear-cut, with the latest names to enter the fray being Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and RSE Ventures, owner of the Miami Dolphins NFL team. They have made a joint approach to buy the 35% controlling stake in Formula One\u2019s parent company owned by the private equity firm CVC.</p> <p>New research shows that any investor might struggle to match the investment group\u2019s return, however, even if it persuades CVC to sell. The private equity house has made more from F1 than any other owner in the sport\u2019s 65-year history, including Bambino, the family trust of its chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernie-ecclestone\" title=\"\">Bernie Ecclestone</a>.</p> <p>Formula One has a mighty cash-generating engine under its bonnet. The research shows that it has made more than $14bn (\u00a39bn) for its various owners \u2013 driven by the sale of shares, dividends and a $1.4bn bond issue in 1999 \u2013 since the first stake in the sport\u2019s parent company was sold in 1999 to investment bank Morgan Grenfell.</p> <p>CVC is a relative newcomer to the race, having bought its stake in 2006 in a leveraged buyout funded with two loans \u2013 $965.6m from its Investment Fund IV and $1.1bn from RBS.</p> <p>Over the past decade CVC has halved its stake to 35% and reaped a $4.4bn reward. That has given it a return on investment (ROI) of 351.8% and its remaining 35% stake controls the voting rights of F1\u2019s Jersey-based parent company, Delta Topco. This gives the stake a valuation of up to $8bn \u2013 and if CVC achieves that price, it will push ROI to over 1,000%, making it the most profitable deal in the investment house\u2019s 34-year history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1437836913746/web_F1-shareholder-returns.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not everyone has done so well. In 2001, impressed by the huge audiences in Germany that seven-time champion Michael Schumacher was attracting to the sport, German media giant Kirch borrowed $1.6bn from three banks to acquire a 75% stake in F1. State-owned German bank BayernLB loaned nearly $1bn, with Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan each providing $300m.</p> <p>However, Kirch\u2019s access to F1\u2019s fortunes was restricted, as the terms of the 1999 bond issue prevented the business from paying a dividend. By the time Kirch collapsed under the weight of its debts in 2002, it had not made any money from F1 and to this day remains its only shareholder not to have generated a return from the sport.</p> <p>The loans from the trio of banks were secured on the Formula One stake and when Kirch went into administration they took over the shareholding. However, in the vacuum, they were unable to exercise control over the business and sued Bambino.</p> <p>When CVC bought F1 from the banks, it ensured that the mistake was not repeated. Buried in Delta Topco\u2019s articles of association is the revelation that CVC\u2019s shares entitle it to appoint representatives, known as \u201cI Directors\u201d, who can \u201cexercise one vote more than the total number of votes exercised by the other directors.\u201d The articles add that the purpose of this is \u201cto ensure that the I Directors will always have sufficient votes to pass a resolution of the board\u201d.</p> <p>It puts a huge premium on CVC\u2019s stake and those riches were unlocked with a debt refinancing which allowed dividends to be paid. Last year alone, F1 made underlying profits of $266.6m on revenue that rose 4.2% to a record $1.4bn, boosted by new races in Russia and Austria. Indeed, F1 is so profitable that it was one of the few assets retained by Lehman\u2019s estate to pay off creditors after the bank went under.</p> <p>CVC has already owned Formula One for double its typical holding period of five years. Last year it was in discussions about selling to media mogul John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global and broadcaster Discovery; the talks stalled and the duo invested in the electric racing series Formula E. Now Qatar and RSE are in pole position to acquire the CVC stake \u2013 but still far from the prize.</p> <p>CVC\u2019s co-chairman, Donald Mackenzie, recently said there was no need to sell. \u201cThere is no end date. We have 12-year funds, which we have to return the original money [to]. We have already done that. So the pressure\u2019s off. We like owning it; we don\u2019t want to sell it. There are always some people who\u2019d like to buy it: it\u2019s a very good business.\u201d For CVC it could prove to be the best.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Losing your chief executive is bad enough. But for Toshiba, which has just admitted to a billion-dollar inflation of its profits since 2008, the news could get worse. In the wake of the resignation of Hisao Tanaka last week, it has restated historical profits and as a result may have to close or sell its PC business, where sales have been sagging over the past five years, and which was one source of the overstatement. The losses there could have been piling up for some time. And few would be surprised by Toshiba\u2019s likely exit from PCs, which have become a shrinking business increasingly dominated by a handful of players that extract economies of scale \u2013 and all the available profits. \u201cThe PC market in recent quarters has been a bloodbath,\u201d says Tim Coulling, senior analyst at tech consultancy Canalys. \u201cTypical mainstream PC makers expect low single-digit percent operating margins. It\u2019s razor-thin. If you get to the low-cost machines, then they\u2019re scrabbling for dollars on products.\u201d The squeeze on margins is so fierce that even Lenovo, the world\u2019s largest PC maker, tried to boost profits by bundling a software program called Superfish on some of its PCs. It said the aim was \u201cto improve the [user\u2019s] shopping experience\u201d. Instead, it exposed users to a security risk \u2013 potentially revealing bank transactions, for instance \u2013 , and had to uninstall it. It is whispered among some analysts that only the preinstallation of third-party antivirus programs \u2013 which try to get users to sign up to subscriptions \u2013 keeps some PC makers afloat at all, owing to the fees they receive from antivirus software firms. It was the PC business that triggered the current turmoil at the Japanese giant, after an internal auditor asked in late January to look at the accounts for the company\u2019s laptop business. That eventually concluded with an examination by an external panel, whose 294-page report noted \u201cinappropriate accounting\u201d in various business segments, including those \u201crelating to component transactions\u201d in the PC business. In a statement on 21 July it said that 111bn yen (\u00a3580m) of assets in the PC business in the past six financial years were \u201cunder consideration\u201d for re-evaluation. That could affect its financial results, which will be finalised by 31 August. But even in its most recent quarterly report, before any restatement, Toshiba said that its PC business recorded restructuring costs of 46bn yen in the previous three quarters, and that otherwise it \u201cwould have recorded positive operating income over three consecutive quarters\u201d. Coulling remarks that Toshiba\u2019s traditional PC market share has been \u201con the slide for a number of years\u201d. The truth may be that Toshiba\u2019s PC business was far from profitable. Even though Toshiba is the world\u2019s seventh- largest PC maker, shipping about 22m computers in 2014 according to analysis company IDC, it is struggling, along with a dwindling group of others outside the top six manufacturers \u2013 Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, Acer and Apple \u2013 to eke a profit from a sector that has deflated dramatically. The worldwide PC market has fallen back so far from its peak in 2011, when 361m units were sold, that analysts now doubt it will pass 300m units this year. That is despite the launch this Wednesday of the new version of Microsoft\u2019s Windows, which has traditionally increased PC sales. But whereas 20 years ago Windows 95 was launched amid midnight store openings, a Rolling Stones-themed ad blitz and a Bill Gates-led roadshow, this time it will happen silently. Millions of PCs will be updated for free via the internet. Neither analysts nor the chipmaker Intel, which provides the essential chips for PCs, expects a significant rise in sales. The PC business is shrinking because the market is saturated, and has moved to a replacement phase where sales come only from switching old PCs with new models. With about 1.5bn PCs in use around the world, split roughly half-and-half between businesses and consumers, people now tend to spend money on smartphones or tablets, and delay replacing their PC. As sales have dropped, the big six have been increasing dominance through using their scale to buy components more cheaply and dominate sales to retailers and businesses. Since 2011, their share of the PC market has grown from 60% to 71%. More importantly, the \u201cothers\u201d in the business have seen the total number of PCs they ship more than halve, from 36m per quarter in mid-2011 to 17.4m in the quarter from April to June. And as that tide goes out, the minnows are increasingly exposed. As Coulling points out, they are being squeezed for profit because the success of Windows has brought with it the commoditisation of PCs, and constantly falling prices. Since 2010 the world average selling price for a PC from the big five Windows PC makers \u2013 excluding Apple \u2013 has dropped from $600 to $500, and dragged profits down with it. Companies and consumers are generally unwilling to splash out $1,000 or more on ultrathin laptops, touchscreen models, or devices that can double up as PCs or tablets, which yield more profit. The odd one out is Apple, which commands premium prices for its computers \u2013 averaging over $1,200 (\u00a3775) for more than a decade \u2013 and yet has seen its market share rise steadily for 10 years, even while the rest of the market has commoditised. Why? \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just a hardware player. They make the hardware and have their own operating system, so you either buy a Mac or don\u2019t,\u201d says Coulling. Some analysts estimate Apple\u2019s operating margin on its Macs at more than 15% \u2013 which suggests it grabs more than half of all the profits in the whole PC industry. The pressure on the rest has told in different ways. Dell went private in September 2013 as it tried to focus more on software and services and play down its PC business, which is still the world\u2019s third largest. Japan\u2019s Sony withdrew from PCs altogether in 2014, unable to make its well-regarded but expensive Vaio line profitable amid falling sales. Samsung withdrew from Europe last autumn, and now concentrates on South Korea, the US, Brazil and China, while Fujitsu concentrates on Japan and Germany. Loren Loverde, senior PC analyst at IDC, says that beyond Samsung and Fujitsu, the two companies ranking below Toshiba, \u201cmost vendors are specialised in a few countries, or specific vertical [market], and volume is more volatile. They certainly feel the pressure from the large players.\u201d With the dollar strong, and the market still falling, Toshiba\u2019s exit might only be a matter of time. But that still leaves the others to compete for its tiny share. So it looks bleak for the \u201cothers\u201d? \u201cYes,\u201d says Canalys\u2019s Coulling. \u201cThat\u2019s a fairly widely held view within the industry.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s major banks are preparing to report their progress in the first six months of the year amid expectations that they will be hit by more bills for payment protection insurance (PPI) and will need to top up the amount they have set aside for fines and other penalties. Two of the banks that will be subject to particular scrutiny are Barclays and Standard Chartered \u2013 which are both in the middle of boardroom upheaval. Barclays is without a chief executive after Antony Jenkins was ousted two weeks ago and with chairman John McFarlane temporarily taking the helm, analysts are on alert for changes to the strategy. At Standard Chartered, the former investment banker Bill Winters will make his first presentation since replacing Peter Sands in June. Analysts are awaiting Winters\u2019s views on the need for a cash call. Bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland face their own issues. Lloyds is expected to set aside another \u00a31bn provision for PPI mis-selling. RBS is likely to add to the \u00a32bn it has already set aside to cover penalties for the way it packaged up mortgage bonds before the financial crisis. HSBC\u2019s bosses will be braced for questions about whether George Osborne has done enough to stop them shifting the bank\u2019s headquarters away from London, where it has been based since 1992. The chancellor used his first fully Conservative budget earlier this month to soften the bank levy on balance sheets which HSBC had opposed and to introduce a new 8% tax on bank profits. The so-called challenger banks now face a hit. TSB last week called for the tax to kick in at \u00a3250m rather than \u00a325m, while Virgin Money, which publishes its figures on Tuesday, will face questions about the implications of the new tax on its prospects. Wednesday: Barclays The sudden ousting of Jenkins and the installation of new chairman McFarlane at the helm means that expectations of drastic cost-cutting measures, job losses and an overhaul of the investment bank have been raised in advance of the half-year numbers on Wednesday. When he stepped into the top role, albeit temporarily, McFarlane insisted that a new strategy is not being envisaged. Even so, he said there would be a new plan for the investment bank, which had been the focus of cost-cutting under Jenkins as he responded to pressure to rein in big bonuses. McFarlane has told staff he aims to double the Barclays share price in three years as he puts renewed focus on growth and more aggression into lending on credit cards and mortgages. Analysts may seek clues as to the risks this will entail: \u201cWe expect the executive chairman to focus on execution rather than a radical strategy rethink,\u201d said analysts at Morgan Stanley. Thursday: RBS The 79% taxpayer-owned bank has not turned in a full-year profit since its \u00a345bn bailout in 2008 and the share price has remained stubbornly below the 502p average price at which the government breaks even on its stake. However, the chancellor has signalled that he is ready to start selling off the shares, even at a loss. That symbolic moment could come after the results, which are likely to show that making a profit is still tough. Some analysts are pencilling in a \u201csmall net profit\u201d. Ross McEwan, the chief executive, has warned that the bank still faces a turbulent ride while it awaits the outcome of a long-running case brought by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in the US about the way it packaged up mortgage bonds before the 2007 crisis. While the bank has set aside \u00a32bn, there have been estimates that the bill could be at least three times that sum. Friday: Lloyds Banking Group Payment protection insurance provisions are once again likely to weigh down Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s half-year profits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley are forecasting that the cost of settling the PPI scandal will rise by another \u00a31bn \u2013 implying that the total bill will break through \u00a313bn. In its first-quarter results, Lloyds said that complaint volumes were 11% down on the same time last year but still running slightly higher than expected \u2013 so the amount set aside to pay out compensation and the associated administrative costs could rise again. \u201cOur remaining \u00a31.7bn provision continues to represent the group\u2019s best estimate of total future costs but a number of risks and uncertainties remain, in particular the total expected future complaint volumes,\u201d the bank said three months ago. The bank\u2019s boss, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, will provide an update on his aim of making Lloyds a \u201cnormal\u201d bank. The government\u2019s stake, which stood at 43% following the bank bailouts in 2008, has now dropped to below 15%. Osborne has promised a sweetened retail offering of the shares \u2013 making them attractive to small investors \u2013 but this seems unlikely until after the full-year results in February. Monday 3 August: HSBC Britain\u2019s biggest bank announced plans to axe 25,000 jobs from its global workforce of 257,000 in June to cut costs and bolster returns to shareholders. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, has said a decision on whether to remain headquartered in the UK will not be made until the end of the year, but that won\u2019t stop speculation about whether a move back to Hong Kong is still on the agenda. \u201cThis could be HSBC\u2019s final set of numbers before its potential \u2018escape\u2019 from the UK is resolved. For the sake of its shareholders, we certainly hope so,\u201d said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec. The bank could also say whether the Midland name will be revived in the UK as HSBC responds to the \u201cringfencing rules\u201d recommended by Sir John Vickers which mean retail bank operations must be run separately from riskier investment banking business. HSBC is setting up a new HQ for its high street bank in Birmingham, and it is likely to be renamed. The bank will unveil its results at 5am as HSBC is putting out its numbers at lunchtime in Hong Kong rather than waiting for the stock market there to close. Despite the plunge in the Chinese stock market and fears of a slowdown in the economy, analysts expect HSBC to report strong progress in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. 5 August: Standard Chartered This will be the first public appearance by the new boss Winters. He took over in June from Sands, who had been one of the few bank bosses to survive the 2008 crisis. Winters, a former investment banker, is facing questions about whether the emerging markets-focused bank has enough capital, whether it needs a cash call on investors and how it might return to growth. Analysts at Barclays said: \u201cThe new CEO\u2019s initial priority must be restoring confidence in the balance sheet and we continue to see a $5bn provision write down and $5bn (\u00a33bn) capital raise as likely.\u201d The analysts do not expect the results \u201cto be particularly encouraging with revenues likely to still be under pressure, credit quality another area of concern and little capital progression likely\u201d. \u201cAny comments on the future size, shape and returns of the business are likely to be more important than performance,\u201d they added.",

The chancellor used his first fully Conservative budget earlier this month to soften the bank levy on balance sheets which HSBC had opposed and to introduce a new 8% tax on bank profits.

Even so, he said there would be a new plan for the investment bank, which had been the focus of cost-cutting under Jenkins as he responded to pressure to rein in big bonuses.</p> <p>McFarlane has told staff he aims to double the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/barclays-john-mcfarlane-board-double-share-price-three-years\" title=\"\">Barclays share price in three years</a> as he puts renewed focus on growth and more aggression into lending on credit cards and mortgages.

The senior executive of a new startup bank is attempting to demonstrate the difference between the incumbent high street banks (the boring Y-fronts) and the \u201cspeed not comfort\u201d approach of Atom, a new digital operation which is planning to open its virtual doors later this year. Stewart Bromley, who has the suitably trendy title of director of people and customer experience, waved both pairs of pants at a recent digital bootcamp to also make the point that there is a market for both. He is part of a team assembled by Anthony Thomson, best known for getting Metro Bank off the ground five years ago, to start a new bank from scratch. There will no branches and it will operate entirely through an app on a smartphone. Some \u00a325m has been ploughed in by a number of heavyweight investors, including star City fund manager Neil Woodford, and the former boss of HSBC\u2019s First Direct, Mark Mullen, has been recruited as chief executive. Durham city council, which owns Atom\u2019s low-rise office on the edge of the city, will also end up with a stake because the bank is paying its \u00a3113,825 rent until January 2017 by handing over 150,000 shares. Mullen and his team \u2013 including former civil servant Edward Twiddy and tech wizards who learned their programming skills in the gaming industry \u2013 have painted the council\u2019s magnolia walls in bright colours to help Atom stand out from the traditional high street players. Selfies of the staff are hung in the entrance hall to reflect the family feel that Mullen hopes to create. Mullen, who spent 20 years at HSBC before quitting last year, is aiming to do to banking what Uber is doing to the taxi industry. \u201cI personally believe the banking industry is ripe for disruption. It\u2019s opaque, or worse than opaque. It\u2019s deliberately confusing.\u201d Atom is one of a number of digital banking startups \u2013 others include Starling and Mondo \u2013 but Atom is ahead of its rivals because it has already been granted a banking licence by the Bank of England. The race to launch a new generation of digital banks comes 15 years after Prudential and Halifax launched ambitious internet-based banks Egg and Intelligent Finance \u2013 both of which have largely disappeared without trace. Just as Egg and IF did back in 2000, Atom is chasing the tech-savvy. \u201cIt would be really easy to say it is the young, hip and trendy. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s a mindset. It\u2019s about people\u2019s attitude to banks and technology,\u201d says Mullen. Bromley believes Atom\u2019s customers will prefer self-service and will relate to Atom\u2019s six values \u2013 respectful, sharing, pioneering, courageous, energetic and joyful. Joyful. Really? Marketing director Lisa Wood \u2013 also hired from First Direct \u2013 reckons postcards handwritten by Atom staff and sent to those who register on the website will do the trick. Bromley hopes the app will put a smile on customers\u2019 faces. How it will do that is not yet clear, as the team are currently keeping the software under wraps. Instead they rattle on about three-dimensional and four-dimensional features and \u201cnudges\u201d to customers. It\u2019s all about sharing aggregated customer information in the cloud. Mullen describes the app as an \u201cever-present companion\u201d. Details of the product range are also sketchy. Decisions are still being made on whether there will be a fee for using the app, and whether customers might be told how much profit was being generated in their dealings with Atom. At a time when the Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the industry, Mullen\u2019s pricing strategy is intended to be very different to the cross-subsidies used by the big banks to offer free banking to those customers in credit. \u201cI have a bit of an objection to cross-subsidising the way other people use their bank,\u201d says Mullen. While Atom is currently racking up losses, its five-year business plan presented to the Bank of England includes aspirations for a stock market flotation. Even though a startup like Atom might seem a long way from turning a profit, George Osborne\u2019s new 8% surcharge on bank profits is still a topic for debate. Twiddy, who is a former Treasury man, believes that Osborne has targeted regulated banks rather than other unregulated startups like peer-to-peer lenders and crowdfunders, which are not subject to the new tax, which kicks in when profits hit \u00a325m. Mullen is not saying when Atom hopes to reach that level, but he will be making a start in the autumn.",
