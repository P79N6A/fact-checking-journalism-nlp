      "bodyText": "Britain's economy will enjoy \"decent but unspectacular growth\" with wages rising in real terms for the first time in six years and low inflation allowing the Bank of England to avoid raising interest rates before next year's general election, according to a group of economic forecasters. The EY Item Club has raised its growth forecast for 2014 to 2.9% from an earlier forecast of 2.7%. That is in line with the International Monetary Fund's forecast but above the 2.7% growth predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in last month's budget. Item is expecting weaker growth of 2.3% in 2015. Low inflation will allow the Bank of England to keep rates on hold at their historic low of 0.5% until the third quarter of next year, the group said. Members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee have, however, said in recent weeks that the first rise in rates will most likely come earlier, in spring next year. \"The economic recovery is becoming more entrenched and better balanced. Although consumer spending has continued to play the biggest role in driving growth, investment is increasingly making its presence felt,\" the economists said in their spring forecast. \"While the UK economy is not completely out of the woods, 2014 should see a year of decent, if not spectacular, growth.\" However, in a blow to the chancellor George Osborne, the forecasters cast doubt on whether government spending cuts still to come were \"really deliverable\", with the UK still only halfway through planned austerity. \"The squeeze on spending over the next few years is forecast by the OBR to take government consumption of goods and services to its smallest share of GDP since at least 1948. \"In the context of an ageing population and public demands for better public services, this will be very difficult to achieve.\" Britain can look forward to rising living standards this year, the report suggested, with wage growth of 1.7% finally outpacing inflation of 1.6% after six years of falling real wages. The forecasters predicted a 9.1% rise in business investment this year and 9.5% next year, boosted by the low cost of capital, a large amount of cash in company coffers, and confidence in company boardrooms. \"We are set for a long period of low inflation as pressures from commodity prices and the labour market \u2013 traditionally the two main suspects in the UK inflation drama \u2013 remain largely absent,\" said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to Item. Inflation has been falling over recent months and in February hit 1.7%, the lowest level in more than four and a half years and below the Bank of England's 2% target. City analysts said the latest official data, to be published on Tuesday, is likely to show that food, petrol, and airfares pushed annual inflation lower still in March to 1.5%. The report suggested that an improving jobs market would be central to the rosier economic outlook. Wage inflation would be kept under control by a swelling workforce buoyed by people working for longer and coming off welfare and into work. The chancellor's belief that the UK could achieve the highest employment rate in the G7 is a reasonable one, it said.",

      "bodyText": "Sellers are attempting to cash in on a buoyant housing market by raising average asking prices in some London boroughs by more than 7% in a month, according to property website Rightmove. Across the country average asking prices rose 2.6% in April, and were 7.3% higher than this time last year \u2013 the biggest annual rise since October 2007, before the credit crunch took hold, according to the website's monthly figures. In the north London borough of Brent, where lender Nationwide recently reported that sale prices had risen by almost a third over the past year, Rightmove said new asking prices have increased by 7.9% in a month. In neighbouring Camden, asking prices have risen by 7.5% since mid-March, and in nearby Harringey they are up by 7.1%. The website also reported a strong ripple effect pushing asking prices to new highs across the south of the country. Economic forecasters at Ernst &amp; Young meanwhile have predicted house prices of 7% nationally this year will be repeated in 2015, but discounted fears of the housing market heading for a bubble. Arguing that a revival in house building and tighter lending criteria would keep a lid on prices outside London, the E&amp;Y Item Club predicted UK house price rises would moderate to 4.2% in 2016. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to Item, said: \"The housing market is not experiencing a typical debt-fuelled recovery. Gross mortgage lending has increased but this has largely been financed by an increase in repayments by existing borrowers. \"New mortgage lending remains at rock bottom while government initiatives such as the Help to Buy schemes will be having little impact on prices in London, where activity is fuelled by cash rather than mortgage borrowing.\" The Rightmove figures showed that in Greater London, sellers are asking 15.9% more for homes than they were last April \u2013 at an average of more than \u00a3572,000 \u2013 and asking prices in and around the capital are now 41% higher than in 2007 \u2013 a rise of more than \u00a3168,000 on the average property. But in the north and in Wales sellers are still expecting less: in the north-west of England, asking prices remain 8.8% less than their 2007 peak, despite a 2% year-on-year increase, while in Wales and Yorkshire they are still more than 7% below previous highs. Latest figures from rival website Zoopla showed that 27% of properties on sale in March had been reduced in price, and that the average discount stood at 6.25%, or \u00a320,782. In Wakefield 42% of properties on the market had seen price cuts, and even in London, where activity levels have been high, 15% of asking prices had been reduced. However, in the hottest parts of the market, estate agents are reporting frenzied bidding by would-be buyers, with some properties attracting multiple bids over the asking price. Rightmove's director, Miles Shipside, said: \"Supply in much of the south is ridiculously tight, with for sale board blackspots in many popular locations within easy commuting distance of London,\" he said. \"There are vicious circles where there is so little property for sale that few local home-owners are willing to come to market to trade up, exacerbating the shortages and boosting sellers' pricing power.\" The monthly figures are compiled using the asking prices of properties which are newly listed with estate agents, and do not reflect the prices achieved by sellers. However, Shipside said he did not expect changes to rules around mortgage lending which are due to come into force this month to calm the market. The rules, which will force banks and building societies to undertake tougher affordability checks before they grant loans, may reduce some borrowers' buying power, but Shipside said the imbalance between supply and demand was likely to support prices. \"Whilst a higher percentage of borderline mortgage applications will be weeded out, the overall numbers of those who are mortgage-worthy and wish to borrow and buy, combined with lenders who are flushed with funds, is still likely to result in increased buyer demand,\" he said. \"It is encouraging that more home-owners are selling, increasing churn and supply and helping to moderate house price growth. However, because we should have built more in the past and are still not planning to build enough, prices will continue to rise in popular locations, further stretching affordability.\"",

    "webTitle": "Co-op risks tighter control by banks without reform, warns Lord Myners", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The City grandee brought in to reform the crisis-stricken Co-operative Group fears his plan will be rejected unless the owners of the loss-making chain of supermarkets, pharmacies and funeral homes understand the serious need for a radical overhaul of the way it is run. Lord Myners resigned from the Co-op board last Wednesday as opposition mounted against his initial proposal to scrap the current boardroom. He warned that the banks, which Co-op owes \u00a31.2bn, could take a tougher stance without change. The group, which is being rocked by warring factions over the proposed shakeup, is poised to report at least \u00a32bn of losses on Thursday. Its financial results have been delayed twice following the resignation of chief executive Euan Sutherland after details of his \u00a36.6m two-year pay deal were leaked to the Observer. Myners' proposals are to be voted on at the annual meeting of Co-op's owner-members next month, when he will step down as the only independent director on the board, which contains 20 members from the co-operative movement. Appointed only in December following the drugs scandal surrounding the former Co-operative Bank chairman Paul Flowers, Myners said: \"I think the possibility of my proposals being accepted by the membership in May is quite low.\" The comments were made before the publication of a comment piece in the Guardian in which he responds to critics who have accused him of trying to impose \"Plc-style\" reforms to the UK's biggest mutual. Myners argues that he is \"a strong supporter of co-operatives and mutuality\" but the reforms are needed in the long term. \"[Otherwise] the banks could conclude that they have to tighten their grip on the Co-op and the government would probably accept that it would have to launch a full inquiry into the way the Co-op Group has been run over several years. \"I see these as being very real possibilities if the Co-operative Group does not reform its governance and become more business-like while remaining true to co-operative values and principles.\" Myners was chairman of Guardian Media Group before becoming City minister in 2008 during the banking crisis. When he hastily published an outline of his ideas in the days after Sutherland's resignation, Myners warned that the Co-op risked running out of money unless it reformed. A number of investigations \u2013 including by City regulators \u2013 are under way into what went wrong at its bank, which is just 30% owned by the group after it had to be rescued last year. The group hired former civil servant Sir Christopher Kelly to investigate and he is expected to publish a damning report shortly. The bank has also warned that the wider group's problems mean it might not pay the \u00a3263m it owes the banks as its share of emergency fundraisings. The crisis is expected to be discussed by the Treasury select committee which has called Myners to give evidence next month. His resignation followed remarks by Patrick Gray, president of the largest independent co-op, the Midcounties, who said his board had voted against the proposals. Gray had written a comment piece for the Guardian's website a week earlier in which he criticised Myners, triggering the Labour peer's decision to write his own rebuttal. Myners argues: \"The Co-operative Group now confronts profound financial and strategic challenges. It urgently needs governance that is fit for purpose. The consequences of not addressing this do not bear contemplation by those who care about the group or for those who depend upon it, like our 90,000 colleagues. \"I represent no one except common sense. For this reason, it is a matter of deep regret that my proposals cannot be voted upon by the entire membership.\" The votes at the annual meeting will be cast by representatives of the regional boards \u2013 which represent up to eight million members and control 78% of the votes \u2013 and independent societies such as Midcounties, which together control the rest. The vacated chief executive role is being filled by Richard Pennycook, who is also receiving the contentious retention pay packages that bolstered Sutherland's pay along with that of seven others. Pennycook is expected to become chief operating officer once a successor is found. Myners added that Ben Reid, boss of the Midcounties, had made clear his willingness to serve as group chief executive if asked, which the peer signalled would probably require Midcounties to merge into the Co-operative Group. Reid would not respond to Myners' comments, but a spokesman for Midcounties said: \"Our board fundamentally believes in strong, independent, regional societies. It has absolutely no aspirations to merge with the Co-op Group.\" Myners would not comment on the reason for his resignation but said he was \"saddened\" by the extent of opposition that emerged even before he had published his final report.",

      "bodyText": "Looking back, it was easy to see that the crash was coming. There had been too much cheap money. Debt had exploded. Speculation was rife. The gap between rich and poor had widened. Welfare spending had risen. The financial system was so stretched that even a modest tightening of policy was enough to make it impossible for over-borrowed debtors to service their debts. The US in 2007? No, this was imperial Rome during the reign of Tiberius in AD33. It was not the first documented financial crisis; that dubious accolade goes to the states of the Delian League in ancient Greece, which defaulted on their debts following a naval blockade by Sparta. But a time traveller would see remarkable similarities between the unfolding of the Roman crisis of almost two millennia ago and the 2007-09 crash. The calling in of loans led to a credit crunch. Debtors went to the wall. Prices fell. The emperor arranged for the most heavily indebted to get interest-free loans for three years. A \"bad bank\" was set up. Tiberius financed his own version of quantitative easing, not by selling imperial bonds but by confiscating wealthy Romans' assets. All of this is documented in an excellent new book by Bob Swarup called Money Mania*, which looks at booms, panics and busts down the ages. His message is that nothing is really new. Put together people, credit and structural fragility and you create the perfect conditions for a crisis. Swarup's book comes out at an opportune moment. The past week has seen a shudder pass through stock markets as investors have taken a closer look at some of the more highly valued technology stocks. Easter traditionally marks the start of the British house-buying season, and this year's begins with sales at a six-year high and prices up almost 10% on a year ago. The appetite for risk was highlighted by the demand for the five-year bonds issued by the Greek government. Inevitably, the talk is of bubbles about to pop, of a new speculative mania, of lessons not learnt. This talk is a bit premature but the warning signs are there. History suggests that certain conditions have to be in place for a crisis to develop. The first is that a decent period of time has to elapse after the previous crash. When bubbles burst, a cavalier approach to risk is replaced, almost instantaneously, by risk aversion. It takes time for those burned by their losses to forget. In the UK, for example, there was a property boom in the early 1970s, another in the late 1980s and a third in the early to mid 2000s. A 15-year gap is the norm. The second condition is a sustained period of solid growth, by the end of which individuals convince themselves that the good times will go on and on. Accordingly, the property boom of the early 1970s came after 25 years of strong growth; the overheated market in the late 1980s stemmed from a belief that Thatcher's reforms had eradicated all the economy's problems; that in the 2000s came amid a period of uninterrupted growth lasting more than 60 quarters. A third crucial factor is belief in those running the show. The runup to the Great Recession of 2007-09 was the heyday of independent central banks, which preened themselves on their ability to deliver solid non-inflationary growth. There were a few, such as Bill White at the Bank for International Settlements, who warned that bubbles could develop in low-inflationary periods, but they were ignored. The public assumed that central banks were fully in control \u2013 a misplaced confidence as it turned out. Central banks, no matter how clever, cannot prevent crises. The establishment of the independent Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 did not prevent the tulip mania of the 1630s; the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 was followed a quarter of a century later by the South Sea Bubble. The Wall Street Crash occurred 16 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve. Whip these three ingredients together and you have the recipe for a crisis. As Swarup notes, humans don't like to stand still. \"Growth is a strong psychological impetus, and if we are not growing in our lives in some way, we feel trapped and miserable.\" So a recent period of growth plus confidence in policymakers allows us to extrapolate the past into the future, even if that means ignoring inconvenient facts. But more is needed to create the perfect bubble dish. Crises do not occur unless there is an abundance of credit to allow debt to build up and to permit speculators to take ever bigger bets. When economies become saturated with debt, as they were in the mid-2000s, it is time to prepare for the worst. That is certainly the case if complex financial systems are badly flawed. Nobody really understood what the web of banks, hedge funds and shadow banks were up to as they traded credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations. Regulators certainly didn't. These two final ingredients matter. In the absence of credit and a functioning framework, economies grow only very slowly, as they did in the 1,000 years after the Roman empire collapsed. But too much debt plus poorly managed and regulated financial systems will, sooner or later, lead to trouble. The fact that we are still bubble conscious suggests that the right conditions for a bubble do not yet exist. Insufficient time has passed. Investors are able to differentiate between tech companies that are not making profits and firms in the real economy that do have a track record of earnings growth. In the UK as a whole, house prices have yet to return to their pre-crisis peak, although they have already done so in London. Regulation is still being tightened as policymakers seek to avoid the mistakes of the past. The eurozone is only just emerging from a triple-dip recession and Britain's national output is still lower than it was six years ago. A much longer period of expansion will, on past form, be necessary for the onset of amnesia. All that said, there are a couple of reasons to beware. One is that central banks could leave policy too loose for too long. Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, is one analyst cautioning that if the Fed leaves policy as loose as forecasts suggest, it could create new asset bubbles. The other is that in the age of Facebook and Twitter, only \"now\" matters. If we have lost our capacity to remember, trouble may come sooner than we think. *Money Mania: Bob Swarup; Bloomsbury",

      "bodyText": "With only three days until Christmas in 2003, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mazzella was under pressure to get to his family home in Fontenay-le-Comte, 300 miles outside Paris \u2013 but all the trains were full. After eventually getting a lift from his sister, he noticed most of the cars on the road were empty but for the driver. This was a vast inefficiency in his eyes \u2013 but one that got him thinking. \"The idea was to organise all the available seats in cars just like we organise all the available seats in planes and trains, with a real search engine, and this did not exist. There was only demand and no offer and organised in a very weird way in that you would have neighbours who would share a ride but you did not know where they were going and when,\" he says. Mazzella's observation that day was the seed for the car-sharing company BlaBlaCar, and it has grown to the point at which the president of SNCF, the French national railway, identified it as a competitor last year. The Paris-based company has six million members in a dozen countries, linking drivers with passengers who can buy seats. According to the company, a million people use its website every month, keying in details of where they want to go and when, and getting a list of drivers heading to the same destination, with their journey history and a price \u2013 which can be a fraction of a ticket on public transport. Mazzella says the early years were marked by frustration as BlaBlaCar struggled to reach a critical mass of drivers and passengers who could meet each others' demands. \"You would have people offering a ride from Paris to Lyon on a Thursday at 6pm and people looking for a ride from Montpellier to Bordeaux on a Monday at 2pm,\" he says. The turning point came in 2007 when a series of strikes crippled the French transport system. A well-timed press release to say BlaBlaCar was still open for business attracted huge media attention. Nicolas Brusson, one of the three co-founders with Mazzella and Francis Nappez, says the influx of users meant that \"suddenly the service worked\". For the first time, people were saying things about the service such as \"useful, interesting, low-cost, efficient\". After that leap forward, the business continued to grow, opening an office in 2009 and hiring its first employee. Then when the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted in April 2010, throwing gigantic quantities of ash into the air and causing massive disruption to air travel, prices on BlaBlaCar skyrocketed. With a trip from Madrid to Paris costing \u20ac850 (\u00a3706), the founders decided to cap prices in an attempt to retain the spirit of the \"sharing economy\". That decision also means drivers do not pay tax on the income as the price cap ensures they do not make a profit. In a similar vein, their insurance is not affected as it is not deemed a commercial venture. These days when drivers offer a ride, an online calculator suggests the price with an upper limit \u2013 it costs around \u00a335 to go from London to Edinburgh, for instance. Drivers can ask for more but the maximum is \u00a346. Profiles of members show how much experience they have of the service, meaning those with more \u2013 known as \"ambassadors\" \u2013 attract more ride shares and, importantly, each user's profile includes a \"BlaBla\" measurement, which indicates how much they are willing to chat during a trip. In France, the company charges a commission of 11% of the journey price \u2013 something that will begin in the UK this year, where at the moment there are no charges. Recent expansion to Russia and Ukraine brings to 12 the number of countries where BlaBlaCar operates, the others being the UK, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, Poland and Germany. In January 2012, $10m (\u00a36m) was raised in a venture round led by Accel Partners. \"We are learning to use our resources in a smarter way. Driving alone in your car for 300 miles has always been a nonsense, it is an economical and an ecological nonsense and it is boring,\" says Mazzella. \"It was just a business model from the automobile industry: they had one product \u2013 the Ford T [the first affordable car] was released with four seats \u2013 and it has always been the same product. They sold it to families at the beginning, then to the dad, the mum, the son. When [children] are 18, they will get one. \"It was always a social way of transport [but] then it became individual cars. Now cars when they are finished have one seat which is used and three [that] are not \u2013 it is a nonsense.\" He says that car advertisements typically have one driver. \"The message that is sent is that you can have one for your weekends, one for your weekdays \u2013 the entire auto industry is getting us to buy cars all the time. \"Half the TV ads are for the new car industry and it is 10% of the French domestic product. Cars spend 95% of their time not moving and the 5% of their time when they are moving, there is one person in it.\" Students, artists, civil servants and teachers in their late 20s were the typical users at the outset but this has broadened as BlaBlaCar has grown, according to Mazzella. The company may expand into Asia, the US and Latin America and the founders cite trains and buses as the competition, not similar services. BlaBlaCar is often compared to Airbnb, the six-year-old accommodation site that was recently reported to be in talks to raise capital in a deal valuing it at $10bn.

      "body": "<p>With only three days until Christmas in 2003, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mazzella was under pressure to get to his family home in Fontenay-le-Comte, 300 miles outside Paris \u2013 but all the trains were full.</p> <p>After eventually getting a lift from his sister, he noticed most of the cars on the road were empty but for the driver. This was a vast inefficiency in his eyes \u2013 but one that got him thinking.</p> <p>\"The idea was to organise all the available seats in cars just like we organise all the available seats in planes and trains, with a real search engine, and this did not exist. There was only demand and no offer and organised in a very weird way in that you would have neighbours who would share a ride but you did not know where they were going and when,\" he says.</p> <p>Mazzella's observation that day was the seed for the car-sharing company BlaBlaCar, and it has grown to the point at which the president of SNCF, the French national railway, identified it as a competitor last year.</p> <p>The Paris-based company has six million members in a dozen countries, linking drivers with passengers who can buy seats. According to the company, a million people use its website every month, keying in details of where they want to go and when, and getting a list of drivers heading to the same destination, with their journey history and a price \u2013 which can be a fraction of a ticket on public transport.</p> <p>Mazzella says the early years were marked by frustration as BlaBlaCar struggled to reach a critical mass of drivers and passengers who could meet each others' demands.</p> <p>\"You would have people offering a ride from Paris to Lyon on a Thursday at 6pm and people looking for a ride from Montpellier to Bordeaux on a Monday at 2pm,\" he says.</p> <p>The turning point came in 2007 when a series of strikes crippled the French transport system. A well-timed press release to say BlaBlaCar was still open for business attracted huge media attention.</p> <p>Nicolas Brusson, one of the three co-founders with Mazzella and Francis Nappez, says the influx of users meant that \"suddenly the service worked\". For the first time, people were saying things about the service such as \"useful, interesting, low-cost, efficient\".</p> <p>After that leap forward, the business continued to grow, opening an office in 2009 and hiring its first employee. Then when the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted in April 2010, throwing gigantic quantities of ash into the air and causing massive disruption to air travel, prices on BlaBlaCar skyrocketed. With a trip from Madrid to Paris costing \u20ac850 (\u00a3706), the founders decided to cap prices in an attempt to retain the spirit of the \"sharing economy\".</p> <p>That decision also means drivers do not pay tax on the income as the price cap ensures they do not make a profit. In a similar vein, their insurance is not affected as it is not deemed a commercial venture.</p> <p>These days when drivers offer a ride, an online calculator suggests the price with an upper limit \u2013 it costs around \u00a335 to go from London to Edinburgh, for instance. Drivers can ask for more but the maximum is \u00a346.</p> <p>Profiles of members show how much experience they have of the service, meaning those with more \u2013 known as \"ambassadors\" \u2013 attract more ride shares and, importantly, each user's profile includes a \"BlaBla\" measurement, which indicates how much they are willing to chat during a trip.</p> <p>In France, the company charges a commission of 11% of the journey price \u2013 something that will begin in the UK this year, where at the moment there are no charges. Recent expansion to Russia and Ukraine brings to 12 the number of countries where BlaBlaCar operates, the others being the UK, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, Poland and Germany.</p> <p>In January 2012, $10m (\u00a36m) was raised in a venture round led by Accel Partners.</p> <p>\"We are learning to use our resources in a smarter way. Driving alone in your car for 300 miles has always been a nonsense, it is an economical and an ecological nonsense and it is boring,\" says Mazzella.</p> <p>\"It was just a business model from the automobile industry: they had one product \u2013 the Ford T [the first affordable car] was released with four seats \u2013 and it has always been the same product. They sold it to families at the beginning, then to the dad, the mum, the son. When [children] are 18, they will get one.</p> <p>\"It was always a social way of transport [but] then it became individual cars. Now cars when they are finished have one seat which is used and three [that] are not \u2013 it is a nonsense.\"</p> <p>He says that car advertisements typically have one driver. \"The message that is sent is that you can have one for your weekends, one for your weekdays \u2013 the entire auto industry is getting us to buy cars all the time.</p> <p>\"Half the TV ads are for the new car industry and it is 10% of the French domestic product. Cars spend 95% of their time not moving and the 5% of their time when they are moving, there is one person in it.\"</p> <p>Students, artists, civil servants and teachers in their late 20s were the typical users at the outset but this has broadened as BlaBlaCar has grown, according to Mazzella.</p> <p>The company may expand into Asia, the US and Latin America and the founders cite trains and buses as the competition, not similar services. BlaBlaCar is often compared to Airbnb, the six-year-old accommodation site that was recently reported to be in talks to raise capital in a deal valuing it at $10bn.</p> <p>Brusson predicts that Europe is coming to the end of an era. \"Every state except Germany is broke, so it is not like we are going to build new roads and rail networks. We need to be smarter about the way we consume and leverage the assets that we have already and make better use [of them],\" he says. \"I think we are entering an era of more efficiency.
