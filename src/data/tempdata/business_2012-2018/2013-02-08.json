A spokeswoman for the Co-op, which has an empire spanning food retail, funeral homes and pharmacies, said that the group remained in \"active discussions\" and was \"working towards the deal.\" Kickstarting the sale of the Verde branches was one of the first actions taken by Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio when he became chief executive of Lloyds in March 2011. A Lloyds spokesman said: \"We are continuing negotiations with Co-op and are making good progress in creating a standalone challenger bank. We expect to have a separate TSB branded bank on the UK high street from the summer.\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio joined from Spanish bank Santander, which had wanted to buy branches from RBS. However, last year it pulled out of the acquisition of 316 branches amid IT issues. RBS is also being forced to sell off parts of its business by Europe because of the bailout of the Edinburgh-based bank, and could conduct a stock market flotation of the branches, currently codenamed Rainbow.",

Horsemeat turns out to have adulterated not just the cheap beefburgers that kicked off the food crisis in Ireland and the UK nearly a month ago, but also big-brand ready meals of beef lasagne. Supermarkets withdrew spaghetti bolognese and meatballs made in the same factories for fear of what they may&#xa0;find.</p> <p>What began as outrage at Tesco's Everyday Value Beef Burgers, revealed to be 29% horsemeat in January, paled into insignificance beside the \"beef\" in&#xa0;Findus's beef lasagne that the company admitted on Thursday was 100% equine. It had begun withdrawing its products from shops across the UK on Monday after an alert from its supplier, French manufacturer Comigel, that there \"might be an issue with labelling\". Damage-limitation PR experts Burson Marsteller, hired by Findus, offered the dubious reassurance that its product was only 15% \"beef\" anyway. Tesco and Aldi, who also source from Comigel, decided to withdraw their beef meals while they tested to see what was in them.</p> <p>The Findus admission has moved the scandal up a gear, pulling in yet another European country and a manufacturer with no apparent connection to the giant Irish meat processor, ABP, that was at the heart of the horse allegations when they first broke, blaming cheap blocks of frozen imported offcuts from Poland.</p> <p>But it was only when the ready meal of horse surfaced that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) went on the public offensive, telling TV and radio that it had now instructed food businesses to test all their beef products \u2013 burgers, meatballs, lasagnes and other ready meals \u2013 for the presence of horsemeat, and to provide it with the results by 15 February.</p> <p>The Irish authorities have called in the police to investigate what they are now referring to as a major criminal fraud in the food supply chain.

The FSA maintains it's an investigation into \"mislabelled meat\" \u2013 there's nothing illegal about flogging dead horse so long as you identify it on the pack. It has also reassured consumers there is no concern over food safety, although it advised anyone who had bought the Findus beef meals not to eat them since they have not yet been tested for phenylbutazone, a drug commonly used for horses that is banned as unsafe from the human food chain. It can cause serious blood disorders in rare cases. Until the authorities uncover the source of the horsemeat, they cannot be sure what sort of horses, from which country, and which bits of them, containing which drug residues, we have been eating.</p> <p>In the UK, seven abattoirs are licensed to kill horses for human consumption. No link has been made between UK horse abattoirs and the current scandal. The FSA has, however, been chasing details of horses slaughtered for meat in the UK that turn out to have contained residues of the banned \"bute\" drug. Investigations have shown that nine horses from UK abattoirs tested positive last year. Six were exported to France; in two cases the FSA is still trying to trace the carcasses, and in a further case the horse had not been exported, but had been purchased by two premises in the UK \"for personal consumption\". It fell to&#xa0;Kirklees and Chorley councils to try to&#xa0;recover the meat.</p> <p>When Chorley officials went looking for its share of the \"bute\" carcass, said to have been returned to a Lancashire farmer for his own hotpot, it was nowhere to be found.

The company has been subject of animal-rights protests this week following undercover filming by Hillside Animal Sanctuary that showed its slaughtermen abusing horses. The FSA told us it had withdrawn licences from three slaughtermen at the site and was <a href=\"http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2013/jan/horse-abuse#.URTFgc3T6Ko\" title=\"\">carrying out further investigations</a> with&#xa0;a view to potential prosecution.</p> <p>The company told us it was carrying out its own investigation in to the welfare abuses. It said it was aware of&#xa0;two horses from its production line testing positive for bute historically, but&#xa0;that it was an unsurprising figure and typical of what was likely to be found in all abattoirs. \"A positive does not imply any public health risk because the residue limits are set at such a low level,\" it added.</p> <p>It is legal to slaughter horses for human consumption so long as they have a valid passport, which is meant to&#xa0;record any medicines they have been administered in the course of their lives.&#xa0;The system of horse passports is, however, widely acknowledged to be ineffective.

Laurence McAllister, a horse dealer from Country Antrim, and Kieran Murphy, originally from South Armagh, were found guilty of trying to smuggle more than \u00a3500,000 worth of cannabis from Scotland through Belfast port in their horse lorry. The drug haul was concealed in bags of molasses between the horse stalls. McAllister had been tracked on&#xa0;two occasions transporting unfit horses and donkeys, some without the required passports, from Northern Ireland into Scotland for disposal in the UK; cannabis was part of the return load. He was later also found guilty of&#xa0;animal cruelty offences, and of smuggling prescription-only veterinary medicines. He was carrying more than \u00a36,000 in cash at the time of his arrest.</p> <p>The source of the horsemeat that ended up in beef factories in Ireland and&#xa0;France before being processed into food for British and Irish supermarkets is still unclear. ABP told us it had never knowingly imported horsemeat to its&#xa0;factory and was cooperating with investigators.

Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is holding an emergency meeting with heads of meat retailers and suppliers in London on Saturday. \"I fear it may be a conspiracy with international implications,\" he said.</p> <p>Food businesses have been told to have test results on all their products with the FSA by next Friday but Paterson is expected to tell MPs in a statement on Monday that some suppliers have been complaining to departmental officials that they have come under pressure from supermarket suppliers to cut corners.</p> <p>Schools have also been warned by the Department for Education to check their food suppliers and Number 10 admitted it could not rule out that horsemeat may have been served in hospitals. At least one baby food manufacturer has ordered emergency tests but said it was confident in the security of its supply chain.</p> <p>UK authorities, who were working with the Garda and government in Ireland, have asked French police to investigate particular contamination at Comigel, the French plant responsible for producing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/07/findus-beef-lasagne-horse-meat?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Findus lasagne found to contain up to 100% horse DNA</a>. Ministers have also asked the EU's law enforcement agency Europol for help. Inquiries since the scare first broke last month originally centred on Ireland, Britain and suppliers in Poland. Horse DNA has also been found in products in Sweden and Spain.</p> <p>Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow environment minister, wants the <a href=\"http:///www.soca.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA)</a> to be involved. In a letter to environment secretary Owen Patterson, she said: \"I have been given information about British companies who may potentially be involved in the illegal horsemeat trade. I am keen to share this information with the police to ensure that a full investigation can be made into any criminal activity.\"</p> <p>The investigations into possible criminality are thought to involve not only what has happened at factories and slaughterhouses but the wider pan-European horse trade. Animal welfare charities have long warned that lack of supervision in the transport of live animals has meant there is illegal activity.</p> <p>As David Cameron indicated that he would have no qualms about eating the sort of processed meat dishes that have been at the heart of the recent food scare, authorities insisted there was no evidence that frozen food in general was a risk to human health. But the FSA advised consumers who have bought affected beef lines from Findus not to eat them. They had not been tested for the presence of the veterinary medicine commonly used to treat horses, phenylbutazone, which is banned in the human food chain. It can cause a serious blood disorder in rare cases.</p> <p>The Guardian has also established that the FSA has been unable to trace all the horses slaughtered in the UK that tested positive for \"bute\" last year. The agency has routinely been testing less than 1% of slaughtered horses for the drug, but found four positives in 2012 in a sample of 82 carcasses. It carried out a special additional survey on a further 63 horses last year and found 5% of those contained residues, bringing the total of positives to nine.</p> <p>The Red Lion abattoir, owned by High Peak Meat Exports Ltd, has admitted that two of its slaughtered horses had tested positive for bute \"historically\" but said that this was typical of the industry as a whole and that residues levels were so low as not to be a public health issue. The abattoir is currently under investigation by the FSA for alleged animal welfare abuses, and three of its slaughtermen have had their licences to kill horses rescinded. The company said it was the FSA's responsibility to inspect horses at abattoirs and decide whether they were fit for the human food chain.</p> <p>The FSA found six of the horses found to contain bute last year had been exported to France, two were still being traced, and one had been allegedly returned to two owners in the north of England for personal consumption. The family of one of the owners, in Chorley, Lancashire, told officials however that they had never received the carcass nor expected to receive it.</p> <p>Some companies have told the Guardian they began testing their own products soon after the first cases of adulteration were reported in Ireland in mid-January. Full details of the testing requirements will be sent to the industry on Monday although the agency says companies already have enough information to get on with the job and return results by next Friday.</p> <p>The agency said evidence of the significant amounts of horse meat in burgers and lasagne pointed \"to either gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain\".</p> <p>It said two particular cases of horse DNA in frozen burgers from Tesco and the lasagne from Findus were linked to suppliers in Ireland and France respectively. \"We are working closely with the authorities in these countries to get to the root of the problem. Our priority remains to protect UK consumers.\"</p> <p>Tesco \u2013 which withdrew burger lines after one of its products made at an Irish plant had 29% equine DNA and withdrew lasagne made by French company Comigel \u2013 said it had already begun testing other beef lines at independent laboratories.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a spokesman from supermarket chain Aldi said: \"Following an alert from our French supplier, Comigel, Aldi immediately withdrew its frozen beef Lasagne and frozen spaghetti Bolognese from stores as a precautionary measure.</p> <p>\"Tests have been completed that show horse meat in the withdrawn products.

      "bodyText": "Scotland Yard has been asked by the food standards watchdog to investigate if there is a criminal element to the horsemeat scandal \u2013 as the food industry prepares to test every processed beef product line following evidence adulteration has spread from burgers to lasagne. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says information so far \"points either to gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain\" and David Heath, the food and farming minister has said there is \"every probability\" criminality was involved. The Met confirmed on Friday that it has met with the FSA. Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is holding an emergency meeting with heads of meat retailers and suppliers in London on Saturday. \"I fear it may be a conspiracy with international implications,\" he said. Food businesses have been told to have test results on all their products with the FSA by next Friday but Paterson is expected to tell MPs in a statement on Monday that some suppliers have been complaining to departmental officials that they have come under pressure from supermarket suppliers to cut corners. Schools have also been warned by the Department for Education to check their food suppliers and Number 10 admitted it could not rule out that horsemeat may have been served in hospitals. At least one baby food manufacturer has ordered emergency tests but said it was confident in the security of its supply chain. UK authorities, who were working with the Garda and government in Ireland, have asked French police to investigate particular contamination at Comigel, the French plant responsible for producing Findus lasagne found to contain up to 100% horse DNA. Ministers have also asked the EU's law enforcement agency Europol for help. Inquiries since the scare first broke last month originally centred on Ireland, Britain and suppliers in Poland. Horse DNA has also been found in products in Sweden and Spain. Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow environment minister, wants the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) to be involved. In a letter to environment secretary Owen Patterson, she said: \"I have been given information about British companies who may potentially be involved in the illegal horsemeat trade. I am keen to share this information with the police to ensure that a full investigation can be made into any criminal activity.\" The investigations into possible criminality are thought to involve not only what has happened at factories and slaughterhouses but the wider pan-European horse trade. Animal welfare charities have long warned that lack of supervision in the transport of live animals has meant there is illegal activity. As David Cameron indicated that he would have no qualms about eating the sort of processed meat dishes that have been at the heart of the recent food scare, authorities insisted there was no evidence that frozen food in general was a risk to human health. But the FSA advised consumers who have bought affected beef lines from Findus not to eat them. They had not been tested for the presence of the veterinary medicine commonly used to treat horses, phenylbutazone, which is banned in the human food chain. It can cause a serious blood disorder in rare cases. The Guardian has also established that the FSA has been unable to trace all the horses slaughtered in the UK that tested positive for \"bute\" last year. The agency has routinely been testing less than 1% of slaughtered horses for the drug, but found four positives in 2012 in a sample of 82 carcasses. It carried out a special additional survey on a further 63 horses last year and found 5% of those contained residues, bringing the total of positives to nine. The Red Lion abattoir, owned by High Peak Meat Exports Ltd, has admitted that two of its slaughtered horses had tested positive for bute \"historically\" but said that this was typical of the industry as a whole and that residues levels were so low as not to be a public health issue. The abattoir is currently under investigation by the FSA for alleged animal welfare abuses, and three of its slaughtermen have had their licences to kill horses rescinded. The company said it was the FSA's responsibility to inspect horses at abattoirs and decide whether they were fit for the human food chain. The FSA found six of the horses found to contain bute last year had been exported to France, two were still being traced, and one had been allegedly returned to two owners in the north of England for personal consumption. The family of one of the owners, in Chorley, Lancashire, told officials however that they had never received the carcass nor expected to receive it. Some companies have told the Guardian they began testing their own products soon after the first cases of adulteration were reported in Ireland in mid-January. Full details of the testing requirements will be sent to the industry on Monday although the agency says companies already have enough information to get on with the job and return results by next Friday. The agency said evidence of the significant amounts of horse meat in burgers and lasagne pointed \"to either gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain\". It said two particular cases of horse DNA in frozen burgers from Tesco and the lasagne from Findus were linked to suppliers in Ireland and France respectively. \"We are working closely with the authorities in these countries to get to the root of the problem. Our priority remains to protect UK consumers.\" Tesco \u2013 which withdrew burger lines after one of its products made at an Irish plant had 29% equine DNA and withdrew lasagne made by French company Comigel \u2013 said it had already begun testing other beef lines at independent laboratories. Elsewhere, a spokesman from supermarket chain Aldi said: \"Following an alert from our French supplier, Comigel, Aldi immediately withdrew its frozen beef Lasagne and frozen spaghetti Bolognese from stores as a precautionary measure. \"Tests have been completed that show horse meat in the withdrawn products. In samples selected at random, tests demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30% and 100% horse meat. \"This is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies, we feel angry and let down by our supplier. If the label says beef, our customers expect it to be beef. Suppliers are absolutely clear that they are required to meet our stringent specifications and that we do not tolerate any failure to do so. \"We have acted quickly to withdraw the affected products from sale, conduct additional testing and review the performance of our suppliers. The products from Comigel will not be sold in our stores again and we will no longer take any product from Comigel. \"We advise anyone who has bought any of these products to return them to their nearest Aldi store for a full refund.\" Cow and Gate, one of the UK's major baby food companies, began testing its 14 lines containing beef in the second half of last month. The results are due \"quite soon\", it said. The company, part of the French-based multinational Danone, has no production plants in Britain but has its factories in France and Spain.

Rehman said the team behind the Papple, which is a cross between a European and Asian pear and is grown in New Zealand, had made hundreds of different hybrid seeds which all had to be grown into mature trees \"before they had any idea what the fruit would taste like\".</p> <p>\"They would have planted hectares of trees, it might not have been very nice and then you've got to dig it all up,\" he said. \"It is very expensive if you look at all the research and development and the man hours.\"</p> <p>Rehman said M&amp;S had an \"innovation calendar\" of when the next fruit inventions will be ready to trial in its stores, but declined to give any hints of what sort of unusual things we can expect to find in stores next year.</p> <p>The vagaries of trying to grow hybrid plants can make it very difficult to predict when, or even if, a fruit in the pipeline will make it to the shelves. Rehman said he had spoken to a grower M&amp;S had contracted to start work on a new type of peach in 2006, but was warned it won't be ready until at least 2016.</p> <p>While some new products have been in planning for decades, other new fruits turn up unannounced in the post at M&amp;S's head office in central London.</p> <p>\"We've got an almost mad scientist, brilliant grower in Israel who just sends over parcels of more than 20 varieties at a time,\" Rehman said. \"He's called Seffi Ben Dor, he's got massive trial orchards and he just sends stuff straight to us. We write back with suggestions, and then get a couple in store.\"</p> <p>Cindy van Rijswick, a fresh produce analyst at Rabobank, said growers and supermarkets spend hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to woe each other over dinners and cocktail parties at Fruit Logistica. \"Some companies hire a complete hotel,\" she said.</p> <p>Sainsbury's has sent 15 of its most senior buyers and supply chain experts to Berlin. Peter Batt, the supermarket's produce manager, said finding the best new products was essential for \"attracting new and younger customers\".</p> <p>Batt said he had spoken to soft fruit growers who are growing 100 different varieties of raspberries and other summer fruits, but warned it will take a decade before any of them are ready to sell in store.</p> <p>\"Most people don't think there is such a thing as new fruits, but they are really popular,\" he said. \"It's like wine. If you go back 10 to 20 years people only really drank core European wines, now they are all drinking new world wines.\"</p> <p>He said the main problem in promoting new products is the difficulty of explaining to customers what the fruits are. \"We do a lot of sampling programmes trying to highlight new products to our customers to encourage them not to sleep shop,\" he said, adding that</p> <p>getting the new inventions on the menus of fancy restaurants or featured on TV shows, such as James Martin's Saturday Kitchen, was also key to their success.</p> <p>Finger Limes, a previous winner of the Fruit Logisitca innovation awards, soared to global attention when the fruit, which is described as \"citrus caviar\" became a hit with Michelin-starred chefs, <a href=\"http://blog.oyster.com/new-york-citys-michelin-starred-restaurants-37046/\" title=\"\">including Gordon Ramsay</a>.</p> <p>The fruit, which is grown in pods on the thorny shrub <em>Citrus australasica</em> in Australia, is a <a href=\"http://morselsandmusings.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/oysters-w-lime-caviar-black-pepper.html\" title=\"\">popular garnish for oysters</a>.</p> <p>Batt said Sainsbury's is currently trialling the fruit in its Tonbridge Wells branch with a view to extending it across its store network.

For every successful fruit invention there are as many as a 100 disasters. Rehman said the team behind the Papple, which is a cross between a European and Asian pear and is grown in New Zealand, had made hundreds of different hybrid seeds which all had to be grown into mature trees \"before they had any idea what the fruit would taste like\". \"They would have planted hectares of trees, it might not have been very nice and then you've got to dig it all up,\" he said. \"It is very expensive if you look at all the research and development and the man hours.\" Rehman said M&amp;S had an \"innovation calendar\" of when the next fruit inventions will be ready to trial in its stores, but declined to give any hints of what sort of unusual things we can expect to find in stores next year. The vagaries of trying to grow hybrid plants can make it very difficult to predict when, or even if, a fruit in the pipeline will make it to the shelves. Rehman said he had spoken to a grower M&amp;S had contracted to start work on a new type of peach in 2006, but was warned it won't be ready until at least 2016. While some new products have been in planning for decades, other new fruits turn up unannounced in the post at M&amp;S's head office in central London. \"We've got an almost mad scientist, brilliant grower in Israel who just sends over parcels of more than 20 varieties at a time,\" Rehman said. \"He's called Seffi Ben Dor, he's got massive trial orchards and he just sends stuff straight to us. We write back with suggestions, and then get a couple in store.\" Cindy van Rijswick, a fresh produce analyst at Rabobank, said growers and supermarkets spend hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to woe each other over dinners and cocktail parties at Fruit Logistica. \"Some companies hire a complete hotel,\" she said. Sainsbury's has sent 15 of its most senior buyers and supply chain experts to Berlin. Peter Batt, the supermarket's produce manager, said finding the best new products was essential for \"attracting new and younger customers\". Batt said he had spoken to soft fruit growers who are growing 100 different varieties of raspberries and other summer fruits, but warned it will take a decade before any of them are ready to sell in store. \"Most people don't think there is such a thing as new fruits, but they are really popular,\" he said. \"It's like wine. If you go back 10 to 20 years people only really drank core European wines, now they are all drinking new world wines.\" He said the main problem in promoting new products is the difficulty of explaining to customers what the fruits are. \"We do a lot of sampling programmes trying to highlight new products to our customers to encourage them not to sleep shop,\" he said, adding that getting the new inventions on the menus of fancy restaurants or featured on TV shows, such as James Martin's Saturday Kitchen, was also key to their success. Finger Limes, a previous winner of the Fruit Logisitca innovation awards, soared to global attention when the fruit, which is described as \"citrus caviar\" became a hit with Michelin-starred chefs, including Gordon Ramsay. The fruit, which is grown in pods on the thorny shrub Citrus australasica in Australia, is a popular garnish for oysters. Batt said Sainsbury's is currently trialling the fruit in its Tonbridge Wells branch with a view to extending it across its store network. Budgens also stocks the fruit in its Islington stores for \u00a34.99 per 100g.",

      "bodyText": "Boeing has told customers expecting delivery of its troubled 787 Dreamliner jets to expect delays, suggesting the company is no longer expecting a quick resolution to the battery problems that have grounded the hi-tech airliners. Executives at Thomson Airways, owned by Britain's TUI Travel, and Norwegian Air Shuttle, two budget airlines, told Reuters Friday that they had been told the delivery of their 787s would be delayed. Thomson's jet were originally scheduled for the end of February but that delivery had been \"moved out of the month\" and no new delivery date was given. Norwegian Air Shuttle told Reuters Boeing had informed it that its planes would be delayed by the ongoing investigation by the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) into the battery fires. No new delivery date was mentioned. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which must re-certify the 787, is now waiting for a report from the NTSB that chairman Deborah Hersman said yesterday should be ready in 30 days. Last month Norwegian Air's chief executive Bjorn Kjos said he was expecting his 787s by April and that Boeing was sure it would soon fix its battery issues. \"They say it is going to be fixed soon; they have a plan. They say it will be delivered according to the schedule,\" he told reporters at the Airline Economics conference in Dublin. A Boeing spokeswoman said: \"We have informed our customers expecting 787 deliveries in the near term that those aircraft either have been or are at risk of being delayed.

Thomson had planned to start using its Dreamliners in May and launched an advertising campaign in Britain last April calling the 787 the \"future of long-haul travel\". Last year Thomson boss Chris Browne told The Guardian the 787 addressed the airlines \"biggest source of complaints\" comfort, legroom and entertainment on long-haul holidays. \"So we had to do something.

Thomson said its contingency plans included using alternative aircraft for its long-haul flights to Mexico and Florida if delivery was delayed beyond the end of March. TUI Travel told Reuters on Thursday it had no plans to cancel its order for 13 Dreamliner jets. British Airways, owned by International Airlines Group, said it was in discussions with Boeing but that the first of its 787 planes were still scheduled to be delivered in May. Virgin Atlantic said delivery of its 16 Dreamliners starting in summer 2014 was unchanged.",

    "webTitle": "EU leaders reach historic budget deal - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here's a closing summary: \u2022 After marathon talks, Europe's leaders have agreed a seven-year budget for the EU. Total spending will fall for the first time since the EU was created, to \u20ac980bn over the period from a previous budget of around \u00a31trn. The amount paid in by member states has also fallen by around \u20ac34bn, to \u20ac908bn. \u2022 David Cameron said it was a deal that Britain could be proud of. He also warned that the country's total commitments to the EU will actually increase (highlights from 4.10pm). \u2022 German chancellor Angela Merkel said the deal was worth the wait, while the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, argued it was no-one's ideal budget. \u2022 Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, dubbed the deal \"a balanced and growth-oriented budget for Europe for the rest of the decade\". \u2022 EU leaders now face a potential battle with the European Parliament to get the budget into law. EP president Martin Schulz could hold a secret ballot, raising the chances of the deal being rejected (see 2.51pm). Cameron said the idea of a secret vote was baffling, and reminded MEPs to respect the fact that certain national leaders will actually provide the funds, with the permission of their own parliaments. \u2022 But the plan was criticised for cutting the amount spend on infrastructure projects compared to the plan rejected last November, while leaving agricultural spending unchanged. (handy graphic here) \u2022 Cuts to the EU development fund were also attacked -- Oxfam said the EU would now struggle to hit anti-poverty goals (details). Thanks for reading and commenting. Keep watching guardian.co.uk for updates through the evening. Our most recent story about the landmark decisions in Brussels is here: EU agrees historic budget deal after all-night talks. Goodnight! The European Council has published a table showing details of the EU budget agreed today: You can see it on page 46 of this fuller list of conclusions from the Summit (pdf). Or I've pasted it below (in two halves so it is legible) EC president Herman Van Rompuy has helpfully published his official remarks on the seven-year budget deal: Van Rompuy began: It has been a lengthy, but successful 24 hours: the European Council has just agreed on the next multi-annual budget. And not just any budget. It is a balanced and growth-oriented budget for Europe for the rest of the decade. It was no easy task: this was our single longest meeting so far in my mandate, but it was worth working for this result. Ven Rompuy argued that the agreement shows \"a sense of collective responsibility, but warned that the European Parliament must still approve it. Van Rompuy added that, compared to the previous budget, there was: \u2022 A \u20ac34bn increase in Competitiveness for Growth and Jobs spending. \u2022 \u20ac30bn for \"connecting Europe\" (a figure that is sharply down on the previous proposal last November) \u2022 \u20ac6bn for a new Youth employment initiative, which he called \"a powerful incentive.\" Francois Hollande did not play the part of the loser at his own press conference. Instead, the French president told reporters that all leaders had made concessions. On whether this was Hollande's 'dream budget', he said: I would say if I were alone, no, it would have been different. My responsibility was to put forward what I thought was the best given the circumstances. The circumstances are the fiscal situation. Here's some more highlights: Here's how David Cameron hailed the new EU budget a deal that Britain can be proud of: I think the British public can be proud that we have cut the seven-year credit card limit for the European Union for the first time ever. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has welcomed the budget deal, saying Europe has shown it can show fiscal responsibility: Clegg (a former MEP) said: This is the right deal for Britain and for Europe. It\u2019s the best outcome for British taxpayers and people right across Europe. Both the Prime Minister and I have always been clear that it was simply not right for the EU budget to go up when cuts are having to be made at home. Every country in Europe is having to take tough decisions at home and it is only right that in these difficult times, the European Union also cuts its cloth accordingly. Whilst we may have our differences on other European issues, we have worked as one to keep the EU budget in check. I'm delighted a deal has now been struck to do just that. The official conclusions from the European Council summit are now online - click here to download (pdf). The historic decision to agree a cut in the EU budget comes right at the end, in a throwaway line: 19. The European Council reached agreement on the next Multiannual Financial Framework as set out in document 37/13. The rest of the communique is devoted to issues such as trade, growth and international relations - particularly the crisis in Syria. The European Council said it \"deplores the awful situation\" in Syria, expressed support for those battling against the Assad regime, and: stresses the need for a political transition towards a future without Assad and his illegitimate regime. The Labour party have welcomed today's result, having been critical of David Cameron after previous summits for leaving Britain isolated. Douglas Alexander MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Foreign Secretary, even suggested they should share the credit (for allying with Tory backbenchers to push through an amendment calling for a real-terms spending cut). Alexander said: We welcome news that a deal has been reached. Failing to agree one could have seen next year's budget go up automatically. Labour voted in November to give David Cameron a clear mandate to negotiate for a real terms cut, and so we welcome the reports indicating the policy we advocated has been agreed. It seemed at times that David Cameron was ready to throw in the towel and aim for a freeze, but today's deal proves that a cut was worth voting for in Westminster and worth negotiating for in Brussels. As Labour we called not only for a reduction, but also reform, of the EU budget. The EU had an opportunity to focus the budget on growth and jobs and it will be a matter of deep regret if that was not achieved, but we will continue to scrutinise the details as they emerge. Ed Balls MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, took a similar line: We will need to look very closely at the detail in the coming days and weeks, but if today\u2019s deal does result in a genuine real terms cut in the EU Budget then the Prime Minister will have delivered what Labour and Parliament demanded. Success really does have many fathers.... From Brussels, my sleep-hungry colleagues Nick Watt and Ian Traynor write: European leaders have finally agreed a budget deal for the rest of the decade after a marathon 25-and-a-half hour negotiation session in Brussels, that will lead to the first cut in EU spending in its 56-year history. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council who chaired the negotiations, broke the news on Twitter. He tweeted at 4.22pm local time on Friday: \"Deal done! #euco has agreed on #MFF for the rest of the decade. Worth waiting for.\" They also explain how David Cameron kept himself going: Cameron had sustained himself through the night with Haribo sweets and copious cups of coffee from a Nespresso machine in the UK delegation room at the EC's Justus Lipsius building. More here Back to Angela Merkel's press conference (held at the same time as David Cameron was speaking). The German chancellor told reporters that the deal was fair, and included \u20ac6bn of fresh aid for Europe's youth unemployment crisis: David Cameron's press conference has ended, after the PM again defended his decision to offer an in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership. The PM insisted that he is not trying to engineer Britain's exit, saying that the UK people understand that he's trying to reform the EU and Britain's place in the union. A referendum now would be wrong, he adds, as we do not yet know what that relationship will be. The PM fends off a second question on horsemeat (some British lasagne is full of the stuff), asking whether he would eat a beef product. Cameron says that he will heed the official advice that there is no health risk, adding (slightly tersely) that he doesn't know what he, or Mrs Cameron, will be serving up for supper at Number 10 tonight. Cameron also fires a small warning shot at MEPs over the rumour that they will hold a 'secret vote' on the EU budget. The PM acknowledges that the European parliament has a role in the EU Budget issue (it will vote on whether it the spending and revenue raising plan is credible). But Cameron also points out that national leaders such as himself, and Angela Merkel, are the ones who have to return to their parliaments and actually raise the money. In other words: if we think the deal is fair and right, MEPs should keep out of the way. Cameron adds that he doesn't understand why MEP's should hold a secret vote on the issue -- that would not offer democratic accountability. Does David Cameron feel happier than at the end of 2011, when he was isolated 26-1 at an EU summit and played his veto. The PM replies that he enjoyed working with allies, such as Angela Merkel. And his message to UK taxpayers who don't understand why Britain's net contributions to the EU are rising? Cameron says that there's more he wants to achieve on European spending, particularly on the Brussels machine. But the best thing for Britain, he says, is to play a role in reforming Europe and making it more competitive and functional. Next question goes to my colleague Nick Watt, who reminds the prime minister that in 2011 his government had set a target of \u20ac886bn. Hasn't he failed to deliver that? Cameron points to the fact that the deal on the table is a clear cut in spending compared to the previous budget. That's the key fact, he says, adding: We wanted to cut this credit card, to deliver lower spending in the future. On any fair view, that's exactly what we've done. Next question -- will Britain's net contributions actually go up, despite the drop in total spending? Cameron confirmed that Britain will pay more, and lays the blame firmly at the door of Tony Blair to agreed to hand back a portion of the UK rebate in 2005. Our commitments were always going to go up, but under this deal they will go up by less, Cameron says. Spending is forecast to fall as a percentage of GDP in the UK, he added. First question for David Cameron: What is his message to the European Parliament, which is threatening to veto the deal that has been hammered out. Cameron replies that the European Parliament needs to work constructively with EU leaders on this issue. He says the key message of the last 48 hours is that \"it's better to have a deal\". Cameron is also asked about the latest twists in Britain's horsemeat scandal - he says it's completely unacceptable, and people have every right to be angry. David Cameron is now giving his press conference -- hailing the news that spending will be limited to \u20ac908bn (that's the payment ceiling). The PM also told journalists that he had faced constant pressure to agree to a cut in the UK rebate: I fought off these attempts. The British rebate is safe. Cameron added that the deal on the table fits the \"modern\" Europe, and is good news for Europe's taxpayers. Van Rompuy added that \"This is perhaps nobody's perfect budget deal\". EC president Herman Van Rompuy is giving a press conference now. It's being streamed here. Van Rompuy said it was \"a budget of moderation\" -- that Europe had to be leaner in the current economic climate. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, has begun briefing the media - saying that today's deal was \"worth the effort\" David Cameron is also due to speak to the press shortly - the lectern is ready.... We expect Cameron to hail the real terms cut in EU spending. But the key question for the PM will probably be whether Britain's payments fall, or rise.... (as explained here) Dutch media are reporting that prime minister Mark Rutte managed to reduce the cut to the Netherlands rebate by \u20ac45m (it was originally being cut from \u20ac1bn to \u20ac650bn). French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is expected to give a press conference any moment. Other leaders will also be holding their own press briefings, so it could get a little hectic \u2026 The deal may be done, but the EU budget is not official yet - not until the European Parliament gives its approval (and as explained at 2.51pm, there is a strong chance that MEPs will veto it). The word from Brussels is that the French media are not impressed by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's performance. Real-term cuts to the EU budget were not top of Paris's agenda - so the French president risks being painted as the big loser over the budget talks: A quick reminder about what was on the table, before the press conferences begin: \u2022 A seven-year EU budget with spending commitments of \u20ac960bn, a cut of around \u20ac33bn (see 7.15am) \u2022 The payment ceiling (how much country's actually agree to pay) has been cut by a similar amount, to \u20ac908.4bn \u2022 The deal includes a \u20ac12bn cut in EU spending compared to the proposal that was rejected in November, with infrastructure spending taking an \u20ac11bn hit ( see table below more details here): \u2022 The UK budget rebate was retained, but there is speculation that Britian's payments could still rise (because of the recent expansion in the EU) (see 10.54am). The deal comes a full day after leaders began arriving in Brussels for the summit. Van Rompuy's announcement went down well with the press corp: And the politicians: Breaking news from Brussels - the Budget deal has been agreed: Now, the press conferences.... Martin Schulz, president of the European parliament, has again warned that the budget deal on the table could be vetoed by MEPs. In a video interview (see below), Schulz said: I must admit a compromise on the basis of the lowest level, the common denominator will for sure be very hard to find a majority in the European Parliament He added that it is \"too early\" to reach a judgement, but cautioned that \"...I fear that it is not possible to vote in favour\". The Spanish are optimistic: Those last-ditch attempts (1.09pm) to raise the 'payment ceiling' in the EU budget above \u20ac908bn have failed, according to Bruno Waterfield of the Daily Telegraph: Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, has warned that the dispute in Brussels is between the wealthy members of the EU That reflects the feeling that Britain and Germany have allied together to outflank France over the budget plan (although this didn't extend to cuts to the Common Agricultural Policy).... Oxfam, which fights poverty across the globe, has strongly criticised the draft budget deal on the table in Brussels. Natalia Alonso, head of Oxfam's EU Office, warned that EU development and humanitarian aid spending is being 'disproportionately hit'. The 4% cut in spending compared to the previous budget will make it harder to hit poverty reduction goals, she warned. Alonso said: Cutting EU aid to save money is like cutting your hair to lose weight. It's not doing the job but worse, in the case of EU aid, it's put millions of people on the line. The disproportionate downsizing of the EU\u2019s aid budget is a breach of faith. The proposed cuts to EU aid will leave a critical shortfall that could unravel the progress made so far and could have potentially disastrous consequences on the ability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, especially in Africa. It would undoubtedly also impact negatively on the role of Europe as a global player. EU leaders, like all other countries, should be held accountable for their commitments. It\u2019s unacceptable for them to wriggle out of their promise to give 0.7 per cent of national income by 2015 to the poorest because there is an economic crisis. Brussels insiders reckon that, with a bit of luck, EU leaders could reach a decision on the budget in two hours time, by 4.30pm local time (3.30pm GMT). Meanwhile, UK officials are blaming today's delays on a few irksome wrinkles. Negotiations are under way again in Brussels! Leaders are considering the proposal pulled together by Herman Van Rompuy. A historic cut in the European Union budget could be close \u2026 The delays in Brussels worked out well for Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, who returned to the negotiations in the last few minutes: Negotiations will resume in 30 minutes, says European Council president Herman Van Rompuy: That's two-and-a-half hours later than the original plan this morning. Something's definitely up.... and Sky's Robert Nisbet says a late row has blown up over the payments ceiling (how much countries will actually pay) involving the UK: EU leaders were hoping to make progress on another important issue today -- a new free trade deal between Europe and the United States. According to the draft of the final summit statement obtained by Reuters, the European Union will give \"its support for a comprehensive trade agreement\" with the US. That would put the ball back in America's court, at a time when there is an urgent need for new growth on both sides of the Atlantic. More here There's also a good recent article about the issue here on the Daily Telegraph. It explains that while existing trade links are fairly liberated, even small changes could produce a significant economic boost. More delays -- the plenary session that was due to start a few minutes ago (and which was originally scheduled for 90 minutes ago) has been put back again.... British prime minister David Cameron and his entourage arriving back at today's talks: David Gow puts his finger on the reason for the latest delays: The Czech Republic had already threatened to veto any deal that including major spending cuts, arguing that the EU's poorer countries should still be supported through infrastructure spending. Another delay -- the meeting won't restart for another 30 minutes. Finland's finance minister is feeling the strain (and was last seen heading for a sofa) All-nighters are one thing if you're trying to get an essay finished in time (i imagine); quite another if you're hammering out a crucial budget. There must be a better way. It's not like we didn't know this was coming.... The prospect of the European Parliament vetoing a deal on the EU budget (see 10.16am) has angered one leading Conservative MEP, Martin Callanan. Callanan, the leader of the European Conservatives and Reformists group, said it would be outrageous if the EP were to call a secret ballot on the plan, as looks likely. He said: If MEPs want to reject an agreement made by their own prime ministers then they should have the courage of their convictions and not try to cower behind a procedural technicality. The European Parliament must be accountable to its voters which it cannot be if MEPs connive to hide their voting record on an issue that they should be judged on at the ballot box. This is not some small vote; it is one of the most important decisions of the entire legislature. A secret vote would make it easier for MEPs to rebel against their national leaders, if they agree with president Schulz that the Budget is dangerous. Schulz is concerned that there is such a large gap between spending plans (\u20ac960bn) and payment commitments (\u20ac908bn). David Cameron will return to Britain to the sound of cheering from his (increasingly fractious) backbenchers, argues Nick Watt, our chief political correspondent. From Brussels, he writes: Barring a last-minute accident, the prime minister will say he played a leading role in drawing up the first cut in the EU's budget in its 56-year history. As he headed out of the European council to freshen up during a break in the negotiations on Friday morning, after one of the EU's dreaded all-night sessions, No 10 was hopeful he has secured his original target. Nick also points out that Britain has worked well with Germany this week, because their respective leaders agree. This time... The German chancellor is keen to co-operate with Cameron at a tactical level \u2013 if she agrees with him \u2013 and at a broader strategic level to maintain the UK as an influential member of the EU as a counterweight to the protectionist France. But Merkel's support should never be taken for granted. The prime minister will therefore need to calibrate his negotiating stances with care when he embarks on the much more delicate and complex task of repatriating EU powers, as he promised in his Bloomberg speech on the EU. David Gow of the Nucleus thinktank (and former European business editor of this parish) reports that French officials are impressed by David Cameron's tough negotiating stance: A one-hour delay in Brussels - leaders won't resume discussing the budget deal until 1pm local time, or noon GMT. That's via Finland's minister for European affairs and foreign trade, Alexander Stubb: Here are two handy graphs. One explain how today's deal differs from the previous two EU budgets - confirming that the current plan is a significant cut on the last deal. This second graph shows how the spending commitments break down. If you compare the 13 Feb proposal with the 12 Nov one, you'll see that the Europe 2020 budget has taken a hit. That \u20ac11bn cut means less spending on transport, telecoms and energy projects - arguably a serious blow to the EU's long-term competitiveness (particularly as many economists believe Big Infrastructure projects are vital to a serious growth strategy today): They both come from Open Europe, whose full analysis is online here. Its broad conclusion is that the deal is quite a decent result, but that Europe is still spending money on the wrong areas: Some potential obstacles to a deal remain, but this seems to be a positive starting point for a deal. The UK can plausibly say it has received a decent deal if something close to this proposal comes into force. Unfortunately, the budget as a whole will remain poorly targeted and outdated. Britain's net contribution to the European Union could still increase under today's proposal, even though the UK rebate has been saved (see 9.55am). The Open Europe thinktank explains: This is because the share of the EU budget going to the new EU member states \u2013 the ones that have joined the EU since 2004 \u2013 will increase. Since this share is not covered by the UK rebate, Britain gets no cash back for its share of the money spent there. This could prove politically sticky for the UK government when explaining the figures to MPs and the opposition \u2013 though it\u2019s likely to heap the blame on Tony Blair for giving up part of the rebate in 2005. However, at the same time, more money (though not nearly enough) will be invested in poorer member states, where it can have the most impact, rather than being recycled unnecessarily between rich member states, at a huge administrative and opportunity cost. For \"likely\", read \"certain\", I suggest... The latest pictures from Brussels show that our elected representatives and their officials are feeling the strain from the long negotiations that kicked off yesterday evening: Surely there is a better way of deciding to commit the best part of a trillion euros of public money? A quick round-up of how the media are covering the EU Summit, while we wait for talks to restart: The Guardian: EU summit on brink of historic cuts to budget The Daily Telegraph: Victory for David Cameron as EU budget faces cuts for first time in history The Financial Times: EU leaders near \u20ac960bn budget deal / Hawks prevail as spending set to be cut for first time The Wall Street Journal: EU Waits on Budget Deal The Times (\u00a3): EU leaders close to budget cut deal European leaders are arriving back at the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels. There's a live feed here (although it's a little slow right now) Angela Merkel's already back: There is speculation this morning that the European parliament could veto the budget deal being hammered out today in Brussels. European parliament president Martin Schulz warned last night against a deal where the spending plans are too much larger than the payment commitments from member states. If we carry on this methodology and set the commitments far higher than the payments, we are going to end up as an EU with a deficit The current deal has a shortfall of \u20ac51.6bn. Such a gap is allowed under EU rules because some spending plans never happen (projects are cancelled, or scaled back). Schulz's views are important as the budget must pass through the European Parliament to become legal. My colleague Nick Watt summarised the key points from the draft agreement earlier this morning -- including the fact that Britain's rebate remains intact: (ie: EU spending only makes up around 1% of the region's total national income) The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is battling to protect his own rebate today. The proposed EU budget sees the Netherlands subsidy fall to \u20ac650m per year, from \u20ac1bn. Dutch officials have confirmed that the figure is accurate, but insist that it doesn't account for other changes which will trim the country's total bill. Developing Last night's summit began with a diplomatic spat between Britain and France, after Fran\u00e7ois Hollande failed to show up at a meeting with David Cameron and Angela Merkel. Hollande's non-appearance was seen as a clear snub (although the French argued that the invitation simply didn't turn up). Cameron and Hollande's relationship is notably spiky: The two-hour break in negotiations (due to resume at 11am GMT or noon Brussels time), gives David Cameron a chance for a good wash: A two-hour pause has just been announced in Brussels: That gives leaders time to regroup, and perhaps snatch some rest. Is it victory for David Cameron? The UK prime minister went into the summit pushing for a real-terms cut in the EU Budget, declaring: The numbers are much too high. They need to come down - and if they don't come down there won't be a deal. And that is exactly what on the table -- cuts of over \u20ac30bn to the EU's spending limits (to \u20ac960bn), and the smaller payments ceiling [what countries actually put in] (to \u20ac908bn). That should allow Cameron to declare success. However, at this stage we do not know the impact on Britain's own contributions to the EU. There are reports that British taxpayers could 'save' up to \u00a3500m per year, but that's not official, yet.... Worth remembering that Britain started this process by declaring that the payments limit should be \u20ac886bn, not the \u20ac908bn now on the table. But that probably won't puncture UK celebrations... Live in the European Union? You can see how much the EU costs you each year, and what you get back, on our Datablog: EU budget interactive: where does your money go? The European commission has also published a list of 97 worthy projects funded by the EU. Some of them tackle seriously big issues - holes in the ozone layer, heart disease, pollution. Some are more, well, localised - including \"Transnational co-operation in local wine sector in the Moselle valley\", and a new road and power network for a potato processing factory in Wales. Agricultural subsidies will continue to consume a sizable chunk of EU spending under the framework Budget on the table today, around 39% of the total. Indeed, the Common Agricultural Policy will actually consume \u20ac1bn more cash than the previous proposal from last November, according to our Europe editor Ian Traynor: That's because the new proposal cuts \u20ac11bn from the budget for \"Connecting Europe\" - the scheme to promote closer transport, energy and telecoms networks between EU nations. Ian also warns that leaders will be scrambling over each other to claim victory: British officials are being cautious this morning, warning that the framework deal on the table has not yet been agreed: Alex Barker, EU correspondent at the Financial Times, believes Brussels officials could be hit with a pay freeze under the EU budget proposal: It's been another grueling European Council summit, as leaders and officials pushed through the night in the search for a deal. Here's some of the overnight action: And this photo, via Finnish minister for Europe, Alexander Stubb, shows his team examining the details of the latest budget proposal: With spending capped at \u20ac960bn, the deal on the table in Brussels this morning is \u20ac12bn less than the previous offer that leaders couldn't agree on last November. These latest cuts fall on a new fund for cross-border transport, energy and telecoms projects, which will lose \u20ac11bn. The amount set aside for EU officials' pay and perks is also being cut by \u20ac1bn, officials added (via Reuters) Good morning. European leaders are close to agreeing a long-term deal that would see the EU budget cut, in real terms, for the first time since the European Union was created. After all-night talks in Brussels, a draft proposal has been tabled which would cap the EU budget at \u20ac960bn over the next seven years. That would trim more than \u20ac30bn off the previous budget -- and be hailed as a triumph by those keen to see Europe's spending curtailed. From Brussels, my colleagues Nicholas Watt and Ian Traynor report: David Cameron, who had demanded a real terms freeze in the near \u20ac1tn budget, was planning to claim victory after the European council president proposed a \u20ac34.4bn cut in the next seven-year EU budget. Herman Van Rompuy finally tabled his budget proposals in Brussels at 6am after a night of haggling at the EU summit that was likened by one official to a \"bazaar\". Shortly before 6.30am the EU's 27 leaders filed into the council chamber to debate Van Rompuy's proposal to cut the \"payment ceiling\", likened to a credit card limit, for the next seven-year budget from \u20ac942.8bn to \u20ac908.4bn. Van Rompuy proposed cutting the higher \"commitment ceiling\" from \u20ac993.6bn for the last budget from 2007-13 to \u20ac960bn for 2014-20. While leaders have agreed the 'framework' of a new long-term deal, the final agreement has not yet been finalised. That should happen later today, assuming the sleep-deprived politicians can get the ball over the line. We'll be covering all the action from Brussels, and reaction to the negotiations, through the day \u2026",

      "bodyText": "Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, has given the green light to a huge windfarm right next door to the constituency of his turbine-phobic colleague, John Hayes. Up to 22 turbines are to be erected at Heckington Fen in Lincolnshire, just north of Hayes' constituency, making it the fourth largest onshore windfarm in England, according to developer, Ecotricity. Davey, a Lib Dem MP who has always been supportive of renewable energy, has consistently been embarrassed by Hayes, the new energy minister and Conservative MP for South Holland, and a growing anti-wind power movement in some parts of the coalition. It is already difficult to win planning permission for onshore windfarms, particularly in Lincolnshire, where the Conservative-run county council has introduced tough hurdles for turbine schemes. Hayes, who took the energy portfolio last autumn, has complained that too many wind turbines have been \"peppered\" across the UK without enough consideration for the countryside and people's homes, adding that \"enough is enough\". \"We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities. I can't single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and pleasant land,\" he said in an interview. Lincolnshire county council explained on its website why new guidelines for windfarms were needed, saying \"although supportive of alternative energy, councillors questioned the efficiency of turbines and their impact on the county's residents, landscapes and tourism industry\". More than 100 Conservative backbenchers wrote to David Cameron earlier this year, calling on him to scale back subsidies to onshore windfarms, on the grounds they were an eyesore and economically inefficient. Their letter was followed up by a rash of comments from the chancellor, George Osborne, about the dangers of Britain moving faster on \"green\" energy than competitors in Europe, resulting in the UK industry facing higher costs. A Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) spokesman declined to comment on Hayes's thoughts about the Heckington Fen project, saying simply that it was not a decision for him to take. \"Onshore wind has an important role to play as part of a balanced energy mix. This development will enhance our energy security and help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" the spokesman added.

      "body": "<p>Are you a billionaire or a private equity baron seeking finance for a big leveraged buyout? Your luck is in. There's a global shortage of junk bonds, apparently, and would-be investors are awash with cash looking for a home. They are weary of chasing down yields on existing corporate debt, and they want ambitious chief executives and private equity firms to do new deals. The debt ammunition, reflecting four years of ultra-loose monetary policy from central banks, is promised at prices that look terrific by historical yardsticks. Terrific for the borrower, that is.</p> <p>John Malone, the so-called \"king of cable\" from the US, is not the type to ignore such an invitation.

In the US, Michael Dell launched a $24.4bn bid for his old PC maker, Dell, with the help of a consortium of private equity firms plus Microsoft. Next in line may be EE, which despite its silly name is the UK's largest mobile phone operator. Two groups of private equity outfits are said to be eyeing EE for a \u00a310bn bid.</p> <p>Happy days, then, in the land of leverage. But how's life for small UK companies looking for loans for expansion? Not so wonderful, according to the business secretary, Vince Cable. Here is his sober assessment this week: \"The cost of borrowing for smaller companies is flat or even increasing.

A world where the leveraged buy-out brigade can party like it's 2006 while others are locked out? If you're an optimist, you might say the locks will soon be removed. According to this theory, the swagger in top-end finance will spread confidence, stir economies and ensure oil reaches the stickier parts of the banking system.</p> <p>Well, maybe. An alternative view is that cart and horse are mis-arranged. Or, to use the metaphor of Bob Janjuah, Nomura's famously bearish strategist, central banks are engaged in a hopeless attempt to turn water into wine by persisting \"with the idea that some form of debt-fuelled asset price elevation will lead to real wealth creation, which in turn will fix all our ills\".</p> <p>Real wealth, Janjuah thinks, can only be created by \"innovation and hard work in the private sector, with policymakers, the financial sector and financial markets there to aid and encourage/incentivise\". He fears central banks' synthetic concoction will intoxicate briefly but prove poisonous. He predicts a \"final parabolic spike up\" for stock markets before a loss of faith in the money miracle.</p> <p>He's right to worry. At a push, one might argue that the Dell buyout is a brave attempt to create real wealth by reinventing the firm beyond the harsh glare of the stock market. But a leveraged buyout mini-boom in the midst of economic stagnation and while SME funding is still a struggle? That does not feel like the right kind of progress.</p> <h2>Ethical Barclays? Four questions for Antony Jenkins</h2> <p>\"We've heard a lot of good intentions. What we want is some concrete evidence,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the banking standards commission, at the end of a three-hour session this week with Barclays' chief executive, Antony Jenkins, and the bank's chairman, Sir David Walker.</p> <p>Tyrie was right. It was nice to hear that Jenkins has appointed 1,000 \"values leaders\" to preach a gospel of doing the right thing. But we need concrete. Jenkins's moment arrives on Tuesday with his first strategy day for investors. The heart of the event will be cuts in the investment banking side, where the arithmetic has been transformed by ringfencing and higher capital cushions. Then he has to decide if Barclays wants to be in business banking in Spain, Italy and parts of Asia.</p> <p>Those announcements will obsess the City. The outside world, though, wants to know what an ethical bank looks like. Here are a few points that Jenkins must answer to be taken seriously:</p> <p>\u2022 Which activities will Barclays close down out of principle? It's not illegal to help clients save tax, but is the bank in that game now? Members of Tyrie's committee have complained that the structured capital markets (SCM) unit was engaged in \"industrial scale tax avoidance\". Barclays disputes the description. But has SCM been disbanded?</p> <p>\u2022 How has he responded to his first ethical test, the revelation that a senior executive at Barclays Wealth America shredded the single copy of a commissioned report that alleged the unit was pursuing \"revenue at all costs\" and had a culture that was \"actively hostile to compliance\"? The executive resigned last month, but how has Jenkins reacted to the report's contents?</p> <p>\u2022 What is a fair division of the spoils between shareholders and employees? Former chairman Marcus Agius enraged investors last year with his wishy-washypledge to \"rebalance\" after handing out bonuses of \u00a32.1bn and dividends of only \u00a3700m. It's time to give the phrase some meaning.</p> <p>\u2022 Who will take personal responsibilty for approving major financial products? The PPI misselling scandal was different from others in that the boards of banks could not claim ignorance of what was happening. PPI, at its height, was generating huge profits at fat margins. The warning signs were there, but directors chose to take the profits and cross their fingers. What's the process for ensuring there is no repeat?</p> <h2>US online poker prohibition eases</h2> <p>Six years after the US authorities decided they'd had enough of online poker companies flouting their gambling laws and launched a clampdown, the end of prohibition is slowly happening. New Jersey is the latest state to say it will consider the licensing of online casinos and poker. Shares in Bwin.party digital, the oddly named European online leader, rose 16% on Friday.</p> <p>Poker is the great American card game, so it was always likely that online licensing would come eventually. Lest we forget, though, recall the madness of allowing Partygaming, one half of pre-merger Bwin, to list on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 and, indeed, briefly enter the FTSE 100 index.</p> <p>The prospectus breezily confessed to the hostility of the US justice department and admitted that Partygaming's business relied on \"the apparent unwillingness or inability of regulators generally to bring actions against businesses with no physical presence in the country\". Never had a \"risk factor\" in a float prospectus been so neon-lit. Naturally, the managers of our pension funds, with only a few honourable exceptions, piled in.</p> <h2>Place your bets: Ocado v Tesco <br></h2> <p>Paddy Power, the bookie with a talent for publicity, jumped on Sir Stuart Rose's appointment as chairman of Ocado a couple of weeks ago to express its scepticism about the online grocer. It offered odds of 7-2 for Ocado's shares to do better than Tesco's over the course of this year. Tesco was priced at a prohibitive 1-6.</p> <p>Even at the time, Ocado looked the value bet. Now that its shares have galloped ahead by 17% since the off (versus a 3% gain for Tesco), 7-2 looks very decent in a two-horse race. Those odds were still available yesterday. This column has staked \u00a320. If it materialises, the \u00a370 profit will go to the Guardian's Christmas charity. A loss will be taken personally. But there's a long way to run. We shall see \u2026</p>",

But a leveraged buyout mini-boom in the midst of economic stagnation and while SME funding is still a struggle? That does not feel like the right kind of progress. Ethical Barclays? Four questions for Antony Jenkins \"We've heard a lot of good intentions. What we want is some concrete evidence,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the banking standards commission, at the end of a three-hour session this week with Barclays' chief executive, Antony Jenkins, and the bank's chairman, Sir David Walker. Tyrie was right. It was nice to hear that Jenkins has appointed 1,000 \"values leaders\" to preach a gospel of doing the right thing. But we need concrete. Jenkins's moment arrives on Tuesday with his first strategy day for investors. The heart of the event will be cuts in the investment banking side, where the arithmetic has been transformed by ringfencing and higher capital cushions. Then he has to decide if Barclays wants to be in business banking in Spain, Italy and parts of Asia. Those announcements will obsess the City. The outside world, though, wants to know what an ethical bank looks like. Here are a few points that Jenkins must answer to be taken seriously: \u2022 Which activities will Barclays close down out of principle? It's not illegal to help clients save tax, but is the bank in that game now? Members of Tyrie's committee have complained that the structured capital markets (SCM) unit was engaged in \"industrial scale tax avoidance\". Barclays disputes the description. But has SCM been disbanded? \u2022 How has he responded to his first ethical test, the revelation that a senior executive at Barclays Wealth America shredded the single copy of a commissioned report that alleged the unit was pursuing \"revenue at all costs\" and had a culture that was \"actively hostile to compliance\"? The executive resigned last month, but how has Jenkins reacted to the report's contents? \u2022 What is a fair division of the spoils between shareholders and employees? Former chairman Marcus Agius enraged investors last year with his wishy-washypledge to \"rebalance\" after handing out bonuses of \u00a32.1bn and dividends of only \u00a3700m. It's time to give the phrase some meaning. \u2022 Who will take personal responsibilty for approving major financial products? The PPI misselling scandal was different from others in that the boards of banks could not claim ignorance of what was happening. PPI, at its height, was generating huge profits at fat margins. The warning signs were there, but directors chose to take the profits and cross their fingers. What's the process for ensuring there is no repeat? US online poker prohibition eases Six years after the US authorities decided they'd had enough of online poker companies flouting their gambling laws and launched a clampdown, the end of prohibition is slowly happening. New Jersey is the latest state to say it will consider the licensing of online casinos and poker. Shares in Bwin.party digital, the oddly named European online leader, rose 16% on Friday. Poker is the great American card game, so it was always likely that online licensing would come eventually. Lest we forget, though, recall the madness of allowing Partygaming, one half of pre-merger Bwin, to list on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 and, indeed, briefly enter the FTSE 100 index. The prospectus breezily confessed to the hostility of the US justice department and admitted that Partygaming's business relied on \"the apparent unwillingness or inability of regulators generally to bring actions against businesses with no physical presence in the country\". Never had a \"risk factor\" in a float prospectus been so neon-lit. Naturally, the managers of our pension funds, with only a few honourable exceptions, piled in. Place your bets: Ocado v Tesco Paddy Power, the bookie with a talent for publicity, jumped on Sir Stuart Rose's appointment as chairman of Ocado a couple of weeks ago to express its scepticism about the online grocer. It offered odds of 7-2 for Ocado's shares to do better than Tesco's over the course of this year. Tesco was priced at a prohibitive 1-6. Even at the time, Ocado looked the value bet. Now that its shares have galloped ahead by 17% since the off (versus a 3% gain for Tesco), 7-2 looks very decent in a two-horse race. Those odds were still available yesterday. This column has staked \u00a320. If it materialises, the \u00a370 profit will go to the Guardian's Christmas charity. A loss will be taken personally. But there's a long way to run.

This site employs 200 people who produce at least 16,000 tonnes of frozen dishes in aluminium trays a year.

      "bodyText": "The French food firm that manufactured the Findus lasagnes found to contain up to 100% horsemeat specialises in frozen ready meals, a third of which are exported. Comigel, based in the north-eastern town of Metz, started business in 1976 and supplies tens of thousands of tonnes of frozen meals to about 15 countries. It was revealed on Friday that the company had alerted the major British food distributors with which it trades because of doubts about what it described as \"conformity of specifications\" of certain products, namely lasagnes and spaghetti dishes sold as containing beef by Tesco, Aldi and other UK supermarkets. Findus confirmed it had received the warning last Saturday. The Comigel group makes its frozen ready meals at its Tavola factory in Capellen, Luxembourg. This site employs 200 people who produce at least 16,000 tonnes of frozen dishes in aluminium trays a year. The meals are then sold either to frozen food firms such as Findus, or to chains such as Tesco and, in France, Cora and Auchan, which in turn sell them under different brand names. A quarter of the factory's output goes to canteens in schools, colleges, hospitals, retirement homes and companies, and public service restaurants in France. Comigel's director, Erick Lehagre, was at the Tavola factory on Friday, but was said to be unavailable for comment. Comigel could be subject to large fines as a result of the scandal, even if it is discovered that one of its suppliers is the source of the horsemeat. Lehagre, 53, is registered as living in large detached property in a village near Lille in northern France. Both he and his wife B\u00e9nedicte, a lawyer and municipal councillor, are keen golfers and leading members of the local club. website was unavailable on Friday morning, a note reading \"under construction\" superimposed on images of some of the company's products, among them a lasagne.

We use only the best ingredients and a generous pinch of imagination.\" So states Findus on its website.</p> <p>It would seem that imagination is now catching up with them, as revelations that Findus beef lasagne products contained up to 100% horsemeat threaten to leave the company's reputation in tatters.</p> <p>Analysts and experts believe a firm best known for crispy pancakes can recover its standing, but the way it handles the fallout will be crucial.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail researcher Conlumino, said: \"I think it's a PR nightmare and disaster for them and I think it's much worse than for a company like Tesco which sells a whole variety of products.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/08/how-horsemeat-scandal-unfolded-timeline\" title=\"\">Last month Tesco was among the retailers caught up in the first wave of revelations</a> that horse DNA had been found in meat products.</p> <p>\"Findus is a food brand associated with ready meals so when customers stand in front of a freezer in a supermarket, they have a lot of choice. People will look at the whole brand as tarnished and it will affect other products.</p> <p>\"Findus's reaction has been left wanting,\" Saunders added. \"If you go on their website, one of the products featured on the front page is the beef lasagne. I don't think they've been particularly clever or savvy at handling this.\"</p> <p>The company, which was bought by the private equity firm Lion Capital for \u00a31.1bn in 2008, also owns the Young's Seafood brand. It has been struggling financially after it was loaded with huge debts, and was forced into a major restructuring last year, including a \u00a3220m cash injection.</p> <p>A source familiar with Findus's operations said there has been \"huge pressure\" to lower the company's costs as it struggles to take its products upmarket.</p> <p>\"Until they could introduce new products for which consumers are willing to pay more - by taking frozen food upmarket - the only option they had was to reduce the cost line,\" the source said, adding that a series of executive changes meant the entire group was short of media expertise, leaving it exposed to the latest damaging revelations.</p> <p>\"No one in the company is responsible for communications as a full-time job. It is simply part of the marketing function, so the company is not set up&#xa0;to manage a crisis.\"</p> <p>The same source said the scandal would deal a further blow to the group's efforts to make frozen food more upmarket.</p> <p>\"The last thing Findus and the frozen food industry needs is a reputational scandal \u2026 They wanted to introduce new brands, new products and take the whole category upmarket \u2026 The bet by Lion Capital was that instead of being 2 for \u00a31 in Iceland, they could sell products for \u00a33.50 in Waitrose. This scandal is a horrible setback for the company and a food category that is very unloved.\"</p> <p>The company's website now has a statement apologising for \"any inconvenience caused\". It adds: \"We do not believe this to be a food safety issue. We are confident that we have fully resolved this supply chain issue. Fully compliant beef lasagne will be in stores again soon.\"</p> <p>Saunders agreed and said any plans to approach high-end retailers lay in tatters, but added: \"If this was just a Findus issue, the full spotlight would be turned on the company. I think retailers would take a slightly more aggressive approach if it hadn't already happened to some of their own-brand products. The biggest saviour for Findus is for something else to be discovered with another brand and another product. Making the blame more diffuse could be very helpful for them in the longer term.\"</p> <p>Tesco has already withdrawn its value burgers after they were found to contain horse DNA and Aldi has also pulled products from its shelves.</p> <p>The Findus brand is likely to remain on supermarket shelves for now, with Sainbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Tesco all saying they currently have no plans to remove other Findus products.</p> <p>Christian Mahne, a corporate reputation expert at Vetch Mahne, said any discovery in the food of phenylbutazone, an anti-inflammatory veterinary drug, could be disastrous.</p> <p>\"The problem will become a full-blown crisis if the banned agent phenylbutazone is found. With that the story moves from being a highly unfortunate, almost comical episode to being a serious major health scare. To weather the storm at best the company is going to need a thick skin and at worst some very expensive lawyers.\"</p>",

It would seem that imagination is now catching up with them, as revelations that Findus beef lasagne products contained up to 100% horsemeat threaten to leave the company's reputation in tatters. Analysts and experts believe a firm best known for crispy pancakes can recover its standing, but the way it handles the fallout will be crucial. Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail researcher Conlumino, said: \"I think it's a PR nightmare and disaster for them and I think it's much worse than for a company like Tesco which sells a whole variety of products.\" Last month Tesco was among the retailers caught up in the first wave of revelations that horse DNA had been found in meat products. \"Findus is a food brand associated with ready meals so when customers stand in front of a freezer in a supermarket, they have a lot of choice. People will look at the whole brand as tarnished and it will affect other products. \"Findus's reaction has been left wanting,\" Saunders added. \"If you go on their website, one of the products featured on the front page is the beef lasagne. I don't think they've been particularly clever or savvy at handling this.\" The company, which was bought by the private equity firm Lion Capital for \u00a31.1bn in 2008, also owns the Young's Seafood brand. It has been struggling financially after it was loaded with huge debts, and was forced into a major restructuring last year, including a \u00a3220m cash injection. A source familiar with Findus's operations said there has been \"huge pressure\" to lower the company's costs as it struggles to take its products upmarket. \"Until they could introduce new products for which consumers are willing to pay more - by taking frozen food upmarket - the only option they had was to reduce the cost line,\" the source said, adding that a series of executive changes meant the entire group was short of media expertise, leaving it exposed to the latest damaging revelations. \"No one in the company is responsible for communications as a full-time job. It is simply part of the marketing function, so the company is not set up to manage a crisis.\" The same source said the scandal would deal a further blow to the group's efforts to make frozen food more upmarket. \"The last thing Findus and the frozen food industry needs is a reputational scandal \u2026 They wanted to introduce new brands, new products and take the whole category upmarket \u2026 The bet by Lion Capital was that instead of being 2 for \u00a31 in Iceland, they could sell products for \u00a33.50 in Waitrose. This scandal is a horrible setback for the company and a food category that is very unloved.\" The company's website now has a statement apologising for \"any inconvenience caused\". It adds: \"We do not believe this to be a food safety issue. We are confident that we have fully resolved this supply chain issue. Fully compliant beef lasagne will be in stores again soon.\" Saunders agreed and said any plans to approach high-end retailers lay in tatters, but added: \"If this was just a Findus issue, the full spotlight would be turned on the company. I think retailers would take a slightly more aggressive approach if it hadn't already happened to some of their own-brand products. The biggest saviour for Findus is for something else to be discovered with another brand and another product. Making the blame more diffuse could be very helpful for them in the longer term.\" Tesco has already withdrawn its value burgers after they were found to contain horse DNA and Aldi has also pulled products from its shelves. The Findus brand is likely to remain on supermarket shelves for now, with Sainbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Tesco all saying they currently have no plans to remove other Findus products. Christian Mahne, a corporate reputation expert at Vetch Mahne, said any discovery in the food of phenylbutazone, an anti-inflammatory veterinary drug, could be disastrous. \"The problem will become a full-blown crisis if the banned agent phenylbutazone is found. With that the story moves from being a highly unfortunate, almost comical episode to being a serious major health scare. To weather the storm at best the company is going to need a thick skin and at worst some very expensive lawyers.\"",

European sales dropped 16% in the quarter compared with the previous year, as demand slumped. Japanese carmakers have also been punished in China, where a territorial dispute sparked anti-Japanese riots and boycotts last year.</p> <p>Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said the company's performance did not meet management expectations. \"This was primarily the result of difficult operating conditions in Europe for the entire industry, in China for Japanese carmakers, and in the US for Nissan.\"</p> <p>Peugeot, meanwhile, was the subject of a report that it could face some form of state ownership, after announcing a \u20ac3.9bn writedown on Thursday.

      "bodyText": "The crisis in Europe continues to hit carmakers around the world, as Nissan revealed tumbling sales and PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn wrote down the value of its automotive assets by \u20ac3.9bn (\u00a33.3bn) amid reports the French state might take a stake. BMW bucked the trend, however, selling more vehicles than ever before in January. Nissan said sales in the third quarter slumped 35% from the previous year to \u00a554bn (\u00a3370m), which it blamed on weak demand in Europe, China and the US. European sales dropped 16% in the quarter compared with the previous year, as demand slumped. Japanese carmakers have also been punished in China, where a territorial dispute sparked anti-Japanese riots and boycotts last year. Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said the company's performance did not meet management expectations. \"This was primarily the result of difficult operating conditions in Europe for the entire industry, in China for Japanese carmakers, and in the US for Nissan.\" Peugeot, meanwhile, was the subject of a report that it could face some form of state ownership, after announcing a \u20ac3.9bn writedown on Thursday. Asked whether France might invest in Peugeot to support the struggling carmaker, budget minister J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac told a TV station: \"It's possible. This company must not and cannot disappear and we must do what it takes for this company to survive.\" Reuters, however, quoted a source from the French finance ministry stating that government investment in Peugeot was not on the agenda. The source added that the company must focus on its joint co-operation agreement with General Motors. \"The priority for the group is to pursue its recovery plan, to strengthen its alliance with General Motors and to continue its development.\" Peugeot is among the companies worst hit by Europe's protracted slump in car sales.

      "bodyText": "Retailers must adapt to attract an army of silver-haired shoppers who will dominate the shopping centres of the future, a report out on Friday suggests. Relatively low growth and the ongoing switch to online shopping will drive a 10% drop in store numbers according to Conlumino, the retail market research company which produced the report. The over-55s will contribute nearly two-thirds of retail sales growth over the next decade as the baby boomers head into retirement. The ageing population will continue to fuel retail sales growth at 2.4% over the next 10 years reaching a total of \u00a3377bn by 2022. However, that growth runs significantly below the average 4.5% enjoyed during the late 1990s. Retailers will have to up their game to win sales, say the Conlumino analysts, rather than rely on a credit-fuelled boom. \"The older shopper of tomorrow is very different from today. They are a lot more savvy and demanding in terms of customer services and they are more attuned to fashion trends which they want adapted to suit their age bracket,\" says Neil Saunders from Conlumino. He says those retailers who can get the formula right have a great opportunity to take market share from some of today's brands who are still creating products for the \"Miss Marple generation\". David Atkins, chief executive of shopping centre developer Hammerson, which commissioned the report, says that its response to an ageing population will be to improve car-parking and add more restaurants and leisure facilities such as cinemas, so that older shoppers can relax with friends and family. He said catering and leisure facilities are likely to make up more than a quarter of Hammerson's shopping malls in future, compared with around 15% today and just 2% or 3% historically. Stores are also likely to be bigger to allow shoppers to see a wider range of products to be displayed and fit in new customers services such as collection points for good bought online. As a result, Conlumino predicts that, although the number of stores in the UK is set to fall, the total amount of retail floorspace in the UK will drop just 5%. In that changing environment, traditional high streets, many of which already have high shop vacancy rates as a result of the economic downturn, are likely to come under increasing pressure. Atkins says: \"It's about the experience and the catering that shopping centres can provide more readily than high streets.\" But Chris Wade, chief executive of Action for Market Towns, says local high streets are fighting back. \"Many small towns have been evolving in the past few years with award-winning projects such as local food markets and special events which are attracting people to high streets,\" Wade said. He said high streets would continue to be attractive because they tend to have a more interesting mix of shops including local independents which keep more money within the community. Wade said: \"If you spend money in an independent shop 80% of that money stays in the local community. At an out-of-town shopping centre it is usually less than 10%.\"",
