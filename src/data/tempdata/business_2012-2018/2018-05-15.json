      "bodyText": "Carillion collapsed as a result of \u201crecklessness, hubris and greed\u201d among directors who put their own financial rewards ahead of all other concerns, according to an excoriating report into the firm\u2019s demise that spreads the blame between board members, the government, accountants and regulators. The company, which managed huge construction projects and provided government services ranging from school meals to prison maintenance and NHS cleaning, slumped into insolvency in January. More than 2,000 people have since been made redundant. A damning 100-page report compiled by two select committees, published today, found that directors prioritised senior executive bonus payouts and dividends for shareholders even as the firm neared collapse, while treating pension payments as a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, said: \u201cSame old story. Same old greed. A board of directors too busy stuffing their mouths with gold to show any concern for the welfare of their workforce or their pensioners.\u201d In a joint statement with business committee chair Rachel Reeves, the pair called for a complete overhaul of Britain\u2019s corporate governance regime, saying the government had \u201clacked the decisiveness or bravery\u201d to do so. \u201cGovernment urgently needs to come to parliament with radical reforms to our creaking system of corporate accountability,\u201d Field said. \u201cBritish industry is too important to be left in the hands of the likes of the shysters at the top of Carillion.\u201d The report warned that without corporate governance reforms, \u201cCarillion could happen again, and soon\u201d. The committees also accused the so-called big four accounting firms \u2013 PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY \u2013 of operating as a \u201ccosy club\u201d. It claimed that KPMG had been \u201ccomplicit\u201d in signing off Carillion\u2019s \u201cincreasingly fantastical figures\u201d and internal auditor Deloitte had failed to identify \u201cterminal failings\u201d in risk management and financial controls, or \u201ctoo readily ignored them\u201d. Reeves said the big four, who took \u00a372m in fees in the decade leading up to Carillion\u2019s failure, enjoyed a \u201cparasitical\u201d relationship with companies whose books they were meant to scrutinise. \u201cThey are guilty of failing to tackle the crisis at Carillion, failing to insist the company paint a true picture of its crippling financial problems,\u201d she said. The report recommends that the competition regulator now considers whether the big four accountancy firms should be forcibly broken up to increase competition. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable backed calls to break them up. Long-Bailey-said: \u201cMillions racked up in debt, thousands of workers losing their jobs and pensions, and supply chain business at risk of collapse, because not only did the corporate auditors fail to hold Carillion\u2019s misbehaving managers to account, but because the government looked on in ignorance at the same time, proceeding to award contract after contract to a firm which had issued numerous profit warnings. \u201cThe breakup of the big four is only the first step. There needs to be a root-and-branch reform of the law in this area.\u201d Cable said it was time to \u201cshatter this cosy club to create a more competitive, truly diverse market\u201d. A KPMG spokesperson said: \u201cWe believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it\u2019s only right that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with the FRC\u2019s ongoing investigation. \u201cWe welcome any future review of our profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade [\u2026] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business models.\u201d Deloitte said it was \u201cdisappointed with the conclusions of the committees in regard to our role as internal auditors\u201d adding that it would take on board any lessons that could be learned from Carillion\u2019s collapse. More than 2,000 of Carillion\u2019s 19,500 UK staff have lost their jobs since its demise, although the Insolvency Service has found new employment for 11,618 people. The company\u2019s failure also saddled the government\u2019s Pension Protection Fund with an \u00a3800m liability, its largest ever, while 30,000 suppliers and subcontractors are waiting in vain for \u00a32bn in bills owed by the company. Creditors have been told they are likely to get back less than 1p for every \u00a31 they are owed. Taxpayers face at least \u00a3150m in clean-up costs, while multimillion-pound hospital projects intended to alleviate pressure on NHS services \u2013 the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Birmingham \u2013 are on hold indefinitely. The report by the two committees placed most of the blame on the company\u2019s \u201cmyopic\u201d board, and says the government\u2019s Insolvency Service should consider recommending that they be banned from holding directorships in future. The committees singled out Carillion\u2019s finance chief, Richard Adam, chief executive Richard Howson and chairman Philip Green for particular criticism. The trio presented themselves as \u201cself-pitying victims of a maelstrom of coincidental and unforeseeable mishaps\u201d including contracts in the Middle East that went sour. In fact, the committees found, the company\u2019s problems were far more deep-rooted. \u201cCarillion\u2019s rise and spectacular fall was a story of recklessness, hubris and greed,\u201d the report said. \u201cIts business model was a relentless dash for cash, driven by acquisitions, rising debt, expansion into new markets and exploitation of suppliers. \u201cIt presented accounts that misrepresented the reality of the business, and increased its dividend every year, come what may,\u201d the report said, adding that the company\u2019s pension scheme was \u201ctreated with contempt\u201d. \u201cEven as the company very publicly began to unravel, the board was concerned with increasing and protecting generous executive bonuses,\u201d MPs on the committees added. The report named Adam as the \u201carchitect of Carillion\u2019s aggressive accounting policies\u201d, which disguised the firm\u2019s financial woes until July last year, when it admitted that \u00a3729m of revenues it had previously accounted for were unlikely to be obtainable. MPs accused him of considering pension payments a \u201cwaste of money\u201d, adding that pension trustees who sought increased contributions were \u201coutgunned\u201d by directors. They also criticised Adam\u2019s sale of nearly \u00a3800,000 of shares shortly after retiring, a decision they described as \u201cthe actions of a man who knew where the company was heading\u201d. \u201cDespite retiring over a year before Carillion went into insolvency, I am deeply saddened by the events that have since overtaken the company,\u201d Adam said. But he rejected the \u201cunwarranted conclusions\u201d of the committees regarding his role in the company, saying comments had been \u201cmisattributed to me\u201d. Green, a boardroom veteran and former adviser to David Cameron on corporate responsibility, said he and the board had \u201calways strived to act in the interests of the company and all its stakeholders\u201d. \u201cWhilst much of the commentary in today\u2019s report fails to understand and accurately reflect the true, more complex picture of events, the committee has highlighted lessons which can be learned by the board, the government and the wider industry.\u201d Howson declined to comment. The government also came in for criticism for failing to address failures in corporate governance rules that allowed Carillion to become a \u201cgiant and unsustainable corporate timebomb\u201d. The report called for an \u201cambitious and wide-ranging set of reforms\u201d to overhaul the UK\u2019s system of corporate accountability. Theresa May promised to \u201cchange the way big business is governed\u201d in 2016 during the first major speech of her campaign to lead the Conservative party and the country after Cameron\u2019s resignation. She has since been accused of watering down planned reforms to corporate governance. It emerged after Carillion\u2019s collapse that the government continued to award large contracts to the firm even after it knew it was in financial trouble. The Guardian revealed earlier this year that the government knew in December last year of a plan that could have retrieved \u00a3364m from the company but did not push directors to adopt it. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority has been the continued, safe running of public services and to minimise the impact of Carillion\u2019s insolvency. The plans we put in place have ensured this. The government wants to see a strong and varied supplier base where companies of all sizes benefit from long-term and stable government contracts. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have recently announced a number of measures to support government suppliers \u2013 strengthening our commitment to prompt payment; protecting staff, businesses and small suppliers from irresponsible directors. \u201cWe welcome the report from the joint select committee and will respond fully in due course.\u201d MPs also lashed out at regulators the Financial Reporting Council and the Pensions Regulator, branding them \u201cchronically passive\u201d. They said the two bodies were \u201ctoo timid to make effective use of the powers they have\u201d and should be given greater power, although they warned that this would require significant cultural change. In the case of the Pensions Regulator, they said this might require new leadership. Chief executive Lesley Titcomb was criticised by MPs for an unconvincing showing during an evidence session with the two committees earlier this year. The FRC said it was making \u201cgood progress\u201d with an investigation into Carillion, one of the largest cases it has ever taken on.",

      "bodyText": "Apart from the junior director who tried to speak against the delusion in Carillion\u2019s boardroom, nobody emerges with credit from the two select committees\u2019 post-mortem on the contracting firm. The other directors, led by chairman Philip Green, chief executive Richard Howson and finance director Richard Adam, were directly responsible for the failure because they were either \u201cnegligently ignorant of the rotten culture\u201d or complicit in it. But the entire system of checks and balances failed. The auditors, KPMG, were useless, as was the audit industry\u2019s passive regulator. The government, in the form of the Crown Representative, was asleep. The Pensions Regulator was feeble. City advisers to Carillion were paid to be supine. Big shareholders were not inquisitive. None of those judgments will surprise those who followed the evidence sessions, but the MPs\u2019 report will count for little unless it forces action from government. Three areas are priorities. First, reform the auditing industry. The public lost faith in auditors when HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland collapsed without a squeak of warning from the people signing off the accounts. Now there\u2019s Carillion, where the report accuses KMPG, which had the auditing gig for 19 years, of failing to exercise professional scepticism \u2013 the basic requirement of the job. The MPs\u2019 prescription is not original, but is correct. Get the Competition and Markets Authority to look at two specific proposals: a breakup of the big four auditors or a separation of the auditing arms from their consultancy operations. Concentration in this market has now reached absurd levels \u2013 the big four are auditors to 97% of FTSE 350 companies. Carillion perfectly illustrated the closed shop in action. KMPG approved the accounts, Deloitte advised the board on risk management, and EY was consulted on turnaround plans. That left the field clear for PwC to name its price as adviser to the Official Receiver. A proper shakeup of the industry would probably mean an increase in the cost of audits, but that will be money well spent if it means more competition and higher standards. \u201cKPMG\u2019s long and complacent tenure auditing Carillion was not an isolated failure,\u201d says the report. \u201cIt was symptomatic of a market which works for members of the oligopoly but fails the wider economy.\u201d Spot on. Second, ministers need to understand the risks they take when they outsource work to companies of Carillion\u2019s size. The failed firm had 450 government contracts and the Crown Representative, looking out for taxpayers\u2019 interests, had no insight into how badly things were going wrong. The huge profit warning in July 2017, which marked the beginning of the end, was a complete shock in Whitehall. The report is short on specific proposals, other than telling ministers to appreciate that \u201cthe cheapest bid is not always the best\u201d. But there are good ideas around, and some have even come from the contractors\u2019 side of fence. Rupert Soames, the chief executive who led the rescue of Serco to prevent an earlier Carillion-style calamity, has suggested a few: open-book accounting so that the Cabinet Office and National Audit Office have the numbers; bank-style \u201cliving wills\u201d so that contracts can be handed back to government without huge costs to the public purse; and a code of conduct that, on the supplier\u2019s side, would involve conservative financing, timely payment of subcontractors, and adequately funded pension schemes. The government is free to demand all that and more. It just requires the penny to drop that, when you\u2019re buying \u00a3200bn of goods and services from the private sector each year, you can change the way business is conducted. The third priority is pensions, since Carillion dumped an \u00a3800m liability on the industry lifeboat. The Pensions Regulator\u2019s threats were hollow and its bluff was called, the report says. The directors were allowed to keep paying a dividend to shareholders that was plainly unaffordable. It\u2019s now too late for excuses or pleas about insufficient powers. The MPs\u2019 hard judgment is that \u201ca tentative and apologetic approach is ingrained\u201d at the regulator and \u201cthe current leadership\u201d may not be equipped for cultural change. That sounds like a call for Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive, to go. It would be personally tough on her, since she arrived in 2015, by which time the worst mistakes on Carillion had been made, but she should take the hint. A pensions regulator needs to be feared. The overall report is impressive \u2013 it drips with anger and is strong on detail. It would be disgrace if it fell between the cracks of Brexit. It is essential that the government makes a point-by-point response \u2013 starting with the auditors, who escaped from the scene of the banking catastrophe but whose moment in the spotlight is now.",

It employs 43,000 people, with more than 19,000 in the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> Notable construction projects</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 GCHQ government communications centre in Cheltenham (2003)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Beetham Tower, Manchester (2006)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 HS1 (2007)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 London Olympics Media Centre - now BT Sport HQ (2011)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Heathrow terminal 5 (2011)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 The Library of Birmingham (2013)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Liverpool FC Anfield stadium expansion (2016)~</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Smethwick (due 2019)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Aberdeen bypass (due 2018)</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Royal Liverpool University Hospital (due 2018, behind schedule)</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Government contracts</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 NHS \u2013 managed 200 operating theatres; 11,800 beds; made 18,500 patient meals a day</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Transport \u2013 \u201csmart motorways\u201d to monitor traffic and ease congestion; work on HS2; track renewal for Network Rail; Crossrail contractor</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Defence \u2013 maintained 50,000 armed forces\u2019 houses; a \u00a3680m contract to provide 130 new buildings in Aldershot and Salisbury plain for troops returning from Germany</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Education \u2013 cleaning and meals for 875 schools</p>\n    <p>\u2022 Prisons \u2013 maintained 50% of UK prisons.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A proper shakeup of the industry would probably mean an increase in the cost of audits, but that will be money well spent if it means more competition and higher standards. \u201cKPMG\u2019s long and complacent tenure auditing Carillion was not an isolated failure,\u201d says the report. \u201cIt was symptomatic of a market which works for members of the oligopoly but fails the wider economy.\u201d Spot on.</p> \n<p>Second, ministers need to understand the risks they take when they outsource work to companies of Carillion\u2019s size. The failed firm had 450 government contracts and the Crown Representative, looking out for taxpayers\u2019 interests, had no insight into how badly things were going wrong. The huge profit warning in July 2017, which marked the beginning of the end, was a complete shock in Whitehall.</p> \n<p>The report is short on specific proposals, other than telling ministers to appreciate that \u201cthe cheapest bid is not always the best\u201d. But there are good ideas around, and some have even come from the contractors\u2019 side of fence.</p> \n<p>Rupert Soames, the chief executive who led the rescue of Serco to prevent an earlier Carillion-style calamity, has suggested a few: open-book accounting so that the Cabinet Office and National Audit Office have the numbers; bank-style \u201cliving wills\u201d so that contracts can be handed back to government without huge costs to the public purse; and a code of conduct that, on the supplier\u2019s side, would involve conservative financing, timely payment of subcontractors, and adequately funded pension schemes.</p> \n<p>The government is free to demand all that and more. It just requires the penny to drop that, when you\u2019re buying \u00a3200bn of goods and services from the private sector each year, you can change the way business is conducted.</p> \n<p>The third priority is pensions, since Carillion dumped an \u00a3800m liability on the industry lifeboat. The Pensions Regulator\u2019s threats were hollow and its bluff was called, the report says. The directors were allowed to keep paying a dividend to shareholders that was plainly unaffordable.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s now too late for excuses or pleas about insufficient powers. The MPs\u2019 hard judgment is that \u201ca tentative and apologetic approach is ingrained\u201d at the regulator and \u201cthe current leadership\u201d may not be equipped for cultural change. That sounds like a call for Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive, to go. It would be personally tough on her, since she arrived in 2015, by which time the worst mistakes on Carillion had been made, but she should take the hint. A pensions regulator needs to be feared.</p> \n<p>The overall report is impressive \u2013 it drips with anger and is strong on detail. It would be disgrace if it fell between the cracks of Brexit. It is essential that the government makes a point-by-point response \u2013 starting with the auditors, who escaped from the scene of the banking catastrophe but whose moment in the spotlight is now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A report into the collapse of Carillion by two parliamentary select committees has spread the blame liberally among the directors of the company, its auditors, the regulators and the government. Here are the key findings from the report: Directors The committees found that the directors sought to increase dividends and protect executive bonuses as the company began to unravel, while funding the pension scheme was \u201ctreated with contempt\u201d. Their report urged the government\u2019s Insolvency Service, which is still trying to salvage jobs from the wreckage of Carillion, to consider whether directors breached their duties under the Companies Act. If so, they could be recommended to the secretary of state for business for disqualification from company directorship. The report singled out three directors in particular. Richard Adam \u2013 chief financial officer 2006-17 Chartered accountant who qualified with KPMG. Former finance director of multiple companies over 30 years, including Associated British Ports. What Carillion said: \u201cStrong track record in cost control, cash-flow and pension scheme risk management.\u201d What the report said: \u201cArchitect of Carillion\u2019s aggressive accounting policies\u201d that masked the company\u2019s mounting financial problems. \u201cResolutely refused to make adequate contributions to the company\u2019s pension schemes, which he considered a \u2018waste of money\u2019\u201d. Sale of nearly \u00a3800,000 in shares immediately after retirement amounted to \u201cthe actions of a man who knew where the company was heading\u201d. Richard Howson \u2013 chief executive 2012-17 Civil engineer who had been with Carillion in various roles since 1999 and was previously chief operating officer. What Carillion said: \u201cSignificant experience in operational delivery, management of commercial positions and performance improvement.\u201d What the report said: \u201cFigurehead for a business that careered progressively out of control under his misguidedly self-assured leadership\u201d. \u201cSought to distance himself from problems in the company that were \u2018from the long-term and from a long time ago\u2019\u201d. \u201cDemonstrated little grasp of the unsustainability of Carillion\u2019s business model or the basic failings of governance that lay at the root of its problems\u201d. \u201cHe was either unaware of the significant long-term problems it was facing, or chose not to act on them,\u201d adding that he appeared surprised to have been sacked in 2017. \u201cHowson should accept that, as the longstanding leader who took Carillion to the brink, he was part of the problem rather than part of the solution\u201d. Philip Green \u2013 chairman Former chief executive of United Utilities and senior executive at firms including Reuters, Saga and DHL. Chaired Prince Harry\u2019s Lesotho-focused charity Sentebale and advised David Cameron on corporate responsibility. What Carillion said: \u201cStrong track record in corporate responsibility.\u201d What the report said: \u201cMr Green appears to have interpreted his role as chairman as that of cheerleader-in-chief\u201d. \u201cAn unquestioning optimist, an outlook he maintained in a delusional, upbeat assessment of the company\u2019s prospects only days before it began its public decline. \u201cWhile the company\u2019s senior executives were fired, Mr Green continued to insist that he was the man to lead a turnaround of the company as head of a \u2018new leadership team\u2019. \u201cAs leader of the board he was both responsible and culpable\u201d. Government The report makes clear that the directors were responsible for Carillion\u2019s collapse and said the government did a \u201ccompetent job in clearing up the mess\u201d. However, it also said the government had \u201clacked the decisiveness or bravery\u201d to tackle a culture of corporate recklessness. Successive governments sought to outsource work on the cheap, a practice that \u201cmade such a collapse, if not inevitable, then at least a distinct possibility\u201d. \u201cThe government\u2019s drive for cost savings can itself come at a price: the cheapest bid is not always the best\u201d. Report criticised the \u201csemi-professional part-time system\u201d under which a crown representative from the Cabinet Office oversees major government contractors in financial difficulty. \u201cThe consequences of this are clear in the taxpayer being left to foot so much of the bill for the Carillion clean-up operation\u201d. Measures intended to protect small business suppliers to government contractors, such as the Prompt Payment Code, have been \u201cwholly ineffective\u201d. The Guardian has previously revealed that the government failed to back a plan that could have retrieved \u00a3364m from Carillion. Auditors One of the most eye-catching suggestions in the report is that the big four auditors \u2013 KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte \u2013 be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority, which should consider whether they ought to be broken up forcibly. The quartet earned \u00a372m from the company in 10 years and were described as a \u201ccosy club incapable of providing the degree of independent challenge needed\u201d. KPMG Received \u00a329m in fees over 19 years as Carillion\u2019s auditor. Branded \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the company\u2019s \u201cquestionable\u201d accounting practices, the report said \u201ccomplacently signing off its directors\u2019 increasingly fantastical figures\u201d. Deloitte Internal auditor was paid more than \u00a310m but \u201cfailed in its risk management and financial controls role\u201d. Did not identify \u201cterminal failings\u201d in risk management and financial controls, or \u201ctoo readily ignored them\u201d. EY Took \u00a310.8m for \u201csix months of failed turnaround advice\u201d. Advised on deferral of payments to pension scheme, HMRC and suppliers. \u201cTheir own fees, however, were not deferred\u201d. PwC Hired to manage insolvency as the only auditor with no conflict of interest, meaning it could \u201cname its price\u201d. Fees for first eight weeks\u2019 work alone was \u00a320.4m. \u201cPwC are continuing to gain from Carillion, effectively writing their own pay cheque, without adequate scrutiny\u201d. Regulators Accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Council and the Pension Regulator stand accused of being \u201cchronically passive\u201d. \u201cWe have no confidence in our regulators,\u201d the report said. \u201cFRC and TPR share a passive, reactive mindset and are too timid to make effective use of the powers they have.\u201d The Financial Reporting Council \u201cContent with apportioning blame once disaster has struck\u201d rather than flagging issues of concern to avoid business failures. Should get new powers from government \u201cto be a much more aggressive and proactive regulator\u201d but this will require a \u201csignificant shift in culture\u201d. The Pension Regulator Made \u201cempty threats\u201d to use powers to force Carillion to increase pension contributions. It has never used those powers in 13 years. \u201cFailed in all its objectives regarding the Carillion pension scheme\u201d. Launched investigation into recovering funds when there was no money left. Needs greater powers but \u201cwe are far from convinced that TPR\u2019s current leadership is equipped to effect that change\u201d.",

A 2016 review of Carillion\u2019s contract to build the Royal Liverpool Hospital \u2013 which remains delayed indefinitely \u2013 reported it was making a loss.

The number of billionaires worldwide increased by 14.9% to 2,754 in 2017 as the wealthy benefited from the \u201cremarkable performances in equity markets and global economy\u201d, according to a report by ultra-rich research firm Wealth-X. The Wealth-X billionaire census 2018, published on Tuesday, found a \u201cdramatic improvement\u201d in billionaires\u2019 assets, with their combined wealth increasing by $1.8bn \u2013 or 24% \u2013 to $9.2tn, as the very rich streak further away from the general population. \u201cAlthough the year 2017 had its fair share of political upheaval, the remarkable performances in equity markets and the global economy supported robust wealth gains across the financial, commodity, technology and industrial sector,\u201d Winston Chesterfield, a director of Wealth-X, said. \u201cIn a rapidly shifting geopolitical environment, the influence on the world economy of this most exclusive group of individuals is continuing to rise.\u201d The 10 richest billionaires collectively hold assets worth more than $660bn. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the world\u2019s richest person. His fortune has increased by $34.2bn in the past year to take his net worth to $133bn. In just one day last month, Bezos\u2019s fortune increased by $12bn, after Amazon reported much higher than expected profits. Bezos, 54, who founded Amazon in his Seattle garage in 1994, owns 16% of the retailer. He also owns all of space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper, which he bought for $250m in 2013. The US is home to by far the largest population of billionaires, with 680, a 10% increase on 2016. However, the number of super-wealthy in China are increasing quickly, with a 36% increase to 338 billionaires.

The UK\u2019s richest person is petrochemicals industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, who this week told the Sunday Times Rich List that it had been underestimating his wealth. The newspaper bumped Ratcliffe, 65, from 18th to first place in its rich list, with a \u00a321bn fortune.

      "bodyText": "Markets were struggling for direction for most of the day, with the exception of Wall Street which moved sharply lower on renewed worries about the US/China trade talks, a rising dollar and falling bond yields. Several European markets suffered from a spate of profit taking, while the volatility of Brent crude - surging to new three and a half year highs, falling back then moving up once more - did little to help the FTSE 100. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 12 points or 0.16% at 7722.98 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.06% to 12,970.04 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.23% at 5553.16 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.31% to 24,297.17 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.49% at 10,207.6 In Greece, the Athens market fell 2.04% to 799.37 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 210 points or 0.84%. As for Brent crude, it is up 0.63% at $78.72 a barrel, having earlier touched $79.47. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 246 points. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Equity benchmarks are in the red as traders become more hawkish. The jump in US government bond yields is prompting traders to switch out of stocks and into bonds. US indices have reached multi-week highs recently on optimism about the US and China coming to a trade deal, and today investors are banking their profits. With Wall Street down as the dollar rises, the FTSE 100 is not benefiting as much as might be expected from the weak pound. The UK\u2019s leading index is up just 0.3%, perhaps because of the dip in the oil price. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A dominant dollar helped lead to a seriously down in the dumps Dow Jones this Tuesday, while the FTSE lost its lunchtime momentum. Though not quite as strong as analysts\u2019 were expecting, the latest US retail sales figures were solid enough to give the dollar a hefty hawkish boost. The greenback was propelled 0.7% higher against the pound, with cable nearing sub-$1.348 2018 lows, while against the euro it was up 0.8%, forcing the single currency under $1.185. This, combined with the USA\u2019s ambassador to China Terry Branstad stating that the two countries were still \u2018very far apart\u2019 on the issue of trade, caused the Dow Jones to have an absolutely miserable time of it after the bell. The index plunged nearly 200 points as the session got underway, trudging back towards 24700 having almost grazed a 2 month high of 25000 on Monday. Normally the sight of a cable-collapse would be like catnip for the FTSE. And yes, the UK index did manage to climb 25 or so points as the day went on. However, that the FTSE can perhaps feel aggrieved that it couldn\u2019t wring more juice from sterling\u2019s slide. Beyond the bearishness plaguing the Dow Jones, the fact Brent Crude has pulled back from its $79 per barrel is potentially responsible for the index not fully taking flight; but even then, BP and Shell are still up around 1.5% apiece, showing investors are still willing to drink down the oil colossi even if the black stuff is off its 3 and a half year peak. Investors may simply have slight reservations about sending the FTSE much higher than it currently is, given that it the index didn\u2019t last long at its 7800-teasing peak back in mid-January. The strengthening dollar after the retail sales figures has taken some of the shine off the oil price, with Brent crude now in negative territory for the day, down 0.17% at $78.10 a barrel. At its peak during the day, Brent hit $79.47, which analysts saying $80 or even $100 could be on the horizon. Back with the UK employment figures and the fall in EU workers, and the Press Association has more details: Labour market data released by the Office for National Statistics showed the fall [in the number of EU nationals] was driven by a steep drop in the number of workers from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. In the latest period, there were an estimated 917,000 nationals of the so-called EUA8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - in work in the UK. This was down by 91,000 compared to January-March in 2017, the largest annual decrease since comparable records started in 1997. Jonathan Portes, professor of Economics at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cToday\u2019s labour market statistics show a year-on-year fall in the number of European nationals working here, for the first time since the aftermath of the recession. \u201cA combination of factors - a slowing economy here combined with recovery on the continent, but also the political and psychological impact of the Brexit vote - have made the UK a significantly less attractive place to live and work.\u201d Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, pointed to figures for EU-born workers, which he said were 155,000 higher than in the same quarter before the referendum. He said: \u201cThese new labour force figures dispose of any claim of a Brexodus.\u201d Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThe employment rate of A8 migrants in the UK is close to record highs, at more than 85%. Despite that, the number of A8 migrants working in the UK has declined. \u201cThese figures are consistent with the possibility that there has been net emigration of A8 citizens but don\u2019t show it conclusively - we\u2019ll need a few more months of data to see whether this is a short-term blip or a real trend. \u201cWe do know from other migration figures that over the last couple of years, net migration from A8 countries has fallen proportionally more than it has from the other parts of the EU....\u201d The year-on-year dip in EUA8 workers was not mirrored across other groups of member states. There were 355,000 Romanians and Bulgarians employed in the UK between January and March, up from an estimated 297,000 in the first three months of last year. It is the second highest figure recorded since restrictions on citizens of the two countries working in Britain were lifted in January 2014. The number of nationals of 14 long-term EU member states including Germany, Italy, Spain and France also showed a slight increase - but remained at just over one million. Donald Trump\u2019s surprise move to support Chinese group ZTE over the weekend prompted hopes of progress in trade talks between the US and China. But ahead of new meetings in Washington, US ambassador to China Terry Branstad has said the two sides were still \u201cvery far apart,\u201d prompting an opening fall on US stock markets. So despite the reasonable US retail sales figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 151 points or 0.59% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.42% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.67%. The retail sales figures have lifted expectations of a series of US rate rises this year, and helped push the dollar higher. Sterling has slipped to a new low for the year of $1.3457, down 0.7%. A US spending boom could be getting underway, says Nordsea\u2019s chief analyst: US retail sales edged up in April with signs of wage growth and the recent tax cuts helping to offset some of the pressure on consumer spending from higher petrol prices. Sales grew by 0.3% last month, in line with expectations, but the March figure was revised up to show a 0.8% surge compared to the initial estimate of a 0.6% rise. Core retail sales, excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, climbed by 0.4% in April. Year on year, sales rose 4.7%. Economist James Knightley at ING Bank said: US retail sales have been heavily distorted over the past 6-9 month, but we are finally getting some \u201ccleaner\u201d data that suggests households are in good spirits and are spending in the new season. US retail sales rose 0.3%MoM in April, which was in line with expectations, but there were some nice upward revisions to March\u2019s data from 0.6% growth to 0.8% growth. Importantly, the \u201ccontrol\u201d group, which excludes very volatile items such as food, autos, building materials and gasoline and supposedly better matches consumer spending within GDP, was up 0.4% after a 0.5% gain in March. February was revised up a tenth of a percentage point too. Retail sales have been difficult to interpret for much of the past year. In particular, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused extensive damage that triggered a wave of spending as households replaced lost items in Sep-Nov 2017. In fact retail sales soared a cumulative 3.5% during the period only to fall back in Dec, Jan and Feb (although Feb has now been revised up to being flat). Now that these distortions are out the way we expect upcoming data to show households continuing to spend strongly. Employment is rising, wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people\u2019s pockets. With consumer confidence at strong levels, consumer spending growth is a key factor behind our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for the US this year. In turn, this leads us to look for a further three Federal Reserve rate rises in 2018. Over in the financial markets, the oil price has hit a new three and a half-year high. Brent crude is changing hands at $79.30 per barrel, the highest since late 2014. Prices have been rising since America pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last week - a move likely to take some Iranian oil production off the market. Crude prices have jumped by 75% since June 2017, which has led to higher transport costs and petrol price at the pumps. That in turn pushed up inflation, and is one reason why real wages in the UK had been shrinking (although not any more) The drop in the number of EU workers in Britain could also be a warning sign for UK firms. The UK labour market certainly looks tight, with inactivity and employment both at record highs - and employers facing 806,000 vacancies in the last quarter. Gerwyn Davies of CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, says bosses may find it harder to recruit staff: \u201cEmployers need to be better prepared for a changing and tighter labour market. Labour supply looks set to fall further in the coming months, partly due to an abrupt plateauing in the number of EU citizens in employment in the UK, as this morning\u2019s figures show. Greater investment in skills is needed to offset recruitment difficulties and increase productivity growth alongside more workforce planning activity.\u201d Britain\u2019s hospitals and social services could be hurt by the 28,000 decline in EU workers in Britain over the last 12 months. So warns Dr Heather Rolfe of The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research. She explains: This represents a reduction in arrivals and increase in departures of EU citizens, which employers explain by uncertain futures and hostility. The reverse trend is shown by non-EU nationals in employment who increased in number by 20,000. This may be explained in part by employers making more use of the visa system when faced with skills shortages.... \u201cThese trends, in particular the fall in EU nationals working in the UK, are likely to affect the UK\u2019s economic performance and also services, with the NHS and social care under particular pressure\u201d. According to FullFact, EU immigrants make up about 5% of English NHS staff, and 10% of all doctors. The Resolution Foundation have sent over some useful charts, showing the state of the labour market: Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, sums up the picture: \u201cBritain started 2018 as it has spent much of the last decade, with more impressive jobs growth but little prospect of recovering from its disastrous record on pay. \u201cEmployment has hit a record high, driven by male employment breaking the 80 per cent barrier for the first time in nearly three decades. \u201cWhile the return to pay growth is very welcome it remains anemic and wages are still over \u00a3700 a year lower than they were a decade ago. The stark fall in productivity in recent months suggests that a strong pay recovery remain some way off.\u201d Britain\u2019s finance minister has welcomed the news that wages are outpacing inflation. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond said: \u201cGrowth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy. \u201cWe can be proud of our record on jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years and with our National Living Wage we are making sure that the lowest-paid feel the benefit with an extra \u00a32,000 a year. \u201cNow the focus has to be on ensuring that wages keep rising faster than inflation, so that living standards increase.\u201d I suspect that final sentence could be a coded warning about Brexit. Hammond will attend a crunch meeting of the government\u2019s Brexit sub committee this afternoon to discuss customs arrangements, where there\u2019s no sign of agreement. Theresa May\u2019s ministers are split over two options -- a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or a \u201cmax fac\u201d model, which would use technology to police the border. My colleague Andy Sparrow will be tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: Panmure Gordon analyst Simon French suspects Britain\u2019s labour market may be peaking - chiming with the IoD\u2019s warning earlier. Nearly two years after the Brexit vote, we can now see that the number of citizens from other European Union countries working in Britain has fallen. The ONS reports that the total EU workforce in Britain fell by 28,000 over the last year. That\u2019s the first annual decrease since January to March 2010, when the UK has fallen into recession after the financial crisis. Here\u2019s the details from today\u2019s labour market report: There were 28.73 million UK nationals working in the UK, 417,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 2.29 million EU nationals working in the UK, 28,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 1.25 million non-EU nationals working in the UK, 20,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 81.9% for EU nationals, higher than that for UK nationals (75.6%) and higher than that for non-EU nationals (63.0%) There was a sharp fall in the number of workers from Eastern European countries who joined the EU in 2004. The Press Association\u2019s Ian Jones has the details: The proportion of UK men in work has hit 80% for the first time since 1991 - despite fears that robots will eliminate millions of jobs: The Institute of Directors fears that companies are now struggling to find properly skilled and qualified workers. Seamus Nevin, the IoD\u2019s head of policy research says: \u201cYet again we\u2019ve seen great employment figures as the number of people in work increased and the number of people without work decreased. All of this suggests, however, that access to staff may be peaking as the labour market tightens. \u201cEmployers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit the people they need. Given access to skills is currently one of the highest concerns for IoD members, today\u2019s figures also highlight the imperative for government to reform the Tier 2 visa cap to allow employers to recruit the overseas workers they need to grow in the short term.\u201d Disappointingly, UK productivity is falling again. Productivity (broadly, how much we each produced) shrank by 0.5% in the first three months of 2018, the ONS says. That\u2019s because Britain\u2019s growth rate slowed in the last quarter (to a measly 0.1%), even though companies created more jobs - meaning the amount of hours worked in the economy rose by 0.6%. Ergo, we were less productive: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the UK economy is a mixed picture -- job creation remains strong, but productivity is a mess. \u201cThe great British job-creating machine kicked back into life in the first quarter of 2018, taking the employment rate to a new record high. Unemployment edged down further and regular pay growth continued to edge up as the labour market has tightened. Real pay growth, excluding bonuses, is now firmly back into positive territory. \u201cAll of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1% estimated for the first quarter. This estimate could be revised up later but, taken at face value, it suggests that productivity growth turned significantly negative again after a couple of quarters when it seemed to be perking up. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, is disappointed that total pay growth (including bonuses) slowed to 2.6% from 2.8% a month ago. Professor Johnes, who is also research director at the Work Foundation, says this shows some weakness in the labour market: This is a disappointing result, in that it represents a fall from the 2.8% figure achieved in February, and it means that we have to wait still longer for real wages to recover. The single month measure shows a year-on-year growth of just 2.3%. This continued flatness in wages provides justification for the Bank of England\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates \u2013 despite the buoyancy of the employment figures, the recovery in the labour market is quite simply not there, and rising wages clearly present no threat in terms of inflation.\u201d This chart, from Fidelity International, shows how Britain is emerging from its second pay squeeze in a decade: Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity, say: \u201cBritish workers are feeling marginally better off after wages grew in real terms for the second month on a trot.\u201d Economists are welcoming the news that basic pay in Britain is accelerating. It could even spur the Bank of England into raising interest rates by August - although, after policymakers left rates on hold last week, who knows for sure? The percentage of people in Britain classed as \u2018economically inactive\u2019 has fallen to just 21%, its lowest level since records began 45 years ago. That means that more people are either in work, or looking for a job. The ONS says: There were 8.66 million people aged from 16 to 64 years who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 115,000 fewer than for October to December 2017 and 171,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Today\u2019s jobs report also shows that Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze is easing. Basic pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 2.8% a month ago. That means that wages are rising faster than inflation (which fell to 2.5% in March). So real basic pay (adjusted for inflation) is now growing at around 0.4%, after shrinking over recent months. However, total pay (including bonuses) only grew by 2.6% during the quarter (again, down from 2.8%). But before anyone celebrates, lets not forget that Britons are basically poorer than before the financial crisis. The Office for National Statistics says: average regular pay (excluding bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00a3460 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00a313 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00a3473 per week recorded for March 2008 average total pay (including bonuses) for employees in Great Britain was \u00a3489 per week before tax and other deductions from pay, \u00a333 lower than the pre-downturn peak of \u00a3522 per week recorded for February 2008 Newsflash: Britain\u2019s jobless rate remained at 4.2% in the first three months of 2018. The latest Labour Force statistics, just released, show that unemployment is at its joint lowest level since 1975. The report also shows that the employment rate is at a record high (the data goes back to Ted Heath\u2019s reign as prime minister): The Office for National Statistics says: There were 32.34 million people in work, 197,000 more than for October to December 2017 and 396,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 46,000 fewer than for October to December 2017 and 116,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Bulgaria and Poland have both posted solid growth figures: The German Federal Ministry for Economics Affairs says the country\u2019s economy remains strong, despite growth slowing in recent months. In a statement, it says: \u201cPrivate consumption remains strong. Companies are upbeat on their trade prospects in the light of overall favourable conditions.\u201d The ministry also suggests that the drop in government spending may be due to the five-month hiatus of negotiations to form Angela Merkel\u2019s new coalition. Just: The Netherlands economy has slowed, but not as sharply as Germany. Dutch GDP rose by 0.5% in the first three months of this year, down from 0.7% in October-December 2017. Finland has outperformed Germany, by posting 1.1% growth in the last quarter. This suggests the eurozone\u2019s most northerly neighbour is shaking off its recent stagnation, despite the slowdown in other countries. Shares in some of Germany\u2019s biggest companies have dipped in early trading. The DAX index has dropped by 0.3%, or 38 points, to 12,939 in Frankfurt, following this morning\u2019s disappointing growth figures. Pharmaceutical giant Merck is the biggest faller (-2.8%), followed by industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (-2.4%, despite reporting higher profits this morning). At just 0.3%, this is Germany\u2019s weakest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2016. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says Germany had a \u2018stumbling start\u2019 into 2018, for a variety of reasons: Trade and government consumption were a drag on growth. Also, don\u2019t forget that a couple of one-off factors like the cold winter weather, early Easter vacation and strikes probably distorted first quarter data. Brzeski says we shouldn\u2019t panic - he thinks that Germany\u2019s economy still has underlying strength, including its manufacturing base: Despite some minor leveling off, capacity utilisation is still close to record highs, assured production in the industry is close to all-time highs and the high stock of orders and historically low inventories all bode extremely well for industrial production in the coming months. So this growth slowdown is \u201cno more than a black eye\u201d, Brzeski concludes. The news that Germany\u2019s growth rate halved in the last quarter is causing a stir. Economist Ulrik Bie blames the drop in exports by German firms: Tom Barfield of the AFP newswire says it will raise fears about the health of the European economy: Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 Claus Vistesen believes the eurozone will tick along at a more steady rate this year: Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics warns that Germany has lost momentum, and may struggle to bounce back in the coming months. Newsflash: Germany has suffered a growth slowdown after being hit by weak trade. The eurozone\u2019s largest economy expanded by just 0.3% in the first three months of this year, official figures show. That\u2019s a sharp slowdown compared to Germany\u2019s 0.6% in the final quarter of 2017. It is also below the 0.4% which economists had expected. The Federal Statistics Office says: The German economy continued to grow at the beginning of the year, though at a slower pace. The slowdown was triggered by \u201cless dynamic\u201d foreign trade, as \u201cboth exports and imports decreased compared with the previous quarter\u201d. Government spending also fell, for the firs time in five years, dragging growth back. But capital investment did rise during the quarter, suggesting companies are still investing in equipment and factories. Domestic consumption also made a positive contribution. Although Germany is obviously still growing, these figures do indicate that the eurozone economy has lost some steam in recent months. They also suggests that fears of a trade war, triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium, are causing worrying ripples in the global economy. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we get a new healthcheck on Europe\u2019s economy, with a fresh estimate of eurozone GDP for the first three months of this year, plus growth figures from Germany and the Netherlands. Last month\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 data showed the eurozone economy grew by 0.4% - investors will be concerned if this is revised downwards today. Britain\u2019s labour market is also in focus. The latest unemployment figures are expected to show the jobless rate remains at just 4.2%, its lowest level in over 40 years. But will there be any progress on wages? Economists predict that basic pay growth rose to 2.9% in the first three months of this year - up from 2.8%. A strong reading might give the pound a lift, and reignite speculation that interest rates might rise in August. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Given that inflation in March was 2.5%, wages growth of 2.9% or higher would be an encouraging sign that domestic inflation will slowly start to pick up, potentially reviving the possibility of a Bank of England rate rise later in the year and pushing sterling back towards $1.37. Traders will also be tracking events in Italy, where talks to form a new government are still continuing.

The UK\u2019s leading index is up just 0.3%, perhaps because of the dip in the oil price. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A dominant dollar helped lead to a seriously down in the dumps Dow Jones this Tuesday, while the FTSE lost its lunchtime momentum.</p> <p>Though not quite as strong as analysts\u2019 were expecting, the latest US retail sales figures were solid enough to give the dollar a hefty hawkish boost. The greenback was propelled 0.7% higher against the pound, with cable nearing sub-$1.348 2018 lows, while against the euro it was up 0.8%, forcing the single currency under $1.185.</p> <p>This, combined with the USA\u2019s ambassador to China Terry Branstad stating that the two countries were still \u2018very far apart\u2019 on the issue of trade, caused the Dow Jones to have an absolutely miserable time of it after the bell. The index plunged nearly 200 points as the session got underway, trudging back towards 24700 having almost grazed a 2 month high of 25000 on Monday.</p> <p>Normally the sight of a cable-collapse would be like catnip for the FTSE.

However, that the FTSE can perhaps feel aggrieved that it couldn\u2019t wring more juice from sterling\u2019s slide.</p> <p>Beyond the bearishness plaguing the Dow Jones, the fact Brent Crude has pulled back from its $79 per barrel is potentially responsible for the index not fully taking flight; but even then, BP and Shell are still up around 1.5% apiece, showing investors are still willing to drink down the oil colossi even if the black stuff is off its 3 and a half year peak. Investors may simply have slight reservations about sending the FTSE much higher than it currently is, given that it the index didn\u2019t last long at its 7800-teasing peak back in mid-January. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5afaea22e4b03387f9ceea0d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T14:15:30.247Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The strengthening dollar after the retail sales figures has taken some of the shine off the oil price, with Brent crude now in negative territory for the day, down 0.17% at $78.10 a barrel.</p> <p>At its peak during the day, Brent hit $79.47, which analysts saying $80 or even $100 could be on the horizon.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5afae474e4b03387f9cee9b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:48:29.606Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the UK employment figures and the fall in EU workers, and the Press Association has more details:</p> <blockquote> <p>Labour market data released by the Office for National Statistics showed the fall [in the number of EU nationals] was driven by a steep drop in the number of workers from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004.</p> <p>In the latest period, there were an estimated 917,000 nationals of the so-called EUA8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - in work in the UK.</p> <p>This was down by 91,000 compared to January-March in 2017, the largest annual decrease since comparable records started in 1997.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes, professor of Economics at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cToday\u2019s labour market statistics show a year-on-year fall in the number of European nationals working here, for the first time since the aftermath of the recession. </p> <p>\u201cA combination of factors - a slowing economy here combined with recovery on the continent, but also the political and psychological impact of the Brexit vote - have made the UK a significantly less attractive place to live and work.\u201d </p> <p>Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, pointed to figures for EU-born workers, which he said were 155,000 higher than in the same quarter before the referendum. He said: \u201cThese new labour force figures dispose of any claim of a Brexodus.\u201d</p> <p>Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThe employment rate of A8 migrants in the UK is close to record highs, at more than 85%.

Importantly, the \u201ccontrol\u201d group, which excludes very volatile items such as food, autos, building materials and gasoline and supposedly better matches consumer spending within GDP, was up 0.4% after a 0.5% gain in March. February was revised up a tenth of a percentage point too.</p> <p>Retail sales have been difficult to interpret for much of the past year. In particular, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused extensive damage that triggered a wave of spending as households replaced lost items in Sep-Nov 2017. In fact retail sales soared a cumulative 3.5% during the period only to fall back in Dec, Jan and Feb (although Feb has now been revised up to being flat).</p> <p>Now that these distortions are out the way we expect upcoming data to show households continuing to spend strongly. Employment is rising, wages are growing and tax cuts means there is more cash in people\u2019s pockets. With consumer confidence at strong levels, consumer spending growth is a key factor behind our above consensus 3% GDP growth forecast for the US this year. In turn, this leads us to look for a further three Federal Reserve rate rises in 2018.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:22:44.972Z\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5afad46be4b02d1f3350fcb6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-15T13:01:39.051Z\">2.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brent crude hits $79 per barrel</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec7e4f26e50ac11ff08989af43f7ce3b7eccffba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec7e4f26e50ac11ff08989af43f7ce3b7eccffba/0_196_3002_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oil platforms under maintenance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil platforms under maintenance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marius Dobilas/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Over in the financial markets, the oil price has hit a new three and a half-year high.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude is changing hands at $79.30 per barrel, the highest since late 2014.</p> <p>Prices have been rising since America pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last week - a move likely to take some Iranian oil production off the market.</p> <p>Crude prices have jumped by 75% since June 2017, which has led to higher transport costs and petrol price at the pumps.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of an August increase in interest rates from the Bank of England has loomed larger after the latest official figures showed that strong jobs growth had pushed the UK\u2019s employment rate to a fresh record in the first three months of 2018. Despite the slowest growth in more than five years, the Office for National Statistics said there were 32.34 million people in work in the first quarter of the year, an increase of 197,000 on the previous quarter and up by 396,000 on the first three months of 2017. The UK\u2019s employment rate rose by 0.4 points to 75.6% in the latest quarter, the highest since modern records began in 1971. A majority of jobs created were full-time posts. City economists said the strong labour market increased the chances of growth being revised up from the ONS\u2019s initial estimate of just 0.1% in the the first quarter of 2018 \u2013 its weakest since 2012. But rising employment and almost stagnant output resulted in a fresh setback to productivity after a rise in the second half of 2017. Output per hour worked fell by 0.5% in the first three months of 2018 and has increased by just 0.2% a year since the financial crisis of 2008. The ONS reported a mixed picture for wages. Growth in total pay in the first quarter of 2018 was up by 2.6% on a year earlier, slower than the annual rise of 2.8% recorded in the three months to February. Regular pay \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 was 2.9% up on a year ago, a slight increase from the 2.8% annual increase reported the previous month. The ONS said that once inflation was taken into account, real regular pay was up by 0.4% on a year ago while total pay was flat. Ministers seized on the evidence of job creation and an end to the squeeze on living standards as evidence that the economy had turned the corner after a tough 2017. Philip Hammond said: \u201cGrowth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy.\u201d \u201cWe can be proud of our record on jobs,\u201d the chancellor added. \u201cThe unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years and with our \u2018national living wage\u2019 we are making sure that the lowest-paid feel the benefit with an extra \u00a32,000 a year. Now the focus has to be on ensuring that wages keep rising faster than inflation, so that living standards increase.\u201d Unemployment on the internationally agreed definition fell by 46,000 to 1.42 million between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was the joint lowest since 1975. Senior ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cWith employment up again in the three months to March, the rate has hit a new record, with unemployment remaining at its lowest rate since 1975. \u201cThe growth in employment is still being driven by UK nationals, with a slight drop over the past year in the number of foreign workers. It\u2019s important to remember, though, that this isn\u2019t a measure of migration.\u201d James Smith, an economist at ING bank, said the strong labour market data made an August interest rate increase from the Bank of England more likely. \u201cAs markets become increasingly sceptical about the prospects of a UK rate hike this year, the latest wage data could prompt a bit of a rethink. \u201cAt 2.9%, earnings growth excluding bonuses is now running at the fastest rate since mid-2015 and will make the Bank of England more confident that their optimistic stance on wage growth is bearing fruit. Remember that survey evidence from Bank of England agents has been pointing to the best year for pay settlements since the crisis.\u201d",

Growth in total pay in the first quarter of 2018 was up by 2.6% on a year earlier, slower than the annual rise of 2.8% recorded in the three months to February. <br></p> <p>Regular pay \u2013 which excludes bonuses \u2013 was 2.9% up on a year ago, a slight increase from the 2.8% annual increase reported the previous month. </p> <p>The ONS said that once inflation was taken into account, real regular pay was up by 0.4% on a year ago while total pay was flat. </p> <p>Ministers seized on the evidence of job creation and an end to the squeeze on living standards as evidence that the economy had turned the corner after a tough 2017. </p> <p>Philip Hammond said: \u201cGrowth in real wages means that people are starting to feel the benefit of more money in their pockets; another turning point as we build a stronger, fairer economy.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cWe can be proud of our record on jobs,\u201d the chancellor added. \u201cThe unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years and with our \u2018national living wage\u2019 we are making sure that the lowest-paid feel the benefit with an extra \u00a32,000 a year. Now the focus has to be on ensuring that wages keep rising faster than inflation, so that living standards increase.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/14/shoppers-desert-uk-high-streets-to-put-more-jobs-at-risk\">Shoppers desert UK high streets, putting more jobs at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unemployment on the internationally agreed definition fell by 46,000 to 1.42 million between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was the joint lowest since 1975.</p> <p>Senior ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cWith employment up again in the three months to March, the rate has hit a new record, with unemployment remaining at its lowest rate since 1975. </p> <p>\u201cThe growth in employment is still being driven by UK nationals, with a slight drop over the past year in the number of foreign workers. It\u2019s important to remember, though, that this isn\u2019t a measure of migration.\u201d</p> <p>James Smith, an economist at ING bank, said the strong labour market data made an August <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/bank-of-england-holds-uk-interest-rates-at-05\">interest rate increase from the Bank of England</a> more likely.</p> <p>\u201cAs markets become increasingly sceptical about the prospects of a UK rate hike this year, the latest wage data could prompt a bit of a rethink. </p> <p>\u201cAt 2.9%, earnings growth excluding bonuses is now running at the fastest rate since mid-2015 and will make the Bank of England more confident that their optimistic stance on wage growth is bearing fruit. Remember that survey evidence from Bank of England agents has been pointing to the best year for pay settlements since the crisis.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Millions of Ryanair passengers booked on flights after 13 June will have shorter check-in periods, in a move likely to encourage more travellers to pay for reserved seating. The budget airline said its check-in window for passengers who have not paid for reserved seating will shrink from four days to 48 hours. But if customers pay for a reserved seat \u2013 which costs from \u00a33 each way but rises to \u00a315 for seats with more leg room \u2013 they will be allowed to check in up to 60 days before flying. The latest rule change at Ryanair comes just months after a controversial change to its baggage policy. Passengers have to pay \u00a35 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at their departure gate. The baggage policy was due to begin in November last year but was delayed until January amid the Ryanair flight cancellations fiasco. The new check-in policy is likely to encourage weekend-break travellers to pay for reserved seating, or be forced to find ways to check in online while abroad. For many travellers using the Ryanair app on their smartphones, check-in is a relatively simple procedure, but others will find it more daunting. As recently as 2016, passengers could check in for free up to a week before departure, but this was cut to four days and will now move to 48 hours. The airline has also faced widespread criticism for running a \u201cpay up or we split you up\u201d seat allocation policy. Couples travelling together who do not pay for reserved seating often find themselves seated at opposite ends of the aircraft, despite Ryanair claims that the allocation policy is random. Ryanair said the new check-in window brings it into line with rival airlines. In a statement, it said: \u201cOnline check-in (for those customers who don\u2019t choose reserved seats) will be available from 48 hours to two hours pre-departure for all flights from Wednesday 13 June. This is double the 24- hour check-in period operated by Aer Lingus, British Airways, Lufthansa, Norwegian and Iberia. This will give reserve seat customers more time to select their preferred seats prior to departure.\u201d Shares in Ryanair have tumbled since the cancellations issue and prolonged labour disputes. They peaked at \u20ac19.35 in August last year, but have since fallen to around \u20ac15.72. Meanwhile shares in its main rival, easyJet, which announced upbeat figures on Tuesday, have jumped from around \u00a312 last August to \u00a317.10.",

      "bodyText": "TSB turned down an offer of help from Lloyds Banking Group, its former owner, in the early stages of an IT meltdown that left up to 1.9 million online customers unable to access their accounts. Lloyds contacted TSB on the morning of 23 April, according to a report in the Financial Times, after it became apparent that a transfer of accounts and customer information to a new IT system had gone badly wrong. But TSB declined the offer, despite the fact its customer information was being transferred from a Lloyds system to one designed by its current owner, the Spanish bank Sabadell. TSB was spun out of Lloyds in 2013 but had continued to pay for the use of its IT systems. Almost a week into the crisis, TSB drafted in a team from IBM to help solve it, after the chief executive, Paul Pester, admitted the bank was struggling to fix the problems with its internet banking and mobile app. The Labour MP John Mann, a member of the cross-party Treasury select committee, said TSB\u2019s failure to accept help was a sign it had failed to acknowledge the scale of the problems and had been \u201choping to get away with it\u201d. \u201cThey were playing fast and loose with the customers and also with their reputation, which has been so damaged by it now,\u201d he told the FT. Four weeks on from the IT transfer, some customers were still reporting problems accessing their accounts and transferring money. It is as yet unclear how much the botched IT transfer will cost TSB. The bank has repeatedly insisted that no customer would be left out of pocket as a result of the chaos. The bank has waived all overdraft fees and interest charges for its retail and small business customers for April. It has also raised the interest paid out on its standard current account to 5% on balances up to \u00a31,500 \u2013 up from 3% \u2013 for existing customers who stick with the bank. During a bruising evidence session before the Treasury select committee, Pester was accused by Nicky Morgan, the committee chair, of being \u201cextraordinarily complacent\u201d after he said the bank\u2019s move to a new IT system had mostly run smoothly. Pester has volunteered to give up a \u00a32m bonus linked to the IT transfer but he could still receive up to \u00a31.3m in other bonuses for 2018 on top of a further \u00a31.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions. Posts on TSB\u2019s Twitter feed on Tuesday suggested the bank was still struggling to cope with the high volume of customer complaints. Lloyds declined to comment. A spokesperson for TSB declined to comment on the refusal of help from Lloyds. They said: \u201cOur teams have continued to work around the clock to put things right for our customers. \u201cOur priority has been to utilise the expertise of IBM together with Sabis [Sabadell\u2019s IT partner] and our in-house teams to help resolve these issues.\u201d",
