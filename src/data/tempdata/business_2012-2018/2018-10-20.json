      "bodyText": "Before Saturday\u2019s Wentworth byelection, the Liberal party was letting it be known that it would require \u201ca miracle\u201d for it to hold the seat. It was a blatant case of expectation management \u2013 any loss would be explained as being in the too-hard basket; any victory would be championed as one of the greatest results in electoral history. Never mind that the Liberal party held the seat by 17.7% and it was the eighth-safest Coalition seat in the country. It turned out they were right to expect a thumping, although even the most pessimistic probably didn\u2019t expect it to be so bad. So in light of that bit of expectations fluff, let me make my own election call \u2013 the next federal election is the Liberal party\u2019s to lose. Incumbency and the economic situation should see the Coalition winning it (to borrow a favourite phrase of the prime minister) in a canter. This week came the news that the unemployment rate hit 5% \u2013 the best result for six years. Now with that figure comes a few provisos. We are talking the seasonally adjusted figures, which the ABS recommends not to use when comparing monthly changes (but the media does because it tends to bounce a bit, and bounces are more newsworthy than little change). The September figures also saw the second-biggest monthly fall in the past 15 years, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if next month sees a rise. But all these are, to an extent, just nice, nerdy caveats. 5.0% unemployment! Just look at that number. Think that at the last two elections it was 5.7% \u2013 so the Coalition has a pretty easy story to tell. And don\u2019t give me the \u201coh, the unemployment rate is a fraud because one hour of work is counted as being employed\u201d. Full-time employment is growing well \u2013 up 2.2% over the past year. Sure, that\u2019s not as good as the 3.9% growth at the end of 2017, but it is still much better than the 0.8% growth at the time of the 2016 election, let alone the -0.2% at the 2013 election. To not be in a supreme election-winning position with those kind of numbers, you would have to be an absolute clown car of a government. And, well ... yeah. Let\u2019s be honest, this government is doing all it can to demonstrate it has no idea. Short-termism is a problem most politicians suffer from but bringing out the idea to move our embassy in Israel, despite advice from security agencies warning it may provoke reaction, and despite the impact it will have on our relationship with Indonesia, in a bid to secure votes in Wentworth, and then most likely dump the position afterwards, is a new level of idiocy. Throw in the allegations that the minister for the environment, Melissa Price, disparaged Pacific nations to the former President of Kiribati, and the miserable disgrace that was the government senators supporting a One Nation motion that used a white supremacist slogan, and the National party making noises about another leadership spill, and you have a government this week not so riven with incompetence as at a point where incompetence would seem an improvement. Yet it is not only the government\u2019s wonderful accuracy at shooting themselves in the foot that has meant the current employment situation is not translating into an electoral sure thing. The employment conditions themselves are lending themselves to that end. We have a situation of low unemployment, strong full-time employment growth (especially for 35-44 year olds) and yet we still have interest rates at record lows and wages growth pretty much dribbling along at if not record lows not far above them. And we also have underemployment still at historically high levels. The last time the unemployment rate was 5.0% was in April 2012, but back then the underemployment rate was 7.3%. Now it is 8.3%. In the past four years, the unemployment rate has fallen 1.4% points, from 6.4% to the current 5.0%; in that same period the underemployment rate has risen from 8.2% to 8.3%. And this matters because over that period the driver of wages growth has been more the level of underemployment than unemployment. The drop in the underemployment rate over the past six months, from 8.5% to 8.3%, should see wages growth improve, but thus far it is more hope than reality. The government itself this week continues to show it is on the side of keeping wages down. The minister for jobs and industrial relations, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, announced the government would intervene in a case before the federal court challenging an earlier ruling that saw a truck driver \u2013 employed as a casual worker for two and half years through a labour-hire firm and paid around 30% less than full-time workers \u2013 being able to claim leave entitlements. It\u2019s a good example of how the government remains very clearly on the side of employers, and has put full faith in the market delivering wages growth at some stage. It\u2019s a position that opens itself up very much to charges of being ignorant of why, in the face of low unemployment, the voters are not giving them credit. But it is not just about the government. The ALP has sought to make the issue of flat real wages and incomes growth an issue \u2013 essentially arguing that all the good news is flowing to companies and owners and not to workers. That might be a winning political argument, but the disconnect of unemployment and wages will be their issue should they take government. And as governments around the world have found, it is a tough problem to solve. It means governments might no longer be able to rely on previous measures of economic strength to get re-elected. And it means the ALP will need to deliver on its promises of wages growth \u2013 while also keeping unemployment low. If they could do that without also becoming a clown car of a government, that would also be rather appreciated by voters, I suspect. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "When Mohammed bin Salman was touring the UK and US earlier this year, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia \u2013 and its de facto ruler \u2013 could have relied almost exclusively on businesses backed by the kingdom\u2019s money. Landing in London, \u201cMBS\u201d might have dispensed with his chauffeur-driven car, travelling into the capital by Uber, while his aides finalised his itinerary on smartphones powered with chips designed by Cambridge-based ARM Holdings. After glad-handing bank chiefs in the City, any investment plans they discussed could have been further developed using cloud office app Slack. On the US leg of the journey, perhaps slumming it in an Accor hotel, MBS and his entourage might have dialled up a plate of the Saudi national rice dish, kabsa, from delivery service DoorDash. Later, they could have relaxed by playing computer games partly designed by simulation technology firm Improbable. Every one of these companies is part of the portfolio of Riyadh\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages the country\u2019s oil wealth. Under the stewardship of the young prince \u2013 he is just 33 \u2013 the PIF has adopted a more aggressive investment approach, seeking out eye-catching, forward-looking deals, particularly technology startups. Its aim is to increase the pot from $250bn to $2 trillion in the next 12 years. This strategy is a key part of Vision 2030, a blueprint to reduce Saudi reliance on oil and diversify the economy into sustainable industries with a long-term future. But the plan hasn\u2019t gone smoothly. \u201cThe idea is that you give the money to the PIF and they invest seriously all over the world, particularly in hi-tech and future-oriented industries,\u201d says David Butter, Middle East and north Africa analyst at Chatham House. \u201cBut a sovereign wealth fund is by definition based on surplus revenue and Saudi Arabia has been running deficits because the oil price is weak, so they need to get [the money] from somewhere else.\u201d Butter points out that Riyadh hoped to accelerate its plans by raising $100bn from the flotation of a 5% stake in its giant state oil company, Aramco, an offering since put on hold. But even if funds can be raised elsewhere, the international investment component of the masterplan is at risk, due to the allegations \u2013 denied by the crown prince \u2013 that he ordered the murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The keystone of the international strategy \u2013 which could now be under threat \u2013 has been the kingdom\u2019s provision of nearly half the money in the $93bn Vision Fund managed by Japan\u2019s Softbank. Much of that cash has gone into potential future blue-chips such as Uber, electric car start-up Lucid Motors and General Motors\u2019s driverless car unit, GM Cruise. MBS is close to Softbank\u2019s billionaire chief executive, Masayoshi Son, one of the few business leaders not to have pulled out of next week\u2019s Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh \u2013 described as \u201cDavos in the desert\u201d \u2013 in light of the allegations. But the gruesome scandal does appear to have tested even that close relationship. Earlier this month, MBS told Bloomberg that the PIF was ready to pump another $45bn into a second Vision Fund. By the end of last week, Softbank appeared to have cooled on the idea, with its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, saying there was \u201cno certainty\u201d such a fund was in the offing. An impressive roll-call of business names have been rather less circumspect in putting distance between themselves and MBS. The high-profile pull-outs from the FII include JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u2013 even Uber\u2019s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u2019s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has suspended the Gulf state\u2019s $1bn investment in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed. All of this deals considerable damage to the public profile of a man who was meant to be the standard-bearer for reform and modernisation. When MBS was in California on his tour, he hired out most of the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, enjoying lunches with Rupert Murdoch, rubbing shoulders in Silicon Valley with the likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and schmoozing film stars. \u201cThe persona he was trying to put out there was that he\u2019s one of them, these business moguls. It was clear that rubbing shoulders with all of these big names was something he enjoyed,\u201d says Butter. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a prestige goal and they\u2019ve been explicit about that,\u201d says Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security thinktank. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to be an economic powerhouse and an effort to invest in state-of-the art technologies that they hope to use in Saudi Arabia, but which also put them on the front page of the newspaper.\u201d Even more crucial than prestige are the economic ramifications, and not just when it comes to boosting investment returns from the PIF. Every overseas deal brings with it international connections that contribute towards realising the domestic Vision 2030 plans. These include massive expansion into solar power, cultural and technological development, not to mention the so-called giga-projects, such as the construction of islands in a tourism complex along the Red Sea coast and a futuristic new city, known as Neom, in the country\u2019s far north-west. Achieving these goals requires expertise that the kingdom doesn\u2019t necessarily have, cannot develop quickly and must import instead. A memorandum of understanding signed with the UK after MBS\u2019s visit earlier this year offers some insight into how Riyadh envisages a symbiotic relationship between internal investment and domestic projects. The document was full of mutual praise. The UK recognised \u201cthe substantial potential for Saudi Arabia as a global investment powerhouse\u201d, while the Saudis recognised London\u2019s \u201cunrivalled\u201d place as a financial centre, a position the capital promptly lost to New York shortly afterwards. But the core of the agreement was for \u201cmutual investment opportunities\u201d worth $100bn over 10 years, including $30bn in direct investments in the UK from the PIF. In exchange, the UK is to share expertise in clean energy, electric vehicles, financial services, culture and entertainment, healthcare, life sciences and, of course, defence. Any and all of these partnerships are likely to involve businesses which, right now at least, fear Saudi is toxic. \u201cThere\u2019s a line between not going to a public event [the FII] and what happens with actual cash placements,\u201d says Ziemba. \u201cBut for some investors, this is another example of uncertainty around Saudi foreign policy. \u201cThey may have more challenges attracting inward investment than placing it abroad with companies that usually need the money.\u201d Nigel Kushner, chief executive of W Legal and an expert in sanctions, warns that the worst-case scenario for the Saudis is if the US decides to put individuals and businesses on the list of those sanctioned under its Magnitsky Act. \u201cThe reality is that business internationally would be closed for anyone on the list,\u201d says Kushner. \u201cIf they put businesspeople or companies on the list that would have a meaningful impact: it could all be removed overnight if the US were minded to do so. But I very much doubt it will be.\u201d A wide portfolio The vast oil wealth of Saudi Arabia and its royal family has been spread liberally around the world in recent years. Many of their overseas assets are owned via the mammoth $93bn Vision Fund shared with Japan\u2019s Softbank, while some are personal playthings of sundry royals. These are some of the assets, ranging from steel to Silicon Valley. The Vision Fund Saudi Arabia put up $45bn of the $93bn in the Vision Fund, the world\u2019s largest private equity pot, managed by Softbank. The investment vehicle has poured cash into more than 25 companies, particularly tech startups and champions such as Uber \u2013 the Vision Fund is the ride-hailing app\u2019s single biggest shareholder with a $9bn stake. Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), separately owns 5%, worth $3.5bn. ARM Holdings is the second biggest investment in the Vision Fund stable. The Cambridge-based tech firm designs chips used in millions of smartphones around the world. The Vision Fund has a 25% stake worth $8.3bn, as well as $8.2bn in fellow chipmaker Nvidia. It has also ploughed $2.3bn into GM Cruise, the driverless cars unit of General Motors, and $4.4bn into workspace company WeWork. London-based startup Improbable, which creates virtual worlds for video games, attracted $500m from Softbank, which later moved it into the Vision Fund. Slack, perhaps best described as a Facebook for business, is a cloud-based virtual office that won a $300m injection. Other Vision Fund investments include food delivery service DoorDash ($500m), German online car dealer Auto1 ($460m) and biopharma firm Roivant ($1bn). Blackstone infrastructure During President Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi last year, it was announced that the PIF would plough $20bn into a $40bn US infrastructure fund managed by investment giant Blackstone. The project is in its early stages and has struggled to find appropriate investments. Other investments The PIF has also sought out tech projects beyond the Vision ambit and owns a 5% stake in electric car maker Tesla. It also joined big-name backers to invest in secretive augmented reality startup Magic Leap, backing it with $400m. It also holds interests in steel, via a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal. Personal investments Some Saudi royals are big investors in their own right. Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal spent $25m on a 2.3% stake in Snapchat this year, plus $267m on shares in French music streaming service Deezer. He already owns stakes in Twitter and ride-hailing service Lyft. Then there are the usual personal fripperies, such as Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s $300m French chateau and a yacht that cost even more, at $500m. But they hardly seem worth mentioning.",

After glad-handing bank chiefs in the City, any investment plans they discussed could have been further developed using cloud office app Slack.</p> <p>On the US leg of the journey, perhaps slumming it in an Accor hotel, MBS and his entourage might have dialled up a plate of the Saudi national rice dish, kabsa, from delivery service DoorDash. Later, they could have relaxed by playing computer games partly designed by simulation technology firm Improbable.</p> <p>Every one of these companies is part of the portfolio of Riyadh\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages the country\u2019s oil wealth. Under the stewardship of the young prince \u2013 he is just 33 \u2013 the PIF has adopted a more aggressive investment approach, seeking out eye-catching, forward-looking deals, particularly technology startups. Its aim is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/01/saudi-arabia-plans-to-sell-state-oil-assets-to-create-2tn-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">increase the pot from $250bn to $2 trillion in the next 12 years</a>.</p> <p>This strategy is a key part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/23/saudi-modernisation-drive-is-reflected-in-aramcos-faltering-sale\" title=\"\">Vision 2030, a blueprint to reduce Saudi reliance on oil and diversify the economy</a> into sustainable industries with a long-term future. But the plan hasn\u2019t gone smoothly.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea is that you give the money to the PIF and they invest seriously all over the world, particularly in hi-tech and future-oriented industries,\u201d says David Butter, Middle East and north Africa analyst at Chatham House.</p> <p>\u201cBut a sovereign wealth fund is by definition based on surplus revenue and Saudi Arabia has been running deficits because the oil price is weak, so they need to get [the money] from somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>Butter points out that Riyadh hoped to accelerate its plans by raising $100bn from the flotation of a 5% stake in its giant state oil company, Aramco, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/15/saudi-aramco-denies-it-is-planning-to-shelve-2-trillion-listing\" title=\"\">offering since put on hold</a>.</p> <p>But even if funds can be raised elsewhere, the international investment component of the masterplan is at risk, due to the allegations \u2013 denied by the crown prince \u2013 that he ordered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/12/recordings-prove-jamal-khashoggi-killed-turkish-investigators-claim\" title=\"\">murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashogg</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/12/recordings-prove-jamal-khashoggi-killed-turkish-investigators-claim\" title=\"\">i</a>.</p> <p>The keystone of the international strategy \u2013 which could now be under threat \u2013 has been the kingdom\u2019s provision of nearly half the money in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/11/insatiable-global-funds-control-future-of-tech-industry\" title=\"\">$93bn Vision Fund managed by Japan\u2019s Softbank</a>. Much of that cash has gone into potential future blue-chips such as Uber, electric car start-up Lucid Motors and General Motors\u2019s driverless car unit, GM Cruise.</p> <p>MBS is close to Softbank\u2019s billionaire chief executive, Masayoshi Son, one of the few business leaders not to have pulled out of next week\u2019s Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh \u2013 described as \u201cDavos in the desert\u201d \u2013 in light of the allegations. But the gruesome scandal does appear to have tested even that close relationship.</p> <p>Earlier this month, MBS told Bloomberg that the PIF was ready to pump another $45bn into a second Vision Fund. By the end of last week, Softbank appeared to have cooled on the idea, with its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, saying there was \u201cno certainty\u201d such a fund was in the offing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28e44d806f0d885127a197935561ad3402c9f788\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28e44d806f0d885127a197935561ad3402c9f788/17_0_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018MBS\u2019 with Richard Branson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018MBS\u2019 with Richard Branson, left, whose Virgin Galactic project has now suspended its $1bn Saudi investment</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An impressive roll-call of business names have been rather less circumspect in putting distance between themselves and MBS.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/oct/16/be-brave-uk-business-leaders-say-why-youre-not-going-to-the-saudi-davos\" title=\"\">The high-profile pull-outs</a> from the FII include JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, Glencore chairman Tony Hayward and many more \u2013 even Uber\u2019s boss, Dara Khosrowshahi, despite the PIF\u2019s $3.5bn investment in his company. Separately, Richard Branson has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/11/sir-richard-branson-suspends-saudi-business-talks-over-khashoggi-affair\" title=\"\">suspended the Gulf state\u2019s $1bn investment</a> in his space project, Virgin Galactic. Rarely have so many business leaders been seen running in the same direction, in this case away from Saudi Arabia at speed.</p> <p>All of this deals considerable damage to the public profile of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/16/the-guardian-view-on-saudi-arabia-in-need-of-new-leadership\" title=\"\">man who was meant to be the standard-bearer for reform</a> and modernisation. When MBS was in California on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/13/mohammad-bin-salman-saudi-arabia-profile-crown-prince\" title=\"\">his tour</a>, he hired out most of the Four Seasons hotel in Beverly Hills, enjoying lunches with Rupert Murdoch, rubbing shoulders in Silicon Valley with the likes of Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and schmoozing film stars.</p> <p>\u201cThe persona he was trying to put out there was that he\u2019s one of them, these business moguls. It was clear that rubbing shoulders with all of these big names was something he enjoyed,\u201d says Butter.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a prestige goal and they\u2019ve been explicit about that,\u201d says Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Security thinktank. \u201cThere\u2019s a desire to be an economic powerhouse and an effort to invest in state-of-the art technologies that they hope to use in Saudi Arabia, but which also put them on the front page of the newspaper.\u201d</p> <p>Even more crucial than prestige are the economic ramifications, and not just when it comes to boosting investment returns from the PIF. Every overseas deal brings with it international connections that contribute towards realising the domestic Vision 2030 plans.</p> <p>These include massive expansion into solar power, cultural and technological development, not to mention the so-called giga-projects, such as the construction of islands in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/richard-branson-to-invest-in-saudi-arabias-tourism-plans\" title=\"\">tourism complex along the Red Sea coast</a> and a futuristic new city, <a href=\"http://www.neom.com/\" title=\"\">known as Neom</a>, in the country\u2019s far north-west.</p> <p>Achieving these goals requires expertise that the kingdom doesn\u2019t necessarily have, cannot develop quickly and must import instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04516a5a040353e6ee447cb5f3e45ef61bf24d45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04516a5a040353e6ee447cb5f3e45ef61bf24d45/0_0_3363_2018/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crown prince with Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On his tour of Silicon Valley, the crown prince also met Sergey Brin, left, co-founder of Google.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A memorandum of understanding signed with the UK after MBS\u2019s visit earlier this year offers some insight into how Riyadh envisages a symbiotic relationship between internal investment and domestic projects.</p> <p>The document was full of mutual praise. The UK recognised \u201cthe substantial potential for Saudi Arabia as a global investment powerhouse\u201d, while the Saudis recognised London\u2019s \u201cunrivalled\u201d place as a financial centre, a position the <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/york-overtakes-london-worlds-top-083248614.html\" title=\"\">capital promptly lost to New York</a> shortly afterwards.</p> <p>But the core of the agreement was for \u201cmutual investment opportunities\u201d worth $100bn over 10 years, including $30bn in direct investments in the UK from the PIF. In exchange, the UK is to share expertise in clean energy, electric vehicles, financial services, culture and entertainment, healthcare, life sciences and, of course, defence.</p> <p>Any and all of these partnerships are likely to involve businesses which, right now at least, fear Saudi is toxic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a line between not going to a public event [the FII] and what happens with actual cash placements,\u201d says Ziemba. \u201cBut for some investors, this is another example of uncertainty around Saudi foreign policy.</p> <p>\u201cThey may have more challenges attracting inward investment than placing it abroad with companies that usually need the money.\u201d</p> <p>Nigel Kushner, chief executive of W Legal and an expert in sanctions, warns that the worst-case scenario for the Saudis is if the US decides to put individuals and businesses on the list of those sanctioned under its Magnitsky Act.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that business internationally would be closed for anyone on the list,\u201d says Kushner. \u201cIf they put businesspeople or companies on the list that would have a meaningful impact: it could all be removed overnight if the US were minded to do so. But I very much doubt it will be.\u201d</p> <h2>A wide portfolio</h2> <p>The vast oil wealth of Saudi Arabia and its royal family has been spread liberally around the world in recent years. Many of their overseas assets are owned via the mammoth $93bn Vision Fund shared with Japan\u2019s Softbank, while some are personal playthings of sundry royals.</p> <p>These are some of the assets, ranging from steel to Silicon Valley.</p> <p><strong>The Vision Fund</strong><br>Saudi Arabia put up $45bn of the $93bn in the Vision Fund, the world\u2019s largest private equity pot, managed by Softbank. The investment vehicle has poured cash into more than 25 companies, particularly tech startups and champions such as Uber \u2013 the Vision Fund is the ride-hailing app\u2019s single biggest shareholder with a $9bn stake. Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), separately owns 5%, worth $3.5bn.</p> <p>ARM Holdings is the second biggest investment in the Vision Fund stable. The Cambridge-based tech firm designs chips used in millions of smartphones around the world. The Vision Fund has a 25% stake worth $8.3bn, as well as $8.2bn in fellow chipmaker Nvidia.</p> <p>It has also ploughed $2.3bn into GM Cruise, the driverless cars unit of General Motors, and $4.4bn into workspace company WeWork.</p> <p>London-based startup Improbable, which creates virtual worlds for video games, attracted $500m from Softbank, which later moved it into the Vision Fund.</p> <p>Slack, perhaps best described as a Facebook for business, is a cloud-based virtual office that won a $300m injection. Other Vision Fund investments include food delivery service DoorDash ($500m), German online car dealer Auto1 ($460m) and biopharma firm Roivant ($1bn).</p> <p><strong>Blackstone infrastructure</strong><br>During President Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi last year, it was announced that the PIF would plough $20bn into a $40bn US infrastructure fund managed by investment giant Blackstone. The project is in its early stages and has struggled to find appropriate investments.</p> <p><strong>Other investments</strong><br>The PIF has also sought out tech projects beyond the Vision ambit and owns a 5% stake in electric car maker Tesla. It also joined big-name backers to invest in secretive augmented reality startup Magic Leap, backing it with $400m. It also holds interests in steel, via a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal.</p> <p><strong>Personal investments</strong><br>Some Saudi royals are big investors in their own right<strong>.</strong> Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal spent $25m on a 2.3% stake in Snapchat this year, plus $267m on shares in French music streaming service Deezer. He already owns stakes in Twitter and ride-hailing service Lyft.</p> <p>Then there are the usual personal fripperies, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/300m-french-chateau-bought-by-saudi-prince-linked-to-da-vinci-purchase-report\" title=\"\">Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s $300m French chateau</a> and a yacht that cost even more, at $500m. But they hardly seem worth mentioning.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With its deserted tables and recycled office furniture, the Ping Pong Parlour in Maidenhead\u2019s struggling Nicholsons shopping centre is not fooling anyone. The desperate attempt to fill what used to be Argos is evidence of the losing battle fought by private equity investors who have surrendered the keys after the mall\u2019s declining fortunes left them unable to meet huge loan repayments. The financial failure of the affluent Berkshire commuter town\u2019s main shopping centre has brought this year\u2019s high street crisis directly on to the embattled prime minister\u2019s doorstep. Theresa May has been Maidenhead\u2019s MP for more than 20 years but rows of empty shops contrast with noisy construction work as new flats populate the town\u2019s revamped waterways, making it hard to tell whether its fortunes are falling or improving. On Thursday, clipboard-wielding market researchers were canvassing shoppers\u2019 views on the squat mall built on the site of the Nicholson\u2019s brewery in the 1960s. One middle-aged woman does not sugar-coat the pill, rating the experience \u201cone out of 10\u201d because \u201cshops keep shutting\u201d. It\u2019s hard to disagree, with at least 20 of the centre\u2019s 50 large stores empty or being marketed by property agents. The precinct bears the scars of a hiatus that has seen about 30 chains, including Toys R Us, Maplin and House of Fraser, go under this year in a domino run that has affected 2,100 stores and nearly 40,000 jobs. The metal grille over Poundworld remains shut as shoppers flow in to the centre from the weekly fruit and vegetable market on the high street. With all eyes on the Brexit negotiations in Brussels, attention will swing back to the UK in 10 days when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, delivers his budget. The fallout from last year\u2019s business rates revaluation, which will add another \u00a3180m to retailers\u2019 bills in April, has been the final straw for some struggling chains. Hammond is now under increasing pressure to make internet retailers share the load. Fashion store Next dealt the Maidenhead centre a blow when it followed Argos out the door. Avid Vogue reader May now has little to choose from locally, apart from H&amp;M (which she attended the opening of two years ago), Topshop or Marks &amp; Spencer. \u201cIf this shopping centre disappeared, the town centre would die,\u201d says one worried store manager . \u201cPeople\u2019s shopping habits have changed; young people don\u2019t shop in shopping centres, they shop online. Amazon has taken over: why pay to park here when anything bog standard can be ordered online and delivered the next day? This situation is not unique. It is happening everywhere.\u201d When private equity property investor Vixcroft teamed up with a hedge fund to buy Nicholsons for \u00a337m in 2015, the centre\u2019s selling points included Crossrail and numerous upmarket residential developments on the horizon. The price tag, backed with a \u00a326m loan, was less than half the \u00a385m paid when it changed hands in 2007. Some property experts fear that Nicholsons, which has been pushed into receivership, is just the tip of an iceberg as hundreds of shopping centre deals brokered in the early part of the decade turn sour. Property asset firm Apam counts at least 175 malls in similar straits as high street names queue up to shut stores or negotiate lower rents. Retailers including Carpetright, Mothercare, House of Fraser and New Look have resorted to company voluntary arrangements \u2013 a form of insolvency \u2013 to close down shops, dramatically reducing the rental income collected by centre owners. Apam executive Simon Cooke says private equity investors did not anticipate the perfect storm created by business rates, weak consumer confidence and the fallout from Brexit: \u201cThey came with a five-year plan, in a five-year fund and with five years of debt. They thought they would be able to do a couple of new lettings and sell it on.\u201d Business rates have become a lightning rod for angry retail bosses saddled with expensive property portfolios in an internet age. Retailers in parts of the country where there have been property booms have been especially hard hit because rates are calculated as a proportion of a property\u2019s value on 1 April 2015. As a result, Maidenhead\u2019s total rates bill will increase again to \u00a357m next year. That is \u00a36m more than in 2016, the equivalent of a 12.6% increase, according to real estate advisor, Altus Group. Nicholsons owners, however, cannot blame its woes on business rates because its retailers\u2019 bills have been cut by a third \u2013 a result of what Altus\u2019s Robert Hayton describes as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d down in the rents being paid in the centre. Another problem for Nicholsons is that shoppers prefer bigger nearby centres such as Reading\u2019s Oracle. Mary, a volunteer in the Maidenhead Heritage Centre where the attractions include a Spitfire simulator, heads to the upmarket Windsor for her retail therapy. \u201cThe shops in town have been closing for a number of years,\u201d she says of Maidenhead. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money around here but we don\u2019t seem to get the facilities.\u201d Councils in Kent and Shropshire have resorted to bailing out struggling malls and it remains to been seen who might be prepared to invest in the Maidenhead mall. \u201cSome of these centres will ultimately be closed down if nothing is done, as the income will fall to below the running cost,\u201d says Cooke who suggests long-term partnerships with councils are the answer. \u201cThis is not about property investors and banks losing money. It\u2019s about the future of town centres and whether they are going to be safe, vibrant places for all generations to visit. It\u2019s a big question for government.\u201d",

It\u2019s about the future of town centres and whether they are going to be safe, vibrant places for all generations to visit. It\u2019s a big question for government.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Caitlin Young is one of millions of teenagers and 20-somethings who are shaking up the fashion industry by digging out their parents\u2019 cast-offs, raiding charity shops and scanning boot sales to build mini businesses online. Young picks up 1990s and \u201cY2K\u201d early 2000s \u201cvintage\u201d gear from charity shops and jumble sales and then styles or customises them for her 22,500 followers on Depop, a fast-growing social media app which combines the image creation of Instagram with a digital version of market trader bargaining. \u201cPeople in my family say, \u2018You sell used shoes?,\u2019 like they are so disgusted, but everyone I know buys vintage. It\u2019s what people do now,\u201d says Young. \u201cIt pays for my life,\u201d adds the animation student, who sells up to \u00a32,000-worth of secondhand clothing a month online. Young and other online clothing sellers are shrugging off the trends shovelled out by mainstream brands and high street chains and making thousands of pounds by trading vintage trainers, fluorescent hoodies and high-waisted jeans their parents wore to raves in the 1990s and early 2000s. Founded in 2011, Depop now has 10m users, most of whom are in the UK, and takes more than \u00a3300m ($400m) a year in sales, a figure that has doubled year on year. Its British shoppers, 80% of whom are aged 13 to 24, buy an average of 20,000 items a day. It reckons that hundreds of its top sellers make more than \u00a3150,000 a year selling online. Depop has caught on to a trend in which secondhand is no longer second best, along with other online marketplaces including US-based Thredup, Poshmark and Grailed, which trade in a more social way than the more established eBay and Gumtree. The online fashion specialist Asos\u2019s marketplace section includes vintage boutiques, while British startup Student High Street holds sellers\u2019 events at universities. A study in the US by Thredup suggested there was a 25% rise in the number of women prepared to buy secondhand in 2017 compared with the year before. It predicted 15% annual growth in the market over the next few years. compared with just 2% for the overall fashion sales. Thredup estimates that secondhand clothes now make up 6% of respondents\u2019 wardrobes, double that of 10 years ago, and that proportion could almost double again to 11% by 2027. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a dark market,\u201d says Lorna Hall, the head of insight at the trend forecasting firm WGSN. \u201cMoney is coming out of the mainstream market because of this way of shopping, particularly in Generation Z [under 25s].\u201d \u201cPeople love that you can easily search for people selling on Depop who are close to you, pick up your purchase and avoid postage costs,\u201d she says. Simon Beckerman founded Depop in Italy in 2011 but moved the company to London three years ago after winning $8m in backing from Balderton Capital, the UK-based investment firm which has previously backed Betfair and Figleaves. Beckerman told Artefact magazine his initial goal was to aim for \u201cyoung designers and cool collectors \u2026 but we discovered this world of girls who want to sell their whole wardrobe and I didn\u2019t imagine there would be such a need for that. Ebay is complicated, long and, if you want to sell something for \u00a35, it just doesn\u2019t work. So having Depop as a social marketplace with chat is better and all the girls love it\u201d. The 2008 recession sparked a change in attitude that has been embraced by young people who want to be fashionable but are concerned about the environmental impact of throwing away clothes after only a few wears. \u201cWe are living in an age of DIY and the rise of being able to create your own platform,\u201d says Depop seller Thidarat Kaha, who sells about \u00a36,000 of clothes a month to her 44,000 followers. \u201cThe mainstream market used to be just buying something from Topshop, and someone else would have that same dress. \u201cThe magic of this product is it is usually one on one. No one else is going to get anything else exactly the same as what you just purchased. And young people are more conscious about the future of the planet. Recycling and buying vintage clothing is contributing to to consuming clothes in a better way.\u201d Depop is aiming to tap into that change in mentality to quadruple the size of the business in the next three or four years. In total, $40m has now been ploughed into the company by investors betting on that future, including Octopus Ventures, the company that backed Graze and Gym Box and Creandum, that backed Spotify and the payment tech firm iZettle. \u201cWe are so small compared to the overall size of the market, the potential is huge,\u201d says Maria Raga, Depop\u2019s chief executive. \u201cDepop is about people selling stuff that is good quality, inspirational and that is down to a lot of creativity.\u201d Young, who began by making and selling clothes to friends at school and used to sell vintage items on eBay before joining Depop as a student, says she has had such a good response to her customised clothes that she is now considering launching her own clothing brand. \u201cI started it to keep me going while I\u2019m studying, but I just love it,\u201d she says.",

A report this week found that three-quarters of all workers do not receive the same pay packet from one month to the next \u2013 with the problem most acute for low-paid workers in the gig economy or on zero-hours contracts. The Resolution Foundation found that for those on the lowest annual incomes, the average monthly fluctuation in pay was \u00a3180 \u2013 which can make the difference between paying the rent or feeding the family. Many are forced to turn to crippling payday loans or high-cost credit cards to make it through to the end of the month. Guardian Money spoke to fourworkers currently trying to survive in the gig economy. \u201cAll you get is \u00a320 to \u00a325 a day. Then my motorbike was stolen\u201d Arjun, 32, (not his real name) is a Deliveroo rider in west London \u201cYou log in to work at about 6pm or 6.30pm for the evening rush, and you find that there are already 20 other people at the branch waiting for work. You often sit around waiting for an order. By 7.30pm there might be 50 people logged in. All you end up getting is about \u00a320 to \u00a325 a day. I only work for Deliveroo. I used to do work for Uber Eats but they blocked me after a customer complained that I hadn\u2019t delivered something, when I had. \u201cBecause there are so many other workers there now, I usually end up doing about five deliveries, using my motorbike. My bike has been stolen twice. Once I managed to recover it, but everything was broken. The bike cost \u00a31,600 so this has been really bad for me. \u201cI don\u2019t have a full-time job during the day. What I\u2019m trying to do is make some money by buying and selling stuff on eBay, but it doesn\u2019t make much. I\u2019m trying to build my own website. \u201cI have a wife and a young child. We pay \u00a3650 a month for a room in a two-bed flat, which we share with someone who rents the other room. My wife does some part-time teaching work but generally we live very much day to day. I have never been able to save any money. Whatever comes in just goes out straight away.\u201d \u201cAt times it\u2019s comfortable.

For the first year it was a bit of an adventure. It was possible to make a comfortable, if not particularly high level of living. It was the summer of 2016, there weren\u2019t too many other Deliveroo cyclists around, and I was picking up \u00a310 to \u00a312 an hour. I was able to start paying off my overdraft. It was flexible, you could earn money, or take a day off, it was really good. \u201cThen I got a knee injury. I couldn\u2019t work for three months, and there was no sick pay from Deliveroo. I got a bit of statutory sick pay and my grandparents gave me \u00a350 a week, but it soon became a beans on toast life. \u201cI came back to work to find a lot of the other couriers struggling. Loads of the orders were going to the scooter guys. One ice-cold day in February 2017 there were 20 of us waiting outside all day for orders. In the end I earned just \u00a34 that day. \u201cI\u2019ve had to get side jobs on building sites and pubs. I switched from bike to scooter with Deliveroo and started getting more drops. It was brilliant again. Then I got hit by a car. It was months before I was able to work again. Above all, it\u2019s a very precarious living. My plan is to try to make a living in the music business, and our jazz band, No Little Trouble, is beginning to get noticed.\u201d \u201cI can make good money \u2013 about \u00a3700 a week. I\u2019m happy with that\u201d Colin Dodds, 48, is an Uber driver in Glasgow and Edinburgh \u201cYes, you don\u2019t know how much you are going to earn each week. But if I wanted that, I\u2019d work as an employee. I like being self-employed. I have a target every day \u2013 some days are quiet, others very busy. \u201cThere are many more Uber drivers around now, but I\u2019ve not seen a drop in fares or my income. I think it\u2019s because Glasgow and Edinburgh had such a cap on hackney cab drivers. \u201cI make good money. I work about 48 hours a week and it comes in at about \u00a3700. My income has actually considerably increased because of Uber. But in Glasgow, when the students go home, my income drops a fair bit. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely safer working for Uber. Bad things are less likely to happen. When I was a private hire driver I was twice threatened with stabbing. And on one occasion I got a man touching my leg when driving. Don\u2019t laugh. You wouldn\u2019t laugh if it was a female driver saying that. \u201cUber can be harsh: I know a pal taken off for five days after a complaint from a customer. There were five of them, and it\u2019s illegal to have more than four. But they said to Uber he was rude, and Uber believed them. That\u2019s the thing with Uber \u2013 they give you no right of reply, they just take the money off you. \u201cAnd I hate it when the customer says \u2018I\u2019ll give you five stars.\u2019 I just wish they\u2019d give a tip instead.\u201d \u201cUber should be forced to do in London what\u2019s happened in New York and ensure a minimum wage\u201d James Farrar is a former Uber driver who won a court case over the minimum wage. Uber is appealing. \u201cNo Uber driver is ever given the benefit of the doubt. If the customer makes a claim, Uber suspends their account and it can be three weeks before they are back on. What I\u2019ve been doing is fighting for better terms and conditions. \u201cUber used to publish a benchmark figure for the earnings of a \u2018top driver\u2019. They said a top driver would pick up \u00a318 an hour gross and work a 48-hour week. So that\u2019s \u00a3850 or so. But you have to pay 25% commission to Uber. Most drivers rent their cars \u2013 typically that\u2019s about \u00a3270. Then there\u2019s another \u00a3100 for fuel. In reality, it can bring a driver\u2019s income down to little more than \u00a35 an hour, which is less than the minimum wage. \u201cNew York brought in a new system where Uber drivers are effectively guaranteed $15 an hour after costs. The idea is that for every hour the driver is logged on to the system, Uber has to top up the driver\u2019s pay if they don\u2019t reach the threshold through fares. What it means is that Uber no longer has any incentive to oversupply the platform with drivers. The tragedy of the system in the UK is that the only way you can make up for lack of fares is to work more and more hours. \u201cConsumers know fares are too low and they will wear higher fares. But because Uber is doing an IPO [stock market flotation] it wants poor people to subsidise its multibillion-dollar float. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue with strike action, and we\u2019re urging people not to cross the digital picket line. We won in court, Uber appealed and lost, now it\u2019s the court of appeal and, if it loses that, it will probably go to the supreme court. It could take seven years from start to finish.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2018 to correct some details of a case study.",

You often sit around waiting for an order. By 7.30pm there might be 50 people logged in. All you end up getting is about \u00a320 to \u00a325 a day. I only work for Deliveroo. I used to do work for Uber Eats but they blocked me after a customer complained that I hadn\u2019t delivered something, when I had.</p> <p>\u201cBecause there are so many other workers there now, I usually end up doing about five deliveries, using my motorbike. My bike has been stolen twice. Once I managed to recover it, but everything was broken.
