      "bodyText": "Stock markets around the world closed down on the last trading day of 2015, with the Dow suffering its first annual drop since 2008. But for the two largest stock market-listed gun manufacturers 2015 has been another great year \u2013 their value has doubled. In a year marred with gun violence and peppered with calls for tougher gun control measures, Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger and Company have been two of the best performing stocks in the US. Over the year Smith &amp; Wesson rose from $9.47 to $21.98. Sturm, Ruger and Company rose from $34.63 to $59.61. It\u2019s not just 2015 that has been good for gun stocks. Over the past five years, stocks of Smith &amp; Wesson increased in value sixfold while stocks of Sturm, Ruger and Company quadrupled in value. By comparison, Apple stock remained almost unchanged over the past year and only doubled in value over the past five years, reaching about $105 a share this year compared with $46 in 2010. Netflix, which has been named as one of the best performing stocks of 2015, performed as well as the US gun companies \u2013 more than doubling in value over the past 12 months and growing by 464% over the past five years, reaching $114 a share on Thursday compared with $25 in 2010. Even as Smith &amp; Wesson stock reached a record high share price earlier this month at $23.45, analysts say it is likely to go higher still in the coming months. Chris Krueger, a senior research analyst with Lake Street Capital Markets, puts Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s price target at $27. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company reached a record high in January 2014 at $80 a share. Investors have a reason to be optimistic about the future of gun stocks. This past Black Friday saw a record number of background checks for gun sales. The 185,345 checks do not necessarily translate into sales, as not all checks result in a sale and multiple firearms can be bought with a single background check. However, manufacturers rely on the background checks to measure how the market is doing. This November, the FBI ran 2.2m background checks for firearms. That\u2019s 24% more than last year. On a conference call with analyst following the 8 December earnings report, Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s president and CEO, James Debney, mentioned Black Friday numbers four times. He called the numbers \u201cparticularly encouraging\u201d. \u201cThe consumer is out there, shopping for firearms, perhaps a little bit more strongly than we anticipated. So certainly, that\u2019s a factor in our thinking going forward as well,\u201d said Debney, referring to the Black Friday sales. Gun shop owners across the country have been reporting that the demand for guns has remained strong well into December as Americans sought to buy firearms as Christmas presents. Debney stressed that gun manufacturers have to be flexible in order to meet the increased demand for guns during such times. According to Krueger, that is one of the short-term challenges facing Smith &amp; Wesson: keeping up with the demand if sales are elevated. Krueger pointed out that according to adjusted FBI background checks, \u201cthe industry\u2019s strongest year was 2013, largely driven by strong sales in the first half of the year. This occurred when gun control became a large, political topic and when there were attempts to pass new laws restricting certain firearms products.\u201d Earlier this year, when the former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for tougher gun control laws, Smith &amp; Wesson stocks surged by more than 7%. In 2015, the gun market conditions returned to normal, \u201cwhere growth is in the mid to high single digits\u201d, said Krueger. \u201cHowever, there has been an uptick in recent weeks following the terrorist activity in Paris and San Bernardino, as people want the ability to defend themselves if they are ever caught in one of these situations.\u201d While many would attribute the spike in demand for guns to a renewed push for gun control, analysts say there is more to the current market dynamic than that. The main reason why people are buying guns is fear and a desire to be able to defend themselves, they say. \u201cI think many people in the media are wrong about why there has been a surge in firearms purchases in recent weeks. The news articles are mostly attributing it to fears that new gun laws will be passed and that consumers are making purchases while it is legal. I believe that this occurred after Newtown, but that this time people are making purchases because they feel the need to defend themselves,\u201d said Krueger. \u201cI have had multiple conversations with gun buyers and this has been the consistent message. None seem too concerned about new laws.\u201d Fear \u2013 especially of Muslims and of African Americans protesters \u2013 is contributing to the demand in the market, Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst with financial services firm BB&amp;T, told the Guardian earlier this month. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear right now of violence with everything going on in anti-Muslim movements and anti-black movements,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this white fear going on \u2013 [people think] \u2018It\u2019s an unsafe world, and I need to be armed.\u2019\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s pledge to increase pay at Sports Direct and improve working conditions represents an extraordinary climbdown. The tycoon barely speaks in public, let alone openly admitting that the company could be doing better. Just two weeks ago Sports Direct issued a lengthy defence of its employment practices and hit out at \u201cunfounded criticisms\u201d. Ashley chose New Year\u2019s Eve to announce that the sportswear retailer would start paying staff 15p more than the minimum wage and that he wanted to overhaul its image as an employer. \u201cI want to see Sports Direct become the best high street retail employer after John Lewis,\u201d he told the Daily Mirror. \u201cI realise this is ambitious and it won\u2019t be easy, but I believe that as a FTSE 100 or even 250 company we have a responsibility to set a high moral standard.\u201d The Unite trade union has dismissed the comments as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d, and it certainly leaves many of the issues raised by the Guardian\u2019s investigation into Sports Direct unresolved. It found that the company was effectively paying below the minimum wage by making staff undergo rigorous searches, typically lasting 15 minutes, at the end of their shift. The searches, which go down to the last layer of clothing, take place because management is concerned about products being stolen. Two undercover reporters for the Guardian found their pay averaged \u00a36.50 an hour during shifts they worked at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse as a result of the unpaid searches. A 15p pay rise would therefore lift their hourly pay to just \u00a36.65, still below the minimum wage of \u00a36.70, and not the official rate of \u00a36.85 cited by the company on Thursday. While any increase in pay is welcome, Sports Direct has so much further to go if it even wants to be considered in the same league as John Lewis as an employer. This announcement does not address the potential arrears that have been built up by staff waiting to be searched. Not does it address the company\u2019s use of zero-hour contracts and casual staff, a strict \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d disciplinary procedure that includes a penalty for taking too long in the toilet, and staff being harangued by a tannoy in the warehouse for not working fast enough. Ashley said that while several thousand Sports Direct staff receive \u201clife changing bonuses\u201d each year through its incentive scheme for managers, the company also has an \u201cobligation to our whole workforce\u201d. This is, however, the least that should be expected. While Sports Direct reviews its employment standards, others are setting a new bar. Aldi and Lidl have announced in recent weeks that they will pay shop floor staff the living wage, with Aldi committing to pay \u00a38.40 an hour outside London and \u00a39.45 in London, and Lidl paying \u00a38.20 and \u00a39.35. The German supermarkets have shown that discount retailing does not need to be combined with discount wages. This article was amended on 1 January 2016. Aldi and Lidl announced recently that they would pay shop floor staff the living wage, not the \u201cnational living wage\u201d introduced by George Osborne in July 2015. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has bowed to criticism of its working conditions by pledging \u00a310m towards a staff pay rise, but Britain\u2019s largest trade union dismissed the response to Guardian revelations over controversial employment practices at the retailer as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d. Unite said the 15p per hour pay increase was pitiful and should not distract from \u201cVictorian work practices\u201d in Sports Direct warehouses. Ian Wright, the head of the influential business, innovation and skills select committee in Westminster, demanded confirmation that the pay rise would apply throughout the business. The committee is seeking to question Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley about his company\u2019s behaviour. The Sports Direct announcement, which was accompanied by a commitment to turn the company into Britain\u2019s best high street employer after John Lewis, followed a Guardian investigation that revealed how the company effectively pays thousands of temporary workers below the national minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour. Warehouse staff undergo searches at the end of each shift for which their time is unpaid and suffer deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late. Despite Unite\u2019s criticism of the pay rise pledge, it will be viewed by many as a climbdown for Sports Direct and its founder after the Guardian revelations were met with initial hostility by the company. The announcement comes just two weeks after the company issued a lengthy defence of its employment practices and hit out at \u201cunfounded criticisms\u201d. The increase will affect an estimated 15,000 workers on zero-hours contracts in stores and 4,000 agency staff at Sports Direct\u2019s depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. It will take effect from 1 January and will cost \u00a310m a year, including \u201crelated costs and knock-on costs\u201d, the company told the stock market in a statement. A spokesman for Sports Direct said the extra costs included national insurance contributions and the wage rise was not a payment in arrears for any salary shortfall in the past. The company insisted it was compliant with minimum wage regulations, but refused to disclose whether it had been approached by HMRC over the Guardian\u2019s findings. Two undercover Guardian reporters were paid \u00a36.50 per hour on average for their shifts in November after the compulsory searches and a penalty for clocking in five minutes late were taken into account. The pay rise means staff aged over 21 will get an increase from \u00a36.70 per hour to \u00a36.85, while those aged between 18 and 20 will collect \u00a35.45 per hour instead of \u00a35.30. The 15p premium will also take effect for over-25s when the \u201cnational living wage\u201d of \u00a37.20 is introduced in April, meaning they will be paid \u00a37.35. Announcing the \u00a310m investment in a newspaper interview, Ashley said he wanted to make Sports Direct \u201cthe best high street retail employer after John Lewis\u201d. The tycoon told the Daily Mirror: \u201cI realise this is ambitious and it won\u2019t be easy, but I believe that as a FTSE 100 or even 250 company, we have a responsibility to set a high moral standard.\u201d Ashley said Sports Direct paid out \u201clife-changing bonuses\u201d to several thousand staff every year but that the company had an \u201cobligation to our whole workforce\u201d. The tycoon told the newspaper that he wanted them to \u201chold my feet to the fire and ensure we don\u2019t slip up\u201d. However, Unite demanded further commitments from Ashley. It called for the company to commit to paying the living wage \u2013 a voluntary measure separate from Osborne\u2019s national living wage and set at \u00a38.25 outside London \u2013 and put all staff on permanent contracts instead of zero-hours agreements, under which staff do not know how many hours they will work from one week to the next. Luke Primarolo, a Unite regional officer, said: \u201cThis pitiful promise by Sports Direct to pay just over the minimum wage should not distract from the Victorian work practices at the retailer\u2019s massive Shirebrook depot. Nor should it deter HMRC from investigating the possible non-payment of the minimum wage to the thousands of agency staff who eke out a living on the site. \u201cFundamental problems remain at Sports Direct, ranging from the exploitative use of zero-hours contracts in its stores through to \u2018gulag\u2019 working conditions at its main warehouse in Shirebrook. \u201cIf Mike Ashley is to fulfill his promise of making Sports Direct a model employer then he needs to commit Sports Direct to becoming a living wage employer and stamp out abusive work practices by putting all staff on permanent contracts. Otherwise, he risks accusations of engaging in yet another PR stunt and a continued loss of confidence among customers and investors alike.\u201d Sports Direct has already said Ashley will lead a review into the terms and conditions of the company\u2019s agency workers in 2016. Unite said Ashley needed to engage with the union \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d over the review. Wright said he still wanted Ashley to appear in front of the select committee and that the devil may be in the detail about the minimum wage announcement. The Labour MP said: \u201cThe news that Sports Direct is committing to paying its staff above the minimum wage is a welcome development. However, the committee\u2019s wish for Mr Ashley to come before us and give evidence in the New Year still stands. \u201cWe would like to hear further details as to how Sports Direct will guarantee that this commitment is applied throughout the company. We would also like to hear directly from Mr Ashley regarding an inquiry we will consider into employee rights, working conditions and the future of work, particularly amongst the low-paid, in an era of growing self-employment and agency work.\u201d Shares in the retailer rose slightly after the announcement, increasing by 7.50, or 1.3%, to 577p, valuing the company at \u00a33.4bn. More than \u00a3400m was wiped off its value in early December after investors turned on the company following disappointing financial results and the Guardian revelations. The investigation prompted Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP, to label Sports Direct a \u201cbad advert for British business\u201d. In the wake of the revelations, Nick Boles, the business minister, said HMRC could take enforcement action if staff had been paid less than the minimum wage. Workers have until 31 January 2016 to tell HMRC if they have not received the minimum wage. Sports Direct insisted it was compliant with employment regulations in a statement defending its practices on 18 December. However, it said the review of terms and conditions for agency workers could lead to the company making changes.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Treasury has defended the City regulator\u2019s decision to ditch a review into banking culture as the chancellor came under pressure to revive the scrapped study. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, urged George Osborne to exert his influence and reinstate the review, which the Financial Conduct Authority dropped just months after it was launched. MPs said the move would be regarded as a softening of policymakers\u2019 stance towards bankers. McDonnell said: \u201cThis will be a huge blow to customers and taxpayers who are all still paying the price for the failed culture in the banking sector that\u2019s been widely attributed to be among the main causes of the crash and the scandals over Libor and price-fixing.\u201d He said the FCA was making a \u201cdangerous and costly mistake\u201d. \u201cThe chancellor therefore cannot stay silent on this issue. It\u2019s time he used his influence to keep this review going. Otherwise he\u2019s letting down the rest of us who bailed the banks out and also allowing a signal to be sent to carry on regardless. Given the scale and severity of the failings in the financial sector and the criminal behaviour shown by some banks, the scrapping of the FCA\u2019s review into banking culture sends the wrong message at the wrong time,\u201d he said. The review was included in the FCA\u2019s business plan for 2015, but was dropped after an initial assessment found it difficult to compare different cultures inside banks. The decision to abandon the review follows the resignation of the FCA chief executive, Martin Wheatley, after the chancellor forced him out in July. A permanent replacement has not been named to take over from Wheatley, who had flagged his tough stance towards the industry by warning he would shoot first and ask questions later. The Labour MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee, tweeted: He added: \u201cFCA surrender to big banks today is entirely from pressure from Treasury and Osborne.\u201d Mark Garnier, a Conservative MP on the committee, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere has always been this great argument that perhaps the Treasury is having more influence over the regulator than perhaps it ought to and certainly, if I was looking for a Machiavellian plot behind what\u2019s happened here and the tone of the regulator, then I suppose I would start looking at the Treasury.\u201d The FCA insisted the Treasury had played no part in ending the review. \u201cHaving undertaken an initial piece of scoping work, we decided that a traditional thematic review would not help us achieve our desired outcomes and we would therefore take forward our work on culture through other routes. This was an FCA decision. [The Treasury] were not involved,\u201d it said. The Treasury denied involvement and said it was not backtracking on banking reform after making changes to the way senior bankers are held to account and altering the tax regime to pacify HSBC, which is reviewing whether or not to keep its headquarters in the UK. Greg Hands, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cMinisters had no involvement in, and indeed no advance notice of, this decision by the independent regulator. To suggest otherwise is utterly false. For Labour, whose system led to the banking crisis and the great recession that caused such misery to millions of families, to complain now about regulation is risible.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson added: \u201cThe government has been absolutely clear that the integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain, which is why we have taken action to improve conduct across the banking sector and deal with the abuses and unacceptable behaviour of the past. \u201cThe independent FCA is responsible for ensuring that the top management of banks instil the right culture and standards of conduct in their institutions. This decision by the independent FCA reflects its view that the best way of doing this is for it to support individual firms bring about change within their organisations. The government was not involved in this decision, to suggest otherwise is wrong.\u201d Consumer bodies were also concerned, after a string of scandals including the payment protection insurance mis-selling fiasco. Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which? said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the regulator has decided against publishing this report on the culture of banking. Cultural change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, so despite signs of improvement, the FCA must not take their eye off the ball and should continue to clean up the industry.\u201d The FCA said it was still focused on culture in financial services firms. \u201cThere is currently extensive ongoing work in this area within firms and externally. We have decided that the best way to support these efforts is to engage individually with firms to encourage their delivery of cultural change as well as supporting the other initiatives outside the FCA.\u201d The Banking Standards Board, established in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, has sent banks their first annual report cards, but it is not clear if the banks will publish the findings.",

      "bodyText": "More than 800 bankers in the UK were paid at least \u20ac1m (\u00a3736,000) by four major US investment banks in 2014. The regulatory disclosures by four US banks \u2013 Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan \u2013 expose the number of financial professionals being handed \u20ac1m or more six years after the financial crisis. Documents published by the UK arm of Goldman Sachs show that 262 of its key staff received at least \u20ac1m, with 10 of these receiving more than \u20ac8m. Morgan Stanley paid \u20ac1m or more to 190 individuals and Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid those sums to 159 staff. JP Morgan disclosed payments of \u20ac1m or more to 287 people. The 898 individuals who received more than \u20ac1m were predominantly based in the UK. The figures cover the year to the end of 2014 and have been been disclosed in recent months to comply with EU rules. Bank of America disclosed it paid six staff between \u20ac5m and \u20ac10m. Morgan Stanley lists seven as receiving over \u20ac5m without putting an upper limit on the pay deals, as does JP Morgan, which said eight were handed more than \u20ac5m. In September, the European Banking Authority, the pan-European banking regulator, published data for so-called high earners for 2013 when it found 3,178 bankers were paid more than \u20ac1m, of whom 2,086 were based in the UK. That total had fallen from 3,530 in total in 2012, with 2,714 of them in Britain. UK banks had published some of the information earlier in 2015 in their annual reports. Barclays, for instance, revealed 359 people were paid more than \u00a31m, compared with 481 the year before. The disclosures about pay follow the revelations a fortnight ago that seven City banks paid a combined \u00a321m in corporation tax in 2014. Between them the banks, together employing about 33,000 mainly City workers, generated UK profits of \u00a33.6bn on revenues of \u00a321bn in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "City investors are nursing losses after the FTSE 100 ended the year as one of the worst performers among global stock markets. Britain\u2019s biggest share index shed almost 5% during a volatile 12 months dominated by the commodities crunch and fears over China\u2019s slowing economy. It means London investors missed out on the returns enjoyed by their rivals in Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo and Shanghai. In a lacklustre New Year\u2019s Eve trading session, the blue-chip index dropped 31 points to finish the year at 6,242. That left it 324 points adrift of the 6,566 point mark where it began the year - a decline of 4.9%. Connor Campbell, an analyst at the City firm SpreadEx, said it was a \u201climp, whimpering finish\u201d to the year. \u201cAfter a year that began so promisingly the markets are wrapping up 2015 in the limpest way possible, a collective sigh instead of any attempt at New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks,\u201d he said. Nine months ago, City traders were celebrating as the FTSE broke through the 7,000-point mark for the first time. It reached an all-time closing high of 7103.98 in April. The index was rocked over the summer, however, as evidence mounted that China\u2019s economy could suffer a \u201chard landing\u201d. It shed a tenth of its value in four dramatic days, as the so-called Great Fall of China rocked markets across the globe. This fuelled a collapse in commodity prices. Crude oil has fallen by almost a third this year, while copper has tumbled by 25%. Gold fell by 10%, posting its third annual fall in a row. This in turn triggered major slumps in the value of the world\u2019s mining giants, many of whom are listed in London. Anglo American, which produces platinum, copper, nickel and iron ore, plunged by 75% to record lows during 2015. The commodity trader Glencore also ploughed new depths, losing 69.5% of its value. Rio Tinto dropped by 34%. While the FTSE lost ground, the German DAX posted a 9.8% gain and France\u2019s CAC index jumped by 8.5%. European indices benefitted from the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme, announced in January, which weakened the euro and helped eurozone exporters. The London stock market also suffered from concern that a rise in US interest rates would derail emerging market economies. That historic hike finally came two weeks ago, starting the process of \u201cnormalising\u201d monetary policy and weaning investors off ultra-cheap money. The prospect of a Federal Reserve rate rise drove the dollar up by around 9% against other currencies this year. That was welcome news for Japan, where a weak yen should combat deflation and help exports. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied by 9% during the year. Despite August\u2019s slump, China\u2019s Shanghai stock exchange gained 10% during 2015, outperforming the FTSE. It rallied during the autumn, as authorities committed to new measures to prop up share prices. The US market was more subdued, the Dow Jones ending the year 2.23% down, although the Nasdaq Composite was 5.73% up, with a degree of investor enthusiasm for tech shares not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange firm World First, believes Beijing\u2019s ability to stabilise its economy will shape the global outlook in 2016. \u201cChina at the moment is feeling the blowback of years of investment driven growth with industries chock full of unproductive factories, a housing sector with a significant stock overhang and ensuing high debt levels in local government and corporate balance sheets,\u201d he said. Some analysts believe that the London stock market will struggle to achieve major gains in 2016. William Hill is offering odds of 7/2 that the FTSE 100 will be over 7,000 points in a year\u2019s time, but only 6/4 that it finishes 2016 between 6,000 and 6,499 points. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a vast amount of movement in the FTSE 100 this year,\u201d said a spokesman. The City will spend the coming months fretting about whether UK interest rates will rise for the first time since 2007, according to Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG. \u201cThere is reason to believe that 2016 will also see sentiment largely driven by the movement of oil prices, their impact upon inflation expectations and the subsequent monetary policy stance from the Bank of England,\u201d he said. The weakening oil price has hurt Russia\u2019s currency. On Thursday, the Russian rouble hit fresh record lows, touching 74 roubles to the dollar. 2015 was \u201ca rotten year for emerging markets\u201d generally, said Kit Juckes of the French Bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cThe big losers include the newly floating/sinking Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the South African rand and the Colombian peso, which are all down by more than 25% against the dollar and are even down against the rouble.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A year that saw leading shares hit new peaks, only to fall to three-year lows mere months later, was always going to be difficult for investors. Supported by central bank stimulus measures and hopes of a quick end to the Greek crisis, the FTSE 100 hit a record close of 7,103.98 in April. Even then, however, there were concerns about slowing demand from China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, which put metal and oil prices under pressure. Those fears only grew as the year progressed, and when China unveiled a surprise devaluation of the yuan in August, commodities suffered a real rout and oil slumped to near 11-year lows. Despite all that, the US Federal Reserve came round to the view that it would soon be time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, in the belief the US economy was strong enough to handle dearer borrowing costs despite problems elsewhere in the global economy. Traders inevitably headed for cover at the prospect of a rate rise, and markets suffered a dreadful December. There was a mini-rally in the run-up to Christmas as the Fed did indeed make its move on rates, which at least relieved the uncertainty, and there was hope of further stimulus measures from China. By the end of the year the FTSE 100 had recorded an annual fall of 4.9% to 6,242, so it was no surprise that our share tips for 2015 ended in negative territory, although a 5.1% collective loss from our tipsters was worse than the overall market. There were some notable gainers, however, with International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, soaring more than 25%, helped by lower fuel costs and a strong trading performance. Aviva also did well, as insurance proved a stable sector. Unfortunately there were also a couple of very poor performers. AO World lost 44%, hit by a profit warning in February from which it struggled to recover. My own tip, Software Radio Technology, dropped 21.4% after delays in receiving revenues from some of its newly won contracts, although it said it was confident on the outlook. As a reminder, the 12-month period we use for these tips is an arbitrary timeframe for tracking shares. In the real world, investors would be likely to cash in any gains or cut their losses at different times of the year, rather than wait until 31 December. With that in mind, on to this year\u2019s choices. A number of them are backing the UK consumer to keep spending, despite the prospect of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England sometime in 2016. Nick Fletcher The dining out market is expected to continue growing, with consumers still feeling the benefits of relatively cheap borrowing and low inflation. Restaurant Group, whose brands include Chiquito, Garfunkel\u2019s and Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, is likely to be one beneficiary. Its outlets are in retail and leisure parks, which insulates it from competition on the high street, according to the broker Panmure Gordon, and also gives it access to customers seeking meals before or after a visit to the cinema. Analysts think it is good at spotting suitable properties for new restaurants, which is just as well given its ambition to double its 495 outlets within 10 years. Some believe it could profitably add a fast casual brand, where food is priced more cheaply and customer turnover is higher, to its existing outlets. Despite the possible negative impact of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the shares \u2013 now 685p \u2013 could have further to go. Simon Goodley WPP\u2019s chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell, has many fans in the City. Watchers of the advertising sector love to tip his firm\u2019s shares and many continue to do so. They reckon the company will continue to buy back stock, while its investment in digital should continue to pay off. In fact, of the 31 analysts following the stock, according to the financial website Digital Look, 22 are bullish and nine are neutral after the shares added around 16% to \u00a315.63 in 2015. Such a positive consensus among City analysts is often a sell sign, but we\u2019ll risk it and join the Sorrell love-in. David Hellier Shares in Cambria Automobiles, the motor dealership, have been climbing steadily of late and currently stand at an all-time high of 80p, up 70% over the 2015. There is reason to think they have much further to go. Annual profits came in 43% ahead of the previous year and above expectations at \u00a37.7m. Such is the momentum in the business that Zeus Capital, the group\u2019s joint brokers, are upping their earnings forecasts for 2016 and 2017 by 4%. The dealership is favoured by Aston Martin and Land Rover, and the group has a history of buying underperforming dealerships and turning them around. Gwyn Topham Every dog has its day, and FirstGroup has been a real dog. Not least since the Aberdeen-based business bought Greyhound, the US coach business, in 2007. First\u2019s share price has hovered around the \u00a31 level for the last two years, but a 2013 rights issue is starting to fade in the memory, the erudite Tim O\u2019Toole is still in post as chief executive, and the group has even won the TransPennine rail franchise - although it is nowhere near as lucrative as the ones that slipped away. No one should bank their life savings on FirstGroup, but with IAG \u2013 last year\u2019s golden tip \u2013 now priced in for success, this oversized bus company can surely chug its share price of 107p further uphill. Terry Macalister Transport infrastructure is one of George Osborne\u2019s biggest obsessions, led by the HS2 rail project. This is good news for the UK engineering sector. WS Atkins, which has been attracting attention with its award-winning work on the design of Birmingham New Street station, is one of the firms that should be brought in early to draw up plans for new rail, road and school schemes. Atkins, which reported a 40% increase in half-year profits last month, pays decent dividends, but it has recently beefed up its nuclear division which may put some off its shares, which stand at \u00a316.26. Sean Farrell It is probably foolish to back a company whose shares have almost doubled in the last year, but take a look at SuperGroup, the owner of the trendy Superdry brand. Amid frantic price slashing by fashion retailers, the firm\u2019s chief executive, Euan Sutherland, said on 16 December that it was selling almost all of its stock at full price. That appears to bode well for what will be another tough year on the high street. SuperGroup, which closed the year at \u00a316.46, also has growth options in the US, China and Germany. None of those markets are easy, but Sutherland, a seasoned retailer who joined in November 2014, seems to have the necessary grip on the business. Graham Ruddick The discount retailer Poundland, whose shares stand at 207.7p, began 2015 by agreeing a deal to buy 99p Stores, but ended it with concerns over the quality of what it actually bought and whether its glory days of sales growth are over. Shares in Poundland have fallen by more than a third this year, mainly thanks to a profits warning in November linked to the costs of integrating 99p Stores and volatile trading. The company, however, has an experienced management team in a growing market. It has plans to open hundreds of new stores and is well-placed to take advantage of changing shopping habits. Sarah Butler That great high street survivor Dixons Carphone consistently outperformed expectations in 2015, when many other retailers were enduring tough times. The PC World and Currys owner has taken on the online purists Amazon and AO.com, making a virtue out of its stores where shoppers can easily pick up the goods they\u2019ve already chosen online. In 2015, the group was helped by cost savings from the merger of the head office operations of its two parents - Dixons Group and Carphone Warehouse \u2013 and the demise of its competitor Phones4u. Next year could be helped by Euro 2016 and the Olympics, which are likely to boost TV sales. The combination of PC World, Currys and Carphone into single stores will also enable it to sell off spare stores and improve the look of the remaining ones to give them broader appeal. The group\u2019s experimental tie-up with the US telecoms firm Sprint is another avenue of growth. It could eventually lead to the opening of 500 US stores. An update is expected in January and the company\u2019s chief executive, Seb James, seemed optimistic about the venture earlier this month. At just over 17 times expected 2016 earnings, the shares at 500p are not super-cheap, but they do offer a 2% yield, which is still better than the interest rate on a high street bank account. Jill Treanor The year ended with a report that ITV could receive a bid from Comcast. The US company, which owns the NBC network, denied the idea, but it helped illustrate the potential for an offer for the UK broadcaster, which Adam Crozier has run since 2010. The share price was around 58p when he was named as the new chief executive, but has risen to 276.6p. Analysts cite the move away from reliance on advertising revenue, which slumped following the 2008 banking crisis, and the expansion of ITV studios, its production arm. \u201cThe ITV business has been transformed over the last five years and it has become increasingly attractive as a takeover target. Mr Crozier has insisted that it has a very strong future as an independent broadcaster and producer. However, as its studio business in the US continues to grow, it seems that a bid from a significant US media player is getting more and more likely,\u201d according to analysts at the stockbroker Charles Stanley. With the prospect of a special dividend on top, that could make it one to watch. Julia Kollewe 2016 will be a crucial year for Britain\u2019s two pharmaceutical giants, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca. Both are on a quest to return to growth, which GSK expects to achieve in 2016, and Astra a year later. But a good chunk of GSK\u2019s earnings growth will come from cost savings. Since fending off Pfizer\u2019s takeover bid in spring 2014, Astra boss Pascal Soriot has been under huge pressure to deliver \u2013 especially as its blockbuster cholesterol pill Crestor is coming off patent. The latest flurry of deals, notably the acquisition of Takeda\u2019s respiratory portfolio and the blood cancer drug firm Acerta, suggest Astra is on the right track. It\u2019s worth another punt at \u00a346.16 given the longer term outlook.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll have a story online shortly covering today\u2019s stock market news. But that\u2019s all from me this year. Thanks for reading and commenting - it\u2019s been an eventful 2015, particularly during the Greek debt crisis: Best wishes for 2016. See you soon.... GW Betting firm Ladbrokes has issued its odds for 2016 - it expects UK interest rates to stay at 0.5%, house prices to keep rising, and the eurozone to stay intact. Here\u2019s the highlights: Bank of England interest rates to rise in 2016: Yes 1/1 No 8/11 Brent Crude to hit $X/barrel in 2016: $20 5/1 $100 5/1 ONS UK House Price Index (Year to December 2016): 5.0% or more 1/3 7.5% or more Evs 10.0% 5/1 ONS UK mix-adjusted average house price in England: \u00a3325,000+ Evs \u00a3350,000+ 10/1 FTSE 100 2016: Fall below 5000 25/1 Rise above 7000 6/4 Rise above 8000 50/1 Any country to cease using the Euro in 2016: 10/1 Any FTSE 100 investors feeling grumpy about this year\u2019s performance should spare a thought for their counterparts in Athens. The Greek stock market lost an eye-watering 25% of its value this year, hit by the long drawn-out bailout negotiations. Bank shares were pretty much wiped out: Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange firm World First, says China\u2019s economy will drive world markets next year. He also warns that Britain\u2019s upcoming vote on whether to stay in the European Union could hurt sterling: \u201cAs we move into 2016 it will be the ability of the Chinese authorities to stabilise economic growth that will shape the global outlook. China at the moment is feeling the blowback of years of investment driven growth with industries chock full of unproductive factories, a housing sector with a significant stock overhang and ensuing high debt levels in local government and corporate balance sheets.\u201d \u201cRisks of another global downturn will continue to favour the US dollar as the true currency of safe haven flows. There are reasons to be optimistic in 2016 around global growth but risks from China, Eurozone and Latin America balance will still exist.\u201d \u201cThe build up to a UK referendum on EU membership will be a major source of instability on the British pound and the prospect of a possible \u2018Brexit\u2019 makes pricing the risk of the referendum a thankless task at the moment.\u201d As predicted, shares on Wall Street are dropping in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 index has lost 0.3%, putting it back in the red for the year. And the Dow Jones industrial average is down 100 points, or 0.6%. That means the Dow is 2% down this year. Despite finishing the year in the red, the FTSE 100 did hit some new highs in 2015. The Press Association has the details: February 24 saw the London market break a record that had stood for more than 15 years as the FTSE 100 hit a new all-time high, boosted by investor optimism about the financial crisis in Greece. Britain\u2019s benchmark index of leading shares closed at 6958.89, which meant the FTSE 100 finally surpassed its previous intraday peak of 6950.6 set on December 30 1999, just before the dotcom bubble burst. The index reached a series of all-time highs before hitting its peak of 7104 on April 27, boasting a total market value of 2 trillion. But all this was to change in the summer as China\u2019s economic woes began to unfold. Global markets were spooked as China posted slowing gross domestic product figures of around 7% after almost a decade of double-digit growth. Joshua Mahoney of IG suggests that the London stock market will be driven by speculation over UK interest rate rises next year: 2015 has seen the FTSE moving in an inverse manner with inflation, with falling inflation in early 2015 treated with glee by investors, yet as disinflation fears were allayed in H2, we have seen the FTSE pull back in anticipation of a more hawkish BoE stance. Given that disinflation fears have been driven largely by the fall in oil prices, there is reason to believe that 2016 will also see sentiment largely driven by the movement of oil prices, their impact upon inflation expectations and the subsequent monetary policy stance from the BoE. Analysts at RBS point out that the FTSE has now recorded two annual declines in a row: London\u2019t main stock index was one of the few major benchmarks to lose ground this year (although America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average could follow it). Here\u2019s how things finished. FTSE 100: -4.9% during 2015 German DAX: + 9.85% French CAC: +8.5% US Dow: -1.2% (before today\u2019s trading session) Japan\u2019s Nikkei: +9% China\u2019s Shanghai Composite: +9.5% The US stock market is expected to follow London\u2019s lead, when it opens in an hour\u2019s time: London\u2019s stock market has closed for 2015, after a less than stellar performance. The FTSE 100 lost 31 points today, or 0.5%, to finish at 6,242. That means the blue-chip index has lost almost 5% of its value since the start of this year. More dramatically, the FTSE 100 has lost 12% of its value since hitting its record high in April. Could there be a rally next year? Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaker William Hill, reckons the FTSE 100 will end 2016 close to its current level. Spokesman Rupert Adams says: \u201cWe don\u2019t see a vast amount of movement in the FTSE 100 this year.\u201d It\u2019s offering odds of 6/4 that the index ends 2016 between 6000 and 6499 points. It is 5/2 to be below 6000, and 7/2 to be over 7000. The oil price is dipping into the red, knocking almost 1% off the price of a barrel of US crude. That won\u2019t help the ruble very much. We\u2019ve pulled together a map showing where today\u2019s oil rig evacuations took place: Sky News\u2019s map shows a few other oil fields too: Reuters data whizz Vincent Flasseur has pulled together some handy charts, showing the scale of the rout in commodity prices this year: News from the North Sea: The barge that was threatening to hit BP\u2019s oil platform in Valhall has missed the installation. It\u2019s not clear how soon BP staff will be returned to the site after being evacuated this morning, or whether other platforms are still at risk, though. Back in London, the stock market is shuffling its way towards the new year. With just over an hour to go until the early finish, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is down 0.3% or 18 points at 6,256. France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.2%, while the German exchange is closed. Unless something remarkable happens soon, the Footsie will post a loss of nearly 5% this year - after hitting a record high of 7,103 in April. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says global indices are staging a \u201climp, whimpering finish\u201d to 2015. After a year that began so promisingly the markets are wrapping up 2015 in the limpest way possible, a collective sigh instead of any attempt at New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks. The stormy weather in the North Sea has claimed one life already this week. A rig operated by energy company Statoil was hit by a \u201cheavy wave\u201d yesterday, killing one worker and injuring two more. Oil giant BP is scrambling to evacuate staff from a platform in the North Sea, because a barge is drifting in the area. Workers at its plant at the Valhall operation are heading for land, after the unmanned vessel broke from its moorings in rough seas. A spokesman told Reuters that: \u201cThe barge has changed direction and BP has decided to shut production [at Valhall] and there will be a total de-manning of the platform. There are 71 people left on the platform and they are being evacuated as we speak.\u201d More here: And BP isn\u2019t the only producer taking precautions. Norwegian TV are reporting that Conocophillips is evacuating staff from a platform at the Eldfisk field (adjacent to Valhall). Tomorrow could be another red-letter day for Puerto Rico, and those investors who have loaned money to the US territory. Puerto Rico is expected to default on $37m of debt obligations, as its ongoing financial crisis worsens. It has already defaulted once, in August, sparking suggestions that Puerto Rico is America\u2019s Greece. Puerto Rico\u2019s national debt now totals $73bn, which the government says is unsustainable. But as it cannot legally declare bankruptcy, it is forced to cut vital services, plead for relief from creditors, and default on payments in an ad hoc manner. The slump in the rouble will hurt Russian families by pushing up the cost of imported goods, and make an overseas trip even pricier. Our Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker explains how the currency could fall further in 2016: Some analysts say the rouble is still overvalued, and the current oil price should theoretically push the rouble down further. This is necessary to balance the budget: the fewer dollars Russia receives for the oil it sells, the higher the exchange rate needs to be for the budget to receive the requisite amount of roubles. For the budget to balance at 65 roubles, not far off the current rate, the price of oil should be $70, a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report found. For ordinary Russians, it could be a tough year ahead. Those who were used to travelling abroad have already had to scale back as the rouble made the cost of visiting foreign cities prohibitive; and rising food prices have made it harder to balance the books for many families. The 2016 budget, fixed in October, requires oil to be at $50 in order to run a 3% deficit within \u201cacceptable\u201d rouble rate limits, meaning if the price does not rise soon, cuts will need to be made or reserves spent. The war in Syria is an extra cost, and the announced increases in military spending are not likely to be reversed. More here: An underwhelming start to trading in London has send the FTSE 100 down by 17 points, or 0.3%, to 6257. Augustin Eden of Accendo Markets says: A continued slide in the oil price and a US Dollar that\u2019s not going down without a fight are dominating sentiment as people begin to attempt their 2016 forecasts, seeing headwinds for long term earnings. Sports Direct\u2019s New Year pay pledge is worth around 15p per hour to around 15,000 workers at its stores (many on zero hours contracts) and some 4,000 agency staff at its depot. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says it could improve the company\u2019s public image, at a price.... Mike Ashley\u2019s New Year resolution to be a better employer will go some way to improve Sports Direct\u2019s battered PR image, but it will knock c\u00a310m off the profit base\u2026 Sports Direct\u2019s pledge to raise staff wages isn\u2019t enough, say campaigners: Alex Flynn, head of media and campaigns at the Unite union, told the Guardian he was \u201cmassively underwhelmed\u201d by the news from Sports Direct. \u201cMike Ashley, if he\u2019s serious about Sports Direct being one of the best retailers in terms of how it treats its staff on the high street, it\u2019s got a massive way to go.\u201d Three weeks ago, the Guardian exposed work practices at Sports Direct\u2019s warehouses - including that staff are effectively being paid under the minimum wage due to lengthy security checks. And now, the retailer has announced a \u00a310m plan to raise wages over the legal minimum. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, CEO Mike Ashley struck a remarkable tone, declaring: \u201cI realise this is ambitious and it won\u2019t be easy, but I believe as a FTSE 100 or even 250 company we have a responsibility to set a high moral standard.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit, Mike. Now, what about those staff who are afraid to take a sick day? 2015 really has been a rough year for commodities. Fears over China\u2019s slowing economy, and the knock-on effect on emerging markets, has sent the prices of metals and energy stocks slumping. For example: Copper has shed around 25% of its value this year, Oil: down 35% Iron ore: down 40% And that has sent the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity Index down by a quarter over the year, to hit its lowest level since 2002. Some investors are calculating that prices may have bottomed out. But there\u2019s also a possibility that prices could keep sliding. Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong\u2019s Wing Fung Financial Group, says there could be more trouble ahead: \u201dSlowing economic growth and structural reforms in China might contribute to decreased demand for commodities.\u201d A quick glance at the oil price shows exactly why the rouble is so weak. Brent crude began 2015 at around $58 per barrel, and climbed up to $68 by April. But it has since slumped to below $37, a loss of around 35%. That\u2019s waaaaay below the break-even point for oil producers (Kuwait needs around $52 per barrel while Saudi needs $96, for example). The Financial Times\u2019s energy editor, Ed Crooks, has stuck his neck out and predicted oil will recover in 2016: Brent crude below $50 per barrel is too low for the industry to make the investments needed to meet growing global demand. Providing the world economy does not skid into recession, this looks like being the year that the oil price heads back to more sustainable levels. Other FT predictions for 2016 include Belgium winning the Euro 2016 football championship, and Angela Merkel being ousted, Thatcher-style by her party.... The Russian rouble could suffer further losses in 2016, unless the oil price bounces back soon. Alexey Korolenko, a money manager at UralSib Asset Management in Moscow, warns: \u201cThe ruble may weaken further.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to expect stronger oil right now. It should rise to $45-$50 per barrel, maybe, by the end of 2016. Reduction of investments should eventually make impact, the question is what the lag will be.\u201d That\u2019s via the Wall Street Journal, who point out that Russia\u2019s manufacturing sector is contracting again (according to data released yesterday). More here: Ruble Caps Third Annual Slump as Oil Seen Stoking Losses in 2016 Over in Moscow, it\u2019s a bracing minus 9 degrees Celsius on the final day of the year. And the Russian rouble is getting an equally chilly reception in the foreign exchange markets, where it has hit fresh lows this morning. One US dollar was worth a mighty 74 roubles early this morning - a record high - as Russia\u2019s currency continues to suffer from the weak oil price. As this chart shows, it has halved in value since autumn 2014: The rouble is being thumped after new figures released yesterday showed a rise in US oil stocks, suggesting the glut in energy reserves is still growing. That\u2019s clearly bad for Russia, given its reliance on oil exports. Matt Weller, senior technical analyst at Forex.com, explains (via Marketwatch). \u201cWe\u2019re getting a big drop in oil attributable to the rise in inventories and that is spilling over into commodity currencies.\u201d Oil\u2019s recent rout could cause Russia a serious headache. It\u2019s 2016 budget is based on a price around $50 per barrel. Crude is currently trading below $37 this morning... Good morning, and welcome to our final business live blog of 2015, covering events across the financial markets, the world economy, business and finance. And what a year it\u2019s been. We\u2019ve not been short of drama - with the Greek debt crisis dominating the first nine months of the year. There\u2019s also been plenty of market turbulence (thank you, China!), the commodities rout, deflation in the eurozone, and the Volkswagen emissions scandal. But it\u2019s not been a vintage year for investors. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, for example, has lost almost 5% since January - partly due to the slump in the mining sector. And European markets are expected to be subdued today, meaning little fun for those traders who struggle into the City. Asian markets have already ended the year on a quiet note, with China\u2019s main indices down almost 1% and Australia losing 0.5%. IG analyst Angus Nicholson says there are concerns that 2016 could start badly: Concerns about traders coming back from holidays in January and aggressively selling off the market may have driven a number of investors to take some of the profits off the table after the good run we have seen over the holiday period. How appropriate that December\u2019s excess could be followed by a nasty hangover.... I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day, looking back over the last 12 months and ahead to 2016....",

This is necessary to balance the budget: the fewer dollars Russia receives for the oil it sells, the higher the exchange rate needs to be for the budget to receive the requisite amount of roubles. For the budget to balance at 65 roubles, not far off the current rate, the price of oil should be $70, a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report found.</p> <p>For ordinary Russians, it could be a tough year ahead.

      "bodyText": "Amazon has started offering loans to customers buying products off its website in a move that could shake up the UK furniture and electricals market. The world\u2019s biggest online retailer is offering a new pay monthly option on orders of more than \u00a3400, which can include multiple items. Amazon Pay Monthly poses a new threat to established high street retailers such as John Lewis and could attract a wave of new customers to the website. The loan can be spread over two, three or four years depending on the size of the purchase, with Amazon charging interest at an advertised rate of 16.9%. Customers do not have to pay a deposit, meaning the first payment is their opening monthly instalment. Only products sold and dispatched by the company are eligible, meaning that products sold on Amazon by third parties are not included. One source close to Amazon said it was a gamechanger for the company. The retailer has signed up Hitachi Capital to run the service. Hitachi also works with John Lewis, which offers interest-free credit on furniture. The UK is thought to be the first country in the world where Amazon has offered instalment loans, though shoppers in the US can buy on credit using an Amazon store card. The pay monthly option is offered to customers under a list of payment methods when they proceed to the checkout page on Amazon\u2019s website. Customers are then invited to apply for a loan, and an online credit check takes place. In a statement, Amazon said: \u201cThe new Amazon Pay Monthly programme provides our customers with further payment options to suit their needs when shopping on our website, and it is easy, convenient and offers competitive rates and flexible terms.\u201d Gerald Grimes, the managing director of Hitachi Capital Consumer Finance, said: \u201cOur new trial with Amazon is all about giving people the fastest and most seamless experience when it comes to point-of-sale credit. \u201cIt means you can go straight from choosing a new dishwasher or fridge to accessing finance options through Hitachi Capital to pay monthly, all while staying on the Amazon website. This means no visible break in the customer journey. \u201cAmazon is famous for its \u20181-Click\u2019 service, allowing you to place an order literally at the click of a button with pre-stored payment details and delivery addresses. This is part of boosting that customer experience and could signal huge changes for the online retail industry.\u201d Amazon Pay Monthly is the latest in a series of customer initiatives the company has launched over the past year. Earlier in 2015 it introduced one-hour delivery in major cities on thousands of items. The Guardian also revealed earlier this week that Amazon is expanding the range of grocery products it sells in 2016, putting more pressure on struggling supermarkets. Christopher North, the company\u2019s UK boss, said it planned rapid development of its groceries service. Amazon Pantry, which launched in November, allows customers to buy from a range of 4,000 grocery and household products. The service means households can quickly stock up on items, with a \u00a32.99 delivery charge for a large box. \u201cWe are really happy with the early numbers,\u201d North said. \u201cIn the new year we are going to be adding a lot more products.\u201d Amazon achieved a record day on Black Friday 2015, generating 7.4m orders, compared with 5.5m last year. It also added millions of users to its Prime membership scheme, and signed up Jeremy Clarkson to a new series that will launch on its video streaming service.",

      "bodyText": "The last serious scandal to squeeze into the news in 2015 doesn\u2019t turn out to be Lynton \u201cdog whistle\u201d Crosby\u2019s knighthood or other recipients of Dodgy Dave\u2019s New Year honours list. No, it\u2019s the decision by Britain\u2019s financial watchdog to drop its investigation into the UK\u2019s banking culture. This retreat from \u201cbanker bashing\u201d, most of it well deserved since the crash of 2007-09, has been visible for a long time. But it has accelerated since the general election in May produced a slender Tory majority for president Cameron and his prime minister, George Osborne. It will come as some relief for the banking business, but not the rest of us. Even Conservative MPs such as Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury select committee, are disappointed by the decision of the Financial Conduct Authority to abandon its overall review in favour of \u201cengaging individually\u201d with major banks. Though the news was not on the FCA website on Thursday morning, only in the Financial Times, we can all see what that probably means. Most regulatory regimes in Britain, in the public and private sector, are susceptible to what economists call producer capture, whereby the regulator ends up, if not in bed with the industry it is targeting, then at least engaged in heavy petting. Remember Dave Hartnett, famous for being Whitehall\u2019s most wined and dined civil servant when he was the head of HMRC, which collects our taxes and sometimes doesn\u2019t? He was what he liked to call non-confrontational in dealing with large tax avoiders \u2013 less so with the rest of us \u2013 and upon his retirement went to work for one or two of them. Unlike his successor, Lin Homer, who seems to have been involved in a series of career train crashes on her way to the top, he didn\u2019t even get a K, as Dame Lin does the women\u2019s equivalent in the New Year honours, and instead was forced to settle for a measly Companionship of the Bath (CB). How bad can you be to endure such humiliation? It is not easy to hold the big boys to account. They are led by aggressive alpha males, occasionally women (Carolyn McCall becomes a dame too, but at least she turned around easyJet), with battalions of overpaid lawyers and accountants. It takes steady nerves to stand up to their bullying, among officials and elected ministers, because the stakes can be high. In this instance, the FCA was supposed to be seeing how well the supposedly chastened banks were doing in reforming their culture. That shift applied to pay and bonuses, promotion decisions among middle managers and the lack of workplace diversity in a pinstripe, sexist world. It was quite separate from tackling successive misjudgments (such as AAA-rated junk bonds) and scandals such as mis-sold consumer products and conspiracies to manipulate foreign exchange and bank rates. In fairness to Osborne (he\u2019s not really prime minister and my hunch is he never will be), he was tougher than Gordon Brown, squeezing more taxes and other impositions on the banks after they crashed the economy. But in last summer\u2019s Mansion House speech, Osborne signalled a new \u201csettlement\u201d with the City, which included the de-facto sacking the FCA\u2019s then chief executive, Martin Wheatley, possibly for being too critical of the banks, as the Guardian reported. Wheatley had been brought in as an outsider from Hong Kong to give the bankers a kicking. But the Treasury was thought to have too much influence \u2013 as it does over so much \u2013 which may be why he\u2019s not yet been replaced. Who would want a job they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do properly? There are real difficulties getting the banks \u2013 retail and the investment/gambling sides of the business \u2013 to work more fairly and effectively for the wider society. The higher the level of reserves they are required to hold, the less they have to lend. The vast fines imposed for misconduct \u2013 even the FCA levied \u00a31.5bn in 2014 (paywall) \u2013 adds to their burdens, though far too many have been levied on banks whose shareholders foot the bills, not on venal or incompetent individuals. Back in 2013, the parliamentary commission on banking standards proposed that senior executives should be held responsible for misconduct by their staff, even if they had no direct knowledge of what they were up to. This was not long after bank chiefs assured ministers they would never again sign off on schemes they did not understand. Thanks to robust industry lobbying, the government is also backing away from that proposal. In November, the FCA hit Barclays for \u00a372m (paywall) over a dubious and secretive banking manoeuvre on behalf of a rich Middle Eastern client. But overall, the level of fines fell below \u00a31bn in 2015, the first such decline since 2011, when the crisis was still in full flow and skeletons were falling out of the banks\u2019 cupboards. Those cupboards have still not been properly spring cleaned, such as at HBOS. Here\u2019s what the Guardian\u2019s Nils Pratley wrote only a few weeks ago. Yes, the industry has acquired its own Banking Standards Board, chaired by Dame Colette Bowe, another great Whitehall survivor \u2013 the Westland scandal in her case \u2013 who acknowledges that banks have lost public confidence. It recently issued its first annual report on bank culture. But as with most such internal regulation, the public is entitled to assume that a regulator with no power to punish will not put the fear of God into many people. What\u2019s more, retreat is an admission of weakness, a reminder to the big banks that they really may still be too big a part of the UK economy to be properly held to account, that threats to move elsewhere \u2013 such as Hong Kong or Singapore \u2013 are real, and that ministers\u2019 bluff can be called. Alas, there is some truth in our painful over-dependency. But it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, so let\u2019s end on a positive note. News of the FCA\u2019s retreat emerged on a quiet day, probably a calculated leak to bury bad news. But this is a matter for parliament, which is also in the business of holding governments to account. Let\u2019s see how Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team, Tim Farron\u2019s Liberal Democrats and the assorted nationalists do on this one. My hunch is that the cross-party Treasury select committee, chaired by the tough Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, is the best bet for causing a row. But here\u2019s hoping.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct's Mike Ashley promises \u00a310m to pay staff above minimum wage", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley has pledged to spend \u00a310m on raising the pay of the retailer\u2019s staff above the minimum wage. Sports Direct said the increase will affect all directly employed and \u201cdirectly engaged casual workers\u201d and will take effect from 1 January. It will cost \u00a310m a year, including \u201crelated costs and knock-on costs\u201d, the company told the stock market in a statement. The move follows a Guardian investigation that revealed how the company effectively pays thousands of temporary workers at its warehouse below the below the national minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour. Staff are required to go through searches at the end of each shift for which their time is unpaid, but also suffer deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late. The revelations prompted criticism from trade unions and MPs over the retail chain\u2019s pay and employment practices, including the use of zero-hours contracts, under which staff do not know how many hours they will work from one week to the next. Announcing the \u00a310m investment in a newspaper interview, Ashley said he wanted to make Sports Direct \u201cthe best high street retail employer after John Lewis\u201d. The tycoon told the Daily Mirror: \u201cI realise this is ambitious and it won\u2019t be easy, but I believe that as a FTSE 100 or even 250 company, we have a responsibility to set a high moral standard.\u201d Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, dismissed the announcement as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d. It said Sports Direct would increase the pay of 18 to 20-year-olds to \u00a35.45 per hour and for workers over 21, the rate will rise to \u00a36.85 an hour. However, from April, Sports Direct will be forced to pay workers over 25 the new national living wage, introduced by George Osborne, of \u00a37.20 an hour. Unite called for the company to commit to paying the living wage \u2013 a voluntary measure separate from the national living wage and set at \u00a38.25 outside London \u2013 and put all staff on permanent contracts instead of zero-hours agreements. Luke Primarolo, the Unite regional officer, said: \u201cThis pitiful promise by Sports Direct to pay just over the minimum wage should not distract from the Victorian work practices at the retailer\u2019s massive Shirebrook depot. Nor should it deter HMRC from investigating the possible non-payment of the minimum wage to the thousands of agency staff who eke out a living on the site. \u201cFundamental problems remain at Sports Direct, ranging from the exploitative use of zero-hours contracts in its stores through to \u2018gulag\u2019 working conditions at its main warehouse in Shirebrook. \u201cIf Mike Ashley is to fulfill his promise of making Sports Direct a model employer then he needs to commit Sports Direct to becoming a living wage employer and stamp out abusive work practices by putting all staff on permanent contracts. Otherwise, he risks accusations of engaging in yet another PR stunt and a continued loss of confidence among customers and investors alike.\u201d Sports Direct has already said Ashley will lead a review into the terms and conditions of the company\u2019s agency workers. Unite said Ashley needed to engage with the union \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d over the review. There are about 4,300 agency workers employed in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse and an estimated 15,000 zero-hours staff in its stores. The company employs about 28,000 people across the UK and Europe. Shares in the company rose slightly after the announcement of the pay rise, increasing by 0.5% to 572.50p. More than \u00a3400m was wiped off the company\u2019s value after investors turned on the company following disappointing financial results and the Guardian revelations.",

It will cost \u00a310m a year, including \u201crelated costs and knock-on costs\u201d, the company told the stock market in a statement.</p> <p>The move follows a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">Guardian investigation</a> that revealed how the company effectively pays thousands of temporary workers at its warehouse below the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">below the national minimum wage</a> of \u00a36.70 an hour. Staff are required to go through searches at the end of each shift for which their time is unpaid, but also suffer deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">Revealed: how Sports Direct effectively pays below minimum wage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The revelations prompted <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/sports-direct-crisis-grows-as-mps-and-investors-question-business\">criticism from trade unions and MPs</a> over the retail chain\u2019s pay and employment practices, including the use of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/sports-direct-chief-defends-zero-hours-contracts\">zero-hours contracts</a>, under which staff do not know how many hours they will work from one week to the next.</p> <p>Announcing the \u00a310m investment in a newspaper interview, Ashley said he wanted to make Sports Direct \u201cthe best high street retail employer after John Lewis\u201d.</p> <p>The tycoon <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mike-ashley-vows-pay-sports-7095975\">told the Daily Mirror</a>: \u201cI realise this is ambitious and it won\u2019t be easy, but I believe that as a FTSE 100 or even 250 company, we have a responsibility to set a high moral standard.\u201d</p> <p>Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, dismissed the announcement as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It said Sports Direct would increase the pay of 18 to 20-year-olds to \u00a35.45 per hour and for workers over 21, the rate will rise to \u00a36.85 an hour. However, from April, Sports Direct will be forced to pay workers over 25 the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/18/national-living-wage-push-up-wages-more-half-employers-survey\">new national living wage</a>, introduced by George Osborne, of \u00a37.20 an hour.</p> <p>Unite called for the company to commit to paying the living wage \u2013 a voluntary measure separate from the national living wage and set at \u00a38.25 outside London \u2013 and put all staff on permanent contracts instead of zero-hours agreements.</p> <p>Luke Primarolo, the Unite regional officer, said: <strong>\u201c</strong>This pitiful promise by Sports Direct to pay just over the minimum wage should not distract from the Victorian work practices at the retailer\u2019s massive Shirebrook depot. Nor should it deter HMRC from investigating the possible non-payment of the minimum wage to the thousands of agency staff who eke out a living on the site.</p> <p>\u201cFundamental problems remain at Sports Direct, ranging from the exploitative use of zero-hours contracts in its stores through to \u2018gulag\u2019 working conditions at its main warehouse in Shirebrook. </p> <p>\u201cIf Mike Ashley is to fulfill his promise of making Sports Direct a model employer then he needs to commit Sports Direct to becoming a living wage employer and stamp out abusive work practices by putting all staff on permanent contracts. Otherwise, he risks accusations of engaging in yet another PR stunt and a continued loss of confidence among customers and investors alike.\u201d</p> <p>Sports Direct has already said Ashley will lead a review into the terms and conditions of the company\u2019s agency workers. Unite said Ashley needed to engage with the union \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d over the review.</p> <p>There are about 4,300 agency workers employed in Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse and an estimated 15,000 zero-hours staff in its stores. The company employs about 28,000 people across the UK and Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/sports-direct-warehouse-work-conditions\">A day at 'the gulag': what it's like to work at Sports Direct's warehouse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shares in the company rose slightly after the announcement of the pay rise, increasing by 0.5% to 572.50p.</p> <p>More than \u00a3400m was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">wiped off the company\u2019s value</a> after investors turned on the company following disappointing financial results and the Guardian revelations.</p>",
