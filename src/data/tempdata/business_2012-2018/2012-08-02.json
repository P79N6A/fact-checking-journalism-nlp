      "bodyText": "Would fully nationalising Royal Bank of Scotland actually improve the supply of credit to UK businesses? That's the question advocates of nationalisation within government \u2013 which appears to be a faction led by business secretary Vince Cable \u2013 would have to answer if the idea gains momentum. There are reasons to be sceptical. Full nationalisation would clearly solve the perceived problem that government has \"ownership without control\" of RBS. The current arm's-length arrangements at RBS could be ripped up and the government would be free to \"carve out of it a British business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly to sound business\", as Cable put it in a leaked letter to David Cameron in March. If that were to become the plan, though, the government would have to declare one of three things. It could say RBS's current management had failed to spot viable opportunities to lend to good businesses and new managers, which the government would have to provide, would do a better job. Or it could say lending criteria would be relaxed to allow more marginal business propositions to receive a green light. Or, in a similar vein, it could announce that RBS in future will be happy to offer cheaper loans and thus accept a lower return on capital because it will no longer be run on purely commercial principles. There are obvious problems with all three potential declarations. First, where is the alternative crew of government-sponsored senior loan officers? It was only a week ago that Mark Hoban, the Treasury minister, was applauding RBS's rapid use of the Funding For Lending scheme and hailing this \"new deal for business\". Second, is it really sensible for lending criteria to be set by government? Clearly, the UK would hope to avoid the Spanish experience, where local politicians advanced pet projects with disastrous consequences. But central and local government would inevitably be drawn into justifying every decision. Micro-management is not meant to be the Treasury's role, or its skill. The third point \u2013 about RBS accepting a return on capital \u2013 raises the most difficulties. Other big banks might protest that they can't compete in a market where the biggest player is a state-directed lender that is willing to accept returns they regard as uneconomic. So, while RBS's stock of loans could be made to go up, Barclays, HSBC et al might retreat to the wings. The net effect could be a fall, rather than a rise, in the overall supply of credit. And that's assuming EU competition authorities would not demand tough remedies to address the state-aid complication. None of which is to deny there is a problem with business lending. It's just that improving the demand for credit, rather than rejigging the supply, looks the easier problem for the Treasury to address. On that score, business leaders increasingly complain about the lack of dynamism in government. Where are the big, confidence-boosting infrastructure projects that government could fund by taking advantage of the once-in-a-century opportunity to borrow at 1.5% for a decade? They do not require full nationalisation of RBS and the ejection of its management \u2013 they just need the Treasury to take the leap rather than fiddle with pasty taxes.",

    "webTitle": "ECB's eurozone crisis remedy runs into German resistance", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi outlined plans on Thursdayfor the European Central Bank and the eurozone's two bailout funds to go on a bond-buying spree to cut the rocketing costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy, but ran into stiff German resistance to his campaign \"to do anything\" to save the euro. In the most keenly awaited performance of his eight months as head of the Frankfurt-based ECB, Draghi reiterated last week's dramatic statements in London that there was no going back on the single currency. \"It's pointless to bet against the euro. It's pointless to go short on the euro,\" he said. \"It stays. It stays.\" But with financial markets straining to decode the specifics of the Draghi policy amid high expectations he would unveil a \"big bazooka\" or \"unlimited firepower\" to defend the euro, the ECB president appeared to play for time, announcing that the \"modalities\" of the new approach would be studied over the coming weeks. He made it plain that the 23-strong ECB governing council took no decision on wading into the bond markets on Thursday, but simply issued guidelines that might result in such action by next month. \"The governing council, within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective,\" said Draghi. The ambiguity allowed him to keep his options open on whether or not to revive a dormant ECB policy of intervention in the secondary markets to buy up government bonds. The immediate response in the markets was one of disappointment with the euro falling 0.3% against the dollar, Spain's borrowing costs soaring to 7.18% from 6.724% hours earlier, and Wall Street's leading Dow Jones industrial average down 150 points, or 1.1%. European stock markets closed down between 0.8% in London and 5.5% in Madrid. As the central bankers and eurozone political leaders headed for their summer villas and country estates, hoping to put off further deliberations until September, it looked like another hot August was looming for the eurozone. Although the ECB took no formal decisions, Draghi made clear that Germany, in the form of the mighty Bundesbank, dissented from even the prospect of any ECB bond-buying. It was the only one of the 23 parties in the governing council to do so. That signalled both how isolated Germany finds itself, but also the problem that Draghi faces if he is determined to push through a more muscular, interventionist campaign by the ECB. In a sign that he intends to fight for bond-buying, though, Draghi said he would address the concerns of private sector bond-holders about \"seniority\", meaning he could re-negotiate the ECB's privileges in escaping losses on debt holdings while private investors suffer in the event of debt restructuring. He demanded that the 17 governments of the eurozone, through their two bailout funds, the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism (still to come into operation), start buying the bonds of struggling countries before the ECB would. \"Governments must stand ready to activate the ESM/EFSF in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist,\" he said. This was a necessary if not sufficient condition for the ECB to then act in the markets. But the bond-buying could only take place if hard-pressed countries first requested help and then were subjected to the kind of intrusive outside scrutiny and tough austerity terms that have accompanied previous bailouts. Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, has been touring the eurozone this week demanding that the currency bloc act to cut his borrowing costs, but is deeply reluctant to request a bailout. Draghi said there could be no such help for Italy unless it asked for aid and accepted the conditions that would go with a bailout. Spain and Italy are the two key candidates for the bond market interventions suggested by Draghi. Monti was in Madrid to see his Spanish counterpart, Mariano Rajoy. Both prime ministers declined to say whether they would ask for eurozone bailout funds, while arguing that Draghi's remarks represented progress in the fight to prevent a euro meltdown. Behind Draghi's campaign to shift towards more persuasive and interventionist action to end the euro crisis, politicial infighting is intensifying. He notched up a points victory by putting the language about ECB and eurozone bond-buying on the formal agenda. But that remains an intention rather than a decision and the policy arguments pitting France, Italy, and Spain against Germany have yet to be resolved. \"It's clear and it's known that the Bundesbank have their reservations about the programme of buying bonds,\" Draghi admitted. \"We now have the guidance, the [ECB] committees will work on this guidance and then [we] will take a final decision and the votes will be counted.\" Draghi quashed growing speculation that one way of settling the crisis and demonstrating resolve to the markets was to give the main eurozone bailout fund a banking licence, meaning that its \u20ac500bn resources could be expanded hugely since it would be able to buy government bonds, deposit them as collateral with the ECB and draw on an unlimited supply of liquidity from the central bank to return to the bond markets. Draghi stressed that, under the rules, the bailout fund did not qualify as an ECB counter-party for refinancing, but that block only applied \"currently\", indirectly suggesting that this could be changed.",

      "body": "<p>Mario Draghi outlined plans on Thursdayfor the European Central Bank and the eurozone's two bailout funds to go on a bond-buying spree to cut the rocketing costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy, but ran into stiff German resistance to his campaign \"to do anything\" to save the euro.</p> <p>In the most keenly awaited performance of his eight months as head of the Frankfurt-based ECB, Draghi reiterated last week's dramatic statements in London that there was no going back on the single currency.</p> <p>\"It's pointless to bet against the euro. It's pointless to go short on the euro,\" he said. \"It stays. It stays.\"</p> <p>But with financial markets straining to decode the specifics of the Draghi policy amid high expectations he would unveil a \"big bazooka\" or \"unlimited firepower\" to defend the euro, the ECB president appeared to play for time, announcing that the \"modalities\" of the new approach would be studied over the coming weeks.</p> <p>He made it plain that the 23-strong ECB governing council took no decision on wading into the bond markets on Thursday, but simply issued guidelines that might result in such action by next month.</p> <p>\"The governing council, within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective,\" said Draghi.</p> <p>The ambiguity allowed him to keep his options open on whether or not to revive a dormant ECB policy of intervention in the secondary markets to buy up government bonds.</p> <p>The immediate response in the markets was one of disappointment with the euro falling 0.3% against the dollar, Spain's borrowing costs soaring to 7.18% from 6.724% hours earlier, and Wall Street's leading Dow Jones industrial average down 150 points, or 1.1%. European stock markets closed down between 0.8% in London and 5.5% in Madrid.</p> <p>As the central bankers and eurozone political leaders headed for their summer villas and country estates, hoping to put off further deliberations until September, it looked like another hot August was looming for the eurozone.</p> <p>Although the ECB took no formal decisions, Draghi made clear that Germany, in the form of the mighty Bundesbank, dissented from even the prospect of any ECB bond-buying. It was the only one of the 23 parties in the governing council to do so.</p> <p>That signalled both how isolated Germany finds itself, but also the problem that Draghi faces if he is determined to push through a more muscular, interventionist campaign by the ECB.</p> <p>In a sign that he intends to fight for bond-buying, though, Draghi said he would address the concerns of private sector bond-holders about \"seniority\", meaning he could re-negotiate the ECB's privileges in escaping losses on debt holdings while private investors suffer in the event of debt restructuring.</p> <p>He demanded that the 17 governments of the eurozone, through their two bailout funds, the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism (still to come into operation), start buying the bonds of struggling countries before the ECB would.</p> <p>\"Governments must stand ready to activate the ESM/EFSF in the bond market when exceptional financial market circumstances and risks to financial stability exist,\" he said. This was a necessary if not sufficient condition for the ECB to then act in the markets.</p> <p>But the bond-buying could only take place if hard-pressed countries first requested help and then were subjected to the kind of intrusive outside scrutiny and tough austerity terms that have accompanied previous bailouts.</p> <p>Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister, has been touring the eurozone this week demanding that the currency bloc act to cut his borrowing costs, but is deeply reluctant to request a bailout.</p> <p>Draghi said there could be no such help for Italy unless it asked for aid and accepted the conditions that would go with a bailout.</p> <p>Spain and Italy are the two key candidates for the bond market interventions suggested by Draghi. Monti was in Madrid to see his Spanish counterpart, Mariano Rajoy. Both prime ministers declined to say whether they would ask for eurozone bailout funds, while arguing that Draghi's remarks represented progress in the fight to prevent a euro meltdown.</p> <p>Behind Draghi's campaign to shift towards more persuasive and interventionist action to end the euro crisis, politicial infighting is intensifying. He notched up a points victory by putting the language about ECB and eurozone bond-buying on the formal agenda. But that remains an intention rather than a decision and the policy arguments pitting France, Italy, and Spain against Germany have yet to be resolved.</p> <p>\"It's clear and it's known that the Bundesbank have their reservations about the programme of buying bonds,\" Draghi admitted. \"We now have the guidance, the [ECB] committees will work on this guidance and then [we] will take a final decision and the votes will be counted.\"</p> <p>Draghi quashed growing speculation that one way of settling the crisis and demonstrating resolve to the markets was to give the main eurozone bailout fund a banking licence, meaning that its \u20ac500bn resources could be expanded hugely since it would be able to buy government bonds, deposit them as collateral with the ECB and draw on an unlimited supply of liquidity from the central bank to return to the bond markets.</p> <p>Draghi stressed that, under the rules, the bailout fund did not qualify as an ECB counter-party for refinancing, but that block only applied \"currently\", indirectly suggesting that this could be changed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BAE Systems has posted a double-digit fall in revenues as ongoing troubles in its main US and UK markets damaged sales of defence equipment, but the group singled out Asia and the Middle East as potential targets for exporters battered by western spending cuts. Britain's largest manufacturing employer said first-half sales fell 10% to \u00a38.3bn, while pre-tax profits slipped 5% to \u00a3655m, as reductions in defence budgets on both sides of the Atlantic took their toll. BAE's figures for the six months to 30 June came the day after official data showed that the wider UK manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest rate in more than three years last month. However, the defence group's travails have been well trailed following military pullbacks from Iraq and Afghanistan that affected demand, Pentagon cuts and a strategic defence review in the UK that will see the \u00a337bn defence budget reduced by 8% by 2014. BAE makes nuclear submarines, aircraft carriers and the Eurofighter Typhoon in the UK, while the Bradley armoured vehicle is among its biggest US products. As well as making some of the most complex products in British industry, BAE generates half its turnover from service and maintenance contracts. The US accounts for 40% of BAE revenues, with a further 30% accounted for by the UK, where BAE employs about 35,000 people and has 7,500 UK companies in its supply chain. Ian King, BAE's chief executive, said the company can perform strongly outside its key markets, pointing to BAE booking orders from outside its two main markets worth \u00a34.3bn in the first half, against \u00a34.8bn worth for the whole of last year,. \"We are pretty vibrant about it,\" said King, pointing to interest in the Typhoon from Malaysia and Oman, as well as a potential deal with India for Hawk training jets. \"We achieved order intake in non-UK and non-US territories of \u00a34.3bn, so we are starting to see that [sales] cycle coming through from all the effort we have put in,\" he said. While Asia and the Middle East hold considerable promise for British manufacturers, particularly in aerospace given their expanding airline industries, only one country from those continents was among the UK's top ten export destinations last year \u2013 China. However, the top 20 includes India, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Japan and Turkey. King added that he was \"encouraged\" by government support for manufacturing, despite Wednesday's Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) reading, which came in at 45.4 for July and far below the 50 mark that signifies economic contraction. \"We are encouraged that this government is starting to understand the strength of UK manufacturing,\" he said, adding that the coalition had given stronger support than its predecessor. David Cameron's attendance at the Farnborough Air Show last month underlined the political commitment to UK manufacturing, he said. \"There has been a sea change since this government come in to power and they are starting to recognise that defence is such an important part of the manufacturing business. The litmus test was the support at the Farnborough Air Show of the prime minister himself. So I think they do get it.\" However, he admitted that announcements such as \u00a360m in support for a centre of excellence for aerodynamics would take time to bear fruit. \"That's always the difficulty of the political environment and the measures you take today. How long does it take to effect the statistics?\"",

The fiscal cliff \"can be avoided and it should be avoided,\" he said. The IMF published its annual checkup of the US economy, known as the Article IV consultation, last month. The latest update comes after it has been assessed by member countries including China and the UK and follows a set of dispiriting reports on jobs growth and manufacturing in the US. On Wednesday the US Federal Reserve said it had noted further weakening in the US and was prepared to act but stopped short of doing so. The move disappointed US investors and led to a selloff in US markets. The IMF's directors said the Fed had room to further ease monetary policy but a number of directors noted \"the effectiveness of additional monetary easing could be limited in the prevailing very low interest rate environment.\" Europe's woes would continue to weigh on the US recovery, said Milesi-Ferretti, slowing exports and strengthening the dollar to levels that make US goods less attractive. Milesi-Ferretti sounded an optimistic note for the medium term and said rising demand for housing would eventually lead to a recovery in the US housing market. The US is now building around 700,000 new homes a year and will need to build 1.5m a year in the near future, he said. But he estimated recovery could take three to five years.",

That said, the context of Mr Draghi's comments suggests the activation of such measures may need to be linked together with a decision by the euro group to use the EFSF and ESM for bond market purchases of debt in southern Europe. Additionally, in the Q&amp;A, Draghi said, \"over the coming weeks we shall devise the appropriate modalities for the policy measures by the relevant committees of the ECB\". In the Q&amp;A, he also said the prospective open market operations \"would be focused on the short term part of the yield curve\" \u2013 which, he said, would be \"very different from the SMP\", but would be carried out within the secondary market.</p> <p>When asked about a banking licence to be given to the ESM, Draghi commented, \"I did say at least twice that the present design of the ESM doesn't allow [....], it is not up to us to decide whether to give the ESM a banking licence; it is up to us to decide whether the ESM can be considered a suitable counterparty; the current design of the ESM does not allow to be defined as a suitable counterparty\" [he also referred to a legal opinion from February on this, which said the ESM was not suitable as a counterparty].</p> <p>He added that the statement endorsed the comments he had made in London [last Thursday] to meet these objectives. The endorsement that it will take whatever it takes to preserve the euro area as a stable currency is unanimous.

He said the various committees would review the various non-standard policy operations. He also noted that there is not one country that had asked the EFSF so far to intervene, signalling that it would take some time.</p> <p>Concerning interest rates, Draghi suggested there would not be a reduction in the deposit rate in the near term. He said possible reductions in interest rates had been discussed, but the governing council had determined this was not the right time. On a negative deposit rate, Draghi said, \"for us, these are largely uncharted waters\" [suggesting to us some reticence concerning implementing a negative rate].</p> <h2>Marc Ostwald, strategist at Monument Securities: </h2> <p><em>Draghi macht schlapp</em> (Draghi flops) would be an appropriate headline in Germany's press.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Draghi has attempted to deploy semantics to cover up for another case of all talk and no trousers or action, above all in promising \"action\" going forward.

In truth, if they have not decided on what they are going to do, then the issue of sterilisation is, in fact, a little bit moot.</p> <p>It is also clear that any ECB measures will be at the very front of yield curves, implying the EFSF/ESM would be the only mechanism for longer-maturity activity, which of course remains highly contingent on the ruling[s] of the German constitutional court in September. Even if the ECB did deploy measures to alleviate front-end pressures in Spain and Italy, which should in theory help to keep the unwinding of curve flattening seen over the past week, it would equally encourage heavier issuance at the front of the Spanish and to a lesser extent Italian curves, thus exacerbating already burgeoning refinancing issues in the next couple of years \u2013 thus quite possibly a pyrrhic victory.</p> <p>Draghi's comments were also peppered with the word \"adequate\" to describe the size of measures that might be deployed.

So, with such a pounding taken due to its digital strategy, why are shares up 2.2p at 156.9p, especially when online is one of the fasting growing areas in betting? The answer is, Ladbrokes put its hands up pretty early on this, admitting its problems and attempting to move on. Nothing was fudged to sound more positive than it was, and investors and analysts were kept updated. The company also did the unthinkable (when you consider how long it took the likes of Bob Diamond et al to stand aside) by sacking Richard Ames, the director responsible for the disaster. Today, analysts were broadly in agreement that Ladbrokes could and should improve.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to set aside more than \u00a3100m to cover the cost of compensating customers who lost out when the bailed-out bank's computer systems crashed in June. The cost of the computer failure comes amid fresh speculation about the future of the ownership of the bank before its results on Friday, which will also be scrutinised for any extra provision for payment protection insurance mis-selling. An extra \u00a3125m was set aside in the first quarter of the year, taking its total PPI mis-selling provision to \u00a31.2bn. The major banks have already set aside more than \u00a38.5bn for the mis-selling of the insurance. Other provisions could be made to compensate any customers who lost out as result of mis-sold interest rate swaps, which were intended to help small businesses protect themselves against interest rate rises. Chief executive Stephen Hester is expected to again apologise to the up to 13 million customers of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank who could not be certain how much money they had in their accounts in the biggest computer problem ever incurred by a UK bank, which was first discovered on 19 June. The provision, which is expected to be included in the bank's second quarter figures, is also expected to cover the overtime costs incurred by parachuting in extra staff for extended opening hours during the week and the weekend opening, at the height of the problem. Ulster Bank's customers were inconvenienced for more a month after the computer problem which the bank has said was caused by a botched systems software upgrade. Some NatWest and RBS customers experienced difficulties for about 10 days. While the bank has about 13 million retail customers, compensation is expected to be handed out to a far smaller number, although even that will run to tens of thousands of customers. Hester has told the Guardian that RBS might have been able to avoid its computer crisis if more had been spent on upgrading existing systems rather than on developing new applications. \"RBS has seen a big mushrooming in spending on technology. With hindsight maybe a bit more of that increase in spend should have been in the core taken-for-granted systems that work every day. Some of our focus was on the new things people want,\" Hester said last week. The other UK-based banks involved in the Libor manipulation scandal are yet to make any provision to cover the cost of potential fines, and Hester has already made clear that the bank is braced for a fine but that he does not yet know the size. RBS is among four banks to have reached an agreement with the Financial Services Authority over interest rate swap mis-selling, but has not yet quantified the cost of any compensation for customers.",

But the next step in the argument \u2013 that the winner of an increasingly ugly contest will have the luxury of pursuing significantly different policies from his opponent \u2013 is much more uncertain.</p> <p>By the time the next presidential term starts in January 2013, and contrary to the current narratives advanced by the Obama and Romney campaigns, the incumbent will find himself with limited room for manoeuver on economic policy. Indeed, the potential differences for America are elsewhere, and have yet to be adequately understood by voters. They center on the social policies that would accompany a broadly similar set of economic measures; and, here, the differences between the candidates are consequential.</p> <p>Whoever wins will face an economy growing at a sluggish 2% or less next year, with a nagging risk of stalling completely.

      "bodyText": "The conventional wisdom about the November presidential election in the United States is only partly correct. Yes, economic issues will play a large role in determining the outcome. But the next step in the argument \u2013 that the winner of an increasingly ugly contest will have the luxury of pursuing significantly different policies from his opponent \u2013 is much more uncertain. By the time the next presidential term starts in January 2013, and contrary to the current narratives advanced by the Obama and Romney campaigns, the incumbent will find himself with limited room for manoeuver on economic policy. Indeed, the potential differences for America are elsewhere, and have yet to be adequately understood by voters. They center on the social policies that would accompany a broadly similar set of economic measures; and, here, the differences between the candidates are consequential. Whoever wins will face an economy growing at a sluggish 2% or less next year, with a nagging risk of stalling completely. Unemployment will still be far too high, and almost half of it will be hard-to-solve, long-term joblessness \u2013 and even more if we count (as we should) the millions of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force. The financial side of the economy will also be a source of concern. The fiscal deficit will continue to flirt with the 10%-of-GDP level, adding to worries about the country's medium-term debt dynamics. The banking sector will still be \"de-risking,\" limiting the flow of credit to small and medium-size companies and undermining hiring and investment in plant and equipment.

The FTSE 100 is up 15 points at 5728 on a busy day for company announcements perhaps in the hope of drawing analysts and investors away from the Olympics. Starting with the Games, there is one outsourcing company that has managed to quietly go about its job without resorting to drafting in the army or being hauled before MPs, unlike G4S (up 0.7p at 251.9p).

Reporting its half-year results this morning, the company said it has expanded well in Latin America but Europe remains troubling. Pretax profits for the first six months of the year were up 23% from \u00a3119m to \u00a3146m, while revenues were up to \u00a3734m from \u00a3637m. However, because of the uncertainty in Europe, the company was propping up the FTSE 100 as the biggest faller, down 64p, 3%, at \u00a320.56.

      "bodyText": "HMV has been teetering on the verge of collapse for years, as it watched rivals on the high street topple one after another. But the company must now stagger on without its chief executive Simon Fox, who has resigned this morning after six years in charge. He will leave on 3rd September to be replaced by former Jessops chief executive Trevor Moore. It makes Moore the second hiring from Jessops in as many months, with former chairman David Adams joining as a non-exec director in May. Usual platitudes were made to and from all concerned. Fox said: \"I am proud to be leaving HMV with a profitable future secured. The appointment of Trevor Moore means I will be leaving the company in safe hands.\" Moore added: \"HMV is a great company and a fantastic brand and I look forward to building on its position as the UK's leading entertainment retailer.\" HMV chairman Philip Rowley said: \"I want to thank Simon for his contribution to HMV. He has led the company through a turbulent period for the entertainment retailing industry and has played an invaluable part in securing HMV's future.\" The company has been squeezed out by online retailers who have consistently undercut high street CD and DVD sellers, while physical CD sales have plummeted since the advent of iTunes. An attempt to expand into the live music scene left the company in unsustainable levels of debt and led to a review this year. It is now starting to sell off its portfolio of venues, shedding the Hammersmith Apollo in June for \u00a332m and a view to sell its remaining 12 venues across the country. The stay of execution was helped this year by the collapse of rivals Game, which helped HMV pick up market share in the lucrative video games market. Shares are flat at 3.4p.",
