      "bodyText": "Despite not winning any major golf tournaments last year, Rory McIlroy still increased his fortune by \u00a328m to \u00a3110m and became Britain\u2019s richest sports star. The 29-year-old Northern Irish golfer overtook Sir Andy Murray and Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale, after signing a string of sponsorship deals including a $100m (\u00a374m) 10-year contract to wear Nike clothing and a $100m agreement to use TaylorMade\u2019s clubs, bags and balls for a decade. Of the top 20 highest earning sportspeople, 15 are footballers. There are no women on the list. McIlroy\u2019s corporate deals came despite a difficult year on the fairway, with him failing to win any major tournaments in 2017. McIlroy, who became the second-youngest player to ever be ranked as the world\u2019s number one golfer in 2012, has since fallen to eighth, and placed fifth at the US Masters last month. McIlroy has three major championships in his sights for the remainder of 2018, but first comes this weekend\u2019s Players Championship, the biggest tournament on the PGA Tour and one at which victory has eluded him. The four-time major winner is selling a mansion in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, for $12.9m (\u00a39.5m). If he achieves the asking price he will have made a $3.4m profit on the $9.5m he paid for it in 2013. The six bed, nine bathroom waterfront home boasts a gym, pool and putting green. McIlroy is moving into the former home of South African golfer Ernie Els a short drive away. McIlroy, who was born in Hollywood, Northern Ireland, married American publicist Erica Stoll in front of celebrity guests including Ed Sheeran, Chris Martin, 50 Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan and One Direction\u2019s Niall Horan at Ashford Castle in County Mayo, Ireland, last year. Murray takes second place in the Sunday Times Rich List ranking of UK-based sports stars with an \u00a383m fortune, up \u00a36m on last year. The Rich List\u2019s authors said Murray\u2019s modest increase in wealth reflects his absence from the courts due to the hip injury he succumbed to at Wimbledon last year. His on-court earnings fell to $2m last year compared to $16.3m in 2016, when he won his second Wimbledon title and was world number one for the first time. Murray is currently ranked 38th in the tennis world, and has lost the British number one spot to 23-year-old Kyle Edmunds. However, the Scot has been raking it in from sponsorship deals with Under Armour, Head, Standard Life and Jaguar. Bale takes third place with \u00a374m (a \u00a320m increase on last year), and Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is fourth with \u00a348m. Boxer Anthony Joshua is the fifth richest with a \u00a335m fortune, but is forecast to rise up the rankings next year. The world heavyweight champion has won 20 of his 21 professional fights by a knockout and his wealth has risen by \u00a320m since 2016. He earned \u00a318m for his title bout with Joseph Parker in Cardiff in March, when he added the World Boxing Organization (WBO) belt to the three he already held. His agent, Barry Hearn, has boasted that Joshua will become the first billionaire boxer. \u201cHis commercial potential outside the ring is huge, way beyond Beckham and the world\u2019s top footballers,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cHe has a much bigger cross-over in terms of potential.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, has been ordered to hand over more than \u00a31.1m out of his own pocket as punishment for attempting to unmask a whistleblower. Staley has been fined a total of \u00a3642,430 by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Barclays has clawed back \u00a3500,000 of his bonus over the matter. The bank will also have to report annually to the regulators detailing how it handles whistleblowing after they expressed concerns about its existing systems. The whistleblowing involved letters sent to the board in 2016 raising concerns about the recruitment of Tim Main as head of the bank\u2019s financial institutions group in New York. Staley tried to hunt down the author of the letters using the bank\u2019s internal security unit. He accused the letter-writer of harassment and trying to \u201cmaliciously smear\u201d Main, a friend and former colleague when Staley was at JP Morgan. The regulators said Staley failed to act with due skill, care and diligence, saying he should have identified that: He had a conflict of interest in relation to the letter and needed to maintain an appropriate distance from the investigation. There was a risk he would not be able to exercise impartial judgment in relation to how Barclays should respond. Once the complaint was in the hands of the compliance team, it was important they kept control of the investigation process. The watchdogs have each fined Staley 10% of his \u00a34.5m total pay package but the total was reduced from \u00a3917,800 after he agreed to settle at an early stage of the investigation. They said the fine was \u201cappropriate and proportionate\u201d, given Staley\u2019s seniority and the impact of his actions. Mark Steward, the FCA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cMr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays\u2019 whistleblowing procedures. Chief executives must act with a high degree of care and prudence at all times. \u201cWhistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the financial services sector. It is critical that individuals are able to speak up anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.\u201d Barclays said the regulators had not found Staley was unfit to continue as chief executive but it took the integrity of its controls seriously and had made \u201ca very significant adjustment\u201d to his 2016 compensation. Staley said: \u201cI have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate and I have apologised for mistakes which I made. I accept the conclusions of the board, the FCA and PRA \u2026 and the sanctions which they have each applied.\u201d Last week Staley survived a bruising annual meeting, with one investor telling the Barclays chairman, John McFarlane: \u201cThe chief executive is irrevocably tarnished. I suggest you consider his continuation. However, McFarlane told the meeting that 95% of shareholders backed Staley staying in his position. He repeated the board\u2019s unanimous support for the chief executive and said: \u201cI\u2019d be quite interested to know how many people in this room have never made a mistake? Jes regrets his mistake. He does not deserve to resign.\u201d It is unusual for financial regulators to investigate and censure chief executives in the City and the FCA and PRA said this was the first case they had brought under the senior managers regime, which came into effect in March 2016. However, the MP Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said she planned to question the FCA about the fine: \u201cAs the FCA\u2019s decision notice states, a chief executive officer should set an example to the firm\u2019s employees. Clearly Mr Staley has failed in this regard. \u201cIn our next evidence session with the FCA, we\u2019ll ask why it believes that the fines are appropriate and what it believes the implications are for the senior managers regime.\u201d Barclays had announced to the stock market in April last year that Staley and the bank were under investigation by the FCA, whose role includes monitoring bankers\u2019 behaviour, and the PRA, which monitors the wider banking system. New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services has also been looking into Staley\u2019s behaviour and on Friday, Barclays said it continued \u201cto provide information to, and co-operate with, authorities in the US with respect to this matter\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main developments: Oil dipped below the three-and-a-half year high of $78, reached on Thursday, as analysts suggested countries such as Kuwait and Iraq could step in to plug a potential fall in exports from Iran. Brent crude is currently down 0.2% at $77.34 a barrel. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, argued governor Mark Carney does not deserve the \u2018unreliable boyfriend\u2019 reputation. Markets might have expected a rate hike in May, but the Bank never promised one, Broadbent insisted. ZPG - owner of the property websites Zoopla and Prime Location, as well as Uswitch - is to be bought for \u00a32.2bn by American private equity firm Silver Lake. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, was fined \u00a3642,430 by UK regulators for a breach of conduct in 2016, when he tried to unmask a whistleblower. In addition, the bank will claw back \u00a3500,000 of his 2016 bonus. In the markets, the pound is up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.3566, and roughly flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1338. European equities are subdued. The FTSE 100 is up 0.1% at 7,710. In the US, the Dow Jones is up 0.3% at 24,821. Apple shares are off 0.2% at $188.87, after hitting a record high on Thursday. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. Over in France, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s first year bodes well for the French economy according to Jessica Hinds, European economist at Capital Economics. One year into President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s term, the French economy is performing well. Annual GDP growth is healthy and the labour market is recovering steadily. But this owes little to Macron\u2019s efforts so far, reflecting instead the impact of previous reforms and the favourable global backdrop. However, the reforms that he has implemented or announced bode well for the future of the French economy. He has made the labour market more flexible and looks likely to follow through on his commitments to boost households\u2019 disposable income and reduce businesses\u2019 costs. Further tough reforms lie ahead but the progress made so far provides cause for optimism. The opening bell has gone on Wall Street: Dow Jones: +0.03% at 24,748 S&amp;P 500: -0.02% at 2,722 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 7,393 Wall Street is expected to edge higher after the opening bell according to traders at spread-betting firm IG: US tech giant is on the verge of a significant milestone, with a market value edging ever closer to the $1 trillion mark. Shares hit a new all-time high of $190.04 on Thursday, and with a market value of $934bn, shares would have to rise a further 7% or so to hit the big one. As Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains, that doesn\u2019t look overly ambitious given the shares\u2019 recent performance: Apple has had a phenomenal week and a half, in which it has gained over 17%, putting it on track for a record breaking winning streak. The rally, which started just prior to Apple reporting quarterly earnings and a $100 billion share buyback has also been propped up by comments from Warren Buffet as his firm Berkshire Hathaway brought up another 75 million shares in Apple. Should Apple continue in the current form, we could soon be looking at the first listed firm to achieve a $1 trillion market cap. Here is our full story on the decision by UK regulators to fine Barclays\u2019 boss Jes Staley \u00a3642,430 over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower: Barclays said that it will claw back \u00a3500,000 of the bonus awarded to Jes Staley for 2016 - the year in which he tried to unmask a whistleblower. John McFarlane, the bank\u2019s chairman, said the board takes Barclay\u2019s culture and integrity \u201cextremely seriously\u201d. The group\u2019s whistleblowing processes are fundamental to ensuring that individuals feel comfortable raising concerns and are encouraged to do so. Accordingly, the board has now confirmed its decision of April 2017 and has made a very significant adjustment to Jes\u2019s variable compensation on the recommendation of the board remuneration committee. He also repeated the board\u2019s support for Staley as chief executive: The board is pleased that the FCA and PRA\u2019s investigations have concluded and are now behind us. The board has reiterated its support for Jes, as have shareholders at last week\u2019s annual general meeting. As a business, we remain focused on executing our strategy and delivering greater returns for shareholders.\u201d Barclays\u2019 boss Jes Staley has responded to the news that he has been fined \u00a3642,430 by regulators for attempting to discover the identity of a whistleblower. He said: I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made. I accept the conclusions of the board, the FCA, and the PRA, following their respective investigations, and the sanctions which they have each applied. Staley has been given two weeks to pay the fine. Barclays boss Jes Staley did not act with \u201cdue skill, care and diligence\u201d when he tried to unmask a whistleblower in 2016, UK regulators declared as they announced the \u00a3642,430 fine. The Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority put out a joint statement to announce the penalty. They said Staley\u2019s fine was reduced by 30% because he agreed to settle at an early stage. Otherwise he would have been fined \u00a3917,800. Mark Steward from the FCA that the chief executive should act in an exemplary way, but Staley failed. Given the crucial role of the chief executive, the standard of due skill, care and diligence is more demanding than for other employees. Mr Staley breached the standard of care required and expected of a chief executive in a way that risked undermining confidence in Barclays\u2019 whistleblowing procedures. Chief executives must act with a high degree of care and prudence at all times. Whistleblowers play a vital role in exposing poor practice and misconduct in the financial services sector. It is critical that individuals are able to speak up anonymously and without fear of retaliation if they want to raise concerns.\u201d Breaking news: UK regulators have fined Barclays chief executive Jes Staley \u00a3642,430 for a breach of conduct after he tried to uncover the identity of a whistleblower. The Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority announced last month that he would be fined but the precise sum had not been decided. The regulators said the joint sum was equivalent to a fine from each authority equivalent to 10% of Staley\u2019s \u201crelevant annual income\u201d. The background to the fine is here: The pound is faring better today after a cautious tone from Bank of England policymakers drove it to a five-month low against the dollar on Thursday. It is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.3549 (after falling as low as $1.3457 yesterday), and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1351. RBS boss McEwan does not know where his cheque book is. Asked by an LBC radio listener why the bank was closing so many bank bank branches, McEwan says people just aren\u2019t using branch services as much these days, including him Cheque usage is down 17% over the last year. I can\u2019t recall [when I last used my cheque bank]. It annoys me to have to write one. I don\u2019t know where to find my cheque book. It\u2019s either up in the cupboard at home or my PA might have it. Ross McEwan, chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, has warned more branches could close in England and Wales as a result of transferring customers from its Williams &amp; Glyn unit to competitors. Around 120,000 of its small business customers will be moved by the end of the year to address competition concerns. Asked on LBC radio about the possible scale of the closures, McEwan said: I don\u2019t know at this point. We\u2019ll have to wait until the end of the year to see what actual footfall disappears when we move these customers out. Oil prices have recovered some - but not all - of the session\u2019s losses. Currently off 0.1% at $77.41, but still near the three-and-a-half-year high of $78 achieved on Thursday. Investors across Europe are in a subdued mood this morning, with most major indices slightly down: FTSE 100: flat at 7,701 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 13,006 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,527 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 23,990 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,256 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.04% at 392 Shares in Zoopla-owner ZPG have jumped 30% on the news that it is to be bought for \u00a32.2bn by US priuvate equity firm, Silver Lake. ZPG is the top riser on the FTSE 250, with shares priced at 488p. It has pushed the broader index of UK-focused shares up 0.5%, or 108 points, to 20,805. Some big UK takeover news this morning, with the announcement that ZPG - owner of property website Zoopla and Prime Location and Uswitch - is to be bought for \u00a32.2bn by the American private equity fund Silver Lake. ZPG said it had agreed to a 490p per share cash offer, a premium of 31% to the company\u2019s share price last night before the offer was made public. Zoopla\u2019s largest shareholder DMGT, the Daily Mail and General Trust, owns a 30% stake and has already given irrevocable undertakings to accept the deal. Silver Lake needs to secure the backing equivalent to 75% of shares. Alex Chesterman, ZPG\u2019s founder and chief executive, said: Silver Lake is the global leader in technology investing and I am firmly of the belief that ZPG will benefit from their technology expertise and global network, which will help accelerate our growth. Since its IPO in 2014, ZPG has evolved and diversified as we have made significant progress in becoming the platform of choice for consumers and partners engaged in property and household decisions. The terms of the acquisition represent an attractive premium that recognises the quality of ZPG\u2019s businesses and the strength of its future prospects, and allows shareholders to realise today in cash the potential future value of their holdings. Oil prices might have come off three-and-a-half years this morning but could hit $100 a barrel next year. That\u2019s according to analysts at Bank of America, who are point to a fall in exports from Iran and a collapse in Venezuelan output. They say: Looking into the next 18 months, we expect global oil supply and demand balances to tighten. If a new Iran deal is not reached in the next six months or Opec/Russia extend production cuts into 2019, global oil markets would likely tighten further. Broadbent says the job of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee is to monitor the data and respond accordingly: The economy moves in an unpredictable fashion. Our forecasts are helpful, they point to the general direction of things, but there will be unforeseeable events and we have to be able to respond to those. It is entirely the sensible thing to do to wait to see whether we\u2019re right that the economy will bounce back a bit from here. For me, the decision [to leave rates on hold at 0.5%] was straight forward. He defends his boss, Mark Carney, who has taken the bulk of the criticism, depicted once again as the \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d for giving the market the mixed messages: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. You\u2019re always responding to news and to suggest somehow we\u2019d nailed our colours on [to May] I just don\u2019t accept that\u2019s what we said. We never said that. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has come under pressure this morning after the decision by the monetary policy committee on Thursday to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5%. At one point markets were entirely convinced that the MPC would raise rates at the May meeting, after the governor, Mark Carney, and other committee members sent hints and signals in various speeches. So, Broadbent is asked on the Today programme by Justin Webb, what is the point of guidance if the guidance is wrong? Broadbent said the Bank\u2019s policymakers never promised a May rate rise: We\u2019d given some guidance of what we expect, what might happen to the path of interest rates over the next two or three years, but that\u2019s never been a promise that at particular point in time we\u2019re going to raise them. We\u2019re not in a position to do that. Forward guidance has never been about a precise date of when interest rates are going up, we\u2019ve never said that. Some rises in interest rates, very gradual, to a limited extent [over the next two or three years], that\u2019s all we\u2019ve said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices are down this morning on hopes that other oil-producing nations will step in to plug a potential fall in exports from Iran after President Trump pulled America out of the nuclear deal. Brent crude is down 0.2% at $77.28 a barrel, after hitting $78 on Thursday - the highest since November 2014. As the dust settles on Trump\u2019s decision, analysts are now considering the prospect that other suppliers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will step up to counter any potential disruption in Iran. Kuwait and Iraq could step up, according to analysts at ANZ bank. Here in the UK, investors and commentators are still digesting the Bank of England\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5% at Thursday\u2019s meeting, after policymakers had previously signalled that a May hike was on the cards. Ben Broadbent, a deputy governor at the Bank has just been interviewed on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme and insisted he and his colleagues never \u201cpromised\u201d to raise rates at a specific time. More on that soon.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Waitrose is battling allegations of chocolate plagiarism in a hot-tempered dispute between rival factions of posh chocolatiers. The bosses of upmarket Hotel Chocolat have written to the supermarket\u2019s chief executive in fury after it launched a range of bars they claim bear an uncanny resemblance to their own. The firm has won backing from fellow independent chocolatier Choc on Choc, which believes Waitrose\u2019s avocado Easter egg is suspiciously similar to one of its own inventions. Hotel Chocolat\u2019s co-founder Angus Thirlwell said eagle-eyed chocoholics first spotted the alleged copycat bars in Waitrose earlier this week and alerted him to the similarity. \u201cI\u2019m peeling myself off the wall in terms of emotion because it\u2019s one of the first products I designed,\u201d Thirlwell said. \u201cThey\u2019re running adverts like it\u2019s some amazing piece of creativity and you just think: \u2018Hang on, this is a complete rip-off.\u2019 It\u2019s got to stop.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll do the right thing,\u201d he said but also warned that Hotel Chocolat has not ruled out legal action. \u201cLook at how [engineer James] Dyson has had to fight to protect his ideas over and over again,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re determined to defend our brand.\u201d All the Waitrose bars are roughly the same size as Hotel Chocolat\u2019s and share a distinctive wavy edge that sets them apart from mass-produced bars with straight sides. One of the Waitrose bars \u2013 made of white chocolate with studs of meringue and strawberry pieces and named Eton mess after the famous pudding \u2013 is a combination almost identical to Hotel Chocolat\u2019s concoction of the same name. Waitrose\u2019s caramel crunch bar also shares several characteristics with Hotel Chocolat\u2019s Caramel &amp; Co offering, while orange and coffee-flavoured iterations echo products that the chocolatier has discontinued. Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat had legal protection for its its curved-edge design from the European Union\u2019s intellectual property office. \u201cIt\u2019s inspired by what happens when you pour molten chocolate out onto a chocolatier\u2019s marble table-top because it spreads into a lovely curvy outline,\u201d he said. Thirlwell initially highlighted the uncanny similarities on Twitter. There he found support from Choc on Choc, which said it had invented a chocolate avocado in 2015, only to see Waitrose subsequently roll out a similar avocado egg for Easter. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up with these great concepts but we\u2019re not asked to manufacture them for them [supermarkets]. What happens is that people take the ideas and use them,\u201d the co-founder Flo Broughton said. \u201cWhen a larger retailer copies it or does something very similar, people think that we\u2019ve copied them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t raise our concerns at the time because we\u2019re a supplier to Waitrose and I was too chicken.\u201d A spokesperson for Waitrose said: \u201cWe take the intellectual property rights of other businesses extremely seriously and so we are looking into the points made by Mr Thirlwell. \u201cHowever, we were only approached about this matter yesterday afternoon and we will, of course, need to consider the issues raised, which we will urgently.\u201d Thirlwell said there was no comparison between the two products in terms of quality because Hotel Chocolat bars have a much higher cocoa content, whereas the main ingredient in most of the Waitrose bars is sugar. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing ripping off the look but it\u2019s another when they\u2019ve been stuffed full of cheap sugar. There\u2019s a difference in taste quality and that\u2019s because sugar is one tenth the price of cocoa,\u201d he said. The dispute marks the second time within months that the chocolate world has been hit by allegations of plagiarism. Poundland and the US confectionery giant Mondel\u0113z ended up in court over allegations that Poundland\u2019s Twin Peaks bar was a rip-off of Toblerone but with two points instead of one. The two sides eventually reached a settlement that allowed Poundland to sell half a million Twin Peaks bars it had already produced, in exchange for changing the shape, which it claimed was inspired by Wrekin and Ercall hills in Shropshire.",

      "bodyText": "Mike Platt, a Preston-born financier who started investing at the age of 14 with a \u00a3500 gift from his grandmother, has been named Britain\u2019s richest hedge fund manager with a \u00a33bn fortune. Platt, 49, the co-founder and chief executive of Belgravia-based BlueCrest capital management, has increased his wealth by \u00a3600m over the past year to retain his crown as the richest hedge fund manager, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. BlueCrest, which is not open to outside investors and only invests Platt and his partners\u2019 wealth, made a 57% gain last year on top of a 20% increase in 2016. Platt, who claims to have never suffered an annual loss, spends a lot of his wealth on art, which he displays in the crypt of a deconsecrated church in Marylebone. The collection includes a black Christ in an electric chair beside skulls, stags\u2019 heads, 5bn-year-old meteorites, a Japanese woman riding a walrus and the levitation of St John the Baptist. There are pieces by the taxidermist Polly Morgan, the Turner prize-winner Keith Tyson and Reece Jones. A Tory party donor, Platt also owns a Bombardier Challenger private jet and homes in London, Switzerland and the US. His first investments, funded by his grandmother, were in Britain\u2019s privatised utilities. The second richest UK hedge fund manager is Robert Miller and his daughter, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, who increased their wealth by \u00a3420m to \u00a32bn. Miller, the co-founder of the Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) chain, invests his family fortune via the Hong Kong-based hedge fund Search Investment Group. Sir Michael Hintze, who runs CQS, is ranked third with a \u00a31.4bn fortune. Hintze, who gave \u00a31.5m to the Conservative party in 2014, increased his wealth by \u00a3100m. A noted philanthropist who has given \u00a31m in the past year to the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity, he describes CQS as: \u201cA special place. A place where people are intellectually stimulated and do exceptional things, and where agile minds work powerfully and nimbly together. I thrive on the \u2018battle of ideas\u2019 and love the business.\u201d CQS has \u00a39bn under management and increased the value of its main fund by more than 30% last year. However, the personal wealth of David Harding, another philanthropic hedge fund manager, fell by \u00a3300m to \u00a31bn after profits at his fund Winton Capital halved to \u00a3107.3m. The top 20 UK hedge fund managers are collectively worth more than \u00a316bn. Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, which is published this weekend, said: \u201cThe recent volatility of global stock markets have provided opportunities for the City\u2019s richest hedgies to gild their wealth. \u201cBut life as a billionaire hedge fund manager is not a one-way bet. Four big names of the hedge fund world have seen big falls in their wealth over the past year. Managers tend to invest heavily in their funds, so if their fund bombs so does their own wealth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The company behind the UK property sites Zoopla and PrimeLocation and the price comparison service uSwitch is being bought by a US private equity firm in a \u00a32.2bn deal. California-based tech investor Silver Lake, which has investments in companies including Alibaba, GoDaddy and Tesla, has agreed a 490p a share bid for parent company ZPG. The bid, which values the business at \u00a32.2bn, is almost a third higher than ZPG\u2019s closing price on Thursday. The deal has been backed by more than 31% of investors including ZPG\u2019s largest investor DMGT, the parent company of the Daily Mail, which is in line for a \u00a3640m pay day from the sale of its 29.9% stake. Alex Chesterman, the Zoopla founder and chief executive, is in line to make about \u00a360m from the sale of the 12.5m shares he has in the business. It marks the latest successful exit of a business for serial entrepreneur Chesterman, who set up Zoopla in 2007 a year after he merged his online DVD rental business ScreenSelect with LoveFilm. LoveFilm was then sold to Amazon in 2011 for \u00a3200m. \u201cSilver Lake is the global leader in technology investing and I am firmly of the belief that ZPG will benefit from their technology expertise and global network which will help accelerate our growth,\u201d said Chesterman. \u201cI am very excited about the opportunity this offers to our employees, customers and partners as we move to the next stage of ZPG\u2019s development and growth.\u201d ZPG, which made a \u00a31bn stock market flotation in 2014, is being taken over six months after its \u00a3460m bid for rival GoCompare was rejected. Shares in ZPG, which acquired uSwitch in 2015 for \u00a3190m, jumped by more than 30% in early trading, while rival Rightmove rose by 5%. The deal has been agreed by ZPG\u2019s board but Silver Lake, which last year raised a $15bn (\u00a311bn) fund to back a new round of tech deals, needs to gain approval from 75% of the company\u2019s shareholders.. \u201cZPG is a great growth technology company,\u201d said Simon Patterson, managing director of Silver Lake. \u201cIt has established strong positions in property classifieds, home and financial services markets by innovating in product and marketing. We are delighted to partner with Alex Chesterman, one of Europe\u2019s leading and most accomplished technology entrepreneurs, to invest in ZPG\u2019s continued growth.\u201d Silver Lake said it did not expect to make any material headcount reductions following the completion of the deal and that it would preserve ZPG\u2019s existing management team, brand and culture to ensure continuity. Westhorpe, a subsidiary of Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Canadian pension fund PSP will also take a minority stake by co-investing in ZPG with Silver Lake. Before Zoopla, Chesterman set up Bagelmania, a chain of bagel bars, and has invested in British start-ups including Graze, Secret Escapes and Farmdrop. He received an OBE in 2016 for services to digital entrepreneurship. Profile of Zoopla founder It was a parking ticket and a late fine on a video rental that turned the Zoopla founder, Alex Chesterman, into one of Britain\u2019s most successful digital entrepreneurs. After working for Planet Hollywood in the US in the 1990s, he set up a UK bagels and coffee chain called Bagelmania. However, when he had to pay \u00a352 in fines returning a DVD he started an online business renting out DVDs by post. In 2003 ScreenSelect was born. It merged with smaller rival Lovefilm and become the biggest DVD rental service in Europe. It was eventually sold to Amazon for \u00a3200m in 2011. Chesterman launched Zoopla in 2007 to simplify home buying and rentals. A \u00a31bn stock market flotation came in 2014. He has invested millions into other tech startups, including the snack box provider Graze, the holidays firm Secret Escapes and the farm produce distributor Farmdrop.",

LoveFilm was then sold to Amazon in 2011 for \u00a3200m.<br></p> <p>\u201cSilver Lake is the global leader in technology investing and I am firmly of the belief that ZPG will benefit from their technology expertise and global network which will help accelerate our growth,\u201d said Chesterman. \u201cI am very excited about the opportunity this offers to our employees, customers and partners as we move to the next stage of ZPG\u2019s development and growth.\u201d</p> <p>ZPG, which made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/18/zoopla-float-property-website-919m-pounds\">\u00a31bn stock market flotation in 2014</a>, is being taken over six months after its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/14/gocompare-rejects-opportunistic-takeover-bid-zoopla-owner-zpg\">\u00a3460m bid for rival GoCompare was rejected</a>. Shares in ZPG, which acquired uSwitch in 2015 for \u00a3190m, jumped by more than 30% in early trading, while rival Rightmove rose by 5%.</p> <p>The deal has been agreed by ZPG\u2019s board but Silver Lake, which last year raised a $15bn (\u00a311bn) fund to back a new round of tech deals, needs to gain approval from 75% of the company\u2019s shareholders.. </p> <p>\u201cZPG is a great growth technology company,\u201d said Simon Patterson, managing director of Silver Lake. \u201cIt has established strong positions in property classifieds, home and financial services markets by innovating in product and marketing. We are delighted to partner with Alex Chesterman, one of Europe\u2019s leading and most accomplished technology entrepreneurs, to invest in ZPG\u2019s continued growth.\u201d</p> <p>Silver Lake said it did not expect to make any material headcount reductions following the completion of the deal and that it would preserve ZPG\u2019s existing management team, brand and culture to ensure continuity.</p> <p>Westhorpe, a subsidiary of Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Canadian pension fund PSP will also take a minority stake by co-investing in ZPG with Silver Lake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Zoopla, Chesterman set up Bagelmania, a chain of bagel bars, and has invested in British start-ups including Graze, Secret Escapes and Farmdrop. He received an OBE in 2016 for services to digital entrepreneurship.</p> <h2>Profile of Zoopla founder</h2> <p>It was a parking ticket and a late fine on a video rental that turned the Zoopla founder, Alex Chesterman, into one of Britain\u2019s most successful digital entrepreneurs.</p> <p>After working for Planet Hollywood in the US in the 1990s, he set up a UK bagels and coffee chain called Bagelmania. However, when he had to pay \u00a352 in fines returning a DVD he started an online business renting out DVDs by post. In 2003 ScreenSelect was born. It merged with smaller rival Lovefilm and become the biggest DVD rental service in Europe. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/20/amazon-buys-lovefilm\">eventually sold to Amazon for \u00a3200m in 2011</a>.</p> <p>Chesterman launched Zoopla in 2007 to simplify home buying and rentals. A \u00a31bn stock market flotation came in 2014.</p> <p>He has invested millions into other tech startups, including the snack box provider Graze, the holidays firm Secret Escapes and the farm produce distributor Farmdrop.</p>",

Next said the balmy spell, which included the warmest April day in the UK in almost 70 years, resulted in a \u00a340m sales boost as Britons splashed out on summer dresses, T-shirts and shorts. Its shares were the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 on Thursday, up about 6%, after the retailer beat City expectations with a 6% increase in sales for the three months to 7 May. Shares in Superdry, however, plunged 18% after its chief executive, Euan Sutherland, blamed \u201csnow disruption\u201d and the cool start to spring for putting a dampener on sales of its new clothing ranges. The fashion brand also revealed that price cutting had taken a bite out of profit margins in the year to 28 April as it trimmed it sales forecast for 2019. \u201cThe consumer environment remains challenging,\u201d said Sutherland, adding that sales through its shops \u201cremained under pressure\u201d. He highlighted \u201clower year-on-year average temperatures at the start of the spring-summer season\u201d as a major factor. Next has been one of Britain\u2019s most successful clothing retailers in terms of profits but it has faltered over the last two years as consumer spending has shifted away from clothing towards holidays and entertainment. Sales were 10% lower than in 2017 during a snowy week at the end of February, but they rose more than 25% in one mid-April week when Britain basked in fine weather. Next\u2019s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said the sunshine boost would add \u00a312m to annual profits, which were now expected to be about \u00a3717m. However, the better-than-expected performance was down to its website, where sales surged 18.1%. The trend of falling sales at its high street stores continued with a 4.8% drop. At Superdry, Sutherland also revealed its fledgling US business was now expected to make a \u00a33m loss, rather than a small profit, after poor trading in stores was compounded by extra investment after it took over the running of the wholesale division. Overall the retailer is expected to report a 11.5% increase in full-year profits to \u00a396.5m. Eleanor Parr, an analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201c[Superdry] anticipates that generating store sales will continue to be difficult this financial year, which makes the success of [its] online and wholesale business more critical.\u201d",
