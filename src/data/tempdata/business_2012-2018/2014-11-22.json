      "bodyText": "Retailers have drafted in extra shopfloor and security staff to control the anticipated crowds of shoppers as they prepare for the American-style Black Friday shopping mania due to sweep Britain\u2019s high streets this week. The 24-hour sales bonanza imported from the US has become big business in the UK, with store bosses predicting that sales rung up on Friday will be double those of last year, at around \u00a3200m. Some of the high street\u2019s biggest names, including John Lewis, Asda, Currys and Argos, will launch thousands of deals. Tens of thousands of shoppers are expected to queue outside supermarkets and shopping centres in the early hours of Friday to get their hands on aggressively discounted TVs, tablets and smartphones. Just as many are expected to log on from their beds, with John Lewis among the retailers launching deals at a minute past midnight. Steve Smith, chief customer officer at Walmart-owned Asda, said the mild autumn meant fewer shoppers had started their Christmas shopping early this year: \u201cPeople are holding off for Black Friday. It\u2019s going to be a lot bigger than last year.\u201d Amazon introduced Black Friday discounts to Britain in 2010 and last year other high-street retailers followed suit. This year the phenomenon has engulfed the whole sector, with Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer among those looking for a slice of what is effectively the new Boxing Day sales. Given that, for many, Black Friday also coincides with the last pay day before Christmas, the weekend is expected to be the biggest spending splurge of the year as retailers spread deals over several days. Websites such as Amazon and white goods retailer AO.com are running a whole week of deals, starting from tomorrow. Amazon says it will run more than 3,000 \u201clightning deals\u201d, a limited amount of a product being discounted for a short time. An offer will launch every 10 minutes at an average saving of 40%, Amazon said, with products on offer including Sony 48-inch TV sets and Le Creuset cookware. The event will also play out on social media, with brands launching deals on Facebook and Twitter. The American event, which follows the Thanksgiving holiday, is a massive sales tradition, although opinion is divided on the true origin of the name. On Wall Street \u201cblack\u201d is said to refer to stores moving from the \u201cred\u201d to the \u201cblack\u201d as they move into profit for the first time in the year; many chains make all their profit in the Christmas trading period, dubbed the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d. Others attribute the phrase to Philadelphia police in the 1960s, when hordes of shoppers caused traffic jams and other problems. Violent scenes are not uncommon in America. There have been deaths and in 2011 a woman pepper-sprayed the crowd at a Walmart in Los Angeles so that she could grab a Nintendo Wii discounted by 60%. Asda was caught off guard last year by the frenzied response to offers such as cut-price 60-inch TVs, with the day marred by fights among shoppers scrabbling for a finite amount of stock. This year it has drafted in 2,000 extra staff, including security guards, and says it will operate a queuing system. An Asda spokesman said it had increased the number of offers by 40% and bought three times as much stock to reduce the potential for flashpoints. \u201cIt is very important for retailers to build rhetoric round this because it is an opportunity to put promotions shoppers\u2019 way, but I\u2019m cynical about the transfer of Black Friday across the pond,\u201d said Jonathan Reynolds, director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management. \u201cYou could call it Blue Wednesday and have the same effect \u2013 it\u2019s about the need to kick off the Christmas shopping season.\u201d Retailers are fighting tooth and nail for sales this Christmas as spending remains muted despite the economic recovery. Mainstream supermarkets are enmeshed in a fierce price war, while the mild autumn has left many fashion retailers sitting on mountains of unsold coats and jumpers. Analysts at research firm Verdict predict consumers will spend \u00a32.3bn more this Christmas, an increase of 2.6% on last year, taking the total over the period to \u00a390.7bn, but sales will be hard won. \u201cIf retailers want to get that extra 2% [of spending], they have to get up early \u2013 it\u2019s a buyers\u2019 market,\u201d added Reynolds of the surprising level of enthusiasm British retailers are showing for the American event. Maggie Porteous, director of selling at John Lewis, said the retailer had also drafted in extra staff to ensure that its stores can manage the extra demand: \u201cIf I was a betting lady, I\u2019d say Black Friday could be the biggest day of the year in our shops.\u201d If an orgy of spending on Black Friday and the ensuing Cyber Monday sticks in your craw, there is the less crass alternative of #Giving Tuesday on 2 December. The global day of giving, backed by hundreds of businesses and charities, asks people to mark the day by doing one thing for a good cause, be it a donation or volunteering their time.",
