      "bodyText": "The latest productivity growth figures released on Monday show that for the fifth year in a row Australian workers have become more productive. But the reasons for that growth combined with the latest investment figures would do little to have workers cheering. Last week the latest private new capital expenditure figures were released showing that the amount of investment in building, structure, machinery and equipment once again declined \u2013 down 4.8% in the September quarter and down 15.6% over the past 12 months. The decline of course was driven by falling investment in the mining industry. This is not a shock. Pointing out that mining investment is falling is about as stunning as suggesting the next Star Wars movie might make a bit of money. The fall of investment in the mining industry has now entered its fourth year \u2013 the peak was way back in September 2012: And while the investment in the non-mining sector is improving slightly, it is by no means enough to make up for the drop in the mining sector: It\u2019s always worth remembering that just because investment in the mining industry has collapsed, that doesn\u2019t mean the mining industry itself has. The industry is actually going gangbusters. While mining investment has fallen 62% since September 2012, output by the industry has grown 32% in the same time (and output by the iron ore sector is up 70%) \u2013 well beyond the 10% increase in Australia\u2019s GDP. But that output is driven by exports of mining, rather than by investment. The investment in the sector was mostly for the building of the mine and the structures \u2013 road, rail etc needed for those mines: And those buildings and structure required a lot of labour. And this brings us to the ABS\u2019s release on Monday of its annual estimates of industry multi-factor productivity. Multi-factor productivity attempts to measure how well labour makes use of capital to produce their output. In 2015-16 in the market sector (ie not counting the public sector), multi-factor productivity grew by 0.9% \u2013 the fifth straight year of improving productivity: During the mining boom years, while our GDP was growing well above average, our productivity growth was as bad as it had ever been. It was the cause of much angst among economists and policymakers. It was one of the justifications for the Howard government introducing WorkChoices in 2006. But the biggest reason for the decline in productivity growth was the actual boom in mining investment. The soaring prices for iron ore meant mining companies were falling over themselves to build new mines, and that meant investing in a lot of capital and employing a lot of labour in order to produce its output. In 2005, 2006 and 2007 \u2013 when the mining boom was at its height \u2013 the mining industry increased investment on average by 45% each year, while annual output growth averaged 5.5%. In the past three years, while investment has fallen on average by 20% each year, output has increased by 7.8%. It meant that during those mining boom years, despite very strong output growth, productivity was falling: The mining and the electricity, gas and water industries were the two big drags on national productivity \u2013 mining due to the massive investment in new mines, and the electricity sector due to the massive investment (some would argue overinvestment) in the electricity network. The latest figures show just how poorly productivity performed in those two industries compared with the rest of the economy: But now, great news! Productivity in the mining industry is on the improve \u2013 up 9.7% in the past two years (the best of any industry) \u2013 and productivity in the electricity and gas industry is also on the improve. But why this has occurred is a perfect encapsulation of why people feel disconnected with economic policies. Productivity is something that is good for the economy and good for people\u2019s lives. If we are able to produce more with the same amount of labour then that means (all other things being equal) that our standard of living will improve. If we are unable to improve our productivity then the only way our income can improve is if the price for the things we produce goes up. But productivity growth can equally come from producing more or even the same amount, but with a smaller amount of labour. And this is what we are seeing occur at the moment. In the past two years, for example, the five industries which have seen the level of \u201clabour inputs\u201d (essentially hours worked) grow the most, have all seen their multi-factor productivity decline. Conversely, all of the five industries whose labour inputs have gone down have seen their multi-factor productivity increase. And the mining industry which has reduced its labour input the most also has the best productivity growth: Ideally of course you want to see both labour and productivity increase, and that did occur in four industries over the past two years \u2013 led by the information media and telecommunication industry which had the sixth biggest increase in labour inputs and the fourth biggest productivity improvement. But even there, the news is not great as most of the productivity growth came from 2015-16, which coincided with a 2% fall in labour input. It\u2019s why when economists speak of productivity improvements they think of standard of living, national income and GDP per capita growth, but when workers hear it they are much more likely to think, cuts to jobs and hours worked. And given the data, they are right to think that.",

      "bodyText": "Investors\u2019 ability to look on the bright side on political turmoil is remarkable. In the case of Italy, the departure of Matteo Renzi, the market-friendly centre-left prime minister, was followed quickly by the thought that the crisis in the country\u2019s banking system may, counterintuitively, become easier to address. That wasn\u2019t last week\u2019s theory, of course. Back then, Renzi\u2019s survival was seen as critical to encouraging private sector investors to cough up billions of euros of new capital to refinance the likes of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and UniCredit. This week\u2019s silver lining theory holds that a political vacuum isn\u2019t so bad if it prods the European Central Bank and the eurozone authorities to take a flexible approach to Italy\u2019s banking mess. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, captured the new mood: \u201cThe president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is Italian and I can\u2019t envisage a situation in which the ECB under Mario Draghi will let the Italian banks get into difficulty.\u201d He\u2019s probably right. It seems quite possible that, if MPS struggles to get its required \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) from big private sector investors such as Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the bank could be nationalised with ways found to compensate ordinary savers who hold bonds that would be wiped out. A wipeout of senior bondholders is meant to be an essential requirement of state bailouts in the eurozone these days. It causes problems in Italy because so many bondholders are retail savers. But the eurozone\u2019s capacity to bend its own rules is legendary: compensation for some bondholders, even if that is supposed to be a no-no, might be deemed a price worth paying after Renzi\u2019s exit. Yet would that really be a cause for celebration? Only if the health of the Italian banking system is addressed once and for all. But it seems far more likely that a weak Italian government and reluctant eurozone authorities will serve up only half a solution \u2013 one big enough to get through the current crisis but insufficient to allow a proper cleansing of the bad loans in the system, which are estimated to stand at \u20ac360bn. If that\u2019s the script, there will little reason to cheer. Italy\u2019s banks would continue to be a drag on the country\u2019s economy and the eurozone authorities\u2019 credibility in a crisis would suffer another knock. RBS should have its day in court From Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s point of view, almost any legal settlement counts as good business these days. The \u201cfull and final\u201d deal with three out of five shareholder groups claiming they were misled in the \u00a312bn rights issue in 2008 also looks craftily pitched. The terms on offer to the complainants \u2013 about 41p for every share bought for about 200p \u2013 present the two remaining groups of hold-outs with a choice. They can accept an offer the others deem acceptable; or they can take their chances with litigation that could take half a decade. Public statements on Monday suggest a willingness to fight on, but we\u2019ll see if that spirit survives the prospect of a lengthy court battle. One suspects cool heads will prevail eventually and that the hold-outs will choose certainty, which would allow RBS to draw a line under the saga at a cost of \u00a3800m, roughly in line with the size of its provision. Such an outcome would be sensible but also disappointing. We would all be deprived of the opportunity of seeing former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin and former chairman Sir Tom McKillop in court to defend their portrait of RBS\u2019s financial health in April 2008. RBS has recorded losses every single year since then and the tally stands at more than \u00a350bn. The testimony would be fascinating. Sports Direct split raises wider issues Back in January 2013, Sports Direct and Merrill Lynch, the sportswear chain\u2019s corporate broker, were said to have parted ways by mutual consent. That wasn\u2019t true, according to filings in the high court made by Jeff Blue, who used to be an adviser to the company but is now suing founder Mike Ashley for a \u00a314m bonus he says he was promised. Blue alleges that Merrill Lynch resigned earlier, in autumn 2012, because it was worried that share purchases by the company\u2019s employee benefit trust could breach financial regulations. The court can unpick the detail of the claims; Sports Direct didn\u2019t comment on Monday. But the discrepancy over timings should make City regulators think. Corporate brokers play an important role in City life, acting as intermediaries between a company and its shareholders. If one quits \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 there ought to be an obligation to announce the fact promptly.",

Blue alleges that Merrill Lynch resigned earlier, in autumn 2012, because it was worried that share purchases by the company\u2019s employee benefit trust could breach financial regulations.</p> <p>The court can unpick the detail of the claims; Sports Direct didn\u2019t comment on Monday. But the discrepancy over timings should make City regulators think. Corporate brokers play an important role in City life, acting as intermediaries between a company and its shareholders. If one quits \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 there ought to be an obligation to announce the fact promptly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The euro has continued to hold firm after recovering from its early falls in the wake of the Italian referendum. Against the dollar, it is currently at $1.076, its highest level since the middle of November. Meanwhile the pound is down around 1% against the single currency, at \u20ac1.1812. Italian bond yields, which initially spiked higher, fell back from earlier highs and are currently up around 6 basis points at 1.97%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has called on governments to tackle the problem of inequality around the globe. Katie Allen reports on his speech in Liverpool: The governor.. has issued a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of \u201cisolation and detachment\u201d among people who feel left behind by globalisation. Mark Carney used his first big speech since Donald Trump swept to power in America, to warn that open markets are under threat and that politicians must do more to share out the gains of global trade and the rise of technology. Carney reiterated the Bank\u2019s stance that monetary policy could not be held accountable for rising inequality. He gave no new hints on the direction of interest rates in the UK and said rate-setters would continue to trade off the opposing forces of rising prices and uncertainty stemming from the Brexit vote. The main focus of his last speech of an eventful year, was inequality and he described current times as \u201cthe first lost decade since the 1860s\u201d. Carney noted the rise in living standards around the world in recent decades and said technological progress had lifted more than a billion people out of poverty. But he recognised those advances had not been felt equally. The full report is here: Despite initial falls after the result of the Italian referendum and the subsequent resignation of prime minister Matteo Renzi, European markets have recovered to end the day higher. Apart that is from Italy itself, which fell back slightly. Earlier we listed six reasons why markets did not drop sharply after the Italian news. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 16.11 points or 0.24% higher at 6746.83 Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.63% to 10,684.83 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1% at 4574.32 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.67% at 8664.7 In Greece the Athens market added 1.03% to 620.29 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.21% to 17,050.21. In the struggling bank sector, Monte dei Paschi lost 4% ahead of news of the fate of its rescue plan, while Unicredit dropped 3% On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record high of 19,274.85 but is currently off its best levels, up 0.33% at 19233. Italy\u2019s bonds are likely to continue to come under pressure despite the - relatively - muted response to the referendum, says Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics: The rejection of the Italian government\u2019s constitutional reforms in Sunday\u2019s referendum is not in itself a game-changer for the bond markets of Italy and the rest of the euro-periphery. But it may represent Italy\u2019s first step along a path towards the euro-zone\u2019s exit door. As a result, we think that the risks for Italian bond yields are skewed to the upside. The outcome prompted little reaction in financial markets. The euro\u2019s fall proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year Italian government bonds rose by just 10bp or so to around 2.0%. This is hardly surprising given that a \u201cNo\u201d vote and subsequent resignation by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had largely been discounted, and that the risk of an imminent Italian exit from the euro-zone remains very small. So what happens now? Despite doubling in recent months, the 10-year yield is not abnormally high and is a far cry from its level at the height of the euro-zone crisis in 2011. In fact, if anything, it \u2013 and the yields of other bonds \u2013 have been kept artificially low by the ECB\u2019s asset purchases in the past two years. So there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns about the country\u2019s banking sector... Admittedly, any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap election being called, which would give the anti-euro Five Star Movement (M5S) an opportunity to seize power. While we doubt there will be an early election, we cannot rule out the possibility altogether... Granted, the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12. However, such support would probably be conditional on certain commitments being made by the Italian government, especially regarding continued membership of the monetary union. This would be a difficult condition to satisfy if M5S, potentially along with eurosceptic allies in other political parties, were to form a government and pledge to hold a referendum on euro membership. So in this case, we think Italian bond yields would surge. Even if the \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d for bonds came to pass \u2013 where a new Prime Minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an early election were avoided \u2013 we expect that it would only provide temporary respite for Italy\u2019s bond market given the country\u2019s troubles. The market may not have gone into meltdown after the Italian vote, but there could be some weakness ahead, not least because of the latest European Central Bank meeting later this week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: They came, they saw and they voted. Italy\u2019s decision to reject Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms has not produced the feared apocalypse in global markets. Instead, we have seen European markets trade in positive territory, aside of course from the Italian index, which is still under pressure thanks to its embattled banking sector. Europe\u2019s bounce today definitely has the \u2018relief rally\u2019 feeling to it, so in the face of a rising euro and pre-ECB nerves it will be interesting to see whether gains can be sustained in coming sessions. No-one really expected Brexit or Trump, but here the result was priced in, and as a result we may well have to endure some extended weakness now that the initial excitement is out of the way. Back with Italy, and Reuters is reporting the fate of struggling Monte dei Paschi may not be known for a few days yet: Potential investors in the bank\u2019s cash call are reportedly waiting to see the political developments before making any commitments. More on the ISM figures: The US data is likely to increase speculation of an interest rate rise next week. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: An above-expectations uptick in ISM non-manufacturing PMI for November suggests that the US services sector \u2013 which accounts for two-thirds of the country\u2019s economic activity \u2013 has remained a robust proposition in the weeks since Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election victory... The most immediate implication of today\u2019s data is its impact on next week\u2019s FOMC meeting, where Fed Chair Janet Yellen is expected to finally pull the trigger on the first interest rate hike for a year.\u201d Despite the worries about Europe and the surprise election of Donald Trump as US president, the country\u2019s service sector put in a strong performance in November. The ISM non-manufacturing PMI came in at 57.2, up from 54.8 in October and better than the forecast 55.4. This is the highest figure since October 2015. Earlier there were also PMI figures from Markit which came in broadly in line with expectations: Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has told reporters in Brussels that the European Central Bank won\u2019t let Italy\u2019s banks failed. Speaking before this afternoon\u2019s eurogroup talks, Noonan said: It\u2019s always a concern when you hear about banks being weak, and some Italian banks are weak. But the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is Italian and I can\u2019t envisage a situation in which the ECB under Mario Draghi will let the Italian banks get into difficulty. Draghi won\u2019t be around for ever to save the Italian banks, though - his term expires in October 2019. Over in the US, the post election market rally continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new peak of 19,261 lead by banking stocks and - with the continuing rise in the crude price - energy companies. The index has slipped back from the record high but is still up around 73 points or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.4% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5%. Eurogroup finance ministers are now holding talks about Greece\u2019s bailout, and Athens\u2019 repeated calls for debt relief. However, we\u2019re not expecting any major breakthrough today, as the latest review of its bailout programme isn\u2019t finished yet. Yikes! Italian banking shares are falling again as the markets watch anxiously for signs that the plan to recapitalise the sector is at risk. There\u2019s no word yet about Monti dei Paschi\u2019s \u20ac5bn capital raising plan, following the meeting of investors who had been planning to back the cash call. The eurogroup is also calling on Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to boost their spending to help Europe\u2019s economy grow. In a statement, they say that the three countries are \u201cover-achieving\u201d their medium-term objectives (ie, running fiscal policy that is too tight). \u201cThe Eurogroup acknowledges that these member states could use their favourable budgetary situation to further strengthen their domestic demand and growth potential, depending on country specific circumstances, while respecting the medium-term objective, the national budgetary prerogatives and national requirements.\u201d Asked if Sunday\u2019s vote is a blow to European reform plans, Dijsselbloem says The referendum took place, the Italian people said no, that\u2019s clear. On a wider level, all European counties need to ensure they have modern judicial systems, political systems capable of taking difficult decisions, and efficient public administrations. The next Italian government will have to consider whether constitutional reforms are needed, he adds. Economist Megan Greene isn\u2019t surprised that Italy can\u2019t commit to new budget cuts or privatisations today, as the eurogroup would have liked. Ouch! Jeroen Dijsselbloem singles out Italy as one of eight eurozone members whose 2017 budgets aren\u2019t up to scratch. Today\u2019s meeting agreed that Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia, Finland, Spain and Portugal have submitted budget plans that risk non-compliance with the eurozone\u2019s budget rules, the eurogroup chief tells today\u2019s press conference. For seven of those countries, their respective finance ministers all agreed to take new steps to ensure their budgets are in line. But obviously Italy\u2019s Pier Carlo Padoan has ducked out of today\u2019s meeting to address domestic matters. And Dijsselbloem admits that \u201cit\u2019s impossible\u2019 to expect Italy to commit to new measures right now. We agreed that at this juncture, it\u2019s difficult for the Italian government to commit now to new additional measures. The eurogroup invites Italy to take necessary steps in the near future to ensure that its budget is compliant, he concludes. Heads-up. The eurogroup are holding a press conference now, following this morning\u2019s talks (they\u2019re spoiling us with a SECOND press conference tonight). Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem says ministers have been discussing the draft budget plans for 2017. He says the eurozone economy is continuing to recover. Growth is forecast in every member state, and will continue to strengthen. And \u201calmost all member states\u201d are expected to achieve the target of keeping their deficits below 3% of GDP. The press conference is being streamed live here Several eurozone finance ministers have played down the dangers posed by Italy, as they gathered in Brussels for today\u2019s eurogroup meeting -- where Greece\u2019s call for debt relief will be discussed. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he didn\u2019t see a crisis looming, but insisted that Rome must press on with economic reforms. He told reporters that: \u201cThere is no reason to talk about a euro crisis\u201d \u201cI think we have to take this with a dose of serenity. Italy urgently needs a government that is ready to act.\u201d France\u2019s Michel Sapin argued that Italian voters hadn\u2019t rejected the EU yesterday: \u201cThe referendum was a question on domestic Italian politics... not about Europe, on European policy, or on the place of Italy in Europe.\u201d Eurogroup ministers didn\u2019t seem too distraught by Renzi\u2019s fall, either, judging by these photos: Thanks to AFP for the quotes. No wonder City veterans talk about \u201cplaying the Forex\u201d: Writing in the Economist, John Hooper explains why the rescue of Monte dei Paschi bank is now in trouble: Many observers had expected a No vote, if a narrower one, and markets have already priced in some of the risk. But the defeat worsens the problems of Italy\u2019s banking system, and particularly of its shakiest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the country\u2019s third-largest. The government has solicited institutional investors to recapitalise MPS, but many had made investment conditional on a Yes vote. Some will see the result as proof that Italy is incapable of reform, and may pull back. Italy could soon face an agonising choice between three options. One would be to nationalise MPS. The second would be to rescue it under new European Union rules that would heap losses on to investors, among them retail investors who hold most of MPS\u2019s subordinated debt. Or, faced with the prospect of having to impoverish these voters, the government might simply decide to break the rules, whatever the cost to the credibility of the single currency and its nascent banking union. Italy\u2019s referendum result isn\u2019t the trigger for a new eurozone crisis, insists Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Arriving in Brussels to chair today\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance chiefs, Dijsselbloem told reporters in Brussels that: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it is (the start of a new crisis). There is no reason for that. Political instability makes it more complicated for Italy and the euro zone. But it is a new reality we have to work with.\u201d \u201cItaly is a large economy, one of the largest in Europe, it has strong institutions. You can see that market reaction so far has been moderate.\u201d The euro has also rallied against the pound this morning. It\u2019s up around 0.3% today, pulling sterling down to \u20ac1.189. It had been as high as \u20ac1.20 in overnight trading, as Asian markets reacted to the Italian vote. Boom! The euro just hit its highest level since mid-November, as the single currency shakes off Italy\u2019s referendum result. It just hit $1.07 against the US dollar, or almost 1.5 cents above Sunday night\u2019s lows. City analyst Louise Cooper has a few theories as to why: A lot of the political risk of Italy voting No was already priced in. Unlike Trump and Brexit, this was an outcome the pollsters expected. Secondly Italy has a long history of political instability. Today\u2019s resignation and the possible creation of a technocratic government is not that unusual. Thirdly, Traders and investors learnt from Tump and Brexit, to buy on short term weakness. You could have made 10% out of the FTSE100 and the S&amp;P500 if buying at the bottom and selling just a couple of weeks later. And fourthly no one quite knows where this referendum vote takes us. It maybe could take us eventually to Italy leaving the Euro. But we are a long way from that eventuality. This Bloomberg screen grab shows how some Italian bank shares were hit this morning: City investors are watching Italy nervously for signs that the programme to strengthen its banks is still on track, or veering off course. Matteo Renzi\u2019s resignation increases the risk that the banks can\u2019t be rescued with private sector money, and will need an official aid package. And that would be politically awkward, as bond holders must be \u2018bailed in\u2019, meaning losses for some investors. It\u2019s not clear if those losses would extent to retail investors (individual households). We\u2019re expecting to hear news within hours from the crucial meeting of investors who had been planning to join the \u20ac5bn cash call for Monte dei Paschi. If that deal falls apart, Italy\u2019s oldest bank might be part-nationalised, says the FT. G+ economist Lena Komileva believes Renzi\u2019s defeat could accelerate the push to recapitalise Italy\u2019s banks, and encourage Brussels to approve any plan. Matteo Renzi can take some credit for calming the markets today, by promising to resign so swiftly last night. That pledge diluted the uncertainty created by the referendum result, says Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades: \u201cRenzi\u2019s quick decision to resign was the best thing in this situation for Italy. \u201cThe next few hours will be crucial for the country, trying to understand if they will go to vote or if there will be a technocrat government to reform the electoral law. Indosuez Wealth Management chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen dismisses talk of a new eurozone crisis. \u201cOur base scenario is a caretaker government which could be in place before Christmas, and no new elections before 2018. \u201cIf indeed things pan out according to our base scenario, there would be little reason for any broad-based turmoil. It is still utterly unlikely that Italy would leave the EU or the euro. So this has helped the euro claw back last night\u2019s losses (it\u2019s now worth \u20ac1.065 again). CNBC\u2019s Gemma Acton points out that the European Central Bank meets on Thursday, and could reassure the markets by extending its QE scheme by another six months (it expires in March 2017). Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, has pulled out of today\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. That may mean he\u2019ll be involved in the post-Renzi talks today: Here are a few reasons why the financial markets aren\u2019t having an almighty tantrum over Matteo Renzi\u2019s resignation. 1) Renzi\u2019s defeat was priced in. After a bad year, opinion pollsters can celebrate getting one vote right. They\u2019ve been predicting for months that the No campaign would win Sunday\u2019s referendum, so investors have had plenty of time to prepare. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG, explains: \u201cThe broader financial market impact has, so far, been relatively limited as evident by only modest gains for traditional safe haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc. Investors are not expecting financial market stability to be disrupted significantly in the near-term. \u201cThe rejection was signalled in advance by the opinion polls \u2013 one likely reason for the limited initial financial market reaction. 2) Italy isn\u2019t about to crash out of the eurozone. Greece proved last year that it\u2019s very hard to check out of the single currency, even if relations with your creditors have hit breaking point. Italy isn\u2019t facing funding problems, and the public aren\u2019t clamouring for a return to the lira. 3) Super Mario is standing by The European Central Bank has weapons on hand to help Italy, if needed. If borrowing costs spike, the ECB can step in and mop up some bonds. That\u2019s only a short-term fix, but it might deter speculators from taking on Mario Draghi and trying to profit from the political instability. 4) Yesterday\u2019s vote was (partly) about preserving the status quo Renzi was defeated by a broad-ranging coalition which included respected former PM Mario Monti, as well as the radical Five Star Movement. City analyst Marc Ostwald argues that we shouldn\u2019t see it as just a populist revolt: Their argument that the Italicum would concentrate too much power in the hands of the PM, and thus heightens the risk of the emergence of a Mussolini type figure, while technically undeniable, is still a smokescreen for the preservation of Machiavellian modus operandi that has seen have 64 governments since World War II - it has therefore precisely nothing to do with either the Brexit referendum or Trump\u2019s presidential victory And it\u2019s also possible that whoever succeeds Renzi as PM will push through electoral reforms (unless a snap election is called). 5) This might speed up the task of fixing Italy\u2019s banks. No-one doubts that the Italian banking sector needs serious repair, to tackle the bad loans that have been lingering since the financial crisis struck. So Renzi\u2019s defeat could spur banking bosses into taking tough action, such as \u2018bailing-in\u2019 bondholders and merging with rivals. Claudio Scardovi, managing director of AlixPartners, says \u201curgent restructuring and consolidation is needed\u201d There must be a radical restructuring plan for ailing banks, some of which could entail a partial \u201cbail in\u201d and liquidation, potentially accompanied by a pre-emptive government recapitalization for an estimated Euros 10-20 billion. \u201cThese restructurings are likely to be followed, or accelerated in parallel, by a long overdue consolidation of the Italian banking system through mergers and acquisitions of small and mid-sized banks. 6) Investors could be too complacent, and not thinking of the long-term Many commentators are pointing out that Italy goes through a lot of prime ministers, so Matteo Renzi\u2019s defeat isn\u2019t all that important. I\u2019m not totally convinced -- Italy doesn\u2019t have a stockpile of reforming politicians to dip into, so Renzi (once seen as The Man to tackle its problems) may be sorely missed. Alberto Nardelli of Buzzfeed (an Italian politics expert) argues that the anti-euro forces have been strengthened: But in the short term, investors have more immediate issues -- like Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, and Donald Trump\u2019s imminent arrival in the Oval Office. European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny says we shouldn\u2019t panic about Italy\u2019s banking sector: He told a news conference in Vienna: \u201cThese are problems of individual banks. It is not a problem of the entire banking system. It is therefore important to tell the difference and these are in my view problems that can be solved.\u201d This chart from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows how the euro has recovered from its tumble on Sunday night, when the Italian exit polls showed that Renzi had lost: Ed also agrees that we shouldn\u2019t panic about the selloff in Italian bonds this morning: European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici has urged investors not to turn Italy\u2019s political drama into a crisis. Moscovici told France 2 television that: \u201cIt\u2019s a solid country with solid authorities and I have complete confidence that Italy can handle this situation. There is some political instability but the country is extremely stable and it\u2019s also a big economy.\u201d Moscovici also denied that the result was another snub to the European Union: Nothing to do with it....It\u2019s a domestic constitutional amendment in Italy which has not managed to get through. (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) The cost of insuring Italian debt against default has hit a three-year high today, but it remains well below crisis levels. Reuters has the details: Five-year Italian credit default swaps rose nine basis points from Friday\u2019s close to 180 bps, their highest since December 2013, according to data from Markit. Renzi has said he will resign and this may open the door to early elections next year and the possibility of an anti-euro party, the 5-Star Movement, gaining power. Italian banking shares are bouncing back from their early losses. Even Monte dei Pasche has jumped -- perhaps a sign that its \u20ac5bn rescue plan is still on course? As feared Italy\u2019s main stock market has fallen at the start of trading. But it\u2019s just rebounded, following other European markets higher! Germany\u2019s DAX has jumped by 1%, and the FTSE 100 is showing solid gains too: This is partly because many investors had expected the Italian public to reject Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms -- which would have weakened the Senate and given the prime minister more power. And if Renzi\u2019s administration is succeeded by a coalition, rather than by immediate snap elections, the immediate impact of his defeat may be limited. But in the long term, Italy\u2019s deep-seated economic problems remain. Maria Paola Toschi, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, fears \u201cnegative implications\u201d for the Italian economy. Structural issues in Italy have contributed to a prolonged period of low growth and declining competitiveness in recent decades. Renzi and his government pursued a very ambitious programme of reform aimed at addressing some of these issues\u2014of which the Senate reform that has been voted down in the referendum was a crucial part. The referendum was therefore seen as a political test for the government\u2014and the No victory was considered a vote of no confidence, putting at risk the survival of the current coalition. The euro is continuing to claw its way back from last night\u2019s dive, as investors digest Renzi\u2019s defeat. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital dubs it a \u201cfairly ordered response\u201d: A \u2018No\u2019 vote had already been priced in although the scale of the defeat for Matteo Renzi has surprised and leads to the prospect of fresh elections next year. Shares in Monti dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s oldest bank, have slumped by 6% in early trading. Traders are clearly concerned that Renzi\u2019s defeat has put the bank\u2019s rescue plans in doubt. Italian media are reporting that investors will meet this morning to decide whether to back Monti Dei Paschi\u2019s efforts to raise \u20ac5bn in new fundraising. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets say: Attention now turns to Monte di Paschi, which was due to do a \u20ac5bn recap this week. It will meet the two underwriters this morning to decide whether to go ahead. If they pull out, the expectation is the bank would be nationalised. Shares in Italian banks have fallen sharply at the start of trading in Milan. The main banking index had slid by 3%, hit by fears that the ongoing attempts to strengthen several lenders could be at risk. Unicredit has lost 4%, with many smaller lenders badly hit too: There are particular fears about Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s oldest bank, which is trying to raise \u20ac5bn in new capital and offload \u20ac28bn of bad loans. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says that rescue plan could be at risk: The No result in the referendum has undoubtedly made it harder to attract private sector capital to fill Monte dei Paschi\u2019s gaping capital hole, and bring it back up to a standard where it could pass under the low bar of the ECB\u2019s stress test, which it failed in the summer. The risk is, that investors lose faith that it will be able to do this, which triggers a run on the bank and a full blown financial crisis that starts in the currency bloc, but could emanate around the world. Italian government bonds have been hit in early trading, following Mattei Renzi\u2019s defeat in last night\u2019s referendum. But the losses aren\u2019t massive, and we\u2019re not looking at a full blown crisis here. The interest rates on Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond has jumped to 2.01%, up from 1.9% on Friday. That means that investors think the debt is riskier, so are demanding a bigger return for holding the bonds. However, this is still a pretty low level -- five years ago, Silvio Berlusconi was forced to resign when Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yields smashed through 7%. AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas points out that the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs has widened, but not too dramatically: This may show that investors had \u2018priced in\u2019 Renzi\u2019s defeat, as recent opinion polls had predicted the No side would win. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s going to be a volatile day in the European stock markets, after Italy\u2019s prime minister announced his resignation after losing yesterday\u2019s referendum on constitutional reforms. Matteo Renzi fell on his sword late last night, deepening Europe\u2019s political turmoil, after nearly 60% of the public voted against his proposed changes. The PM declared that: I take full responsibility for the defeat, He\u2019s expected to hand in his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella today: The euro plunged to a 20-month low after Renzi quit, as investors feared that another chapter of eurozone debt crisis drama was opening up. BUT.... the single currency has been clawing back some ground since, and is currently down just 0.5% at $1.053. European stock markets are expected to fall when trading begins at 8am GMT, led by Italy\u2019s main stock index, the FTSE MIB. Financial shares are likely to be hit hardest, on fears that Renzi\u2019s resignation will scupper efforts to recapitalise the Italian banking sector. Renzi\u2019s failure is being painted as another triumph for anti-establishment, populist parties. But my colleague Stephanie Kirchgaessner explains that many voters had serious concerns about Renzi\u2019s plan to shake-up the constitution: The proposed reforms, in effect, neutered the senate and would have given much more power to Renzi and future prime ministers. The prime minister, who started his political career as the mayor of Florence and was the youngest-ever prime minister when he assumed office in 2014, made constitutional reform a central plank of his premiership and argued for months that the changes would make Italy more stable and likely to adopt tough-but-needed economic and labour policies. But the prime minister did not overcome the steep decline in his own popularity and the mistrust of voters who were disappointed that he could not or did not do more to improve the economy and cut unemployment. For many the plebiscite ultimately became a vote of no confidence in the premier. Renzi\u2019s personality \u2013 jovial but verging on arrogance \u2013 made him seem far removed from the worries of ordinary Italians, some said. Our liveblog has full coverage of the Italian result, which came hours after Austria\u2019s presidential election was won by former Green Alexander Van der Bellen, who defeated the far-right Norbert Hofer. Italy isn\u2019t the only issue today either. Eurozone finance ministers are due to meet this afternoon to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout programme. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has already fired a warning shot against those pushing for Greek debt relief. He told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag that: \u201cAthens must finally implement the needed reforms.\u201d \u201cIf Greece wants to stay in the euro, there is no way around it \u2013 in fact completely regardless of the debt level.\u201d Today\u2019s market action will show us if investors are seriously worried about the eurozone, or can take these latest bouts of turmoil in their stride...",

But it may represent Italy\u2019s first step along a path towards the euro-zone\u2019s exit door. As a result, we think that the risks for Italian bond yields are skewed to the upside.</p> <p>The outcome prompted little reaction in financial markets. The euro\u2019s fall proved short-lived and the yield of 10-year Italian government bonds rose by just 10bp or so to around 2.0%. This is hardly surprising given that a \u201cNo\u201d vote and subsequent resignation by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had largely been discounted, and that the risk of an imminent Italian exit from the euro-zone remains very small.</p> <p>So what happens now? Despite doubling in recent months, the 10-year yield is not abnormally high and is a far cry from its level at the height of the euro-zone crisis in 2011. In fact, if anything, it \u2013 and the yields of other bonds \u2013 have been kept artificially low by the ECB\u2019s asset purchases in the past two years. So there is plenty of scope for it to climb as political events unfold against a backdrop of renewed economic stagnation and ongoing concerns about the country\u2019s banking sector...</p> <p>Admittedly, any substantial rise in the yield will probably depend on a snap election being called, which would give the anti-euro Five Star Movement (M5S) an opportunity to seize power. While we doubt there will be an early election, we cannot rule out the possibility altogether...</p> <p>Granted, the euro-zone authorities are far better equipped to deal with upward pressure on yields today than they were back in 2011/12. However, such support would probably be conditional on certain commitments being made by the Italian government, especially regarding continued membership of the monetary union. This would be a difficult condition to satisfy if M5S, potentially along with eurosceptic allies in other political parties, were to form a government and pledge to hold a referendum on euro membership. So in this case, we think Italian bond yields would surge.</p> <p>Even if the \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d for bonds came to pass \u2013 where a new Prime Minister were asked to head the existing government relatively quickly and an early election were avoided \u2013 we expect that it would only provide temporary respite for Italy\u2019s bond market given the country\u2019s troubles. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5845926fe4b056d3d56ad988\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T16:16:10.397Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The market may not have gone into meltdown after the Italian vote, but there could be some weakness ahead, not least because of the latest European Central Bank meeting later this week. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They came, they saw and they voted. Italy\u2019s decision to reject Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms has not produced the feared apocalypse in global markets. Instead, we have seen European markets trade in positive territory, aside of course from the Italian index, which is still under pressure thanks to its embattled banking sector.</p> <p>Europe\u2019s bounce today definitely has the \u2018relief rally\u2019 feeling to it, so in the face of a rising euro and pre-ECB nerves it will be interesting to see whether gains can be sustained in coming sessions. No-one really expected Brexit or Trump, but here the result was priced in, and as a result we may well have to endure some extended weakness now that the initial excitement is out of the way.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58458833e4b015a427f77bea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T15:32:37.313Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with Italy, and Reuters is reporting the fate of struggling Monte dei Paschi may not be known for a few days yet:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/805795943543173120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Decision On Monte Paschi&#39;s Recapitalisation Plan To Be Taken In 3-4 Days After Political Situation Becomes Clearer \u2013 RTRS Sources</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/805795943543173120\">December 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Potential investors in the bank\u2019s cash call are reportedly waiting to see the political developments before making any commitments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T16:17:58.386Z\">at 4.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58458444e4b049350cc96196\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T15:14:23.954Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the ISM figures:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/econhedge/status/805789408645550080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">strong production and employment the standouts within a robust non-manuf ISM report <a href=\"https://t.co/JqzSVclS7T\">pic.twitter.com/JqzSVclS7T</a></p>&mdash; econhedge (@econhedge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/econhedge/status/805789408645550080\">December 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58458233e4b049350cc96189\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T15:06:56.759Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The US data is likely to increase speculation of an interest rate rise next week.

But the defeat worsens the problems of Italy\u2019s banking system, and particularly of its shakiest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the country\u2019s third-largest. The government has solicited institutional investors to recapitalise MPS, but many had made investment conditional on a Yes vote. Some will see the result as proof that Italy is incapable of reform, and may pull back. </p> <p>Italy could soon face an agonising choice between three options. One would be to nationalise MPS. The second would be to rescue it under new European Union rules that would heap losses on to investors, among them retail investors who hold most of MPS\u2019s subordinated debt. Or, faced with the prospect of having to impoverish these voters, the government might simply decide to break the rules, whatever the cost to the credibility of the single currency and its nascent banking union.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/john_hooper/status/805746567210745859\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My take on a &quot;mortifying&quot; defeat for Matteo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Renzi?src=hash\">#Renzi</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZTNMmzFYyW\">https://t.co/ZTNMmzFYyW</a></p>&mdash; John Hooper (@john_hooper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/john_hooper/status/805746567210745859\">December 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58455d74e4b056d3d56ad86c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-05T12:33:13.730Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1eef2910e565b8328f14b4dd6d4a01af17dcb9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1eef2910e565b8328f14b4dd6d4a01af17dcb9c5/0_0_3668_2679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President of Eurogroup, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Italy\u2019s referendum result isn\u2019t the trigger for a new eurozone crisis, insists Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem.</strong></p> <p>Arriving in Brussels to chair today\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance chiefs, Dijsselbloem told reporters in Brussels that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it is (the start of a new crisis).

There were celebrations as Italians took possession of the new euro notes and coins that became legal tender as the clocks struck midnight. But hopes that the advent of the single currency would provide a fresh start for Italy\u2019s economy were misplaced. The growth performance of the eurozone as a whole has been poor, but Italy\u2019s has been dismal. Greece and Spain at least had booms before their painful busts; Germany and France have managed to claw back the ground lost in the deep recession of 2008-09. But national output per head in Italy is only 4% higher than it was 15 years ago. The economy is still smaller than it was in 2008. Unemployment is at 11.6%, labour market participation is low, and its birthrate in 2014 was the lowest since the modern Italian state was founded in 1861. If there was a contest for the unwanted title of the sick man of Europe in the 21st century, Italy would walk it. The eurozone\u2019s third biggest economy has one central problem: the goods and services it produces are more expensive than those of its rivals. This lack of competitiveness means that it has suffered the biggest drop in export market share of any developed country. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector has traditionally been dominated by small companies, many of them family-owned. These businesses have been reluctant to invest, poor at innovation, and were slow to take advantage of the the new information technology when it came on stream in the 1990s. Productivity has increased less rapidly than in Germany or France. Secondly, Italy has tended to specialise in low-cost manufactured goods, a segment of the global economy that has been dominated by China since it gained membership of the World Trade Organisation in 2001. Italy\u2019s competitiveness problem is not new. Since the second world war, it has tended to have higher costs and higher inflation than rival countries. But up until it joined the euro, Italy was able to restore competitiveness by devaluing the lire, which made exports cheaper. With that option no longer available, Matteo Renzi has been trying a different approach: structural reforms of Italy\u2019s labour market. These, though, have proved unpopular, and explain why Renzi\u2019s constitutional changes were heavily defeated in the referendum.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rescue deal for the world\u2019s oldest bank \u2013 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena \u2013 hung in the balance on Monday after Italian voters rejected constitutional changes and plunged the government into crisis. Shares in MPS, which was founded in 1472 , fell amid fears the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will affect its attempts to clinch a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) lifeline from investors. The shares plunged 10% initially before ending the day 4% lower while shares in other major Italian lenders were also lower amid speculation that the Italian government might have to prop up MPS. As the news emerged of Renzi\u2019s defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform, there was a sharp drop in the euro and a rise in the cost of borrowing for Italian government. But after the initial reaction the euro recovered to touch its highest level against the dollar since November and Italian bond yields were also little changed. The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, arriving in Brussels for a meeting of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, called for calm. \u201cItaly is a large economy, one of the largest in Europe, it has strong institutions. You can see that market reaction so far has been moderate,\u201d said Dijsselbloem. The market\u2019s focus was largely on MPS, which is also Italy\u2019s third largest bank, where concerns were raised during the stress tests on the sector by the European Banking Authority in July. The bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 European institutions subjected to the annual assessment. A consortium led by the Wall Street bank JP Morgan was meeting to discuss the fundraising but unlikely to make any formal decision for a few days to test the political backdrop after Renzi\u2019s resignation. There were also reports that MSP bank officials are meeting representatives from the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 the gulf state\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to try to secure backing. Even so, there are expectations that the Italian government will need to step in, despite new EU rules which prevent state aid unless bondholders have been forced to take losses. Alberto Chiandetti, a manager at the Fidelity European Opportunities and Fidelity Funds Italy investment funds, said: \u201cThe focus is on whether an anchor investor will materialise or not. If not, Monte Paschi needs a plan B and in that scenario, bank shares are likely to suffer most. We should know [on Monday] whether such an anchor investor exists for Monte Paschi.\u201d The prospects of a capital injection for MPS being found entirely from private investors appeared to be receding, analysts said. \u201cI think a precautionary recapitalisation is ultimately still probable as a private sector-only solution is now highly unlikely to work,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of consultancy Eurasia Group. Renzi has been credited with helping to create a backstop fund \u2013 known as Atlante \u2013 for a banking industry that has \u20ac360bn of bad debts and is highly fragmented with more than 500 lenders. Technically, the state can intervene only once bondholders \u2013 which in the case of Italy would include savers - have taken losses. However, in uncertain circumstances the government can step in. There are also suggestions that a compensation scheme could be set up for retail bondholders forced to take losses. Markets are also looking to next week when Italy\u2019s largest bank, UniCredit, is scheduled to meet investors in London to discuss its strategy. The meeting on 13 December has prompted speculation it is readying a multibillion-euro cash call. UniCredit was ranked fifth weakest in the European bank stress tests. Chiandetti said: \u201cCurrently rumoured to be around \u20ac10bn to \u20ac13bn, the amount should be disclosed at the UniCredit capital market day. A difficult environment for Italian banks will no doubt weigh on this upcoming deal and put pressure on UniCredit shares.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy looks on course for a solid finish to the year after a closely watched business survey for last month smashed expectations, although worries about inflation and political uncertainty are making firms nervous about 2017. Companies in the UK\u2019s services sector, which spans banking to hotels, enjoyed the fastest growth in activity since January as they continued to recover from a short, sharp downturn following the Brexit vote. The report chimed with other indicators suggesting businesses and consumers have shrugged off the referendum result for now. The headline reading on the Markit/CIPS UK services PMI [pdf] rose to 55.2 in November from 54.5 the month before. That beat economists\u2019 forecasts for it to ease to 54.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. The index has now been above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for four months running. The services poll follows Markit\u2019s reports on the smaller construction and manufacturing sectors last week. The survey compilers said all the readings together suggested the economy was on course to grow 0.5% in the final three months of the year, matching the pace of growth in the third and defying economists\u2019 post-referendum warnings of a sharp slowdown. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, commented: \u201cThe further upturn in the vast services sector shows that the pace of UK economic growth remains resiliently robust in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. \u201cThe three PMI surveys collectively indicate that the economy will grow by 0.5% in the fourth quarter.\u201d The report, which covers most of the services sector but not retailers, showed employment growth picked up to the fastest pace since April as new business continued to rise, helped in part by overseas demand thanks to the weak pound. Sterling\u2019s sharp fall since the EU referendum in June has made UK goods and services cheaper in overseas markets. The flipside of the weak pound for businesses is higher import costs, with services companies reporting pressures from higher food and fuel costs and pricier business travel. Input price inflation remained sharp in November despite easing for the first time since May, and there was a similar trend for prices charged by service providers. Those inflationary pressures combined with political uncertainty to knock business sentiment, which weakened for the first time since July, according to the poll. Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the race for the US presidency on an anti-globalisation platform was also a factor weighing on business mood, the report said. David Noble at the survey\u2019s co-publishers, the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (Cips), said: \u201cThe ongoing battle with currency fluctuations, a weak pound and the impact of inflation will continue to undermine company profits. \u201cThe silent undercurrent of uncertainty also dampened the mood compared to last month, as business sentiment was at its lowest since July and the second-lowest since December 2012. This reveals how the result of the EU referendum vote, and now the recent US election, continues to have an impact on future business expectations.\u201d With signs that the economy has remained resilient since June\u2019s vote and that inflation has not jumped higher so far, the Bank of England has signalled it is in a holding pattern on interest rates. It cut borrowing costs to a new record low of 0.25% in August to shore up confidence and had hinted at another cut before Christmas but recently rowed back from that guidance as the economic news continued to beat expectations.",

A total of 184,101 vehicles were registered in November, a rise of 2.9% from a year earlier, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. So far this year, more than 2.5m new cars were registered \u2013 a record for the 11-month period. A 5.1% increase in fleet car registrations fuelled growth as sales to private buyers fell 1.2%, repeating a trend that took hold eight months ago.

Venters said the retailer had recorded an increase in overseas hamper orders this year as wealthy food-lovers cash in on the weak pound. The company, founded in 1707 and best known for its flagship store in Piccadilly, central London, said an overall 17% increase in hamper sales had contributed to another record financial performance, with pre-tax profit up by 27% to \u00a36.2m in the year to July. Sales increased by 12% to \u00a398.7m. Fortnum\u2019s, which holds two royal warrants, is owned by the Weston family, which has a majority stake in Associated British Foods. Venters said the retailer was anticipating a successful Christmas trading period, but there would be \u201cno hiding\u201d from food price inflation in the new year, with manufacturers seeking increases of between 5% and 10%. Fortnum\u2019s deals with 1,000 UK suppliers and Venters said they had all been affected by the decrease in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote.",

The bailed-out bank has reached agreement with three out of five groups which brought the claims, worth about \u00a34bn, over the rights issue which took place before its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. The groups represent 77% of the claims by value and the bank said it would aim to reach a deal with the remaining two. In total, it has set aside \u00a3800m to settle the claims. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, has been trying to tackle these so-called legacy issues. The bank also faces a penalty of up to \u00a38bn from the US authorities over the way it sold mortgage bonds a decade ago. The bank, which is not admitting liability, last week failed its annual health check from the Bank of England. Uncertainty about such matters is one reason the bank struggled in last week\u2019s stress tests. \u201cWe have been very clear that we wanted to deal with as many of our legacy litigation issues as possible during 2015 and 2016. We are pleased to have reached this agreement and hope that it will be accepted by the remaining claimant groups so that this long course of complex and costly litigation can now be concluded,\u201d said McEwan. A trial date has been set for March 2017. One group which represents 27,000 shareholders is suing Fred Goodwin, who was chief executive of RBS at the time of its taxpayer bailout, and three of the bank\u2019s former executives. The group said: \u201cWe were only informed of this settlement at the end of last week. At the moment we are considering the issues and the implications.\u201d In August, RBS set aside \u00a3700m for the case after an attempt at mediation in July failed. It said the \u00a3800m would be covered from its existing provisions. The bank is 73% owned by taxpayers and the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, has admitted that any attempts to reduce the stake is not possible because of the litigation problems and issues over selling off 300 branches. Clive Zietman, partner and head of commercial litigation at Stewarts Law, said: \u201cThe case brought by our clients against RBS arising from the April 2008 rights issue has settled. \u201cRBS will pay up to \u00a3800m to the various shareholder groups. The litigation, in which we act for more than 300 institutional investors, was due to go to a six-month trial starting in March 2017. We are unable to comment further at this stage.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The euro has fallen to a 20-month low against the dollar and investors fled riskier assets after Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign on Monday following a crushing defeat on constitutional reform. Renzi\u2019s defeat threatens to undermine efforts to stabilise the country\u2019s shaky banking system and deals a wider body blow to the European Union, which is already reeling under anti-establishment anger in the wake of June\u2019s Brexit vote. The single currency, which opened at around $1.0685, slumped as much as 1.4% to $1.0505, its lowest since March 2015, before recovering a bit to $1.0539. The drop to its session low was the sharpest since June and could pave the way for further falls when European trading gets under way later on Monday. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets in Sydney argued that, based on what happened in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, the risk of a eurozone crisis could see the euro trade as low as $0.8000. \u201cIt may sound extreme, but if a second euro zone crisis were to hit, with the US dollar at a much stronger starting point, the euro could arguably trade lower still,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not very hard to see a new election, and it\u2019s not very hard to see the [opposition] 5-Star Movement taking power and they\u2019ve basically said they want to get out of either the European Union or the euro or both,\u201d said Mark Wills, head of State Street Global Advisors\u2019 investment solutions group for the Asia Pacific. Against the pound, the common currency slipped 0.76% with one euro buying 83p. The euro slid as much as 2.1% to 118.71 yen, but pared some of the losses to trade down 1.2% at 119.73 yen. Some observers focused on the more immediate impact of the result on efforts to contain the growing crisis in the country\u2019s banking system, especially the debt-ridden Monte dei Paschi bank, amid an expected spike in Italian borrowing costs. \u201cThe \u2018no\u2019 vote was priced in to a certain extent in advance. So I do not expect a freefall in the euro in the near term,\u201d said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in Tokyo. \u201cIn the long run, this will delay progress in Italy\u2019s efforts to get rid of banks\u2019 bad debt and is likely to widen the yield spread of German and Italian bonds,\u201d he added, a development which would make it much more expensive for Italian banks to raise much-needed capital. European shares are likely to be sold off along with Italian bonds when trading opens in Europe on Monday. Futures trading indicated that the FTSE100 would fall around 0.6% and the Dow Jones average would dip about 0.2% on the open in New York. Stock markets in Asia dipped following news of the referendum result. Japan\u2019s Nikkei slid 0.7% and the Sydney markey slumped 0.65%. Korea was down 0.21% and the Hang Seng was off 0.36%. Renzi\u2019s resignation represents a fresh blow to the European Union, which is struggling to overcome a raft of crises, and was eager for Renzi to continue his reform push in the euro zone\u2019s heavily indebted third-largest economy. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets in Sydney argued that, based on what happened in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, the risk of a eurozone crisis could see the euro trade as low as $0.8000. \u201cIt may sound extreme, but if a second euro zone crisis were to hit, with the US dollar at a much stronger starting point, the euro could arguably trade lower still,\u201d they wrote. Markets had earlier taken some encouragement when Austria\u2019s far-right presidential candidate was soundly defeated by a pro-European contender, confounding forecasts of a tight election. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday amid much speculation it will announce a six-month extension of its asset buying program and widen the type of bonds it can purchase. \u201cThere has been some speculation that the ECB would step and front load purchases of Italian bonds if markets became unsettled by a No result, so perhaps it is the thoughts of a central bank liquidity sugar pill driving things again,\u201d said ANZ economist Jo Masters.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government has hit back at suggestions it is responsible for Australia\u2019s high domestic gas prices and has rejected claims by the industry minister, Greg Hunt, that the state has banned new projects. Hunt is reportedly due to meet with top energy executives in Melbourne on Monday to discuss the price spike and supply shortages on the domestic gas market. The meeting \u2013 which will involve major producers Santos, Origin, Shell and Esso \u2013 will put pressure on Victorian and NSW governments to allow more onshore gas exploration and development, according to News Corp. Hunt has repeatedly blamed Australia\u2019s the problem on the two states, saying their moratoriums on CSG exploration and development were restricting supply, despite analysts pointing out that price rises are being driven by the booming LNG export market rather than lack of supply. NSW has reduced the land covered by exploration licences and applications from more than 60% to less than 7%. But the NSW energy minister, Anthony Roberts, rejected the federal government\u2019s assertion that the state had banned new gas exploration and development. Roberts said Santos was currently exploring for gas near Narrabri, a project that, if approved, could provide half the state\u2019s gas supply. \u201cThe NSW government does not have a ban, we have a plan,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cOur NSW gas plan, released in November 2014, set out the government\u2019s plan to pause, reset and recommence gas exploration on our terms.\u201d Victoria has a moratorium until June 2020 and has introduced a bill to ban further onshore unconventional gas, exploration and development. The Victorian resources minister, Wade Noonan, said the Australian energy market operator had found there would be no shortfall in Victoria for at least the next 20 years. \u201cVictoria produces more gas than is required for local demand through production from offshore gas resources in Bass Strait,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cRemaining supplies are exported to other states.\u201d Researchers, meanwhile, say the government knew the risks of the current gas shortages years ago. Melbourne University\u2019s chair of geology, Mike Sandiford, who has studied Australia\u2019s gas market extensively, said supply had actually tripled in recent years, largely due to new LNG projects in Queensland. Sandiford said the root of the problem lay in the market\u2019s transition to one of increasing export commitments. He said suppliers had signed export contracts that they were unable to meet and had diverted domestic supply to compensate. \u201cThere is a shortage at the moment but the shortage comes at a time when we\u2019ve essentially tripled the supply on the east coast,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cSo that itself is a bit of a conundrum; how can you get a shortage when you\u2019ve tripled the supply? \u201cWell, you sign export contracts and you can\u2019t easily fulfil, just as the department of industry foreshadowed in its 2013 eastern Australian gas markets study\u201d. That study warned three years ago that a transition toward increased LNG exports risked creating domestic shortages. The report warned that exporters could divert domestic supply to meet their overseas commitments. \u201cThe timely development of gas resources will be important to ensure that supply is available for domestic gas users and to meet LNG export commitments,\u201d the report warned. \u201cSuch is the scale of the LNG projects that even small deviations from the CSG reserve development schedule could result in significant volumes of gas being sourced from traditional domestic market supplies.\u201d Sandiford said the government should have done more to ease the impact of the transition period on the domestic market.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 300 people rallied in Melbourne on Monday to protest against a proposed $1bn federal government loan to Adani for a rail line before an expected meeting in the city between Malcolm Turnbull and the head of the Indian mining company, Gautam Adani. Adani and Turnbull were expected to meet on the sidelines of the Australian Indian Leadership Dialogue in Melbourne, which they are both scheduled to attend. The minister for northern Australia, Matt Canavan, confirmed the federal government was considering lending $1bn toward the construction of a 310km rail line from the proposed Galilee Basin coalmine to the port. The potential funding deal was reported on Saturday. Canavan told the ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast that the proposal was currently before the independent panel of the National Australia Infrastructure Fund (NAIF), which makes recommendations to government on how the $5bn fund should be spent. Canavan said there was \u201cno decision to be made by the federal government at this stage\u201d but that it would not be unusual for it to support mining infrastructure. He said progress on the proposed mine was \u201cgood news for our country\u201d. \u201cIt is a major project, it will be the first time a new minerals basin has opened up for 40 years, and this has the potential to be the platform for many other projects in our region as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have some of the highest-quality coal in the world, so providing India with its energy needs from Australian coal is good for the environment because it burns at a higher rate and produces less emissions per kilowatt hour produced.\u201d The Galilee Basin is the largest untapped coal reserve in Australia but the coal is lower quality. Six companies, of which Adani is the largest, have sought permits to develop the basin, despite warnings from scientists and conservationists that it could damage the already fragile Great Barrier Reef. A recent report said mining Australia\u2019s untapped coal reserves, including the Galilee Basin, could produce enough emissions to push global warming beyond 2C. Canavan dismissed concerns about the quality of the coal, saying it was higher quality than coal being mined in Indonesia and South Africa, India\u2019s two other options for cheap fuel. India, he said, was \u201cagnostic\u201d about where the coal came from. The Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s campaign director, Paul Sinclair, said at the protest in Melbourne\u2019s Treasury Gardens that committing any funding toward the project would break the Turnbull government\u2019s election promise. \u201cMalcolm Turnbull has a very clear choice to make,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cHe made an iron-clad promise during the election campaign, which he can honour, or he can make a dirty deal with a billionaire polluter and bankroll coal.\u201d Behind him, the crowd chanted \u201creef not coal.\u201d Sinclair said Canavan\u2019s comments about the relative quality of the coal was misleading and accused the government of trying to drum up public support by leaking the NAIF proposal. \u201cI think that the government is in fairyland when they say coal is good for the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying smoking is good for your health.\u201d Charlie Wood, campaign director for 350.org, said the suggestion of any federal funding for Adani\u2019s project was \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that the government is putting the big polluters ahead of the people they are here to represent,\u201d Wood said. \u201cHere we are outside while Gautam Adani, the head of one of the biggest coal companies in the world, is meeting with our prime minister ... has that level of access. This is outrageous.\u201d Behind Wood, two masked protesters showing Turnbull as a puppet being controlled by Adani tried not to crash into the crowd. Among the protesters was Mary Beech, who told Guardian Australia she began fighting to save the reef to honour her parents, who moved to northern Queensland after the second world war. \u201cIt is 30 years ago tomorrow that my mother died,\u201d Beech said. \u201cAt the funeral she didn\u2019t want flowers, all the money went toward saving the reef and saving the Daintree \u2026 I\u2019m so against the government using taxpayers money to fund this dirty, dirty coalmine.\u201d India, she said, could meet its energy needs elsewhere. \u201cIf it wants its coal that badly it can get it from somewhere else,\u201d she said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of restaurant businesses in Britain could go bust because the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote has sharply raised the cost of imported food and wine, an accountancy firm has warned. Moore Stephens says that 5,570 restaurant businesses have at least a 30% chance of insolvency in the next three years, due to inflationary pressures and stagnating disposable incomes. The UK imports 48% of its food, according to government figures, and many restaurants rely heavily on imported food and wine. The cost of labour has also gone up, after the government raised the national minimum wage from \u00a36.70 to \u00a37.20 in April, with a further rise to \u00a37.50 to take place next April. The restaurant sector is fiercely competitive, with 200 new restaurants opening in London last year alone. This gives consumers a lot of choice and forces restaurants to cut prices or come up with special offers. Many diners are also suffering from flatlining disposable incomes \u2013 the amount households have left to spend after tax and bills have been paid. The average gross disposable household income increased just 0.5% over the last year, from \u00a317,872 to \u00a317,965, Moore Stephens said, quoting official data. Even some of the biggest restaurant companies are struggling. For example, The Restaurant Group is closing 33 outlets across the UK, including 14 Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and 11 Chiquito branches. It also plans to close its flagship Garfunkels restaurant on the Strand in London. The company, which also owns Coast to Coast, has blamed its poor performance on unpopular new menus, higher prices and poor customer service, and vowed to listen more to its customers. The business\u2019s new chair Debbie Hewitt, who took over in March as part of a boardroom shake-out, has said the drop in the value of the pound following the referendum would push up the price of imported food next year but added that the company cannot afford to pass this on to customers. There have been a growing number of warnings over dearer food prices, from Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket, Tesco, and others, and the impact on poor families. The Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and City economists all believe that inflation will rise to at least 3% by the end of next year, from 0.9% in October. Mike Finch, restructuring partner at Moore Stephens, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year for many restaurants in the face of rising costs and fierce competition. It is unrealistic to expect UK restaurant groups to avoid the impact of the fall in the pound by substituting for UK produce \u2013 they are going to face a big hit. Restaurants have to make tough decisions as to how much they try to pass on to consumers; too much and they risk losing business, too little and they lose margin.\u201d He said that sterling\u2019s wild swings in the currency markets had hit small and medium-sized restaurant businesses particularly hard as they operate on tighter budgets and are less likely to negotiate long-term supply contracts. All this comes at a time when many consumers are likely to be very price conscious. \u201cThe high number of potential insolvencies over the next year shows just how fragile finances can be in this sector and demonstrates the importance of careful financial management,\u201d Finch added. \u201cThere may be further challenges to come as the UK\u2019s trading agreements with Europe remain uncertain. Many in the restaurant industry would consider the idea of additional import tariffs on foodstuffs with horror.\u201d A separate report showed the strain many UK consumers are under. The number of those who have taken on more debt over the last five years has risen to 37% from 27% a year ago. The findings come from a survey of 2,008 consumers with debt, including 804 defaulters who have fallen behind with payments, by FTSE 250-listed Arrow Global, which buys and manages debt portfolios. The most common form of personal debt is credit cards that are not paid off in full every month. The fact that credit cards have overtaken mortgages as the most frequent form of debt, alongside an increase in overdraft borrowing, suggests that the nation\u2019s habits have changed to favour short-term borrowing. More people than ever are renting as they cannot afford to buy a home. Almost half of borrowers (48%) have a credit card which is not cleared in full each month, compared with 39% a year ago. Almost a third have an overdraft, up from 23%, while the number of those with a mortgage has fallen to 42% from 46%. One in 10 debt defaulters who fall behind on repayments never catch up. The latest Bank of England figures showed credit-card borrowing reached an all-time high of \u00a366.2bn in October. Arrow Global has arranged an industry roundtable this Friday to discuss what the industry can do to support debt defaulters. Tom Drury, the firm\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cConsumer credit is vital for the smooth-functioning of the economy, but it is clear that British consumers are taking on a heavy debt burden at the moment that is not going to be sustainable for some. \u201cThe low interest rate environment means that debt is cheap, but that doesn\u2019t help consumers who have struggled with their monthly budgeting or suffered from a shock event like losing their job. When borrowers do fall behind on repayments, it is vital that they get all the support they need to rehabilitate their debt.\u201d",

Its report deplores that the \u201cexploitation of agency staff remains unaddressed,\u201d while the treatment of staff on zero-hours contracts at places like the Sports Direct warehouse in Shirebrook has made headlines and prompted changes. Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile zero-hours contracts are often in the news, agency workers are the \u2018forgotten face\u2019 of the modern workforce, despite being just as prevalent across the labour market. This fast growing group is not just made up of young people looking for temporary employment as some have suggested, but instead includes many older full-time, permanent workers.\u201d Agency work is booming, but it means an average pay penalty of 22p an hour, equivalent to \u00a3430 a year for those working full-time, according to the report, entitled Secret Agents: agency workers in the new world of work. The loss of earnings rises to 45p an hour for permanent agency workers. Agency workers also lack basic employment rights: they are not entitled to sick pay or parental leave pay, have no notice period and little recourse in the event of dismissal. Despite the stereotype of agency workers being short term and temporary, half of all agency workers say they work on a permanent basis and three-quarters work full time. The number of office temps, bank nurses, fruit pickers, IT consultants and other agency staff has grown by 30%, or 200,000 people, to 865,000 since 2011 and is set to swell to a million by the end of the decade, according to the independent thinktank\u2019s analysis of Labour Force survey data. That data shows that: The number of temporary agency workers providing holiday cover, Christmas temps and seasonal agricultural workers has risen to a 25-year high of around 340,000. The foundation has also identified 440,000 permanent agency workers; a further 66,000 who are officially self-employed; and 20,000 who are agency workers in their second jobs. Over the last 18 months, 14% of agency workers were also employed on zero-hours contracts. The foundation acknowledges that there are good reasons for some employers and workers to use agencies \u2013 namely flexibility, variety and absence of bureaucracy \u2013 but warns that many do it out of necessity rather than choice. More than 60% of temporary agency workers would prefer to be in a permanent role. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady believes many agency workers are getting an unfair deal. \u201cAgency workers don\u2019t deserve to be treated like second-class citizens. But they are often paid less than their permanent colleagues, even when they do exactly the same job,\u201d says O\u2019Grady. \u201cWe need the government to toughen the law to create a level playing field for agency workers. Too many employers are getting away with treating them unfairly.\u201d Agency work is most prevalent in the healthcare and social sector, where 18% of all agency staff work, closely followed by manufacturing (17%) and business activities (17%). The latter includes conference organisers, credit rating agents, business consultants and literary agents. Nearly one in five agency workers are in London, but the East Midlands has the largest share of the local labour force working in this way (3.2%). While 54% of all agency workers are male \u2013 the same gender split as for overall employment \u2013 women account for 85% of the growth in the number of temporary agency staff in the last five years. In October, the parliamentary business, energy and industrial strategy committee launched an inquiry into the rapidly changing nature of work, agency workers, the self-employed, and those working in the \u201dgig economy\u201d. It comes after its inquiry into working practices at Sports Direct, news stories about the use of agency staff at Asos, concerns about couriers at Hermes and growing questions about the status of those working in the \u2018on-demand\u2019 economy for businesses such as Uber and Deliveroo. Judge said: \u201cIt is important that the discussion of the non-traditional parts of work in modern Britain consider the relatively lower pay that agency workers receive compared to identical employees in similar jobs. This merits serious examination from government, with an official measure of agency workers being a good place to start.\u201d Agency workers defy stereotypes: many work in high-end industries such as IT consultants, and the majority are not low-skilled migrants, stay-at-home mums or students as is often thought. However, the research also found that agency workers are disproportionately drawn from ethnic and other minorities and are more concentrated in low-paid industries and lower-skilled jobs. The TUC highlighted the growing use of the loophole known as the Swedish derogation. This loophole allows agency workers placed with companies to be paid less than direct employees, provided the agency agrees to continue paying them for at least four weeks at times when it is unable to find them work. Agency workers are more likely to be younger and less qualified than the rest of the workforce, and four out of five are white. However, 8% of all black and African Caribbean workers in the UK are agency staff, even though they only make up 2.7% of the overall workforce. Six in 10 agency workers are UK nationals, compared to more than eight in 10 in the overall workforce. EU nationals account for 22% of agency workers while people from the rest of the world make up 17%. Ethnic minorities are three times more likely to be agency workers than white workers.",
