      "bodyText": "The spiralling cost of bailing out Spain's fourth largest bank, Bankia, rose further on Thursday night after sources close to the bank said it would ask for more than \u20ac15bn (\u00a312bn) from the government on Friday. Bankia, partially nationalised by the government earlier this month, is the weak spot in Spain's fragile banking system where loan losses stemming from a 2008 property crash threaten to push the country into seeking international assistance. \"The help needed to clean up the bank will be more than \u20ac15bn,\" one source told Reuters. Other reports spoke of \u20ac14bn. Finance minister Luis De Guindos had told parliament on Wednesday that Bankia needed an injection of at least \u20ac9bn. Two weeks ago, the bank received a \u20ac4.5bn loan that the state turned into a 45% shareholding in Bankia's parent company, BFA. That move gave the state control over BFA and Bankia, setting up a nationalised bank that some observers predict could absorb other troubled Spanish savings banks. Spanish authorities have always claimed to be giving minimum figures for Bankia's needs, but the latest figures came amid reports of strong disagreements between the government and the bank about how much it would receive. Bankia called off a board meeting on Wednesday after failing to reach agreement with the finance ministry. The bank is a symbol of the increasingly fragility of Spain's banking system, which has failed to digest losses produced by a 2008 housing bust. Spain's banking sector is now seen as the biggest threat to the euro currency after Greece. Loans to property developers are the biggest problem, with Bankia and other former savings banks laden by toxic assets that include unsold housing developments and worthless building land. Many of those loans have been refinanced in order to save the banks from admitting to the losses. The government has ordered the banks to set aside an extra \u20ac82bn against loans to developers. Some banks will be unable to cover the new provisions and the government already expects to inject up to \u20ac15bn to help them. But with lenders demanding ever higher interest rates for Spanish debt, the cost of refinancing might prove too much for the government. Analysts believe a further \u20ac50bn-100bn is needed to protect Spanish banks against upcoming mortgage defaults and bad loans to small- and medium-sized businesses as the country heads back into a double dip recession. Spain's recession, driven deeper by government austerity measures to cut the deficit, is expected to last well into next year, with 24% unemployment also set to grow. The European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund will oversee an external audit of Spain's banks aimed at putting a definitive number on how much money is needed to shore up banks. An increasing number of analysts believe Spain cannot do that alone, and that the European Stability Mechanism will eventually have to bail out Spain's banks.",

But nothing came of any of these.</p> <p>\"The collapse of the group left tens of thousands of Farepak savers, whose socio-economic profile meant they were drawn from some of the most financially vulnerable members of society, out of pocket for Christmas 2006 and with no prospect of obtaining either vouchers for Christmas 2006 or any immediate distribution in relation to their claims as unsecured creditors.\"</p> <p>Davis-White indicated that Farepak might not have collapsed if its funds had not been \"swept up every night to EHR [Farepak's parent company, European Home Retail]\". At the time of the collapse, Farepak was owed \u00a335m by EHR, which was chaired by Thompson. EHR also collapsed.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith, described Farepak's business model as a \"helpful arrangement where they get the money 12 months in advance\".</p> <p>Neil Gillis, a former chief executive of Blacks Leisure, and five other directors, are also facing the threat of being banned from standing as company directors for between two and 15 years.

Lawyers acting for the business secretary, Vince Cable, called on the high court to ban the former Farepak bosses from being company directors for up to 15 years. Malcolm Davis-White QC, for the Insolvency Service, part of the business department, said Farepak's former bosses, including Sir Clive Thompson, a former president of the CBI and chief executive of Rentokil, had taken \"unreasonable risk\" with prudent savers' money. Davis-White said Farepak was still accepting \"about \u00a31m a week\" from customers on low incomes right up until its collapse in October 2006 even though the company had \"identified a risk\" that it might not have enough cash to pay its suppliers as far back as November 2005. \"With alarming cashflow projections available from early April 2006 warning of a lack of sufficient cash in the group from October 2006 onwards, various unsuccessful attempts were made by the group to find a solution to the funding crisis,\" Davis-White said. \"Throughout this period, savers' weekly payments (amounting by October to \u00a32m per week) continued to be collected by Farepak and swept up daily into the group account, unprotected by any trust account or similar arrangement.\" Davis-White said Farepak's customers continued to scrape together their monthly payments to the scheme with no inkling of any serious risk to their savings, while the company's bosses were well aware of the risk of failure. \"The collapse did not come out of the blue,\" Davis-White told the high court on Thursday. \"Directors tried one possible means of raising finance after another. But nothing came of any of these. \"The collapse of the group left tens of thousands of Farepak savers, whose socio-economic profile meant they were drawn from some of the most financially vulnerable members of society, out of pocket for Christmas 2006 and with no prospect of obtaining either vouchers for Christmas 2006 or any immediate distribution in relation to their claims as unsecured creditors.\" Davis-White indicated that Farepak might not have collapsed if its funds had not been \"swept up every night to EHR [Farepak's parent company, European Home Retail]\". At the time of the collapse, Farepak was owed \u00a335m by EHR, which was chaired by Thompson. EHR also collapsed. The judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith, described Farepak's business model as a \"helpful arrangement where they get the money 12 months in advance\". Neil Gillis, a former chief executive of Blacks Leisure, and five other directors, are also facing the threat of being banned from standing as company directors for between two and 15 years. Two others have already agreed not to act as directors. Suzy Hall, a former Farepak saver who set up a campaign group, Unfairpak, said she was \"delighted\" that the legal proceedings had finally begun five and a half years after the collapse. \"We hope justice will finally be served in respect of 116,400 prudent Christmas savers who had \u00a330m taken from them and their Christmases ruined,\" she said.",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of fresh action to boost the flagging British economy loomed larger on Thursday after official figures showed a steeper fall in activity than previously thought and the crisis-hit eurozone drifted towards a deeper slump. Labour seized on data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing that gross domestic product declined by 0.3% in the first three months of 2012 as evidence that Britain is ill-prepared to withstand a deterioration in the rest of Europe over the coming months. The ONS had originally pencilled in a 0.2% drop in output for the first quarter but said that the downturn in the UK's construction sector was even more pronounced than it had previously projected. Britain's economy was 0.1% smaller at the end of the three months to March than it was a year earlier, the ONS added. A survey of business activity in the eurozone showed that the worsening of the debt crisis looks likely to have a marked impact on business activity. The purchasing managers' index \u2013 a forward-looking guide to sentiment in the manufacturing and service sectors \u2013 slid to a 35-month low of 45.9 in May, from 46.7 in April and 49.1 in March. Manufacturing was particularly weak, with activity contracting at the fastest rate for nearly three years while services activity shrank at the fastest rate for seven months. Meanwhile, a key measure of German business confidence \u2013 the Ifo index \u2013 revealed that fears about the break-up of the single currency are starting to cast a shadow over Europe's biggest economy. Business confidence fell from 109.9 to 106.9, reversing all its gains of the past five months. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said: \"It's now clear that this is a recession made in Downing Street by this government's failed policies. Despite all the problems in the euro area, France, Germany and the eurozone as a whole have so far avoided recession and only exports to other countries stopped us going into recession a year ago. The result is that Britain is now in a weaker position if things get worse in the eurozone in the coming months.\" According to the ONS, the downturn in the first quarter was of the same magnitude as the contraction in the final quarter of 2011, undermining hopes that the economy was moving towards recovery. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg suggested earlier this week that the coalition plans to expand its policy of credit easing, using government guarantees to kickstart spending on infrastructure and housing to boost the economy. According to the ONS, construction output declined by 4.8% in the first three months of the year, after a 0.2% decline in the fourth quarter of 2011, helping to explain the government's change of heart about pumping fresh cash into building projects. \"Over the past 18 months, the economy has experienced a mild contraction in output. This reflects global economic headwinds as well as domestic economic conditions such as the impact of continuing high rates of inflation in the UK,\" the ONS said. With the extra bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee expected to depress economic output in the second quarter of the year, as workers down tools and fire up their barbecues, analysts believe it will be autumn at the earliest before the UK emerges from recession. However, as Sir Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, has stressed, events in the eurozone, where leaders are battling to contain the impact of the political paralysis in Greece, present a major risk to the outlook in the weeks ahead. David Miles, the one member of the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) to vote for further quantitative easing this month, said: \"No one on the MPC feels comfortable with the prolonged and substantial overshoot of inflation above its target level. But that does not mean bringing inflation back to target very rapidly is the best thing to do. \"In a situation where weak demand is likely to be having a negative impact upon productive capacity, the cost of having a tighter monetary policy to bring inflation back to target fast will be some long-lasting damage to incomes.\" Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, described the growth figures as \"very disappointing\".",

The board is now considering introducing whether to introduce a replacement incentive scheme.</p> <p>The Aim-listed company, which on Thursday reported <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201205240700159871D\" title=\"\">a near-doubling of pre-tax profits to over \u00a330m</a>, is also beginning the search for a new chairman to replace Lord (Waheed) Alli, who is leaving after 12 years. Media entrepreneur Alli will remain until a successor is found.</p> <p>The valuation of the share awards is based on a price of \u00a316.55, after the stock jumped 8% following the release of the full-year profit figures.</p> <p>Robertson \u2013 whose 10% stake in the business is worth \u00a3140m \u2013 painted an upbeat picture for the future. \"We remain positive in our outlook for 2012-13 as we continue our journey to becoming the world's number one online fashion destination,\" said Robertson, who started the website in 2000.</p> <p>At the time the business was called As Seen On Screen, based on Robertson's idea to allow twentysomethings to copy the styles of their favourite celebrities. The company was listed in 2001 and has since evolved to offer a much wider range.</p> <p>Robertson said he remained motivated and the award of shares \"was not an issue\" as he could sell down his existing stake at any time. He is receiving the 1.5m shares after a <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201205240700299850D\" title=\"\">\"management incentive plan\" put in place in April 2009 </a>reached two targets based on rewards for shareholders: earnings per share, which grew by a compound annual rate of 42%, and total shareholder return. This target was based on a notional investment in all the companies in the FTSE All Share retailers' index and required Asos to be in the top decile relative to the index \u2013 which it was, with a return of 472%. During the same three-year period, its stock value has risen from \u00a3220m to \u00a31.4bn.</p> <p>Nick Beighton, the finance director, is receiving 730,000 shares worth approximately \u00a312m; Jon Kamaluddin, international director, will get about 610,000 shares worth about \u00a310m; and product director Robert Bready is receiving 788,000 shares worth around \u00a313m. The shares are being handed out in two tranches \u2013 the first on 30 September 2012 and the second on 30 September 2013 \u2013 and the company is applying to Aim to list the 4m shares required to meet the terms of the incentive plan.</p> <p>The company, which now has websites targeting seven countries including Britain, the US and Australia, has 8 million registered users and 4.4 million \"active\" customers in 160 countries to which it has shipped clothing and accessories in the last 12 months. Almost 70% of its web traffic \u2013 largely from 15-to-34-year-olds \u2013 is from outside Britain.</p> <p>Pre-tax profits rose 93% to \u00a330.3m; excluding exceptional items, they rose 43% to \u00a340m after a 49% rise in sales to \u00a3481m. Revenue was up 46% to \u00a3495m, and the goal is to achieve \u00a31bn in sales from five major markets by 2015.

      "bodyText": "Seven top managers of online fashion retailer Asos are being handed \u00a366m in shares after hitting all the targets in a three-year incentive plan. Chief executive and founder Nick Robertson is receiving almost 1.5m shares worth nearly \u00a325m while his three fellow directors are sharing more than \u00a335m, and a further \u00a36m is being handed to three senior colleagues. The board is now considering introducing whether to introduce a replacement incentive scheme. The Aim-listed company, which on Thursday reported a near-doubling of pre-tax profits to over \u00a330m, is also beginning the search for a new chairman to replace Lord (Waheed) Alli, who is leaving after 12 years. Media entrepreneur Alli will remain until a successor is found. The valuation of the share awards is based on a price of \u00a316.55, after the stock jumped 8% following the release of the full-year profit figures. Robertson \u2013 whose 10% stake in the business is worth \u00a3140m \u2013 painted an upbeat picture for the future. \"We remain positive in our outlook for 2012-13 as we continue our journey to becoming the world's number one online fashion destination,\" said Robertson, who started the website in 2000. At the time the business was called As Seen On Screen, based on Robertson's idea to allow twentysomethings to copy the styles of their favourite celebrities. The company was listed in 2001 and has since evolved to offer a much wider range. Robertson said he remained motivated and the award of shares \"was not an issue\" as he could sell down his existing stake at any time. He is receiving the 1.5m shares after a \"management incentive plan\" put in place in April 2009 reached two targets based on rewards for shareholders: earnings per share, which grew by a compound annual rate of 42%, and total shareholder return. This target was based on a notional investment in all the companies in the FTSE All Share retailers' index and required Asos to be in the top decile relative to the index \u2013 which it was, with a return of 472%. During the same three-year period, its stock value has risen from \u00a3220m to \u00a31.4bn. Nick Beighton, the finance director, is receiving 730,000 shares worth approximately \u00a312m; Jon Kamaluddin, international director, will get about 610,000 shares worth about \u00a310m; and product director Robert Bready is receiving 788,000 shares worth around \u00a313m. The shares are being handed out in two tranches \u2013 the first on 30 September 2012 and the second on 30 September 2013 \u2013 and the company is applying to Aim to list the 4m shares required to meet the terms of the incentive plan. The company, which now has websites targeting seven countries including Britain, the US and Australia, has 8 million registered users and 4.4 million \"active\" customers in 160 countries to which it has shipped clothing and accessories in the last 12 months. Almost 70% of its web traffic \u2013 largely from 15-to-34-year-olds \u2013 is from outside Britain. Pre-tax profits rose 93% to \u00a330.3m; excluding exceptional items, they rose 43% to \u00a340m after a 49% rise in sales to \u00a3481m. Revenue was up 46% to \u00a3495m, and the goal is to achieve \u00a31bn in sales from five major markets by 2015. Robertson said he was confident of achieving this target. \"The fact is it requires 27% compound growth over the next three years, which is a rate below what we've been achieving over the last 10 years,\" he said. The international business, which accounted for 59% of total sales compared with 43% a year ago, is now the fastest growing arm of the company with sales rising 103%, compared with 7% in the UK, where growth is expected to be flat in the coming year. The company is targeting countries such as Russia and China for growth in the coming months.

      "bodyText": "A debate over the merits of \"free\" banking was raging on Thursday after top banking regulator Andrew Bailey faced criticism after appearing to call for an end to non-fee paying current accounts to prevent mis-selling of financial products. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer body Which?, said it was a \"myth\" that banking was free. \"Consumers pay over \u00a39bn a year in fees and lost interest on their current accounts. The idea that if banks charged more, they would stop trying to mis-sell other financial products is completely unfounded,\" he said. Bailey is acting head of the body that is to become the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is to be set up in the Bank of England to oversee the banking industry, following the resignation of Hector Sants at the FSA. In a speech Bailey described himself as \"like a dog with a bone\" over the issue of free banking, which he said might encourage mis-selling of products because of the \"unclear picture\" over the price of the myraid of financial products being sold to consumers. Free banking refers to customers who remain in credit with their current accounts and who do not pay charges. \"It may require intervention in the public interest, not least because it is a way to encourage greater competition,\" Bailey said. The industry has been hit by the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal, thought to be costing the industry \u00a39bn after insurance was sold alongside personal loans and credit cards but rarely paid out. Lloyd used Bailey's remarks to call for the Financial Conduct Authority, the other regulatory body being set up by the coalition to become a \"watchdog that stands up for consumers and stands up to the banks\", while Labour called on the Treasury to resist calls for an end free banking. Shadow financial secretary Chris Leslie said: \"We need a regulator that stands up for ordinary bank account customers. The Treasury should send a strong signal that actively encouraging charges for current accounts would be unacceptable.\" \"Millions of ordinary bank account customers will be concerned by these comments from the government's new financial regulator, as they seem to suggest that the banks should be encouraged to charge customers for the privilege of in-credit current accounts,\" Leslie said. The term \"free banking\" provokes debate. The Treasury select committee's report of March 2011 concluded, for instance, that \"so-called free banking is not free\". It described the term free-in-credit banking as a misnomer and warned that \"it misleads the customer\". Mike O'Connor, chief executive of Consumer Focus, said the fact that banking \"isn't really free is one of our worst kept secrets\" and called for more transparency. \"Most people pay indirectly either through penalties or lost interest, depending on whether they are in the red or the black,\" said O'Connor. The British Bankers' Association intends to discuss Bailey's comments with him. BBA chief executive Angela Knight said: \"The UK is unique in its current free banking model: customers who keep their account in credit do not expect to pay anything extra for their normal banking services. In other countries, both in Europe and elsewhere, either customers pay a fixed amount each month or there is a levy depending on the number of transactions that they undertake, plus similar costs to the UK for additional services such as unarranged overdrafts\".",

      "bodyText": "Mothercare has posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a3102.9m as the maternity and children's clothing retailer warned of a \"tough\" UK market. The struggling chain is undergoing a sweeping \u00a335m overhaul that will see one-in-three of its UK stores closed and the loss of around 800 jobs. The majority of the losses were accounted for by a \u00a355m writedown relating to Mothercare's Early Learning Centre outlets, as well as \u00a326.4m hit from the store closure programme. The company was boosted by its overseas business, where it has over 1,000 stores in more than 50 countries, with worldwide network sales - UK sales, franchise revenues and international sales - rising 6.4% to \u00a31.2bn. However, the UK - which accounts for 45% of the business - dragged down performance with like-for-like sales falling by 6.2%. The annual loss compares with a profit of \u00a38.8m last year. Speaking in the wake of official figures that showed a 2.3% fall in sales on the UK high street last month, Mothercare's chief executive, Simon Calver, said: \"Overall the market in the UK still remains tough and the high street is tough. I don't think many of the economic fundamentals have changed.\" Mothercare plans to focus on out of town stores in its UK revamp, which will result in its UK portfolio reducing from 311 stores to a \"profitable core\" of 200 by March 2015 - dumping stores that lose \u00a313m a year collectively. The retailer will also focus on its own brand range and exclusive third party tie-ups. \"The key thing with this plan is that all the initiatives, especially in the early years, are about self-help,\" said Calver, referring to the store closure and cost-cutting programme, which will affect 730 store staff and 98 back office employees. Calver said Mothercare was suffering from its own version of the squeezed middle, caught in a pincer move between high-end retailers and low-cost competitors such as supermarkets. Admitting that Mothercare's pricing had given a foothold to supermarkers, Calver said a new lower cost range would be launched this summer. \"We need to ensure that we have the right pricing ... and focus on that. We have got a new range coming in July which will be double-digit reductions in prices for our customers.\" Calver, who took over as Mothercare boss this month, said UK customers viewed Mothercare as an \"incredible brand\" but the retailer did less well on the value-for-money issue. Analysts say Mothercare has been assailed by the cheap offers at supermarkets, the fashion appeal of specialist clothing outlets and the choice offered by the internet. Calver, formerly the boss of Lovefilm, said the company's out-of-town outlets would appeal to internet-savvy shoppers. \"We have seen the out of town stores continue to perform well ... it is a very important part of the portfolio especially if people are going online beforehand and want to see the stores to test and experience [products] themselves.\" Calver said Mothercare's international expansion will focus on China, India, the Middle East and Latin America. The company said it expected to open 150 new stores abroad this year, with international sales growing by 20% per year over the next three years. Despite the poor UK outlook, shares in Mothercare rose 12.5% to 185p in early trading.",

      "body": "<p>A major rift has opened up between Germany and France for the<br>first time in 30 months of euro crisis over how to restore confidence<br>in the single currency.</p> <p>A special EU summit marking the debut of France's President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande saw him challenge Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, on the euro, arguing that the pooling of eurozone debt liability \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/22/eurozone-crisis-eurobonds-hollande-merkel\" title=\"\">eurobonds</a> \u2013 had to be retained as an option for saving the currency. Merkel has ruled out eurobonds as illegal under current EU law.</p> <p>Hollande told the dinner of 27 leaders that he wanted to see eurobonds established, while conceding that this would take time, witnesses at the talks said.<br> <br>Merkel responded that this was nigh-on impossible since it would require changes to the German constitution and around 10 separate legal changes, the sources said.</p> <p>There was no policy breakthrough at the summit, rather a reiteration by leaders of known positions. Any decisions were postponed until the end of next month after French and Greek parliamentary elections on 17 June.<br> <br>The fissure between Paris and Berlin widened further when Hollande also called earlier for the eurozone's new bailout vehicle to be allowed to draw funds from the European Central Bank and to be able to recapitalise banks directly, both proposals fiercely resisted by Berlin and also currently impossible under EU law.</p> <p>Senior German government officials had insisted that eurobonds should not be even discussed at the summit. The Hollande team maintained that all topics were on the table and also held open the prospect that France could refuse to ratify Merkel's fiscal pact compelling debt and deficit reduction in the eurozone unless eurobonds were recognised as a possible tool.<br> <br>Officials said that the inconclusive meeting saw a shift in the balance of power towards the French, with supporters of Hollande's eurobonds demands increasing in number and becoming bolder.</p> <p>The Franco-German clash was framed in terms of German-scripted austerity which has dominated two years of European response to debt crisis against a new French-led drive for growth policies at a time of record eurozone unemployment.</p> <p>A series of marginal measures entailing use of EU budget funds and increased capital for the European Investment Bank to finance growth projects were criticised by economists and analysts as \"a PR exercise\". Hollande's advisers also said they were inadequate to the scale of the challenge confronting a eurozone which could unravel.</p> <p>There was no final agreement on whether and how the extra capital for the EIB should be organised.</p> <p>In what appeared to be a shot across the bows of the French, meanwhile, Germany's central bank warned for the first time that if the Greek crisis came to a head, Germany's and the eurozone's interests would be best served by Greece's exit from the currency.</p> <p>According to Reuters, the 17 governments of the eurozone were told on Monday to draw up individual contingency plans for a Greek exit. The Greek government on Wednesday night denied that such an instruction was issued.</p> <p>The Bundesbank in Frankfurt said that Greece was threatening to renege on the terms of its #130bn bailout.</p> <p>\"The challenge this would create for the euro area and Germany would be considerable but manageable,\" the statement said. \"By contrast, a significant dilution of existing agreements would damage confidence in all euro area agreements and treaties\u2026calling into question the institutional status quo.\"</p> <p>The timing of the Bundesbank warning appeared directed at Wednesday night's talks. It said that given the risks involved in bailing out Greece, eurozone governments should reconsider whether they should continue to provide a lifeline to Athens.</p> <p>Merkel appeared rather isolated, while Hollande enjoyed the discreet support of the Spanish and Italian governments as well as of the European Commission which is now backing the drafting of a \"road-map\" on the medium-term prospects for eurobonds.</p> <p>With Berlin and Paris looking seriously at odds, no hard decisions are expected until the end of next month.

      "bodyText": "A major rift has opened up between Germany and France for the first time in 30 months of euro crisis over how to restore confidence in the single currency. A special EU summit marking the debut of France's President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande saw him challenge Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, on the euro, arguing that the pooling of eurozone debt liability \u2013 eurobonds \u2013 had to be retained as an option for saving the currency. Merkel has ruled out eurobonds as illegal under current EU law. Hollande told the dinner of 27 leaders that he wanted to see eurobonds established, while conceding that this would take time, witnesses at the talks said. Merkel responded that this was nigh-on impossible since it would require changes to the German constitution and around 10 separate legal changes, the sources said. There was no policy breakthrough at the summit, rather a reiteration by leaders of known positions. Any decisions were postponed until the end of next month after French and Greek parliamentary elections on 17 June. The fissure between Paris and Berlin widened further when Hollande also called earlier for the eurozone's new bailout vehicle to be allowed to draw funds from the European Central Bank and to be able to recapitalise banks directly, both proposals fiercely resisted by Berlin and also currently impossible under EU law. Senior German government officials had insisted that eurobonds should not be even discussed at the summit. The Hollande team maintained that all topics were on the table and also held open the prospect that France could refuse to ratify Merkel's fiscal pact compelling debt and deficit reduction in the eurozone unless eurobonds were recognised as a possible tool. Officials said that the inconclusive meeting saw a shift in the balance of power towards the French, with supporters of Hollande's eurobonds demands increasing in number and becoming bolder. The Franco-German clash was framed in terms of German-scripted austerity which has dominated two years of European response to debt crisis against a new French-led drive for growth policies at a time of record eurozone unemployment. A series of marginal measures entailing use of EU budget funds and increased capital for the European Investment Bank to finance growth projects were criticised by economists and analysts as \"a PR exercise\". Hollande's advisers also said they were inadequate to the scale of the challenge confronting a eurozone which could unravel. There was no final agreement on whether and how the extra capital for the EIB should be organised. In what appeared to be a shot across the bows of the French, meanwhile, Germany's central bank warned for the first time that if the Greek crisis came to a head, Germany's and the eurozone's interests would be best served by Greece's exit from the currency. According to Reuters, the 17 governments of the eurozone were told on Monday to draw up individual contingency plans for a Greek exit. The Greek government on Wednesday night denied that such an instruction was issued. The Bundesbank in Frankfurt said that Greece was threatening to renege on the terms of its #130bn bailout. \"The challenge this would create for the euro area and Germany would be considerable but manageable,\" the statement said. \"By contrast, a significant dilution of existing agreements would damage confidence in all euro area agreements and treaties\u2026calling into question the institutional status quo.\" The timing of the Bundesbank warning appeared directed at Wednesday night's talks. It said that given the risks involved in bailing out Greece, eurozone governments should reconsider whether they should continue to provide a lifeline to Athens. Merkel appeared rather isolated, while Hollande enjoyed the discreet support of the Spanish and Italian governments as well as of the European Commission which is now backing the drafting of a \"road-map\" on the medium-term prospects for eurobonds. With Berlin and Paris looking seriously at odds, no hard decisions are expected until the end of next month. That suggests weeks of greater uncertainty and friction between Germany and France which will unsettle the financial markets. Fresh from the G8 summit outside Washington at the weekend, Hollande also sought to play the American card, referring to the efficacy of Brady bonds in the US in spurring economic growth. Merkel responded that eurobonds would \"not make any contribution to stimulating growth.\" It emerged that the Obama administration had sought at the weekend to \"impose\" a much tougher G8 declaration on the crisis in the eurozone, but that Merkel had fiercely resisted and that the summit communique had to be rewritten as the US draft was too \"awkward.\" The growing international exasperation with the Europeans' halting response to the crisis is being echoed by the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. In a speech in Berlin this evening he is expected to say that some world leaders \"are saying behind capped hands that Europe is now congenitally incapable of exercising the leadership needed and it might be in everyone's interests if Greece left the Euro. \"We must build a firewall big enough and strong enough to stop the flames from spreading,\" Clegg said. Despite the reference to \"we\", Britain is not involved and refuses to take part in the rescue effort. Senior EU officials also voiced exasperation with the recent rash of statements from David Cameron advising the eurozone what to do. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, used his summit platform to articulate the broad annoyance with Downing Street's comments on the euro crisis, officials said. \"We couldn't care less what Cameron says,\" said another senior EU official. Despite the differences between Paris and Berlin, Hollande and Merkel, say well-placed sources, are united in opposing a Greek exit from the euro in the belief that keeping Greece in will be hugely expensive but nonetheless much cheaper than letting it go. \"There are too many unknowns,\" said another official. But Merkel and Hollande disagree on tactics towards Greece, with the French favouring sending a signal on easing the schedule for Greek deficit reduction while the Germans believe this would encourage Athens to compromise on the austerity measures.",
