Many in the old-school investment camp \u2013 long-only London-based funds \u2013 are quietly seething about what they regard as a lost year at Barclays.</p> <p>Many would agree with the Institute of Directors, hardly a cockpit of Marxist fury, that capitalism isn't working at Barclays. Shareholders will get \u00a3859m in dividends and staff, chiefly in the investment bank, will collect \u00a32.4bn in bonuses after a year in which profits fell steeply and the bank once again failed to achieve an adequate return on equity. As the IoD correctly says, the bank is being run for its staff, not its owners.</p> <p>Shareholders' reticence (so far) perhaps reflects that fact that the long-only brigade applauded chief executive Antony Jenkins' \"transform\" programme a year ago. They bought Jenkins' line that Barclays should be a \"universal bank\" and are not brave enough \u2013 yet \u2013 to tell Barclays to get smaller in investment banking and concentrate on retail banking and the slick Barclaycard operation.</p> <p>But there's nothing like a slumping share price to concentrate minds and change a mood. Barclays' shares have fallen 8% since Tuesday's full-year figures and the valuation is now horrible. The bank, still making substantial profits, is valued at just 0.8 times book value: the market is saying it expects Barclays to destroy value. Lloyds, by contrast, is priced at 1.6 times book value.</p> <p>Jenkins probably has a year \u2013 no more \u2013 to improve matters. In January last year he was inviting staff who did not wish to live by the bank's new \"values\", which were taken to include a fairer cut of the spoils for investors, to leave. \"My message to those people is simple: Barclays is not the place for you,\" he wrote in a memo. Now he finds himself inflating the bonus pool to persuade equity salesmen and deal-makers to stay. He looks a weaker leader.</p> <p>In Barclays' world, there has been no U-turn. According to the official script, the bank merely overdid things a year ago when it cut the bonus pool to \u00a32.2bn from \u00a32.5bn. This year's increase to \u00a32.4bn is pitched as a roundabout route to the same happy land where the investment bank's return on equity, just 8.2% in 2013, will consistently exceed Barclays' bare-minimum target of 11.5%. It was always a three-year plan, comes the shrug from Canary Wharf.</p> <p>Jenkins hasn't got that long. He has taken a high-risk gamble that an investment in the \"franchise\" will make the ratios improve. That bet must succeed quickly. If not, Jenkins will find himself with a double headache in investment banking \u2013 sub-par returns and staff who wonder whether Barclays is really a committed owner.</p> <p>April's annual meeting, as in 2012, the last year of the unlovely Bob Diamond/Marcus Agius show, will be a bunfight. Afterwards, one suspects, old-style fund managers will calm down and see what the rest of the year brings. But, if Jenkins and chairman Sir David Walker are still torturing shareholders with miserable dividends and a similar bonus ratio next February, patience may snap. Jenkins is still a new boy, but he burned a lot of goodwill this week.</p> <h2>Anglo American turnaround</h2> <p>A turnaround programme elsewhere is going rather better. It's early days for Mark Cutifani at mining group Anglo American \u2013 he has been chief executive for only 10 months \u2013 but there were no slip-ups in yesterday's full-year numbers. It was a second year of losses, naturally, as $1.9bn (\u00a31.1bn) of impairment charges bit. But the notion that there's a coherent set of set of mining assets within Anglo is definitely alive.</p> <p>Minas-Rio, the huge iron ore project in the Brazilian rainforest, will forever be remembered as one of the most overpriced acquisitions of a development asset in the history of mining: Anglo has written down $4bn of value and the delay in completion is at least three years. But as least Minas-Rio is finally arriving. Cutifani even has an acronym. FOOS \u2013 first ore on ship \u2013 is due by the end of this year.</p> <p>The corporate prayer is for iron ore prices to stay strong. At $120 a tonne, there's a healthy margin to be made on ore that can be landed in China for $55 a tonne. At peak production volumes Anglo would be collecting cash flows of $1.7bn at those prices. That would start to make a dent in net debt, up by $2.2bn to $10.7bn last year and still rising.</p> <p>Other miners are far more advanced on their cost-cutting and debt-reduction programmes, as Rio Tinto demonstrated this week, and as BHP Billiton should do next week. Nor do they face the seemingly intractable difficulties that come with mining platinum in South Africa (the current strike at Anglo's mines in Rustenberg is three weeks old). But Anglo is finally plotting a vaguely similar strategic course as the bigger beasts, albeit with a long lag.</p> <h2>Twitter recovery</h2> <p>Twitter's shares have regained almost half the ground lost after the wobbly quarterly numbers on 5 February. That equates to a bounce of 14% \u2013 not a bad 10-day return. The shares are once again trading at more than twice the flotation price of $26 (\u00a315.54) last November.</p> <p>It's very odd when you consider that Twitter's arrival on Wall Street was a global news story \u2013 and a prod, one might think, for the uninitiated and the curious to investigate what the fuss was all about. Yet Twitter's \"timeline views\" \u2013 the company's measure of users' engagement \u2013 fell in the final quarter of 2013.</p> <p>Yes, Twitter did better than expected on revenues and profits. But those numbers are tiny. It's the growth rate that matters with these social media stocks, we're always told. When the stock is rated at 30 times annual revenues, it's astonishing that investors are not more alarmed by the failure to translate oceans of free publicity into increased viewing. There is nothing like the faith of true believers in a tech story.</p> <h2>It's war out there</h2> <p>It's been an exciting week at the under-pressure supermarket Morrisons. There was a fluffy tale of private equity interest, which acclaimed former boss Ken Morrison said he knew nothing about, followed by City chat about a possible dividend cut.</p> <p>Now chief executive Dalton Philips is offering his staff lessons in survival from the Vietnam war. Trade paper Retail Week reports that Philips cited the Stockdale Paradox at a staff conference this week. James Stockdale was the tortured, and highly decorated, US prisoner of war who said the key to survival was to avoid false hope and confront the most brutal facts of a situation.</p> <p>If one overlooks the lack of direct parallels between selling baked beans and surviving the Vietnam war, Philips' advice beats standard management-speak.

GDP is the sum of consumption, investment and the trade balance (exports minus imports). The French government missed its deficit target meaning the government spending component was higher than planned, arithmetically boosting the GDP data. Growth has to be higher to offset the ongoing deficit woes.</p> <p>Still Hollande's government is quietly starting to make some improvements. For example the French will soon be able to buy simple medicines like aspirin outside of a pharmacy; something most of the world takes for granted. This might sound small but it's a saving for many and more importantly shows the government willing to take on vested interests and monopolies.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for us for today, and indeed the week. To quickly recap... the eurozone\u2018s shaky recovery from the depths of the last recession has continued with growth of 0.3% in the final three months of 2013. Better-than-expected growth in France and the Netherlands, solid expansion in Germany, and the end of Italy\u2019s recession helped the euro area to post its third quarterly expansion in a row. Higher exports, and a increase in business investment in some countries, overcame weaker domestic spending in many euro areas. But with Greece, Cyprus, and Finland all shrinking, Europe recovery remains pretty fragile. Analysts warned that stronger growth will be needed to push down unemployment and tackle the region\u2019s debt levels. Full coverage of today\u2019s GDP data starts back at 6.42am(!) with France avoiding a recession, followed by growth in Germany, the Netherlands and (finally) Italy. The news that the eurozone grew by 0.3% in the last quarter came at 10am. Don\u2019t forget to to tune into Andrew Marr at 9am Sunday morning to see Mark Carney, George Clooney and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso in action. Good night, and best wishes for the weekend. GW European markets have closed with solid gains after this morning\u2019s better-than expected growth data. The Italian FTSE led the way, up 1.7% in anticipation that a new government that can drive through political and economic reforms (easier typed than done). The German DAX closed 0.6% higher, the French CAC gained 0.5%, Spain\u2019s IBEX nudged up 0.2%. In the City, the FTSE 100 closed just 4 points higher. Here\u2019s Michael Hewson of CMC with a market round-up: European markets have enjoyed a positive end to the week after the latest Q4 GDP data from the euro area, all came in as, or slightly better than expected. Growth in France and Germany exceeded expectations while Italian GDP came in as expected at 0.1%. The return to growth in France in Q4 was all the more surprising given the wretched PMI numbers seen in recent months, and while business investment did improve in the quarter, over the whole of 2013 it declined to the tune of 2.1%, while government spending rose 1.7%. If French President Francois Hollande is serious about cutting spending and cutting red tape then government spending is one area which could well decline over the next few months, and if business doesn\u2019t pick up the slack we could well see a drop-off in GDP growth in the coming months. As for events in Italy, markets are looking past the political turmoil and have remained remarkably sanguine with the FTSEMib hitting its highest levels since 2011 as Matteo Renzi waits in the wings to replace existing PM Enrico Letta who submitted his resignation today. Then again political turmoil is nothing new in a country that has endured political dysfunction for the best part of 20 years and is now set to be on its third unelected Prime Minister in a row. The best performers today have been basic resource stocks with gold and silver miner Fresnillo tracking higher on the back of firmer gold and silver prices. Also higher oilfield services provider Petrofac is having a good day on the back of a broker upgrade from Berenberg. The pound, meanwhile, remains at a 3-year high against the US dollar, and hit a five-year high against a basket of currencies. The Bank of England\u2019s new stab at forward guidance appears to have given sterling a lift this week. Some traders doubt whether interest rates will really stay as low, for as long, as the BoE suggests..... Bit late to this, but Open Europe have done an interesting blog post about Finland\u2019s economic problems - after seeing its GDP shrink by an alarming 0.8% last quarter. It cites several factors, including the decline of Nokia (now subsumed by Microsoft after losing its dominant position in mobile); weaker global trade which hit its shipbuilding sector; and increased competition in the paper industry, where Finland (with its forests) once thrived. It concludes: It\u2019s clear that Finland remains a very strong and healthy economy. However, it is clearly undergoing some serious structural changes and may continue to post low growth figures for some time to come. Fortunately, public debt remains low at around 59% of GDP, while the deficit continues to be under control at 2.4% of GDP, and unemployment remains at just 8.1% despite recent increases. This should give the country plenty of space to conduct the structural changes needed. That said, the case of Finland provides further evidence (as we have pointed out for Germany) that the peripheral eurozone countries aren\u2019t the only ones undergoing significant changes. European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso will warn tonight that the free movement of people across the EU has put \u201cunintended strains\u201d on public services and is open to abuse, in a speech on Europe\u2019s future. He\u2019ll be speaking at the LSE - here\u2019s the details. Our senior political correspondent, Nick Watt, has the story already: In a move to show that Brussels understands the concerns raised in Britain, Barroso will say in London that the commission has recently clarified anti-abuse rules to crack down on sham marriages which allow non-EU citizens to claim benefits as a family member. But the commission president will make clear in a speech to the London School of Economics that he will not compromise on the right of all EU citizens to move across all 28 member states \u2013 one of the four founding pillars which guarantees the free movement of labour, capital, goods and services. The speech by Barroso came as Whitehall sources confirmed that a government report on free movement was delayed on Thursday after the home secretary Theresa May complained that it did not contain enough evidence on \u201cbenefit tourism\u201d. More here: Migration in the EU \u2018has caused strains,\u2019 admits Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso At Southwark Crown Court, a UK judge has handed down the longest sentence ever following a prosecution brought by the Financial Conduct Authority. Benjamin Wilson of Bournemouth, Dorset was sentenced to seven years for defrauding investors of over \u00a321m. He had previously pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, forgery and operating a collective investment scheme without authorisation. Sentencing Wilson, His Honour Judge Michael Grieve QC said: \u201cIt was an utterly shameless confidence fraud.\u201d \u201cThe purpose was to give himself a lifestyle of untold lavishness and luxury.\u201d \u201cIt was abuse of trust on a massive scale.\u201d According to the FCA, Wilson took \u00a321.8m from more than 300 people who invested in his SureInvestment fund, and misled them about its performance. The FCA explained: In September 2005 he emailed an investor to say the fund was now worth $3.6 million and was up 146% that year. In fact SureInvestment had less than \u00a3100,000 at that point and in the previous year Wilson had lost 90% of investors\u2019 money. At the time the FCA shut it down, \u00a317.54m was owed to investors and it is estimated that \u00a35.39m in total will be recovered. Commenting on the case, Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime, said: \u201cWilson used his charm and the trappings of apparent success to lure investors. However, his firm was almost as fictitious as his claims to genius. It was little more than a charade acted out at the expense of those who trusted and believed in him. There was only one beneficiary of the scheme and that was Wilson himself. We\u2019ll have a full story on the case later today. These graphs show how Italy finally returned to growth in the last quarter of 2013: But GDP was still 0.8% smaller than in Q4 2012: Over in Ireland, the criminal trial following the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank continues today. Henry McDonald reports: The former head of compliance at the bank that nearly bankrupted Ireland claimed in court today that the Republic\u2019s Financial Regulator was \u201cvery, very positive\u201d about a controversial deal that loaned investors hundreds of millions of euros. Brian Gillespie told Dublin\u2019s Central Criminal Court that he was involved in setting up the loan to the so-called Maple 10 - a group of developers, builders and speculators whom Anglo Irish Bank persuaded they should buy shares in their financial institution. On day eight of the trial, Gillespie said he had heard conference calls between Morgan Stanley and legal firm Matheson Ormsby Prentice and between Morgan Stanley and Con Horan from the Republic\u2019s Financial Regulator\u2019s office. He said Horan was \u201cvery, very, very positive\u201d about the transaction. The Maple 10 - a codeword for the investors given to Morgan Stanley by Anglo Irish Bank - were given loans to buy the shares just months before the bank had to be saved from total collapse with billions of euros of Irish taxpayers money. Gillespie said that Morgan Stanley was doing due diligence on the deal, and making sure everything was in order. Three top Anglo Irish Bankers - Sean Fitzpatrick, Patrick Whelan and William McAteer - are on trial for allegedly making unlawful financial assistance to 16 people including the Maple 10. All three men pleaded not guilty to the charges when the trial opened last week in courthouse 19. The case continues. US factories have reported an unexpected drop in output in January, which adds to concerns that the poor weather which hit America recently is hurting its economy. Industrial output dropped 0.3% during the month, startling economists who had expected a 0.3% rise in output. Manufacturing output was particularly disappointing, down 0.8%, led by a drop in mining activity. Added to the disappointing job creation in December and January, the data suggests the wintery weather caused by the polar vortex did chill parts of America\u2019s economy. But the US shopper hasn\u2019t been alarmed, according to the latest University of Michigan/Thomson Reuters survey of consumer confidence. It held steady at 81.2 for February. Update: Fast FT has a good take on the Michigan data. The FT\u2019s top man in Brussels, Peter Spiegel, is alarmed to see Finland among the worst performing eurozone countries in the last quarter (see 10.51am for the details). On Mark Carney\u2019s TV appearance on Sunday.... The interest rate on Spain\u2019s 10-year bonds has just dropped to its lowest level since Spring 2006. Italian and Spanish government bonds are romping up in value today, pushing Spain\u2019s 10-year bond yield down to just 3.57% and the Italian equivalent down to 3.68%. Heads-up: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso will both be appearing on the Andrew Marr show (BBC1: 9am-10am). A chance for Marr to quiz them both about monetary policy, and the state of the UK and EU economies. The Bond Vigilantes at M&amp;G are very excited that George Clooney will be squeezing in alongside Carney -- given the apparent resemblance between the pair: Wonder if Clooney fancies playing a central bank governor defending his flagship policy as he frantically rewrites it after just six months.... The stronger than expected eurozone growth figures helped to push shares higher in Germany and France today, where the main indices are both up around 0.5%. While in Italy, the FTSE MIB has jumped by 1.5% as Milan traders welcome Matteo Renzi\u2019s move to oust Enrico Letta and (presumably) claim the prime ministerial throne. The euro\u2019s still slightly higher today, just below $1.37. Brenda Kelly of IG comments: Activity continues to recover in the eurozone. While the political shenanigans in Italy are providing a Groundhog Day backdrop to proceedings, investors are choosing to focus on the better-than-expected GDP numbers from France, Holland and Germany. The overall GDP number for the area also beat consensus, coming in at 0.3% in the fourth quarter. The euro is a currency that refuses to bow to broader sentiment; the buoyant single currency is on the front foot again, testing the $1.37 level in early trade. Back to Italy, where the president\u2019s office have confirmed that Enrico Letta has tendered his resignation, for good. As flagged up early this morning -- Letta told staff last night that \u201cIt\u2019s true: Italy does break your heart\u201d. But while he nurses his wounds, rival political leaders will be flocking to the Quirinale for talks with President Napolitano. The next PM could be chosen by Saturday.... Jeremy Warner of the Telegraph has tweeted a graph that hammers home how much economic output Italy has lost in its recession. And without a return to decent growth, Italy\u2019s \u20ac2trn debt mountain becomes even harder to conquer.... Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, argues that the European Central Bank can take some quiet satisfaction in today\u2019s growth data: She\u2019s also encouraged that Spain, Italy and Portugal all reported growth this morning: \u201cThe Eurozone\u2019s star pupils of Germany and France of course led growth, but the breakdown of the report showed important developments in the fabric of the eurozone economic growth... The growth gap between the core and peripheral economies, based on data released so far, stood at just 0.1 percentage points. The economic bloc is converging and the surprise is that the peripheral nations are catching up to the core, and not the dragging it down. Although the UK grew more than twice as fast as France in the last quarter (+0.7% vs +0.3%), Britain\u2019s economy is still below its pre-crisis peak. French national output, though, is now - finally - higher. Italy\u2019s prime minister has just tweeted that he\u2019s resigning right now. Enrico Letta told his followers that he is at the Quirinal Palace, the official residence of Italy\u2019s president, to tender his resignation. He thanked all those who had helped him during his nine months in office, and then repeated his mantra to live: \u201cEvery day as if it were your last\u201d Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes that while there are encouraging signs in today\u2019s data, we shouldn\u2019t get excited about growth of just 0.3%: He says: There were three things to welcome in the data for the final three months of 2013: the increase in activity was slightly higher than forecast, it was a generalised pickup, and there were tentative signs of a recovery in investment. But later cautions: At best, the eurozone is likely to continue growing at its current rate, with the risk that problems elsewhere in the world \u2013 such as a slowdown in demand from emerging markets \u2013 lead to weaker export growth. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, should be careful not to draw the wrong conclusions from the GDP data. Sure, it beat expectations. But growth running at an annual rate of 1% is not sufficient to combat the eurozone\u2019s two big problems: debt and deflation. Here\u2019s the full piece: Celebrating 0.3% growth shows eurozone\u2019s diminished expectations A reminder of how low some eurozone economies have fallen: This is the first time in almost three years that the Eurozone\u2019s six largest economies have all reported growth for the same quarter. As this graph showed, Netherlands achieved 0.7% growth, Germany and Belgium both grew by 0.4%, France and Spain expanded by 0.3%, and Italy brought up the rear with a 0.1% rise in GDP. And with UK also growing, by 0.7%, it was a solid - if unspectacular - quarter for Europe. Here\u2019s an interactive map showing the latest eurozone growth data, made by my colleague Nick Mead: (may not work on all devices -- if not, click here to see it) Finland\u2019s recession has deepened, with GDP falling by another 0.8% in Q4 2013. Statistics Finland estimated that the economy shrank by 1.5% on an annual basis. It also released monthly GDP data, showing that contraction worsened in December. This was driven by a 5% contraction in manufacturing and construction (\u201csecondary production\u201d) and a 1% drop in the Service sector. Primary production (agriculture, forestry and fishing) rose almost 4% - not enough to reverse the decline. Here\u2019s the full report. Cyprus\u2019s economy continued to contract sharply -- its GDP shrank by another 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in Q4, and a alarming 5.3% year-on-year. That\u2019s the impact of its bailout package, with its banking sector diminished and capital controls preventing Cypriots from withdrawing large sums of money from their accounts. Martin van Vliet of ING is encouraged that the eurozone recovery has \u201cpicked up speed and broadened out\u201d in the last three months of 2013. He points to evidence that exports and business investment picked up in countries such as Germany and France: This indicates a classic recovery pattern, typically seen in many \u201ccore\u201d countries (but this time round also in peripheral economies): first exports pick-up, then business investment joins in, eventually to be followed by stronger consumer spending. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the eurozone\u2019s 0.3% growth in the last quarter was \u201ca step back in the right direction\u201d after the measly 0.1% growth recorded in Q3. Archer added: It marked a third successive quarter of expansion following six quarters of contraction through to the first quarter of 2013. It also meant that Eurozone GDP was up 0.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the first annual growth since the fourth quarter of 2011. Nevertheless, Eurozone GDP still contracted 0.4% overall in 2013. Most Eurozone economies saw an improved performance in the fourth quarter of 2013, with the core northern Eurozone economies generally growing by around 0.3-0.4% quarter-on-quarter, including Germany (0.4%) and France (0.3%). An exception was the previously struggling Dutch economy where GDP spiked up 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. Greece\u2019s long slump also eased in the last three months of 2013 -- its GDP shrank by 2.6% on a year-on-year basis. That\u2019s an improvement on the 3.0% annual decline measured in Q3 2013. This means the Greek economy shrank by 3.7% during last year, Reuters reports, which is a smaller contraction than the 4.0% contraction predicted by the Troika. You can see all the data here, on Eurostat (pdf). Europe is still lagging behind America, which grew by 0.8% in the same period. The US economy benefitted from Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus programme, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s exceptionally loose monetary policy - pumping up to $85bn of new money into the system each month. The wider European Union economy grew by 0.4% in the last three months of 2013. That\u2019s partly due to Britain\u2019s recovery - UK GDP rose by 0.7% in the quarter. JUST IN: The eurozone grew by 0.3% in the last three months of 2013 -- stronger than economists had expected. That\u2019s also an improvement on the 0.1% growth recorded in the July-September quarter. It was driven by 0.4% growth in Germany (details), the 0.3% expansion in France (details), and the long-awaited end of Italy\u2019s recession (details). Here\u2019s a picture of the ousted PM, Enrico Letta, leaving his house this morning. He\u2019s expected to tender his resignation to prime minister Napolitano this afternoon, after a brief nine-month premiership. Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Societe Generale, warned this morning that the next Italian PM will face challenges. We need to reserve judgement until we see Matteo Renzi in office and actually implementing reforms, she told Bloomberg TV. He\u2019ll still working with the same parliament, so the problems faed by Letta will also be faced by Renzi, she added. Fact of the day-- Italy has been through three prime ministers since it last posted a quarter of economic growth, in the third quarter of 2011. (Silvio Berlusconi was in power until November 2011, then Mario Monti took over, followed by Enrico Letta, and now presumably Matteo Renzi...) Portugal has also recorded another quarter of growth, as it approaches the end of its bailout programme. GDP rose by 0.5% on a quarterly basis in the final three months of 2013. On a year-on-year basis, it grew by 1.6%. If you\u2019re just joining us (where were you at 6.42am?), this chart shows the key GDP data this morning, showing that all Europe\u2019s major economies posted growth in the last three months of 2013. (the Belgian and Spanish numbers came out before today) I\u201dm afraid Enrico Letta isn\u2019t feeling much Valentine\u2019s Day affection, having been forced to resign by his own party last night: ISTAT has published its survey of Italian GDP here: Preliminary estimate of GDP (pdf) It shows that while the economy grew by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared with the third quarter, it decreased by 0.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. And this table shows how the Italian economy went into a nosedive at the end of 2011, and continued to shrink through 2012 and early 2013. ITALY HAS FINALLY RETURNED TO GROWTH. On the very day that prime minister Enrico Letta clears his desks after being ousted by his own party last night. Italian GDP rose by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013, bringing to an end a downturn that began in the middle of 2011. ISTAT also revised its estimate of third-quarter GDP to 0.0%, from a previous forecast of -0.1%. More to follow.... Amid all this eurozone excitement, the pound has hit a three-year high against the US dollar, of $1.671. We\u2019ll have details and reaction on that later... With Germany and France both beating forecasts, there\u2019s a decent chance that the eurozone as a whole grew faster than expected in Q4 2013. Economists had predicted growth of 0.2% - but it might now come in at a slightly more vigorous +0.3%. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities is cautious about today\u2019s data, saying: For all the optimism that has been expressed about the Eurozone (notwithstanding the disinflation chatter), forecasts for Q4 GDP hardly paint a picture that suggests any real momentum. However, with most economies now growing (not Greece or Cyprus, alas) the situation is a \u201cmaterial improvement\u201d, he adds. Thanks for all the early comments on today\u2019s GDP data -- it\u2019s always valuable to hear your opinions and insight from across Europe and beyond (as well as catching my typos). Here\u2019s an early selection - on the French growth data: Keep \u2018em coming! This handy graph from Markit puts today\u2019s German GDP figures in context. Growth of 0.4% is still quite modest compared to the years leading up to the 2008 crash, or even in 2010 before Europe\u2019s debt crisis blew up. Austria also reports growth, with its GDP rising by 0.3% in the last quarter. That\u2019s a small pick-up in activity, after 0.2% growth in the July-September period. And again, the expansion is being attributed to rising exports in the face of weak domestic demand. WIFO, the Austrian statistics body, said exports rose by 0.4%, up from 0.1% in Q3. Imports only rose by 0.1%. More encouraging news from the central and eastern wing of Europe -- Romania has reported sizzling quarterly growth of 1.7%, while Hungary grew at a 0.6% rate (twice as fast as expected). Here\u2019s some proper growth -- The Czech Republic grew by a punchy 1.6% on a quarterly basis in the last quarter. That\u2019s much better than economists had expected. And again, business investment and exports are being credited for driving the growth. The Czech statistics body said that \u201c fixed capital formation\u201d (firms spending on big-ticket items like transport and machinery) rose, while household and government spending was flat. Exports grew 4.8% and imports rose 4.5%. On that Dutch GDP data -- it\u2019s worth noting that the 0.7% growth was due to a rise in exports and an increase in business investment, while household spending fell. That\u2019s a similar pattern to that reported by Germany earlier this morning . Perhaps a pattern is emerging for now Northern European countries are performing? In a similar theme... Economics professor Yanis Varoufakis isn\u2019t impressed by this morning\u2019s figures, though.... The Netherlands economy has also grown faster than expected. Dutch GDP rose by a punchy 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2013, accelerating from 0.3% growth in the third quarter. That\u2019s much stronger than the 0.3% growth that economists had pencilled in. The euro has risen slightly since the German and French growth figures were released - jumping almost 0.2% to over $1.37. Traders may be calculating that the GDP figures take some pressure off the European Central Bank to take new measures to stimulate the euro economy. The stronger than expected German growth data (7am onwards) is a rare \u201cpositive surprise\u201d for the eurozone, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. Brzeski reckons Germany\u2019s economy will pick up through 2014 -- and predicts stronger domestic demand as workers receive pay rises: Here\u2019s some highlights from his latest research note: Looking ahead, the German economy should gain further momentum. Filled order books and the latest inventory reductions bode well for industrial production in the coming months. Moreover, the construction sector, driven by the mild winter weather and government investment, should be growth-supportive throughout 2014. Finally, the strong labour market and latest wage increases should further back domestic demand. Germany remains the economic stronghold of the Eurozone. In fact, this morning\u2019s data was one of those positive surprises the Eurozone has seen too seldom over the last few quarters. Let\u2019s hope it won\u2019t be the last one. The French government shouldn\u2019t rush to hang bunting on the Eiffel Tower, even though its economy has avoided le double dip recession with growth of +0.3% in Q4. As Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Societe Generale, pointed out on Bloomberg, these are not very dynamic growth numbers -- and show France is experiencing a rather slow recovery. Unless growth picks up, debt levels will continue to rise faster than economic output - putting the country\u2019s long-term health at greater risk, she added Germany\u2019s Statistics Office said that the German economy \u201ccontinued its moderate growth\u201d at the end of last year. But while foreign trade was strong, and companies invested more, household spending fell during the quarter. It said in a statement: According to provisional calculations, the increase in exports of goods and services was substantially higher than that of imports. As regards domestic demand, different developments were reported. Government final consumption expenditure remained at the level of the previous quarter, while household final consumption expenditure was slightly lower. A positive development was recorded for fixed capital formation, which was markedly up both in machinery and equipment and in construction compared with the third quarter of 2013. However, inventories were considerably reduced, which slowed down economic growth. GERMANY HAS BEATEN EXPECTATIONS TOO, with its economy picking up pace in the last three months of last year. Its GDP rose by 0.4% in the final three month of 2013, ahead of expectations of a 0.3% increase. Exports rose much more strongly than imports, the German statistics body said. That means external demand helped Germany to shrug off some domestic weakness. Details and reaction to follow... Here\u2019s Reuters early take on the French growth data: The French economy grew 0.3 percent in the final quarter of 2013, boosted by corporate investment and slightly beating expectations, preliminary figures from the INSEE national office said on Friday. A Reuters poll of 32 economists had forecast on average that the economy grew 0.2 percent in the last three months of 2012 from the previous quarter.I NSEE said that growth was flat in the third quarter, revising the figure up from a preliminary estimate that the economy had contracted 0.1 percent The result meant that the euro zone\u2019s second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent over the course of last year, more than the government\u2019s estimate of 0.1 percent. The details of France\u2019s growth data are on the INSEE website here: INSEE reports that French household consumption rose by 0.5% in Q4. And encouragingly, the data shows the French companies finally started investing again. Corporate expenditure rose by 0.6% in the quarter, after declining since the start of 2012. Good morning. France has avoided falling back into recession by posting growth in the final three months of 2013. INSEE, the French statistics body, just reported that the French economy grew by 0.3% in the October-December quarter. That\u2019s slightly stronger than expected. And in another boost for Paris, the growth figures for the third quarter were revised up -- the economy was flat between July and September, and didn\u2019t contract by 0.1% as first estimated. The news will be welcomed by the French government as it tries to battle stagnation, and implement Francois Hollande\u2019s new economic reform plan. Full details and reaction to follow. The news kicks off a busy morning for eurozone data -- with new growth figures for many of its members due in the next few hours. We get German Q4 GDP at 7am GMT (8am CET), Italian GDP at 9am GMT, with the figure for the full eurozone due at 10am GMT. So in under four hours, we\u2019ll know which countries grew, and which shrunk, in the last quarter. I\u2019ll track all the details, and reaction, along with other developments in the financial markets, the economy, and business. We\u2019ll also be watching Italy, where Enrico Letta will resign as prime minister today - paving the way for Matteo Renzi.

      "bodyText": "As leading shares recorded their second week of gains, supermarket group Morrisons was in the spotlight after a brief flurry of takeover speculation. Reports that members of the founding family had approached private equity firms with a view to buying back the business sent Morrisons' shares flying, albeit briefly. Reality soon set in, as investors focused on the latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel showing the main supermarkets continuing to lose market share to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas issued an underperform recommendation on Morrisons on Friday and cut their target price from 230p to 200p, pointing to poor trading and the unlikelihood of debt-funded buyout. They said: Morrison is haemorrhaging market share and has a pricing problem requiring painful margin cuts to fix. The dividend no longer looks secure...management is pressured and bid speculation is rising but a leveraged buyout or carve-up look unlikely. Morrison's Christmas trading was a shock but to deliver a -7% like for like in January against a -6% comparison (based on Kantar data), suggests sales are unravelling. The consumer's embrace of the discounters has hurt all of the mainstream grocers, but Morrison's geographic and demographic positioning has left it exposed and its value credentials have been most tarnished, we think. Hoping for a better consumption backdrop looks futile \u2013 trust needs winning back which means price cuts and investment in customer loyalty/insights. To deliver a successful leveraged buyout realistically requires the stock market to accept an implicit low property worth in Morrison, and for property investors then to accept high rents and low yields on the subsequent property carve-out. Basing an LBO assessment on the 'greater fool' argument lacks credibility, to us. Morrisons fell 2.3p to 233.8p, a 2% decline on the week. Overall though, the market was in a brighter mood. The FTSE 100 finished at 6663.62 on Friday, up 4.2 points on the day and 92 points on the week. Investors took heart from soothing comments from central bankers, with Janet Yellen using her first public testimony as chair of the US Federal Reserve to underline that the bank would continue to trim its bond buying programme, but only if the economic news was strong enough to support such a move. Bank of England governor Mark Carney did a U-turn on his forward guidance but signalled interest rates would remain at low levels until at least next year. Positive European data, including a 0.3% rise in eurozone GDP in the last quarter, also helped sentiment while the market took political turmoil in Italy, with prime minister Enrico Letta ousted by rival Matteo Renzi, in its stride. Better than expected Chinese trade data supported the mining sector throughout the week. Antofagasta added 33p to 938.5p on Friday and BHP Billiton was 17.5p better at 1888.5p. But Anglo American dipped 14p to 1519.5p after it reported a 6% rise in underlying profits to $6.6bn, ahead of expectations, but made a $961m loss after impairment charges. Helped by a recovery in the gold price as the dollar weakened, Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo rose 49p to 971.5p, while elsewhere International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Iberia, climbed 4.4p to 446.4p after it announced a pay agreement on Thursday with its Spanish pilots. Deutsche Bank issued a buy note and raised its target price from 430p to 506p: Recent incoming on IAG has been focused on when the right time is to get out of the stock. There seem to be four main concerns; (1) Summer trans-Atlantic capacity growth, (2) whether increased capital expenditure will swallow increased cashflow, (3) whether share performance of 2013 can recur and (4) whether market expectations are now too far ahead of company guidance. Whilst some of these concerns are valid, we think the big picture is unchanged; IAG is successfully going through its restructuring and its valuation, most importantly, is still compelling. Clearly one needs to keep the risk/reward under review but for us it is simply too early to bail out. Oilfield services suppler Petrofac put on 52p to \u00a313.17 after an upgrade from Berenberg, which moved from hold to buy. The week saw a number of shock profit warnings, notably from Tate and Lyle and Rolls-Royce. Tate slumped 16% on Thursday and lost another 2.5p to 657.5p a day later while Rolls lost nearly 14% following its figures and ended down 20p at \u00a310.25p on Friday. But Shire added 77p to \u00a332.19 following a better than expected 36% rise in fourth quarter earnings, helped by growing demand for its rare disease drugs. Imperial Tobacco dipped 51p to \u00a323 after the company confirmed it was considering a potential flotation of its European logistics business, Logista. Panmure Gordon said: Although any potential transaction would be dilutive we think it would be well received. We think any proceeds would support the existing shareholder returns programme and clearly free up management to focus on driving through the current organisational change programmes. Whilst it would be positive, in our view, the scale of the transaction isn't really sufficient to change our overall view on Imperial and we maintain our hold recommendation and 2300p target price. The bank reporting season continued but with as much focus on paypackets as profits. Barclays slipped 3.4p to 253p on Friday while Lloyds Banking Group lost 0.87p to 80.45p. GlaxoSmithKline added 11.5p to 1664.5p amid reports it could bid for US biopharma group Arena. Meanwhile analysts at Barclays raised their target price from \u00a315.45 to \u00a315.75. Finally a stellar performance came from Actual Experience, a technology company spun out of intellectual property company IP Group and Queen Mary university in London. It joined Aim at 54.5p on Thursday, soaring to 245p on its first day of trading before slipping 17.5p to close the week at 227.5p.",

There seem to be four main concerns; (1) Summer trans-Atlantic capacity growth, (2) whether increased capital expenditure will swallow increased cashflow, (3) whether share performance of 2013 can recur and (4) whether market expectations are now too far ahead of company guidance. Whilst some of these concerns are valid, we think the big picture is unchanged; IAG is successfully going through its restructuring and its valuation, most importantly, is still compelling. Clearly one needs to keep the risk/reward under review but for us it is simply too early to bail out. </p> </blockquote> <p>Oilfield services suppler <strong>Petrofac</strong> put on 52p to \u00a313.17 after an upgrade from Berenberg, which moved from hold to buy.</p> <p>The week saw a number of shock profit warnings, notably from <strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> and <strong>Rolls-Royce</strong>. Tate slumped 16% on Thursday and lost another 2.5p to 657.5p a day later while Rolls lost nearly 14% following its figures and ended down 20p at \u00a310.25p on Friday.</p> <p>But <strong>Shire</strong> added 77p to \u00a332.19 following a better than expected 36% rise in fourth quarter earnings, helped by growing demand for its rare disease drugs.</p> <p><strong>Imperial Tobacco </strong>dipped 51p to \u00a323 after the company confirmed it was considering a potential flotation of its European logistics business, Logista. Panmure Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although any potential transaction would be dilutive we think it would be well received. We think any proceeds would support the existing shareholder returns programme and clearly free up management to focus on driving through the current organisational change programmes. Whilst it would be positive, in our view, the scale of the transaction isn't really sufficient to change our overall view on Imperial and we maintain our hold recommendation and 2300p target price.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bank reporting season continued but with as much focus on paypackets as profits. <strong>Barclays</strong> slipped 3.4p to 253p on Friday while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 0.87p to 80.45p.</p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> added 11.5p to 1664.5p amid reports it could bid for US biopharma group Arena. Meanwhile analysts at Barclays raised their target price from \u00a315.45 to \u00a315.75.</p> <p>Finally a stellar performance came from<strong> Actual Experience</strong>, a technology company spun out of intellectual property company IP Group and Queen Mary university in London. It joined Aim at 54.5p on Thursday, soaring to 245p on its first day of trading before slipping 17.5p to close the week at 227.5p.</p>",
