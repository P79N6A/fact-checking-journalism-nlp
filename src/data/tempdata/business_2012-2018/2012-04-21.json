      "bodyText": "With pasties, pensioners and philanthropists still dominating the headlines a month after the budget, the chancellor's fumbled tax grab has rocked his reputation as a smooth political operator. But on Wednesday, the focus will switch back to George Osborne's handling of the economy, when official figures reveal whether the UK slipped back into recession in the first three months of the year. Osborne boasts that his deficit-cutting spree has made the UK a \"safe haven\", helping to keep the government's borrowing costs down by retaining the confidence of financial markets. But after the 0.3% decline in GDP in the final quarter of 2011, a negative number on Wednesday would mean a double-dip recession, and force the chancellor to explain how the coalition has dragged the economy from recovery back into the danger zone. With mixed signals from different sectors of the economy, City analysts are divided about whether growth has picked up since the dark days of late 2011, when the prospect of a full-blown credit crunch in the eurozone sent business confidence through the floor. Business surveys have been relatively upbeat; but manufacturing output fell sharply in January and February, according to the Office for National Statistics, and construction too looks extremely weak. Last week brought some modest reasons for optimism. Labour market data showed the first decline in unemployment for almost a year \u2013 though a record 1.4 million people are working part-time because they can't find a full-time job, a sign that firms remain cautious. Retail sales figures, released on Friday, were relatively strong, even without the artificial boost from panic-buying of petrol. \"I'm glass-half-full,\" says Alan Clarke of Scotia Capital, who is expecting the Office for National Statistics to announce GDP growth of 0.2%, although he adds: \"I wouldn't rule it out being negative.\" There is also growing evidence of a change of mood on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Minutes of its April meeting, released last Wednesday, showed members fretting more about above-target inflation than sickly economic growth. And after official inflation figures showed a surprise rise to 3.5% in March, Paul Tucker, the Bank's governor-in-waiting, admitted in a speech that inflation remains \"uncomfortably above target\", and there was \"considerable uncertainty about the path that it will follow\". Adam Posen, the American economist who consistently warned about the weakness of the economy last year, and eventually won the argument for an extension of the Bank's emergency quantitative easing programme, voted against another increase in QE in April. The City read his change of heart as a powerful signal that once the Bank has run through the last of the \u00a3325bn it has promised to spend, QE will be halted for the foreseeable future. Inside the Treasury, though, next week's number is being watched with anxiety. Although 0.1% growth would feel little different to most of Britain's battered households from a 0.1% contraction, in an economy that has been flatlining for a year, a batch of headlines about the return of recession could knock fragile consumer confidence. And even if growth has picked up smartly in the first three months of the year, it's hard to feel confident about the rest of 2012. Output in the second quarter is likely to be temporarily depressed as a result of the extra bank holiday in June to celebrate the Queen's diamond jubilee, echoing the downturn last year as the nation celebrated the royal wedding by taking the week off. Much more worryingly, the eurozone crisis is still rumbling ominously on across the Channel. Unemployment in the struggling peripheral countries has reached almost unthinkable levels \u2013 youth unemployment in Greece and Spain has shot through 50%. With the French elections looming next weekend, there are also growing signs that political support for the savage austerity measures enshrined in Europe's \"fiscal compact\" is starting to crumble across the EU. A Treasury spokesman concedes that events in the eurozone present the biggest risk to the outlook. \"Recent data shows that the British economy is holding up: retail sales are up 1.8% in March and unemployment is down by 35,000 in the three months to February. But as recent developments across Europe demonstrate, there is still a lot of economic uncertainty emanating from the eurozone, which is having a chilling effect on the UK economy and weighing down on confidence.\" There are potentially chilling influences back home too. Rising inflation in March may be a sign that strengthening demand is allowing retailers to pass on rising costs to their customers. But if, instead, it simply shows the knock-on effect of high commodity prices and rising taxes, then it will eat into consumers' spending power and force them to tighten their belts yet further. Higher-than-expected inflation was one of the key reasons cited by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility in November for getting last year's growth forecasts badly wrong. Michael Saunders of Citi believes that a couple of positive pieces of data should not disguise the underlying weakness of the economy. \"I just think we shouldn't get too carried away,\" he says. And after almost five years of financial and economic turmoil, the UK remains saddled with many of the imbalances that made it vulnerable to the sub-prime shock in the first place. Households have made little progress in paying off the mountain of debts they were left with as a legacy of the pre-credit-crunch boom, property prices still look overvalued, and the financial sector remains enormous relative to the rest of the economy. Dario Perkins of consultancy Lombard Street Research argued in a briefing last week that those imbalances have not mattered too much over the last couple of years, as rock-bottom interest rates and a smaller-than-expected increase in unemployment have helped to prevent the forced sales and mass repossessions that could have a created a vicious downward spiral. But he says they could still leave the economy dangerously exposed if the eurozone situation worsens. \"This situation seems stable for now, but the UK's 'safe haven' status is far from guaranteed. The economy remains vulnerable to its large financial sector and our banks are heavily exposed to Europe ... If something goes wrong in Europe \u2013 and that is still the direction in which we are headed \u2013 then the UK's economic outlook might appear very different.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The news about inflation is not good, either for hard-pressed individuals whose incomes are stagnating and therefore falling in real terms, or for the economy generally. Not to put too fine a point on it, reports of the economic recovery continue to be much exaggerated. With real incomes so squeezed, that chimerical recovery is not coming from consumer spending; the trade figures have recently taken a turn for the worse; in these circumstances new investment is hard to come by; and as for government spending \u2013 well, we all know what the government plans for that. True, the latest employment and unemployment figures are marginally better, but they largely reflect an increase in part-time working. This suits some, but for many people the \"choice\" of part-time working is an involuntary one. But back to that inflation figure. There has been much shock and horror at the news that the year-on-year figure for March rose slightly, from 3.4% to 3.5%. The Bank of England had been telling us that the rate of inflation was on its way back to 2%. Now Paul Tucker, the joint deputy governor, has warned us that, what with high oil prices and the effects of the budget (yet another budgetary embarrassment\u2026) it will remain above 3% for some time. This inflation rate would have been considered quite respectable in the 1960s \u2013 a period when the distinguished economics commentator Sir Samuel Brittan spent some time in government and kept an interesting diary that has just been published by the British Academy (Inside the Department of Economic Affairs: Samuel Brittan, the Diary of an \"Irregular\", 1964-6, edited by Roger Middleton). Then, as now, there were worries about economic growth, the difference being that \"failure\" then was disappointment at not achieving a target of 4% real growth, whereas now any growth at all would be considered an achievement. Indeed, if this week's gross domestic product figures for the first quarter indicate that the country has so far avoided a double dip recession, our eccentric chancellor will be exultant. The problems of high unemployment and potential social unrest in the British economy and the eurozone are partly the inevitable reflection of the bust that historically tends to follow a boom. But they also reflect the pre-Keynesian nature of economic policy. Inflation was a serious problem in the 1970s \u2013 in August 1975, the year-on-year increase in retail prices in the UK was 26.9% \u2013 and in the 1980s, notwithstanding Margaret Thatcher's monetarist mission to eliminate it, the average rate of inflation was 7.8% in 1989 and the year-on-year rate hit a peak of 10.9% in September and October 1990. Traditionally, successive postwar British governments used fiscal and monetary policy to encourage the growth of aggregate demand in the economy, provided that inflation was not a serious threat. It was a serious threat when the figures were like those just quoted. But despite the fact that the Bank of England and other forecasters have egg on their computer screens over the latest statistic, which was not meant to be in the scheme of things, this is hardly a moment to panic over inflation. However, if current policies persist here and in the eurozone, there may be panic for reasons that have nothing to do with inflation. The impact on real incomes would be less severe if the emphasis of policy were to be on growth, not austerity. Both in the United Kingdom and the eurozone we have experienced monetary flexibility but not fiscal flexibility. It is no use talking about the need for growth while imposing policies that impede it. And pace the standard line from Berlin, it was not fiscal laxity that caused the crisis. In economies ranging from Spain to the UK, the budget deficits that so worry people now were the result of the financial crisis, not the cause of it. Paradoxically, by drastically cutting government expenditure at a time like this, the British and eurozone governments are almost certainly guaranteeing a prolonged budgetary crisis. I was quite struck last week to find that pillar of the US financial establishment Charles Dallara (the managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which represented the major global banks in the Greek debt negotiations) being quoted as having said: \"It is very important to avoid a vicious cycle of economic contraction and budget cutting.\" Because that it what is on the cards, and there is a human cost as well. The New York Times recently reported a significant increase in the number of suicides in Europe, apparently directly connected to grief and despair associated not only with unemployment but also with business failures, as banks and creditors pull the rug out from beneath small and medium-sized enterprises that might well be viable in normal times. The US economist Paul Krugman extended the point to express concern about \"the apparent determination of European leaders to commit economic suicide for the continent as a whole\". This may be pushing it a bit. Unlike humans, economies do not die. But they can remain on life-support for a long time if not properly treated.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Its heavily logoed T-shirts, hooded tops, jackets and dresses are worn by celebrities from Kate Winslet and Pixie Lott to David Beckham and Zac Efron. But the phenomenal growth enjoyed in recent years by SuperGroup \u2013 the owner of Superdry, one of the most popular young fashion chains in the UK \u2013 has suffered a huge knock. Once the darling of the stock market, SuperGroup saw its share price plunge 40% on Friday after a shock profit warning. And it's not just investors who are losing faith. Fashionistas say the Superdry brand, which burst on to the scene in 2004 with its vintage Americana look topped off by Japanese script, is looking tired. \"Fashion is a bit will-o'-the-wisp \u2013 you can never rely on the same formula,\" says Melanie Rickey, fashion blogger and contributing editor to Grazia and Pop magazines. \"The last brand that captured the mainstream British public in that sloganeering way was FCUK. Superdry have taken over from them, but the market tires easily and moves on.\" She says Superdry can't afford to stand still, when rival Uniqlo, for example, makes a better job of \"poppy basics\", refreshing colours, fabric and typography. Uniqlo, she says, is a more democratic brand. \"You're either a Superdry person or you're not, whereas anyone can be a Uniqlo shopper.\" City analysts may not be known for their fashion sense, but on the subject of Superdry's fading allure, they agree with the trendsetters. Freddie George, at house broker Seymour Pierce, says: \"There has been less celebrity endorsement for their ranges. They rely a lot on staples but have got to broaden their ranges and increase levels of newness.\" Superdry was born in 2003 out of the Cult Clothing stores opened by Julian Dunkerton, mostly in university towns, over the previous two decades. He teamed up with designer James Holder, who had created the Bench brand, to come up with a new in-house line. The first Superdry shop opened in London's Covent Garden the following year, and the chain grew rapidly to 80 UK shops and 70 concessions in department stores, as well as 145 international stores today. More recently criticism of the ranges has increased, particularly of the prominent use of branding on garments. \"Mundane\" is how fashion blogger Charlie Porter describes Superdry's \"pretty basic versions of utility clothing\". He adds: \"You need to do something else. Clothes have to be more than just a brand. Nike and Adidas work because they are performance gear.\" SuperGroup was one of the most successful flotations of 2010 when it debuted on the stock market at 500p. The shares rocketed and hit \u00a318.99 in February last year, but have since fallen sharply, to 351.8p. On Friday, a third profit warning since October sent the shares down nearly 40%. It now expects to make a profit before tax of \u00a343m this year, compared with \u00a350m forecast in February. Last year it made a \u00a347m profit (which was more than double the previous year). City analysts took a knife to their forecasts and share recommendations, with John Stevenson at Peel Hunt even calling the shares uninvestable, after SuperGroup admitted to making an \"arithmetic error\" over its forecasts, as well as suffering issues with wholesale stock, and lower margins due to changes in the sales mix. More shoppers are buying its polos, dresses and T-shirts on the eBay clearance site or from cut-price outlet stores such as the one in Bicester, and this has eaten into margins. A pair of men's cargo shorts can be had for \u00a329.99 on eBay, compared with \u00a344.99 on the Superdry website or in store. The botched introduction of a new IT system at the company's warehouses had already caused problems last year. New finance director Shaun Wills, who starts on Monday, will review SuperGroup's financial controls, while Susanne Given, in the newly created post of chief operating officer, has been charged with sorting out operational problems. Many analysts think Superdry can be revived. Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities does not believe the brand is broken, operational cock-ups aside. \"The new spring and summer ranges are a big improvement, but these are pretty austere times for the average 24-year-old, who is the heart of their brand,\" he says. \"The value for money and quality are very good.\" SuperGroup has just opened a new, three-storey flagship store on London's Regent Street. Even critics say it looks great, with far less emphasis on branding in the new ranges and a bigger collection of accessories, but it is up against tough competition. Rivals Zara, Mango and Uniqlo all have stores nearby. Porter holds up Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's dark, minimalist store just up the road as an example of \"how to do a hell of a lot out of not very much\".",

Superdry have taken over from them, but the market tires easily and moves on.\"</p> <p>She says Superdry can't afford to stand still, when rival Uniqlo, for example, makes a better job of \"poppy basics\", refreshing colours, fabric and typography. Uniqlo, she says, is a more democratic brand. \"You're either a Superdry person or you're not, whereas anyone can be a Uniqlo shopper.\"</p> <p>City analysts may not be known for their fashion sense, but on the subject of Superdry's fading allure, they agree with the trendsetters. Freddie George, at house broker Seymour Pierce, says: \"There has been less celebrity endorsement for their ranges. They rely a lot on staples but have got to broaden their ranges and increase levels of newness.\"</p> <p>Superdry was born in 2003 out of the Cult Clothing stores opened by Julian Dunkerton, mostly in university towns, over the previous two decades. He teamed up with designer James Holder, who had created the Bench brand, to come up with a new in-house line. The first Superdry shop opened in London's Covent Garden the following year, and the chain grew rapidly to 80 UK shops and 70 concessions in department stores, as well as 145 international stores today.</p> <p>More recently criticism of the ranges has increased, particularly of the prominent use of branding on garments. \"Mundane\" is how fashion blogger Charlie Porter describes Superdry's \"pretty basic versions of utility clothing\". He adds: \"You need to do something else. Clothes have to be more than just a brand. Nike and Adidas work because they are performance gear.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/19/supergroup-superdry-sales-shares-rise\" title=\"\">SuperGroup was one of the most successful flotations of 2010</a> when it debuted on the stock market at 500p. The shares rocketed and hit \u00a318.99 in February last year, but have since fallen sharply, to 351.8p. On Friday, a third profit warning since October sent the shares down nearly 40%. It now expects to make a profit before tax of \u00a343m this year, compared with \u00a350m forecast in February. Last year it made a \u00a347m profit (which was more than double the previous year).</p> <p>City analysts took a knife to their forecasts and share recommendations, with John Stevenson at Peel Hunt even calling the shares uninvestable, after SuperGroup admitted to making an \"arithmetic error\" over its forecasts, as well as suffering issues with wholesale stock, and lower margins due to changes in the sales mix. More shoppers are buying its polos, dresses and T-shirts on the eBay clearance site or from cut-price outlet stores such as the one in Bicester, and this has eaten into margins. A pair of men's cargo shorts can be had for \u00a329.99 on eBay, compared with \u00a344.99 on the Superdry website or in store.</p> <p>The botched introduction of a new IT system at the company's warehouses had already caused problems last year. New finance director Shaun Wills, who starts on Monday, will review SuperGroup's financial controls, while Susanne Given, in the newly created post of chief operating officer, has been charged with sorting out operational problems.</p> <p>Many analysts think Superdry can be revived. Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities does not believe the brand is broken, operational cock-ups aside. \"The new spring and summer ranges are a big improvement, but these are pretty austere times for the average 24-year-old, who is the heart of their brand,\" he says. \"The value for money and quality are very good.\"</p> <p>SuperGroup has just opened a new, three-storey flagship store on London's Regent Street. Even critics say it looks great, with far less emphasis on branding in the new ranges and a bigger collection of accessories, but it is up against tough competition. Rivals Zara, Mango and Uniqlo all have stores nearby. Porter holds up Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's dark, minimalist store just up the road as an example of \"how to do a hell of a lot out of not very much\".</p>",
