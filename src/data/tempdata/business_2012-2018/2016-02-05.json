      "bodyText": "After it was announced on Friday that US unemployment had fallen below 5% for the first time in eight years, Barack Obama made a surprise visit to the White House briefing room. Praising how far the economy had come on his watch, since the recession of 2008, Obama attacked Republican candidates to succeed him he said were running \u201cdoom-and-despair\u201d campaigns. \u201cUnemployment, deficit, gas prices are all down. Jobs, wages and rate of the insured are all up,\u201d Obama said, not mentioning that the figure for jobs added in January, 151,000, also deemed disappointing when announced that morning. \u201cAs I said in my State of the Union address, the United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world.\u201d He continued: \u201cI know that\u2019s still inconvenient for Republican stump speeches as their doom-and-despair tour plays in New Hampshire. I guess you cannot please everybody.\u201d According to Obama, the US has recovered \u201cfaster, stronger, better, more durably than just about any other advanced economy\u201d, specifically because it did not adopt some policies advocated by Republicans. Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t seem to have any plausible, coherent recipe other than [to] cut taxes\u201d for the rich, he said. Without naming names, Obama said some Republican candidates for president argued that Americans are \u201cfeeling insecure \u2026 because immigrants or poor people are taking more and more of your paycheck\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d the president said, vowing to spend the rest of his last year in office touting the \u201cprogress we have made\u201d. Obama\u2019s message was one of recovery, progress and hope. In December, though, he said he could understand why people would support the likes of Donald Trump if they were frustrated with stagnant wages and were unable to find good jobs. Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont who is fighting former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, also noted that economic hardship was one reason why Trump appealed to some voters. \u201cMany of Trump\u2019s supporters are working-class people and they\u2019re angry,\u201d he said in December. \u201cThey\u2019re angry because they\u2019re working longer hours for lower wages. \u201cThey\u2019re angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to China or other low-wage countries. They\u2019re angry because they can\u2019t afford to send their kids to college so they can\u2019t retire with dignity.\u201d One of the signs that voters still lack confidence in the US job market is the labor participation rate, which in 2015 reached its lowest point in 38 years. \u201cWe are still at a point where labor participation rate is lower than it has been historically,\u201d Obama said on Friday. In January, the rate was 62.7%. Obama noted that part of the problem is due to a shift in demographics, as an increasing number of Americans enter retirement. \u201cSome of this is still hangover from what happened in 2007 and 2008 and this is part of the reason why we have to keep our foot to the accelerator in terms of doing the things that need to be done to keep the economy going and keep it strong,\u201d Obama said. The US secretary of labor, Tom Perez, described Friday\u2019s report as \u201csolid\u201d. \u201cThis is the best six months of wage growth since the start of the recovery,\u201d he said, in a call with the Guardian. The past year has seen wages grow by 2.5%. In January, 4.5 million Americans got a raise thanks to state and local laws that increased minimum wages, said Perez. \u201cI want to get to where we were at the end of the 90s, which was 4% unemployment,\u201d Perez said, minutes before Obama took the stage. \u201cI think we can get there, but we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d An infrastructure bill signed into law by Obama last year will keep the momentum going in the construction sector. Perez said that to really drive down unemployment, Congress should look to increase the federal minimum wage and pass an immigration bill.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global stock markets fell on Friday after the news that US wages picked up and unemployment fell to an eight-year low raised the prospect of another interest rate rise in the world\u2019s biggest economy this year. The US jobless rate dipped below 5% for the first time since February 2008 to come in at 4.9% in January, the US Department of Labor reported. That fresh dip in unemployment and news that employers had increased hours for workers helped to overshadow a weaker than expected rise in new jobs in January. The US economy added 151,000 jobs, well below expectations for 190,000 new jobs in a Reuters poll of economists. But financial markets took the jobs report as a whole as confirmation that the US labour market recovery remained well on track, despite a tumultuous start to the year for the global economy. That fanned investor fears about another rate rise from the US Federal Reserve and at the time of the London close, Wall Street was down sharply. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500 were both down more than 1% in early trading while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 closed down 0.9% at 5848.06. One of the brighter spots in the jobs report was a rise in US hourly earnings, which went up by 0.5%, or 12 cents. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5%. The Department of Labor has often referred to US wages as the \u201cunfinished business of this recovery\u201d. On Friday, Barack Obama hailed the \u201clongest streak of private-sector job growth on record\u201d and stronger pay growth. \u201cOver the past six months, wages have grown at their fastest rate since early 2009,\u201d the US president told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve recovered from the worst economic crisis since the 1930s.\u201d But Obama also conceded that \u201csoftness\u201d in China, Europe and other economies would continue to challenge US exporters. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in almost a decade in December. Before Friday\u2019s employment data, financial markets had not been pricing in another rate rise until 2017 but following the release they shifted to price in a 50% chance of a move in December. Economists said the mixed report could be read different ways. \u201cIt is difficult to see exactly what the Fed will make of this. But with global financial conditions tightening, this release says \u2018more data needed\u2019 before drawing any firm conclusions about any shift in Fed policy. That does at least suggest that a March hike remains off the table,\u201d said Rob Carnell at ING Financial Markets. \u201cAnd hopefully by then, we will have a better idea of whether things are really slowing, with no further hikes possible, or whether recent data were just a soft patch and the Fed can resume tightening later in the year.\u201d The caution among investors, who had only recently been talking about a possible rate rise next month, reflects downbeat news on the US economy and a shaky global backdrop. Figures last week showed the US economy barely grew in the final three months of 2015, rising at an anaemic 0.7% annual rate. Labour market experts warned that the slowdown in the pace of job creation could continue as employers announce cuts. Earlier this week, Yahoo said that it was shrinking its workforce by 15%. BP will cut 4,000 jobs from its exploration arm and 3,000 jobs from \u201cdownstream\u201d refining, many of which are in Houston, Texas. A merger between Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group will eliminate 10,000 jobs in 2015-2016, according to Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben Van Beurden. According to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a global outplacement company that keeps track of layoffs, employers in the US planned to cut 75,114 jobs in January, up from December\u2019s 15-year low of 23,622. The energy sector alone planned to cut 20,246 jobs, while retailers planned to eliminate 22,246. \u201cHowever confident Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues were when raising interest rates in December, the US data released in January must be giving them food for thought \u2013 and today\u2019s poor non-farm payroll figures are no different,\u201d said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX. \u201cAdding less than 200,000 jobs for the first time since October, coupled with lower than expected GDP and productivity figures, has taken some of the shine off of the previously buoyant US economy.\u201d",

The British bank on Friday agreed to pay the fine to settle US federal and state investigations into alleged abuses against homeowners struggling to keep up with mortgage payments during the 2008 global financial crisis. \u201cThere has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes lenders who engage in abusive business practices,\u201d New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cThe settlement announced today is a joint partnership that will create tough new servicing standards that will ensure fair treatment for HSBC\u2019s borrowers and provide relief to customers across New York State and across the country.\u201d The settlement with the US Department of Justice and 49 states plus DC centres on allegations that the bank \u201crobo-signed\u201d thousands of foreclosure documents \u2013 leading to evictions \u2013 without properly reviewing the paperwork. As part of the fine, HSBC was ordered to pay $59.3m in compensation to borrowers who lost their homes between 2008 and 2012. The money might have to stretch very far, as there are more than 135,000 eligible borrowers in New York state alone. Kathy Madison, chief executive of HSBC Finance Corp, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have reached this settlement and believe it is a positive result that benefits American homeowners and the US housing industry. She said that throughout the crisis HSBC had \u201cstayed focused on home preservation and approached foreclosure as a last resort option\u201d. \u201cThis agreement affirms our commitment to assisting customers who are facing financial difficulties,\u201d she added. The settlement also requires HSBC to change some of its policies and take corrective actions, including giving homeowners the chance to appeal foreclosures. The bank must also install an independent monitor to oversee its compliance with the settlement. The deal is similar to a $26bn settlement struck with five of the nation\u2019s biggest banks in 2012. About 7 million Americans lost their homes during the financial crisis. It is the latest in a string of fines the US has brought against HSBC in recent years, including a $1.9bn fine for a \u201cblatant failure\u201d to implement anti-money laundering controls and wilfully flouting US sanctions.",

      "bodyText": "Citigroup is the latest big bank to say that Britain\u2019s economic growth and the pound would be hit if it leaves the European Union. Citi said Brexit could knock up to 4 percentage points off economic growth over the next four years, and the pound could fall by 15% to 20%. The bank\u2019s Michael Saunders said, \u201cBrexit would probably trigger major economic weakness and a political crisis in the UK...with a 15-20 per cent depreciation of sterling in trade weighted terms, resultant return to import driven inflation and a major policy dilemma.\u201d The warning follows something similar from Goldman Sachs. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day, and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. Over in Greece, thousands of police men (backed up by firemen and coastguard officials) are marching through Athens chanting \u201cwe save lives, don\u2019t drown ours \u201c in reference to pension cuts, writes Helena Smith. All are in uniform. They\u2019re protesting pension funds being amalgamated and demanding that they be excluded from planned reforms by virtue of the sensitivity of their jobs. Protestors have descended on the capital from all over Greece, including the southern Aegean, site of mass refugee arrivals. The union of police employees from Trikala are participating with a banner that reads: \u201cNo to the measures of death. Stop the cuts.\u201d The initial reaction to the US jobs numbers, which showed a weaker than expected rise of 151,000 in non-farm payrolls, was that a US rate rise was therefore off the table in the immediate future. But as the afternoon wore on, investors began to concentrate on the rise in average earnings and the fact that the jobless rate was at an eight year low. So the prospect of a rate rise was suddenly back on the agenda, and as a consequence the dollar rose and markets fell. In reality, the outlook for the Fed\u2019s next move is no clearer than before, and as we know, markets hate uncertainty. So Wall Street led the drive lower, with sentiment not helped by a slump in shares of Linkedin after it fell into the red. Europe lost early gains to end the week on a downbeat note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 50.70 points or 0.86% to 5848.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.14% to 9286.23 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.66% at 4200.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 2.13% at 17,250.26 But Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend, ending 0.37% higher at 8499.5 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 169 points or just over 1%. On the market\u2019s negative reaction to the mixed jobs data, David Morrison of Spreadco said investors needed guidance from the US Federal Reserve: [It was] a bad number on the face of it suggesting that the Fed is less likely to be in any rush to raise rates further at its March meeting, or even for the rest of 2016. If that\u2019s the case then one would\u2019ve expected the dollar to fall, precious metals to build on recent gains and equities to rally. But two hours after the event and with all the US markets fully open that wasn\u2019t what we were seeing. The dollar was up; gold and silver were slipping and what began as a modest pull-back on the major US stock indices was beginning to gather downside momentum. What\u2019s going on? Well, as is often the case the devil was in the detail. The Unemployment Rate fell to 4.9% - its lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Average Hourly Wages rose 0.5% month-on-month (well above the +0.25 expected) and up a total of 2.5% from the same time last year. This presents a problem for the US central bank and that is what worries investors. Of course, it could be that everything flips round by the time we close tonight. But I can\u2019t help thinking that investors are desperate to get some guidance from the Fed. Without that, they will continue to unwind positions and lighten up on risk. Expect further volatility. Markets are extending their losses as investors look to the rise in US average earnings and conclude that perhaps there will be more rate rises from the Federal Reserve this year after all. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 150 points or 0.9%, while in Europe the FTSE 100 has fallen 20 points and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 34 points. The dollar - which has been weak all week - has also recovered some ground after the figures. The dollar index is currently up 0.6% to 97.07 after hitting a 15 week low on Thursday. US investors are also nervous after a slump in the shares of Linkedin after the company fell into the red, which has weighed on other tech companies. Something a bit lighter on non-farms day: Back with the US jobs data, and the weaker than expected headline figure adds to the feeling the Federal Reserve erred in raising interest rates in December, says Larry Elliott: Hindsight is a wonderful thing. It\u2019s easy to be wise after the event and say a decision was a mistake. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that the Federal Reserve would have raised interest rates in December had it known then what it knows now. News that employment growth as measured by the increase in non-farm payrolls was up by 151,000 is just the latest piece of evidence to suggest that the US economy is going through a tough period. Growth in the fourth quarter was weak, sales of durable goods suggest that businesses are reluctant to invest, and consumers are saving rather than spending the windfall from lower oil prices. Even so, Janet Yellen, chairman of the Fed, is not going to hit the panic button and reverse December\u2019s increase \u2013 at least not yet. There are two reasons for that: a U-turn would be a considerable blow to the central bank\u2019s reputation; and the Fed will want to see more evidence before it decides that the world\u2019s biggest economy is heading for a recession rather than simply going through a temporary soft patch. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: The European Commission has said that it accepts the Portuguese budget after some changes, but it is still at risk of non-compliance with EU rules. It will assess the budget again in the spring. It said: The European Commission considers that the Portuguese government\u2019s 2016 Draft Budgetary Plan is at risk of non-compliance with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In its Opinion adopted today, the Commission therefore invites the authorities to take the necessary measures within the national budgetary process to ensure that the 2016 budget will be compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact. Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for the Euro and Social Dialogue, said: \u201c...The Portuguese Government is invited to take the necessary steps to ensure that the 2016 budget is compliant. In spring, the Commission will reassess Portugal\u2019s compliance with its obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact, including under the Excessive Deficit Procedure.\u201d The full statement is here: European Commission adopts Opinion on Portugal\u2019s 2016 Draft Budgetary Plan We mentioned earlier that the European Commission was meeting to discuss Portugal\u2019s anti-austerity budget, and could reject it. Well, perhaps not entirely. The non-farm figures, although the headline number was lower than expected, still suggest further US rate rises this year, according to UniCredit chief economist Harm Bandholz: The [jobs] report unequivocally supports the Federal Reserve\u2019s (and our) baseline view that further gradual rate hikes are warranted. After all, ongoing labor market dynamics are the main driver of consumer spending, which in turn is the main driver of economic growth in the US. A falling unemployment rate and faster wage gains also mean that the Fed is getting closer to meet both of its mandates. That said, many Fed officials have in recent weeks highlighted the unusual uncertainty about the outlook, and stressed that they need to see evidence that global headwinds and tighter financial conditions do not affect the US economy. So while this report is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, the FOMC wants to see more of these signs before pulling the trigger again. And here are the odds on a hike: Following the mixed US employment figures, the US market is slipping back in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 30 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P slipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq fell 0.4% at the open. European markets are off their best levels, with the FTSE 100 now up just 7 points after earlier climbing nearly 50 points. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac are also up just 20 and 14 points respectively. Brent crude has dipped 0.6% to $34.25 a barrel. So, fewer US rate cuts this year than previously forecast perhaps. More reaction to the non-farm numbers. And here\u2019s a gloomy one from Gary Chaison, Professor of Industrial Relations at Clark University: There is no joy in this month\u2019s jobs report and no sign that things have turned around. The recovery isn\u2019t happening, it isn\u2019t expanding and the labor participation rate is holding. While wages are up a bit, it isn\u2019t enough to make an impact. A lot of workers have substituted good jobs for poor jobs or aren\u2019t working at all which is why the labor participating rate continues to hold. I think the real problem is a lack of consumer confidence that we\u2019re going to come out of this, the economy can recover or we can fall back into a recession. For the huge recession we had, we should be seeing a huge recovery and this is impacting the voters and public in general. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: Signs of a slowdown in hiring, still-weak annual pay growth and disappointing survey data, all pitched alongside an adverse financial market environment so far this year, reduce the odds of the Fed hiking rates again in March. \u201cThe unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 4.9% as the economy added 151,000 jobs in January, according to official estimates, signalling a marked slowing in the rate of job creation after the surge seen late last year. However, this is still a robust rate of employment growth, and a trend strong enough to keep bringing unemployment down. Furthermore, December\u2019s numbers had in part reflected stronger than usual construction sector hiring due to unseasonably warm weather... It would therefore not be surprising if Fed policymakers decided to await clear signs of an upturn in the economic data flow and easing of financial conditions before committing to more tightening. Some commentators have concluded January\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll was good, apart from the bad bits. Others reckon it was a bad report, apart from the good bits. So on balance, it\u2019s probably OK. There are around 6 million Americans stuck in part-time jobs who want to work full time, down from around 6.8 million a year ago. Today\u2019s report says: These individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full-time jobs. And that\u2019s despite a steady-pickup in full-time job creation since 2011. Mixed but not too bad, is the verdict of Rob Carnell at ING on the non-farm numbers, with a March rise in US interest rates now very unlikely: The January labour market survey was very mixed, though the headline payrolls figure was on the soft side, at only 151,000, with downward revisions to the previous months data (262,000 down from 292,000). But aside from this, the report wasn\u2019t all that bad. The household survey registered an eye-popping and rather improbable 615,000 increase, which added to the 485,000 gain in December suggests more than 1.1 million jobs were created in the last two months. That takes some swallowing, but helped to push the unemployment rate down a further notch to 4.9%. But adding to the sense that this is a mixed, rather than bad reading, both hours worked and average earnings also came in on the stronger side, with some upwards revisions on the wages side. It is difficult to see exactly what the Fed will make of this. But with global financial conditions tightening, this release says \u201cmore data needed\u201d before drawing any firm conclusions about any shift in Fed policy. That does at least suggest that a March hike remains off the table. And hopefully by then, we will have a better idea of whether things are really slowing, with no further hikes possible, or whether recent data were just a soft patch and the Fed can resume tightening later in the year. Several industries took on more staff last month, says the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Here\u2019s a breakdown of where new jobs were created in January: The retail sector: +58,000 jobs, Employment in food services and drinking places: +47,000. Health care: +37,000 Manufacturing: +29,000 jobs in January Financial activities: +18,000. But, employment declined in private educational services, transportation and warehousing, and mining. The Non-farm Payroll is online here. US futures - which before the non-farm figures were predicting a 19 point gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average - are now suggesting a 65 point decline when the market opens. These latest non-farm payroll numbers are another set of poor data since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: However confident Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues were when raising interest rates in December, the US data released in January must be giving them food for thought \u2013 and today\u2019s poor non-farm payroll figures are no different. Adding less than 200 thousand jobs for the first time since October, coupled with lower than expected GDP and productivity figures, has taken some of the shine off of the previously buoyant US economy. Yellen won\u2019t be worrying too much just yet, as other major economies have pared down growth forecasts amid global volatility. Many observers will surely be adopting a wait and see approach. Josh Raymond, director at London-based broker XTB, sums it up: It\u2019s a mixed bag. The dollar is fluctuating wildly as traders (and their algorithms) try to decide if this is a good jobs report, or a bad one. Here\u2019s the unemployment rate: This is important. Average earnings rose by 0.5% month-on-month in January, and were up 2.5% over the last year. That\u2019s a decent pick-up, suggesting that workers are feeling the benefits of the recovery. And that will reassure the Federal Reserve that it didn\u2019t blunder by raising interest rates in December. December\u2019s payroll has been revised down to +262,000, down from the previous estimate of +292,000 But it\u2019s not all bad - November\u2019s has been revised up to +280,000, from +252,000. Effectively, almost 30,000 new hires have been moved around. Nothing to panic about. Here we go! The US economy created 151,000 new jobs last month, according to the Non-Farm Payroll which is flashing on the wires right now. That\u2019s rather weaker than the 190,000 expected by economists. The US unemployment rate has dipped again, though, to just 4.9%. That\u2019s an eight-year low. Lots more to follow.... Economist Frederik Ducrozet predicts solid earnings growth.... If the economists are right, today\u2019s non-farm payroll will show the slowest job creation since September: Thank goodness. We\u2019re about to get the final major economic news of the week. At 1.30pm GMT sharp, or 8.30am Washington time, we\u2019ll get a insight into the state of the US jobs market. Even though Non-Farm Payroll is notoriously unpredictable, and regularly revised, it will still set the mood in the markets - possibly for some time. So, what should we watch for? 1) The first question is how many new jobs were created in January? The consensus figure is that the NFP rose by 190,000. That would be a slowdown on December\u2019s 292,000 (which could be revised), but not a disaster. However, Wall Street economists are quite divided - Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have predicted 170,000 new jobs, while French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is optimistically expecting 245,000. 2) Wage growth is also important. The Fed is unlikely to raise rates again until it sees decent earnings growth. Economists predict that wages probably increased 2.2% annually, or 0.3% month-on-month. Not too impressive, if so. 3) Where were the jobs created? The report could show that the energy industry kept slashing staff, in response to the fall in the oil price. But how are manufacturers faring? If they aren\u2019t hiring, that could suggest the factory sector is struggling. It will take something remarkable today to prevent the US dollar posting its worst week since the last global downturn. Since Monday morning, the dollar has lost almost 3% against a basket of major currencies, as traders reassess the prospects for American monetary policy following signs of economic weakness at home and abroad. The possibility that we see zero US interest rises this year weakened the greenback against almost every other currency. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Barton has tweeted the details: Yesterday, Greece\u2019s riot police clashed with protesters as Athens was gripped by a huge anti-austerity protest. Today, officers have been protesting outside prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s mansion, objecting to cuts to their own pensions. There will be more protests later, as the Kathimerini newspaper flags up: The brief rally dispersed without any upheaval but police are expected to monitor a larger anti-austerity rally scheduled to take place in central Athens on Friday afternoon when fire service workers are to join police officers in protesting the planned changes to the pension system. For the second day running, mining stocks are going on a remarkable rally. Anglo American is leading the charge, up 10%, adding to Thursday\u2019s 19% surge, with commodity player Glencore up over 5%. It looks like traders are anticipating that miners will benefit if (as seems likely) the US Federal Reserve resists raising interest rates much this year. That, the theory goes, makes the US dollar weaker and means commodity prices rise (you need more dollars to buy the same lump of iron ore). This is all bad news for the speculators who have \u2018shorted\u2019 mining stocks - selling shares they don\u2019t own, and planning to buy them back at a lower price in future. Once that bet goes wrong, speculators can be caught in a nasty \u2018bear squeeze\u2019, scrambling over each other to buy shares to cover their short position. The FT\u2019s Neil Hume, though, wonders if something else is happening at Anglo.... ArcelorMittal has become the latest company to count the cost of the commosity crunch The world\u2019s largest steelmaker is to raise $3bn through a rights issue to strengthen its finances, news that sent its shares sliding by over 7%. After weeks of rocky markets, traders are grateful that there\u2019s really not much going on today. That will change when the US jobs report lands at 1.30pm. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says we should enjoy the quiet while we can: \u201cEquity markets are pretty much flat amid a welcome calming of recent volatility as investors adopt their traditional wait-and-see ahead of the US monthly jobs report, even if it should have little bearing on the topic and driver of the week - the Fed\u2019s ability to raise rates in 2016 amid soggy data and protracted financial market gyrations following its December hike. Two and a half months after taking office, Portugal\u2019s left-wing government is heading into a showdown with EU authorities. The Commission is holding a special college meeting today, to discuss Lisbon\u2019s failure to submit tax and spending plans that meets EU rules. It could reject Portugal\u2019s new anti-austerity budget - which would be a pretty incendiary development. Politico\u2019s Ryan Heath sets the scene: Portugal yesterday adopted its budget without waiting for Commission approval. Now, if the budget is rejected in Brussels \u201cit would mark the first time a eurozone government has had its spending plan vetoed.\u201d Some suspect that a small country (Portugal) is once again being targeted not only on the merits of its own problems but to make a point to a bigger country (Italy) with similar issues that the EU dare not touch directly. I can\u2019t see Portugal meekly accepting a rebuke. Its current budget will create deficits above the 3% limit in both 2016 and 2017 -- as the government tries to unravel years of austerity and spur more growth. Yougov\u2019s claim that the Brexit campaign have a nine-point lead has been gently rubbished by Andrew Cooper of rival polling group Populus: European stock markets have opened cautiously, with little news to stir investors ahead of the US jobs report in just five hours time. The German and French markets have picked up, led by exporters, following a small dip in the value of the euro against the US dollar this morning. In London, mining shares are dropping after posting big jumps yesterday. Anglo American, which surged by almost 20% on Thursday, are down 4%. But the City is really waiting for the NFP report, because it could shunt the dollar one way or the other. Tony Cross of Trustnet explains: Looking ahead, it\u2019s the US non-farm payrolls that will dominate in the short term as this could readily counter the dollar weakness that we\u2019ve seen creeping in of late. Critically this has been pushing commodity prices higher and accounted for at least part of the short squeeze that was seen as buoying the miners yesterday, so anything that looks too hot in the data could have repercussions going into the weekend break. UBS analyst Paul Donovan isn\u2019t impressed by the media clamour over Non-Farm Payroll Day. Peppering his morning research note with sarcastic exclamation marks, he writes: Employment report Friday!!! A frequently revised statistic about a tiny change in a very large labour market!!! Cue the media frenzy right now. The consensus is for a generally OK report in aggregate. Sorry, Paul. There\u2019s a lot of chatter about Brexit in the City this morning. Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, has told the BBC that companies don\u2019t appear to be freezing spending ahead of the EU referendum (which could come in June) Asked about Brexit risks, he said: \u201cWe have not yet seen, regarding investment intentions, any weakening of those of late,but obviously it\u2019s something we watch pretty closely.\u201d But a glance at the front page of The Times could encourage companies to rethink their spending plans. A new survey puts the Out campaign in the lead, by 45% to 36% (with 19% of people unsure). But before we cement up the Channel Tunnel, let\u2019s remember that the polling industry has been far from infallible recently (it got the Scottish referendum, and the last general election, wrong). And these kind of stories are also likely to get Remain supporters out to the polling booth. Which may be why they\u2019re expected to win: Most Asian stock markets fell today, as traders hunkered down ahead of this afternoon\u2019s non-farm payroll report. In Japan, the Nikkei fell by another 1.3%, amid nervousness that the yen might continue to strengthen against the US dollar (bad for Japanese exporters and inflation). The Chinese stock market also fell, losing around 0.6% in a quiet trading session. Many investors have already quit the bourses and headed home to celebrate the Chinese New Year The European trading day has started with weak economic data out of Germany. German factory orders declined by 0.7% month-on-month in December, according to stats body Destatis. Economists expected a 0.5% drop, following a 1.5% jump in orders in November. These monthly surveys can be quite volatile, but it suggests Germany\u2019s economy ended 2015 on the back foot. And it can\u2019t just be blamed on emerging markets. Orders from outside the eurozone actually rose, but that couldn\u2019t make up for falling demand from Germany\u2019s euro neighbours, or within Germany itself. Bloomberg has more details: Domestic orders fell 2.5%, the ministry said, while euro-area orders slumped 6.9% and demand from outside the currency bloc rose 5.5 percent. Orders for investment goods declined 0.5, and for consumer goods surged 4.3 percent. \u201cOrder activity somewhat recovered in the fourth quarter,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cIncreasing demand from countries outside the euro area indicates a gradual recovery the global economy. However, industry expectations have somewhat clouded, signaling a more modest recovery in industrial activity. Good morning. Another turbulent week in the markets is nearly over. But there\u2019s just one major hurdle to get over first \u2013 the US unemployment report, due at 1.30pm GMT. January\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that around 192,000 new jobs were created in America last month (excluding the volatile agriculture sector). The unemployment rate is projected to stay at 5% -- just half the level in the eurozone. And wage growth could remain elusive, with earnings expected to rise just 2.2% year-on-year. Economists will be scrutinising the data closely, for signs that the labor market is weakening. Recent economic surveys from the US have been somewhat disappointing, with service sector growth slowing last month. A disappointing payroll report could renew fears over the US economy, and mean the US central bank cannot raise interest rates for several months. Perhaps not even this year? The US dollar is already on track for its worst week since 2009, and it could slump again if the NFP comes in below forecasts. Angus Nicholson of IG explains: A big miss on the NFP numbers (150,000 or less) would see a further dive in the US dollar, killing expectations of any further rate hikes by the Fed. Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to open cautiously, with investors sitting on their hands until the report comes out. Also coming up today: A row is brewing in Brussels with Portugal, whose new left-wing government has angered eurocrats by submitting a budget that doesn\u2019t meet the EU\u2019s fiscal rules. More on that shortly.... And Bank of England governor Ben Broadbent is on a media tour this morning:",

The dollar was up; gold and silver were slipping and what began as a modest pull-back on the major US stock indices was beginning to gather downside momentum. What\u2019s going on?</p> <p>Well, as is often the case the devil was in the detail. The Unemployment Rate fell to 4.9% - its lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. Average Hourly Wages rose 0.5% month-on-month (well above the +0.25 expected) and up a total of 2.5% from the same time last year. This presents a problem for the US central bank and that is what worries investors.</p> <p>Of course, it could be that everything flips round by the time we close tonight. But I can\u2019t help thinking that investors are desperate to get some guidance from the Fed. Without that, they will continue to unwind positions and lighten up on risk.

And hopefully by then, we will have a better idea of whether things are really slowing, with no further hikes possible, or whether recent data were just a soft patch and the Fed can resume tightening later in the year.<br></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b4a730e4b00a3b344ab7b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-05T13:49:23.572Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Several industries took on more staff last month, says the Bureau of Labour Statistics. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of where new jobs were created in January:</p> <ul> <li>The retail sector: +58,000 jobs,<br></li> <li>Employment in food services and drinking places: +47,000.<br></li> <li>Health care: +37,000<br></li> <li>Manufacturing: +29,000 jobs in January<br></li> <li>Financial activities: +18,000.<br></li> </ul> <p>But, employment declined in private educational services, transportation and warehousing, and mining.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">The Non-farm Payroll is online here</a>.</h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b4a809e4b0be7e084fe9eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-05T13:48:37.857Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US futures - which before the non-farm figures were predicting a 19 point gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average - are now suggesting a 65 point decline when the market opens.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56b4a797e4b0be7e084fe9e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-05T13:47:23.575Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These latest non-farm payroll numbers are another set of poor data since the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However confident Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues were when raising interest rates in December, the US data released in January must be giving them food for thought \u2013 and today\u2019s poor non-farm payroll figures are no different.</p> <p>Adding less than 200 thousand jobs for the first time since October, coupled with lower than expected GDP and productivity figures, has taken some of the shine off of the previously buoyant US economy.</p> <p>Yellen won\u2019t be worrying too much just yet, as other major economies have pared down growth forecasts amid global volatility.

Even though Non-Farm Payroll is notoriously unpredictable, and regularly revised, it will still set the mood in the markets - possibly for some time.</p> <p>So, what should we watch for?</p> <p><strong>1) The first question is how many new jobs were created in January?</strong> The consensus figure is that the NFP rose by 190,000. That would be a slowdown on December\u2019s 292,000 (which could be revised), but not a disaster.</p> <p>However, Wall Street economists are quite divided - <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong> have predicted 170,000 new jobs, while French bank <strong>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong> is optimistically expecting 245,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/695565665269366784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ht\" dir=\"ltr\">US <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFP?src=hash\">#NFP</a> Guesses<br><br>SocGen 245k<br>BarCap/Citi 225k<br>HSBC 214k <br>JP AM 209k <br><br>Exp/CS/UBS 190k<br><br>MS 180k<br>Wells 178k<br>DB/JP Chase 175k<br>GS/BofAML 170k</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/695565665269366784\">February 5, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>2) Wage growth is also important.</strong> The Fed is unlikely to raise rates again until it sees decent earnings growth. Economists predict that wages probably increased 2.2% annually, or 0.3% month-on-month. Not too impressive, if so.</p> <p><strong>3) Where were the jobs created?</strong> The report could show that the energy industry kept slashing staff, in response to the fall in the oil price. But how are manufacturers faring?

After a two-year dispute, all crew will be allowed to wear trousers if they choose, undoing part of the dress code imposed on new recruits who have joined the company since 2012. The crew\u2019s union, Unite, said BA was \u201cjoining the 21st century\u201d by making the change, a decision made after an internal test case. Established crew of either sex have long been allowed to wear trousers, but the new \u201cmixed fleet\u201d of crew \u2013 employed under inferior terms since the strikes in 2010 and 2011 \u2013 were subject to different rules. Female cabin crew on the 3,000-strong mixed fleet had to wear a skirt unless exempt on medical or religious grounds. Unite said 83% of its members at the airline wanted the option of wearing trousers for warmth and protection. A BA spokesperson said: \u201cOur mixed fleet team wear the \u2018ambassador\u2019 British Airways uniform. While trousers are not a standard part of this uniform, colleagues wishing to wear them can request this through their manager.\u201d Unite regional officer Matt Smith said: \u201cBritish Airways\u2019 stance was unbefitting of a modern airline in the modern age, and demonstrates that Unite will not allow cases like this to go unchallenged. \u201cNot only is the choice to wear trousers a victory for equality it is also a victory for common sense and testament to the organising campaign of our members. \u201cFemale cabin crew no longer have to shiver in the cold, wet and snow of wintery climates, but also can be afforded the protection of trousers at destinations where there is a risk of malaria or the Zika virus.\u201d Crew in BA\u2019s worldwide (long-haul) and Euro fleets have been able to wear trousers since 2003, after a uniform overhaul by designer Julien Macdonald. Cabin crew have suffered recent reversals in the wider trouser war, with Etihad removing the option in its revamp last year. In Britain, Virgin Atlantic reviews requests on a case-by-case basis, with skirts the norm. Only EasyJet crew are routinely able to wear trousers. Ryanair has yet to make trousers available, although since last year its female crew are no longer encouraged to pose in bikinis for an annual calendar.",

But it\u2019s hard to imagine that the Federal Reserve would have raised interest rates in December had it known then what it knows now. News that employment growth as measured by the increase in non-farm payrolls was up by 151,000 is just the latest piece of evidence to suggest that the US economy is going through a tough period. Growth in the fourth quarter was weak, sales of durable goods suggest that businesses are reluctant to invest, and consumers are saving rather than spending the windfall from lower oil prices. Even so, Janet Yellen, chairman of the Fed, is not going to hit the panic button and reverse December\u2019s increase \u2013 at least not yet. There are two reasons for that: a U-turn would be a considerable blow to the central bank\u2019s reputation; and the Fed will want to see more evidence before it decides that the world\u2019s biggest economy is heading for a recession rather than simply going through a temporary soft patch. There was enough in the latest jobs report to support a wait-and-see stance. The increase in payrolls was certainly smaller than Wall Street had been expecting, and December\u2019s rise was revised down too. On the other hand, an increase in the length of the average working week and a 0.5% increase in weekly earnings will be taken by the Fed as evidence that the labour market is not quite as weak as the headline payrolls figure would suggest. When the Fed raised rates in December, there was an assumption it would move for a second time in March. Two months of market turmoil and indifferent economic news means that is now completely out of the question. Employment is a lagging indicator of economic performance: it says more about what was happening a few months ago than it does about the present state of activity. The Fed will sit tight and wait to see whether the strong jobs data in the last few months of 2015 was as good as it gets.

    "webTitle": "'Flash crash' hearing told spoofing does not justify trader's extradition to US", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The practice of spoofing, where a financial trader signals orders to sell shares that they do not intend to fulfil, is not a crime in the UK and should not be used to justify the extradition of a British citizen to the US, Navinder Singh Sarao\u2019s lawyer has told a court. The US government alleges that Sarao\u2019s behaviour helped cause a sharp fall in Wall Street equity prices on 6 May 2010, widely known as the \u201cflash crash\u201d, and is seeking his extradition to stand trial in a US court. James Lewis QC, speaking on the second day of Sarao\u2019s extradition hearing in London on Friday, said that in any case, the defendant was not guilty of making a false representation of his trading intentions in order to mislead the market. He said Sarao\u2019s frequent sell orders were genuine in the sense that, while they were in the market, they could be fulfilled and in fact sometimes were fulfilled. \u201cThe prosecution says the defendant is guilty of spoofing and maintains that the way he traded \u2026 involved the practice of spoofing, which involves the deliberate manipulation of prices,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWithout an admission as to Sarao\u2019s conduct, I would point out that spoofing is not a crime in the UK. There has been no English case of spoofing and no one has ever been convicted in the UK.\u201d Sarao\u2019s defence team is arguing that the alleged offences do not amount to an \u201cextradition offence\u201d within the meaning of the 2003 Extradition Act. They also claim that if the conduct is found to be criminal, it should be prosecuted in the UK. Under English extradition laws, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to show Sarao\u2019s conduct would amount to a crime in the UK. The defence argued that Sarao\u2019s trading was not central to the flash crash in the US, a prime reason for the request for him to be extradited. Joel Smith QC, another defence lawyer, said Prof Lawrence Harris, an expert witness on the flash crash who gave evidence through videolink on Thursday, had concluded that Sarao\u2019s trading was not a significant contributor to the crash. \u201cThis has been put in to jazz up the request, but it is not right or fair,\u201d he said. The US Department of Justice claims that Sarao and his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, made \u00a326m illegally over five years. The Hounslow-based former bank worker and Brunel University student faces 22 charges including wire fraud and commodities fraud. Sarao denies all the charges. Mark Summers, representing the US authorities, said there was no doubt that the harm stemming from Sarao\u2019s actions was done in the US and that he should be tried there. \u201cProtecting the integrity of markets is of great importance,\u201d said Summers, who added that most of the investors affected by the defendant\u2019s trading were investors or intermediaries based in the US. District judge Quentin Purdy expressed concern for the defendant, who for a second day sat in court with his head down for most of the time. Lewis reminded the judge that his client had Asperger syndrome and was having treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The judge said that he had a lot of material to sift through and would make a decision on extradition on 23 March. He told Sarao that his bail terms would be extended but that he would be arrested if he failed to attend court on the assigned day. He initially set a \u00a35m surety as part of Sarao\u2019s bail conditions, which the trader claimed that he was unable to pay. Sarao was released on conditional bail in August after providing a \u00a350,000 surety. The extradition hearing took place at Westminster magistrates court. Outside the court Sarao\u2019s solicitor, Richard Egan, asked for the link with the \u2018flash crash\u2019 to be downplayed. \u201cSo much of the story has focused on the flash crash. But it is self evident that this link is tenuous.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The practice of spoofing, where a financial trader signals orders to sell shares that they do not intend to fulfil, is not a crime in the UK and should not be used to justify the extradition of a British citizen to the US, Navinder Singh Sarao\u2019s lawyer has told a court. </p> <p>The US government alleges that Sarao\u2019s behaviour helped cause a sharp fall in Wall Street equity prices on 6 May 2010, widely known as the \u201cflash crash\u201d, and is seeking his extradition to stand trial in a US court.</p> <p>James Lewis QC, speaking on the second day of Sarao\u2019s extradition hearing in London on Friday, said that in any case, the defendant was not guilty of making a false representation of his trading intentions in order to mislead the market.</p> <p>He said Sarao\u2019s frequent sell orders were genuine in the sense that, while they were in the market, they could be fulfilled and in fact sometimes were fulfilled.</p> <p>\u201cThe prosecution says the defendant is guilty of spoofing and maintains that the way he traded \u2026 involved the practice of spoofing, which involves the deliberate manipulation of prices,\u201d Lewis said.</p> <p>\u201cWithout an admission as to Sarao\u2019s conduct, I would point out that spoofing is not a crime in the UK. There has been no English case of spoofing and no one has ever been convicted in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Sarao\u2019s defence team is arguing that the alleged offences do not amount to an \u201cextradition offence\u201d within the meaning of the 2003 Extradition Act. They also claim that if the conduct is found to be criminal, it should be prosecuted in the UK.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Under English extradition laws, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to show Sarao\u2019s conduct would amount to a crime in the UK. </p> <p>The defence argued that Sarao\u2019s trading was not central to the flash crash in the US, a prime reason for the request for him to be extradited.</p> <p>Joel Smith QC, another defence lawyer, said Prof Lawrence Harris, an expert witness on the flash crash who gave evidence through videolink on Thursday, had concluded that Sarao\u2019s trading was not a significant contributor to the crash. \u201cThis has been put in to jazz up the request, but it is not right or fair,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice claims that Sarao and his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, made \u00a326m illegally over five years. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Hounslow-based former bank worker and Brunel University student faces 22 charges including wire fraud and commodities fraud. Sarao denies all the charges.</p> <p>Mark Summers, representing the US authorities, said there was no doubt that the harm stemming from Sarao\u2019s actions was done in the US and that he should be tried there.</p> <p>\u201cProtecting the integrity of markets is of great importance,\u201d said Summers, who added that most of the investors affected by the defendant\u2019s trading were investors or intermediaries based in the US.</p> <p>District judge Quentin Purdy expressed concern for the defendant, who for a second day sat in court with his head down for most of the time.</p> <p>Lewis reminded the judge that his client had Asperger syndrome and was having treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>The judge said that he had a lot of material to sift through and would make a decision on extradition on 23 March.</p> <p>He told Sarao that his bail terms would be extended but that he would be arrested if he failed to attend court on the assigned day. He initially set a \u00a35m surety as part of Sarao\u2019s bail conditions, which the trader claimed that he was unable to pay. Sarao was released on conditional bail in August after providing a \u00a350,000 surety.</p> <p>The extradition hearing took place at Westminster magistrates court.</p> <p>Outside the court Sarao\u2019s solicitor, Richard Egan, asked for the link with the \u2018flash crash\u2019 to be downplayed.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of the story has focused on the flash crash. But it is self evident that this link is tenuous.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

Unfortunately the border between Sudan and Egypt was closed at the time so we had to ship the land rover back to the UK from Port Sudan. We then got to Egypt by boat up the Red Sea and then to UK. We had to register and MOT the Land Rover in the UK, but it was not manufactured to EU standards and was set to fail. The guy felt sorry for us and passed it on the basis it was going back to Africa, which it did after we sold it. </p> <p>I returned to Africa a year later and got married. My wife Ruth and I lived in Botswana for 10 years and owned several Defenders which were well used in the Kalahari and Okavango Delta. We returned to UK in 1998 and live in the Cotswolds but still visit friends in Africa as much as possible. Sadly they drive Toyota Landcrusers now.

Our eventual route was through Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda,Zaire, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, Algeria, Morocco, Spain and home! We covered all types of terrain from deserts to jungles, mountains to plains. Travelling was generally safe apart from the major cities. Outside of the towns people were intensely curious.

I started out as a teacher in UK, where I had a Series 2 (2L) diesel for several years which I used for outward bound work, mostly in North Wales. When no one was looking I also trialled it with the Land Rover Owners Club and have a cup to prove it! The offer of a teaching job came up in Nairobi while I was looking for a Teacher Training College post in UK. So we sold the house, used the profit to buy a LWB Land Rover, upped sticks with a young family and headed for Kenya. That Series 2 LWB took us to some pretty wild places in East Africa for four years. It was sold to the Nairobi National Museum when I left. During my time there I regularly took students to the Nairobi National Park as many of them had never seen any \u201cbig game.\u201d </p> <p>I managed to find an old 1954 Series 1 when I returned to the UK and for many years this towed horse boxes around the country. It is presently in pieces in my son-in-law\u2019s barn undergoing a major rebuild, hopefully to pristine original specifications.

It was a huge decision on my part. On his, not so much! The planning and packing was a logistic nightmare. It was a long way from my native Essex. But I was totally seduced by the romanticism of the whole idea.<br><br></p> <p>The trip took several months driving the route outlined. It was of course totally amazing. And actually at times really really hard. At one stage we had to drive 2800 kilometres without being able to fill up with petrol. We had to carry it in jerry cans on the roof rack which was dangerous of course. We also had to skirt the war zone in Uganda and avoid Zaire because they had closed the borders.<br></p> <p>We had planned to work when we arrived in Kenya. The dentist had been fairly itinerant and thought it would be easy to pick up casual dentistry. In the event, surprising to both of us, he couldn\u2019t find any work. I on the other hand, as a trained actress, picked up a job as the temporary leading lady in the English repertory company The Donovan Maule Theatre Company.<br><br></p> <p>As to whether we are still together, the dentist\u2019s response today is \u2018\u201donly just.\u201d<br>But, astonishing to both of us, we have two adult daughters and a period of living in South Africa for nine years behind us.

While we\u2019re admiring classics, the Clarks sandals must surely get a mention.\u201d David Marsh \u2018We sold the house, used the profit to buy a LWB Land Rover, upped sticks with a young family and headed for Kenya\u2019 \u201cI worked in Kenya in the late 1960s/early 70s training biology teachers at Kenyatta College. I started out as a teacher in UK, where I had a Series 2 (2L) diesel for several years which I used for outward bound work, mostly in North Wales. When no one was looking I also trialled it with the Land Rover Owners Club and have a cup to prove it! The offer of a teaching job came up in Nairobi while I was looking for a Teacher Training College post in UK. So we sold the house, used the profit to buy a LWB Land Rover, upped sticks with a young family and headed for Kenya. That Series 2 LWB took us to some pretty wild places in East Africa for four years. It was sold to the Nairobi National Museum when I left. During my time there I regularly took students to the Nairobi National Park as many of them had never seen any \u201cbig game.\u201d I managed to find an old 1954 Series 1 when I returned to the UK and for many years this towed horse boxes around the country. It is presently in pieces in my son-in-law\u2019s barn undergoing a major rebuild, hopefully to pristine original specifications. I wish I\u2019d kept it!\u201d Mark Boulton \u2018I picked up a job as the temporary leading lady in the English repertory company The Donovan Maule Theatre Company.\u2019 \u201cVery soon after I started dating a South African dentist in 1979, he popped the question (no, not that one); \u201cHow would you like to drive through Africa?\u201d Quite a chat up line, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. We set off in the Land Rover that he had owned since 1974. It was a huge decision on my part. On his, not so much! The planning and packing was a logistic nightmare. It was a long way from my native Essex. But I was totally seduced by the romanticism of the whole idea. The trip took several months driving the route outlined. It was of course totally amazing. And actually at times really really hard. At one stage we had to drive 2800 kilometres without being able to fill up with petrol. We had to carry it in jerry cans on the roof rack which was dangerous of course. We also had to skirt the war zone in Uganda and avoid Zaire because they had closed the borders. We had planned to work when we arrived in Kenya. The dentist had been fairly itinerant and thought it would be easy to pick up casual dentistry. In the event, surprising to both of us, he couldn\u2019t find any work. I on the other hand, as a trained actress, picked up a job as the temporary leading lady in the English repertory company The Donovan Maule Theatre Company. As to whether we are still together, the dentist\u2019s response today is \u2018\u201donly just.\u201d But, astonishing to both of us, we have two adult daughters and a period of living in South Africa for nine years behind us. The Land Rover died in 1983.\u201d Judy Jarvis You can view all your Land Rover Defender photos and stories via GuardianWitness",

Anglo American has jumped 10.5% or 34p to 3623p, after a near 20% surge on Thursday. The mining group is benefiting from recent dollar weakness which has lifted commodity prices by making them more affordable to holders of other currencies. The US currency has been on the slide after recent weak data suggested that the Federal Reserve\u2019s proposal to hike interest rates further this year could be in doubt. Sentiment could change with a strong non-farm payroll number later but for the moment mining groups are seeing the benefit. Traders said miners were also moving higher after short sellers who had been betting on a continuing fall in the shares were forced to cover their positions as the sector rallied. Anglo was also lifted by news that investment group Blackrock had taken its stake above 5%. Analysts at SP Angel said: Stories that Anglo American might fall out of the FTSE 100 index may have encouraged hedge funds and other investors to short the stock. An unexpected and sudden weakening in the US dollar on expectations for ongoing low interest rates helped oil prices, gold and other metals to jump. The recovery in gold and other commodity prices yesterday prompted a rally causing a likely rapid unwinding of short position and a rush to contain losses by short sellers. We suspect that Chinese hedge funds and CTAs which had been shorting commodities have been limiting positions ahead of the new year break. Anglo American is seen as more sensitive to precious and base metals than the other majors which tend to derive more of their earnings from iron ore and other bulk commodities. Anglo shares are up 31% on the week so far after a 22% gain last week. In the rest of the sector Glencore has jumped nearly 5% to 104.4p while Antofagasta is up 2.8p to 433.1p. BHP Billiton is 1.3p better at 713.9p but Rio Tinto is down 16p at \u00a318.42.",

      "bodyText": "Ikea has lost the rights to its own name in Indonesia after the country\u2019s highest court ruled that the trademark was owned by a local company. Indonesian rattan furniture company PT Ratania Khatulistiwa registered its Ikea trademark in December 2013. It\u2019s an acronym of Intan Khatulistiwa Esa Abadi, which refers to the rattan industry. The supreme court said the Swedish retailer, which registered its trademark in Indonesia in 2010, had not actively used its trademark in three consecutive years for commercial purposes, which meant it could be deleted under Indonesia\u2019s trademark law. The ruling came in May last year but was only published on Thursday, online, by the court. Ikea\u2019s only outlet in Indonesia opened at Tangerang, near the capital, Jakarta, in late 2014. A supreme court spokesman said on Friday that the ruling was not unanimous. One of the three judges on the panel argued that the trademark law could not be applied to a company the size of Ikea, which is much bigger than the plaintiff, Ratania. The Indonesian firm took its case to the central Jakarta district court in mid-2014, when Ikea was building its first store in Indonesia. The district court ruled in September 2014 that the trademark was owned by Ratania and ordered Ikea to stop using its own name, which is an acronym for its founder Ingvar Kamprad and the farm Elmtaryd and village Agunnaryd where he grew up. The Swedish firm then appealed to the supreme court.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has not seen any signs that UK companies are scaling back their investment plans because of uncertainty caused by the looming EU referendum, a top Bank official said. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent was asked how the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, likely to be held in June, was affecting the economy. He told BBC radio 5 Live: \u201cWe have not yet seen, regarding investment intentions, any weakening of those of late, but obviously it\u2019s something we watch pretty closely.\u201d US investment bank Goldman Sachs warned on Thursday that sterling could fall 15-20% if Britain votes to leave the EU. Such an outcome would alarm foreign investors and put them off injecting capital into Britain, placing pressure on the current account deficit. The pound slipped 0.4% against the dollar on Friday, falling to $1.4531. Broadbent\u2019s comments came as a YouGov poll conducted for the Times showed that the \u201cout\u201d campaign has achieved a record lead as the public rejected the terms of Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s draft reform deal with the EU. The survey found that 45% of voters now want to leave the EU against 36% who want to stay. Nineteen percent do not know or would not vote in the referendum. JPMorgan Chase economist Allan Monks cautioned that the poll was conducted at a time when \u201cmedia write-ups of the draft deal were scathing\u201d. He went on to say: \u201cTwo major factors will be the extent to which fear of the unknown persuades the undecideds to remain, and issues surrounding migration will stoke support to leave. The latter is hard to predict and depends partly on how the refugee crisis is handled this year. \u201cBut backing to remain from leading politicians and businesses could help to make up the minds of those currently undecided. Either way, at this stage the risk of a vote to leave appears real. And regardless of the ultimate effect this would have on the UK, we believe the transitional costs would be high.\u201d Broadbent also said that the UK was enjoying a \u201csolid\u201d recovery but added there was \u201cno great urgency\u201d to put up interest rates. He described the fall in oil prices as a \u201cnet good\u201d for the economy. A global oil glut and weaker demand have pushed crude prices down by 75% since mid-214. Brent crude, the global benchmark, traded at $34.08 a barrel on Friday, down 1.1%. Broadbent said real wages (adjusted for inflation) had risen 7% in the last two years \u2013 the fastest growth rate in nearly 15 years. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the drop in oil prices. That\u2019s boosted consumption and UK growth overall,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only in the latter part of 2012, once confidence about the eurozone had begun to come back, that the UK economy really got going. So, I would date the recovery not from 2008 or 2009, but actually from early 2013. And since then we\u2019ve enjoyed three years of pretty solid growth, certainly in the labour market.\u201d",
