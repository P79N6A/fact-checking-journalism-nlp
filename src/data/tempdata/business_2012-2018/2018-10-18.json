      "bodyText": "MPs have urged ministers to bring forward their ban on new petrol and diesel car sales by eight years to 2032, to avoid the UK being left \u201cin the passenger seat\u201d in the global switch to electric vehicles. Government plans for a 2040 ban on fossil fuel-powered cars and vans across Britain were unambitious and did not even show leadership within the UK, given Scotland has set itself an earlier target, the business, energy and industrial strategy committee said. The group said that although the UK was a world leader on electric cars, ranked fourth globally in sales last year, that status was at risk due to the government being too vague on its targets. Ministers and officials were unable to explain to the committee, for example, what they meant by their promise to ensure all new vehicles were \u201ceffectively zero emissions\u201d. \u201cZero should mean zero,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the committee\u2019s chair. In a report published on Friday the committee said it was unacceptable to have so little clarity on the meaning of the 2040 targets, which was leaving industry in the dark over investment decisions. Reeves called for the ban to take effect in 2032 to put the UK in the \u201cleading pack\u201d of countries on the transition to electric cars. \u201cIf we want to ensure we have jobs in the car industry in the UK in 20 years time we need to be at the forefront of the electric car revolution,\u201d she told the Guardian. The Labour MP also criticised the government for sending inconsistent signals, such as cutting grants last week for electric vehicles, a move she said was disappointing and should be reversed. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the car manufacturers\u2019 group, the SMMT, said 2040 was \u201calready challenging\u201d so 2032 would be \u201cnigh-on impossible\u201d. The energy industry, by contrast, welcomed the committee\u2019s call to bring the ban forward. The motoring industry has already scored one victory in its pushback over the goals, ensuring that hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius will not be covered by the ban. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, had hoped to have them banned, but was defeated by cabinet colleagues. The MPs called on the government to resist industry lobbying, and prioritise clean air and action on climate change. Transport has become the UK\u2019s biggest source of carbon emissions, overtaking the energy sector which has seen a phase-out of coal and expansion of renewable sources. Conventional cars are also the main cause of the illegal levels of air pollution afflicting dozens of UK cities. The select committee said that this had to change, and that the charging infrastructure for electric cars was not fit for purpose. Government had devolved much of the work on charging points to local authorities without giving them enough support. BP Chargemaster, the UK\u2019s biggest charging network, said the key barrier to growth was not the number of chargers but supply constraints holding back the number of electric cars that manufacturers were delivering to customers. A government spokesperson said: \u201cOur Road to Zero strategy outlined our ambition for the UK to be the best place in the world to build and own an electric vehicle.\u201d",

Perennial struggler Flybe issued a profits warning this week, sending its share price tumbling. What are the problems? The big one is rising fuel costs. The unexpected bonus of plunging oil prices saw airlines\u2019 jet fuel bills drop dramatically from $120-$140 (\u00a392-\u00a3107) a barrel for much of the decade to a low of $40 in early 2016. That led almost all airlines to finally make a profit. But now the price is back at nearly $100. Some airlines loosened the purse strings and committed to aircraft purchases or leases that the industry could ill afford overall: analysts talk of overcapacity, which can be good news for passengers in the short term with lower fares to fill seats, but may not prove sustainable. What else? For some, Brexit \u2013 or at least the tumbling pound since the referendum. Fuel and aircraft are bought in dollars, but a large proportion of the revenue for IAG, Ryanair and others is in sterling. Poorer sterling exchange rates also deter Britons from travelling, and the UK punches above its population weight for air travel. Cobalt was heavily reliant on the UK routes, including Heathrow and Gatwick - almost 30% of air traffic to Cyprus came from the UK last year. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit continues to affect confidence: Wizz Air has become the second scheduled airline, after Ryanair, to put a clause in its conditions disclaiming liability for flights grounded due to Brexit after 29 March next year. Whether Brexit-related or not, several airlines have identified falling consumer demand and forecast overall revenues to decline. Are bigger airlines immune to the problems?

      "bodyText": "In the past month Donald Trump has called the US Federal Reserve \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cout of control\u201d and \u201cloco\u201d. This week he returned for another bite. The Fed is the \u201cmy biggest threat\u201d, said the president, and he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the chairman, Jerome Powell, an official he nominated to office less than a year ago. The upwards adjustments to US interest rates are \u201ctoo fast\u201d, argued Trump, because inflation is \u201cvery low\u201d. Expect to hear more of this nonsense because the Fed shows no sign of being distracted from its course. The odds were already short on a rise in US rates in December and they shortened again on Wednesday with the publication of minutes of policymakers\u2019 last meeting. The notes showed a clear preference for \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d. It is tempting to say the Fed is \u201cdefying\u201d Trump, but the description is not quite right. It is actually ignoring the president\u2019s jibes, which is exactly what it is supposed to do as an independent central bank. The focus should be on the administration\u2019s economic policies. On that score, the main facts are that Trump is pursuing deep tax cuts, adding substantially to the level of US debt and importing some inflation via tariffs on $250bn-worth of Chinese goods. And he is doing so at a moment when the US economy is growing strongly and enjoying an employment boom. In those circumstances, the Fed is almost bound to conclude that its base rate, which was raised to 2% to 2.25% last month, probably needs to go a little higher. Yes, US inflation currently stands at a 2.2%, which Trump can call low, but the Fed must look around the next corner. The current stance on rates can be viewed as neutral. To call it \u201ccrazy\u201d is ridiculous. Maybe the president will sustain the silliness so he has someone to blame when the economic cycle turns. But he would be better advised to say nothing. Powell\u2019s term runs for four years and the bond market would freak out if there were an attempt to remove him. Indeed, any sign that political bullying could succeed would be taken badly. Trump is not going to win this scrap. Unilever should have listened Unilever has \u201cno regrets\u201d about proposing to move its headquarters to the Netherlands, says the finance director, Graeme Pitkethly, even though the \u201csimplification\u201d plan had to be scrapped when angry UK fund managers rebelled. In fact, he says, the exercise provided valuable information the board will use to try to craft a plan B. One admires his ability to put a brave face on events. Come on, though, Unilever spent 10 months contemplating its options and then seven more months trying to persuade investors to swallow the choice of Rotterdam. There were more than 200 meetings with fund managers. Aside from the humiliation of having to retreat before a vote had taken place, a lot of management time was wasted. As for insights, the main revelation wasn\u2019t actually a surprise: UK fund managers, or some of them, are prisoners of their investment mandates. That is why they protested at the prospect of seeing a Dutch-domiciled Unilever disappear from the FTSE 100 index, indeed from all UK indices. They didn\u2019t object to the principle of dismantling the clunky Anglo-Dutch structure, but they definitely cared if the new model would prevent them from owning the shares. \u201cThe problems for shareholders were foreseeable,\u201d said Columbia Threadneedle on the day Unilever dropped its plan. Quite. The other insight, of a sort, is that companies can\u2019t assume fund managers will fall into line if they\u2019re shoved hard enough. It had been obvious for months that a substantial core of UK managers were furious. Their discontent was not hard to detect, even before they went public. Put another way, it\u2019s a good idea to listen to what you\u2019re being told. But it should not require 200 meetings, and a crew of City advisers, to learn that lesson.",

The focus should be on the administration\u2019s economic policies.</p> <p>On that score, the main facts are that Trump is pursuing deep tax cuts, adding substantially to the level of US debt and importing some inflation via tariffs on $250bn-worth of Chinese goods. </p> <p>And he is doing so at a moment when the US economy is growing strongly and enjoying an employment boom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p>In those circumstances, the Fed is almost bound to conclude that its base rate, which was raised to 2% to 2.25% last month, probably needs to go a little higher. Yes, US inflation currently stands at a 2.2%, which Trump can call low, but the Fed must look around the next corner. The current stance on rates can be viewed as neutral. To call it \u201ccrazy\u201d is ridiculous.</p> <p>Maybe the president will sustain the silliness so he has someone to blame when the economic cycle turns. </p> <p>But he would be better advised to say nothing. Powell\u2019s term runs for four years and the bond market would freak out if there were an attempt to remove him. Indeed, any sign that political bullying could succeed would be taken badly. Trump is not going to win this scrap.</p> <h2>Unilever should have listened</h2> <p>Unilever has \u201cno regrets\u201d about proposing to move its headquarters to the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/18/unilever-reports-sales-boost-after-hq-row-but-investors-unimpressed\">says</a> the finance director, Graeme Pitkethly, even though the \u201csimplification\u201d plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/05/unilever-scraps-plan-move-london-rotterdam-uk-netherlands\">had to be scrapped</a> when angry UK fund managers rebelled. In fact, he says, the exercise provided valuable information the board will use to try to craft a plan B.</p> <p>One admires his ability to put a brave face on events. Come on, though, Unilever spent 10 months contemplating its options and then seven more months trying to persuade investors to swallow the choice of Rotterdam. </p> <p>There were more than 200 meetings with fund managers. Aside from the humiliation of having to retreat before a vote had taken place, a lot of management time was wasted.</p> <p>As for insights, the main revelation wasn\u2019t actually a surprise: UK fund managers, or some of them, are prisoners of their investment mandates. That is why they protested at the prospect of seeing a Dutch-domiciled Unilever disappear from the FTSE 100 index, indeed from all UK indices. </p> <p>They didn\u2019t object to the principle of dismantling the clunky Anglo-Dutch structure, but they definitely cared if the new model would prevent them from owning the shares. \u201cThe problems for shareholders were foreseeable,\u201d said Columbia Threadneedle on the day Unilever dropped its plan. Quite.</p> <p>The other insight, of a sort, is that companies can\u2019t assume fund managers will fall into line if they\u2019re shoved hard enough. It had been obvious for months that a substantial core of UK managers were furious. Their discontent was not hard to detect, even before they went public. </p> <p>Put another way, it\u2019s a good idea to listen to what you\u2019re being told. But it should not require 200 meetings, and a crew of City advisers, to learn that lesson.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A big splosh of electronic red ink has hit European stocks at the close of trading today, and Wall Street is lower too. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has ended 27 points lower, or 0.4%, at 7,026, with this morning\u2019s drop in retail sales doing little for sentiment. Mining stocks also got dented, following China\u2019s tumble to a four-year low overnight. Germany\u2019s DAX fell around 1%, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB had a poor day, down almost 2%, as the EU signalled it would reject Rome\u2019s 2019 budget. Wall Street is also back in the red, as the optimism in evidence earlier this week fades. Here\u2019s the damage: Investors also noted the WTO\u2019s warning that a full-blooded trade war would eliminate millions of jobs, and take a chunk off global growth. Fiona Cincotta of City Index fears over China\u2019s economy weighed on stocks: The UK mining sector has been falling across the session, as concerns are growing over the health of the Chinese economy. Chinese stocks fell heavily overnight as a toxic combination of factors saw the CSI 300 drop 2.2% to its lowest close in 31 months. Miners could be in for another difficult session on Friday, as China\u2019s GDP is expected to decline to 6.6% in Q3, down from 6.7% in Q2. This will be the weakest level of growth in almost a decade for China, and the first indication of the impact of Trump\u2019s trade tariffs on the economy. Given that the full scale of the impact of the ongoing trade war is not expected to be seen until Q4 and 2019, a surprise to the down side for Q3 GDP is going to sound loud alarm bells for investors. That\u2019s probably all for today.... It\u2019s not been a thrilling day in the markets, alas. After the wild volatility of last week, trading seems to have calmed down. Here\u2019s Connor Campbell of SpreadEx\u2019s take: A mixed, muted session became slightly more negative after the US open, as Wednesday night\u2019s Fed meeting minutes came into play. In the record of September\u2019s get-together the central bank signalled \u2018further gradual increases\u2019 to interest rates, ignoring the repeated criticisms made by Donald Trump without ever mentioning the President by name (the comments came before the market freak-out seen in October). This, relatively gently, reignited the markets concerns about such a course, with the Dow Jones dropping between 70 and 140 points as the bell rang on Wall Street. This failed to make a floaty set of European indices follow the same narrative. The CAC managed to rise 0.2%, while the DAX reversed its initial gains to sink 0.3%. The FTSE added 20 points able to eke out some growth as sterling\u2019s decline compensated for the index\u2019s commodity losses. The City of London is getting a new guest - Fearless Girl. The defiant sculpture has proved highly popular since appearing on Wall Street, and she could soon take a holiday outside the London stock exchange instead. The Evening Standard reports: New York\u2019s Fearless Girl sculpture is coming to London. Hailed as a symbol of female resilience, it has been seen by millions of people in New York\u2019s financial district and is likely to be placed outside the London stock exchange. Members of the City of London\u2019s Culture, Heritage and Libraries Committee are expected to approve the plan for the 4ft (1.3 metre) high bronze, which weighs 110kg, to go on show for six months from March. The artwork, showing a young girl with her fists on her hips, became an over night sensation when it was placed opposite a large sculpture of a charging bull near Wall Street. So take your daughters. And your sons! As predicted, shares in New York have fallen into the red in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by over 0.6%, or 160 points, as the prospect of further interest rate hikes continues to worry Wall Street.... Last night\u2019s hawkish Fed minutes, indicating further rate hikes in the coming quarters, have depressed sentiment in New York. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, explains: One of the most interesting takeaways from the minutes released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is a suggestion from the Federal Reserve that it could raise interest rates beyond market expectations. This would of course come across as disappointing to President Trump, but would also be considered as positive news for Dollar buyers as it stresses the Federal Reserve is completely independent from the White House. British businesses are watching the lack of progress over Brexit with increasing alarm. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, has warned that jobs are already at risk, and urged both sides to agree a withdrawal deal pronto. She says: \u201cBusiness\u2019 patience was already threadbare and is nearing an end. The need for compromise on both sides to agree the Withdrawal Agreement and secure the transition period is long overdue. \u201cThe risk of no deal is already biting hard. With each week that passes, firms are accelerating their contingency planning, diverting investment and costing jobs. And many firms, especially smaller businesses, simply have no time to prepare. All efforts should focus on securing transition to relieve pressure on firms, protecting people, wages and living standards across Europe. \u201cIf extending the transition period makes the Withdrawal Agreement easier to agree it should be welcomed. Securing the transition period remains the top priority for business to protect jobs and investment.\u201d However, Theresa May still opposes the EU\u2019s Irish backstop agreement, and many pro-Brexit MPs are unhappy about potentially extending the Withdrawal Agreement. So businesses face more uncertainty.... Shares fell in New York yesterday, after the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve showed further rate hikes are likely. Traders don\u2019t expect a bounceback today, though, with the main indices all a little lower in pre-market trading. Just in: America\u2019s labour market remains remarkably strong, as companies shake off any trade war worries. The number of US citizens filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell last week, new data show, to just 210,000. That\u2019s down from 215,000 in the previous seven days, and not far from a 49-year low [202,000, set last month] The number of Americans receiving jobless support for more than one week (the \u2018continuing claims\u2019 figure) has hit a new low. At just 1.64 million, its the lowest since August 1973. Overnight, the US found a new way to hurt Chinese companies. The White House said it was pulling out of a United Nations treaty that offered low rates for foreign postal deliveries of small packages in the US. That could make it much pricier for Chinese firms to send goods to America. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says this helped drive Chinese stocks down to a four-year low today: Fragile doesn\u2019t describe just how delicate Asia investor sentiment is as any sliver of optimism from US earnings gave way to that reality that trade tension and geopolitical unrest continues to gurgle... To make matters worse, President Trump has found in the US postal service, a way to cripple China e-commerce which sent mainland equities into the tank. Britain\u2019s pub industry is fighting its own battle against rising taxes, which it blames for forcing locals to close. Six publicans, including former model Jodie Kidd, have dropped off a petition at Downing Street today, calling for a cut in beer duty in this month\u2019s budget. Organised by the \u201cLong Live the Local\u201d campaign, it warns that 12% of pubs could close in the next five years unless the chancellor cuts the duty (currently three times the EU average). Kidd, who runs The Half Moon, Kirdford, says another rise in beer duty would cripple the industry: \u201cLocal pubs like my own bring people together and are at the heart of communities. However, mounting financial pressures mean that for many it is already a struggle just to keep their doors open. \u201cI am at Downing Street today to deliver the Long Live the Local petition because, along with 105,000 other people, I believe the Chancellor must act now to protect our local pubs. Chancellor Philip Hammond is currently scrambling around, trying to find ways to raise revenue so he can meet Theresa May\u2019s pledge to end austerity. So he may not be amenable to cutting the levy. However, pubs could certainly use some help - with supermarkets under-cutting them on price, and an increasing number of young people shunning alcohol. Heads-up for UK travellers: Cypriot airline Cobalt cancelled all its flights and indefinitely suspended operations, after failing to agree a new funding package. So if you were due to fly Cobalt from, say, Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no point heading to the airport. More here: Domino\u2019s Pizza hasn\u2019t been caught up in the retail slowdown. The fast food chain has reported a 6.1% jump in sales in the UK and Ireland in July-September. David Wild, Chief Executive Officer, says the sizzling summer weather didn\u2019t help (is it ever too hot for pizza, though?!) \u201cOur businesses continue to trade well, despite the evident uncertainty among UK consumers, and hot weather across Europe for much of the quarter. Shares have jumped 7.5%, after Domino\u2019s reiterated its profit guidance and announced a new \u00a325m share buyback programme. Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s retail sales figures: A strong summer for Britain\u2019s retailers came to an abrupt end in September as weaker demand for food dragged down spending overall. The latest snapshot of spending from the Office for National Statistics showed that the volume of sales for shops and online businesses dropped by 0.8% \u2013 a bigger monthly fall than analysts had been expecting. September\u2019s fall was not enough to outweigh rising activity in July and August, leaving sales for the quarter \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend than one month\u2019s data \u2013 up by 1.2%. Although consumers have only recently started to see their wages rise faster than prices, the ONS said the quantity of goods bought last month was 3% up on the same month a year earlier. All sectors apart from department stores, which underwent the collapse and partial rescue of House of Fraser in the past year, achieved growth. More here: Andrew Westbrook, head of retail at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM, reckons some retailers have been slashing prices, to shift stocks: There continue to be signs of distress on the high street, with deep discounting evident in some stores. The big rise in the sales of watches and jewellery over the last three months may be linked to discounting on big ticket items in an attempt to reduce stock levels. For many retailers, the run-up to the all-important Christmas season when stock can be converted to cash can\u2019t come soon enough. This chart shows how retail sales growth has been levelling off recently (the blue line, which gives a better picture than the more volatile monthly stats): Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, says UK retailers are in a gruelling scrap: \u201cIt\u2019s still tough out there for the UK\u2019s retailers, so solid 3% growth compared with last September is welcome news, despite being slightly below expectations. Every sale continues to be hard-won and retailers are having to find creative ways to lure customers through their doors and onto their websites, but it seems from today\u2019s data that they are persuading the public to keep spending. Although the dip in food sales from August is eye-catching, it was expected given the exceptional performance achieved over the summer and shouldn\u2019t cause undue concern. He also singles out Brexit as a key worry: Any growth is significant given the plethora of challenges facing retailers \u2013 they are being hit from all sides, with business rates, the continued weakness of sterling and persisting uncertainty around Brexit combining to thwart investment and push up costs. Retail CEOs will be hoping to see some white smoke from Westminster and Brussels as soon as possible, and for solid assurances that they will be able to maintain their existing supply chains and frictionless trading arrangements with EU partners and consumers. Here\u2019s Channel 4\u2019s Helia Ebrahimi on the retail sales figures: Today\u2019s report also shows the impact of inflation, particularly at petrol stations where fuel is a lot pricier than a year ago: The sharp drop in retail sales last month shows that consumers are being squeezed, argues Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. She explains: \u201cToday\u2019s UK retail sales numbers confirm what we all fear about the state of the high street, with the latest figures showing a decline in sales of 0.8% in September compared to August 2018. The drop in sales in September is a reflection not only of clouds starting to form in the sky, but also our pockets. Food stores were the largest fallers contributing to this decline, with sales falling by 0.6%. Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU is one factor, she adds: \u201cWhile some retailers may be pinning their hopes on the recent news that consumers are likely to see a boost to their pay packets after this week\u2019s data revealed that our earnings growth is currently outstripping inflation, UK consumers are unlikely to be splashing out just yet given the current climate of uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations. Unlike most common colds we are suffering at this time of year; UK households are still unable to shake off the prolonged symptoms of inflation and poor wage growth since the Brexit vote. With no breakthrough at last night\u2019s EU leaders\u2019 meeting, and mounting political pressure at home, that uncertainty hasn\u2019t lifted yet.... Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s UK retail sales figures are a concern: Retail sales fell 0.8% in September as shoppers cut back on spending after a bumper summer. Food sales suffered their biggest monthly drop in three years. The monthly data is notoriously volatile, but the year-on-year figure of 3.0% undershot economists\u2019 forecasts of a 3.6% rise, and September\u2019s drop dragged the three-month number down to 1.2%, the third fall in a row. It looks like consumer spending \u2013 along with the weather \u2013 peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since. Where we go from here is highly uncertain. Brexit is hitting consumer confidence hard, but on the plus side wage growth has hit a decade high while inflation is falling. So consumers look likely to have more spending power \u2013 the issue is whether they choose to use it, or keep their powder dry until more clarity over Brexit emerges. Philipp Gutzwiller, head of consumer at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says shoppers cut back last month, after a summer splurge. \u201cAfter a summer of spending boosted by the long, hot weather, September saw shoppers tighten their belts to catch up. \u201cAs a result, retailers have had to redouble their efforts, focusing on either steep discounts or creating the theatre that makes going shopping an experience consumers can actually enjoy. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA agrees that the retail sales report is disappointing; James Hughes of Axitrader says the summer spending burst couldn\u2019t last.... One month\u2019s data can be volatile, of course. On a three-month basis, the quantity bought in retail sales increased by 1.2% ONS Head of Retail Sales Rhian Murphy said: \u201cRetail continued to grow in the three months to September with jewellery shops and online stores seeing particularly strong sales. This was despite a stark slowdown in food sales in September, following a bumper summer.\u201d Newsflash: UK retail sales shrank by 0.8% in September, a bigger fall than expected. The Office for National Statistics reports that customers bought less food after a strong August. The ONS says: In September 2018, the quantity bought declined by 0.8% when compared with August 2018, due mainly to a large fall of 1.5% in food stores; the largest decline in food store sales since October 2015. Economists had only expected retail sales to dip by 0.4% month-on-month. On an annual basis, retail sales in September were 3% higher than a year earlier (or 3.2% higher if you strip out petrol sales). More to follow... It was another rough trading session in China today. Nearly every stock fell, as today\u2019s 3% slump means the Shanghai index has lost almost 25% of its value this year alone. Bloomberg says that some speculative traders are being forced to put up more more money to cover their losses. This leads to more selling, and thus more losses, in a destructive cycle also seen in the 1929 crash. Chinese shares extended the world\u2019s deepest slump and the yuan touched its weakest level in almost two years, testing the government\u2019s ability to maintain market calm as risks mount for Asia\u2019s largest economy. Fears of widespread margin calls fuelled a 3 percent tumble in the Shanghai Composite Index, which sank to a nearly four-year low as more than 13 stocks fell for each that rose Shares in Europe have opened a little higher, despite the WTO\u2019s trade war gloom. The FTSE 100 has gained 19 points, or 0.3%, 7,073. France\u2019s CAC and the German DAX are both up around 0.45%. Multinational European companies are benefiting from the stronger dollar (a weaker euro makes their US earnings more valuable). The Chinese yuan is also weakening this morning, hitting its lowest level since January 2017 Yesterday, the US Treasury resisted labelling China a \u2018currency manipulator\u2019, in a new report on the foreign exchange policies of major US trading partners. President Donald Trump has previously accused China of keeping its currency weak to make exports more competitive, but the Treasury has now shied away from taking action. Trump\u2019s complaints were ironic, though, that Beijing has actually been intervening to prevent the yuan falling too much. Today, the yuan has dipped to 6.9422. Many other currencies are also dropping against the US dollar this morning, after last night\u2019s hawkish Fed minutes. A weaker currency could help Chinese firms swallow tariffs on their sales to the US..... Roberto Azevedo\u2019s warning of the perils of a trade war will have resonated in China\u2019s stock exchanges today. Shares are sliding sharply AGAIN today, as traders fear that the dispute with America will escalate further. The Shanghai composite index has just closed, down 3%, at its lowest level since November 2014. How bad would a full-blown breakdown of trade relations be? According to WTO chief Roberto Azevedo, \u201ca complete breakdown in international trade cooperation\u201d would drive tariffs higher, knocking up to 17% off global trade growth. That worst-case scenario could knock 1.9% off overall global economic growth, WTO economists reckon. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Trade wars are on investors\u2019 minds this morning, after the World Trade Organisation fired a broadside at the US and China over their deepening dispute. Roberto Azevedo, WTO director-general, told an audience in London that we are facing a crisis in global trade. Calling for a cease-fire in the current trade ware, Azevedo warned that: \u201cWithout action to ease tensions and recommit to cooperation in trade, we could see serious harm done to the multilateral trading system. The long term economic consequences of this could be severe.\u201d Currently, the US imposes tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports, as it tries to force Beijing to change its trade policies. Instead, China has retaliated with its own tariffs. Azevedo says a political solution is needed, before \u201cserious harm\u201d is incurred by the multilateral trading system. Potentially, it could force millions of people to seek new jobs, he explained: \u201cThese effects would cause significant disruptions for workers, firms, and communities as they adjust to this new reality. \u201cPotentially millions of workers would need to find new jobs; firms would be looking for new products and markets; and communities for new sources of growth. Also coming up New UK retail sales data are expected to show Brits cut back last month. Retail spending is expected to have fallen by 0.4% last month. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Once again groceries are expected to continue to do well, whilst non-essential items continue to disappoint. After a strong summer of spending from the UK consumer, and a surprise to the upside in August, there is a good chance the UK consumer is reining in their spending ahead of the Christmas period. The City is bracing for further US interest rate rises in future months, after the Federal Reserve signalled it intends to keep hiking - despite Donald Trump\u2019s criticism.

      "bodyText": "New Look is to close all its 120 shops in China by the end of the year after disappointing sales, as it continues to battle tough conditions on the UK high street. The fashion chain, which persuaded landlords to back the closure of up to 60 of its 593 UK stores and rent reductions on dozens more via an insolvency process in March, said it was reviewing all its international markets. The retailer said it had decided to withdraw from China, where it employs 730 people, just over four years after entering the country, because it had \u201cnot achieved the necessary sales and profitability to support the significant future investment required to continue operations\u201d. The closure of its Shanghai head office, expected in January, marks the end of an overseas expansion that was seen as a key part of the chain\u2019s future under former boss Anders Kristiansen, who was partly hired for his expertise in China. New Look currently has more than 300 stores overseas as far afield as Saudi Arabia, Libya, Malta and Poland, about two-thirds of which are run directly and the rest via franchise partners. Maureen Hinton, at the retail analysis firm GlobalData, said the company was likely to consider closing the majority of its directly-owned overseas stores, except those in Ireland. \u201cThe company needs to cut costs and these small businesses overseas are a costly distraction when they need to focus on differentiating themselves from everyone else in the UK,\u201d she said. China is New Look\u2019s biggest overseas territory, in terms of store numbers, followed by the Middle East, where the group has 63 franchise outlets. Alistair McGeorge, its executive chairman, said: \u201cHaving reviewed the trading performance of our business in China and the substantial investment required to continue operations in the market, we have made the difficult decision to exit our stores in China. As our turnaround plans continue, we remain focused on ensuring that New Look is well positioned to drive strong business performance and profitable growth.\u201d McGeorge returned to lead the retailer late last year after sales and profits collapsed. He has said the previous management team led by Kristiansen pushed up prices and started selling clothes that were \u201ctoo young and edgy\u201d. The chain is among a string of retailers to use a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to close stores or cut rents, including Mothercare and Carpetright, as they face rising costs and a shift towards online sales. Consumers are diverting spending from homewares and clothing to experiences such as eating out or holidays. Fashion retailers across northern Europe have also struggled as the summer heatwave sent young people to beaches and parks, rather than the high street, while the latest in a series of warm autumns has held back sales of knitwear and coats.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The announcement that the Bank of England is to introduce a redesigned polymer \u00a350 note has sparked speculation as to who might feature on it. The Bank says it will seek public nominations via \u201ca character selection process\u201d. Campaigners have already begun backing their favourites. The political blog Guido Fawkes has started to petition for Margaret Thatcher to be the face of the UK\u2019s highest denomination note. The petition, which features a mock-up of how the note might look, has already attracted more than 11,000 signatures. The Leave.EU lobby group is also backing Thatcher to be the face of the fifty, while the Labour MP for East Hull, Karl Turner, has suggested a counter-petition to oppose the suggestion. One social media user suggested that putting Thatcher on the \u00a350 note might at least stop Conservative students burning notes in front of homeless people. A leading alternative is Noor Inayat Khan. Moscow-born Khan was a spy for Britain in occupied France during the second world war, having joined the Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force. She was captured and tortured by the Nazis before being killed at Dachau concentration camp at the age of 30. She was posthumously awarded the George Cross. She would be the first Muslim, indeed the first member of any ethnic minority group to feature on a Bank of England note. Political figures including Sayeeda Warsi and the transport minister Nusrat Ghani are in favour of featuring Khan, and a petitionhas already attracted more than 3,500 signatures. Given that this is the nation that voted to name a ship Boaty McBoatface, however, allowing the public to choose the face of the new \u00a350 note is fraught with risk, and social media users have not been slow to come forward with some more leftfield suggestions. A campaign to have the England defender Harry Maguire riding a unicorn pictured on the note is also gaining momentum. The Leicester City player was pictured riding an inflatable unicorn while England were relaxing during World Cup training in the summer, and Jonny Sharples, who started the petition, has mocked up how the note might look. Over 35,000 people have backed the idea so far, more than Thatcher and Khan combined. Maguire\u2019s England teammate Kyle Walker joined in the fun, posting a mock-up of a \u00a35 note featuring himself suffering from cramp during the World Cup, which became a widely shared image at the time. The actor John Challis, who played Boycie in Only Fools And Horses, has nominated his co-stars David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst in character as Del Boy and Rodney dressed as Batman and Robin. The unlikely choice of Lisa Scott-Lee from Steps also found a surprising backer in the BBC\u2019s technology correspondent Chris Fox. Media brands have also co-opted the wave of humorous suggestions. Social media managers at Sony and Good Morning Britain posted mock-ups of the One Direction star Louis Tomlinson and the TV presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. Fellow ITV presenter Philip Schofield has also been put forward. However popular the online petition in his favour proves, Harry Maguire riding a unicorn is unlikely to make the final cut. Bank of England guidelines suggest avoiding fictional characters and people who are still living, the latter with the exception of the monarch of course. Other more serious suggestions include Mary Seacole, who was voted the greatest black Briton in 2004, and who has been backed by the Labour MP Wes Streeting. Clement Atlee and Stephen Hawking may also be in the frame. Fifty-pound notes were first produced in 1725. Production ceased in 1943 and they were only reintroduced into regular circulation in 1981, since when they have featured the architect Christopher Wren and the 17th century Bank of England governor Sir John Houblon. The current note features Matthew Boulton and James Watt, whose steam engines led to the mechanisation of factories and mills. The Bank is yet to set a date for the new note to go into circulation. It has only said that it will be after the new polymer \u00a320 is introduced in 2020, featuring the painter JMW Turner.",

The petition, which features a mock-up of how the note might look, has already attracted more than 11,000 signatures.</p> <p>The Leave.EU lobby group is also backing Thatcher to be the face of the fifty, while the Labour MP for East Hull, Karl Turner, has suggested <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlTurnerMP/status/1051863683691933696\">a counter-petition to oppose the suggestion</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gary_Bainbridge/status/1051897643696308225\">One social media user suggested</a> that putting Thatcher on the \u00a350 note <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/10/cambridge-student-filmed-burning-money-in-front-of-homeless-man\">might at least stop Conservative students burning notes in front of homeless people</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d678469b97f4c5620eaad4d705ab3c0781f5fe2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d678469b97f4c5620eaad4d705ab3c0781f5fe2/0_201_856_514/500.jpg\" alt=\"Noor Inayat Khan has emerged as a candidate to be featured on the new note\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noor Inayat Khan has emerged as a candidate to be featured on the new note.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Khan Family/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A leading alternative is Noor Inayat Khan. Moscow-born Khan was a spy for Britain in occupied France during the second world war, having joined the Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force.

She was posthumously awarded the George Cross.</p> <p>She would be the first Muslim, indeed the first member of any ethnic minority group to feature on a Bank of England note. Political figures including Sayeeda Warsi and the transport minister Nusrat Ghani are in favour of featuring Khan, and a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/zehra-zaidi-put-noor-inayat-khan-on-the-new-50-note\">petition</a><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/zehra-zaidi-put-noor-inayat-khan-on-the-new-50-note\">has already attracted </a><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/zehra-zaidi-put-noor-inayat-khan-on-the-new-50-note\"> more than 3,500 signatures</a>.</p> <p>Given that this is the nation that voted to name a ship Boaty McBoatface, however, allowing the public to choose the face of the new \u00a350 note is fraught with risk, and social media users have not been slow to come forward with some more leftfield suggestions.

      "bodyText": "Unilever, which this month was forced to scrap plans to move its headquarters from London to Rotterdam after a shareholder rebellion, said a hot summer across Europe and a recovery in Brazil boosted sales in the third quarter. The firm behind brands such as Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and Dove soap reported a 3.8% rise in underlying sales to \u20ac12.5bn (\u00a311bn) during the three months to the end of September. The chief executive, Paul Polman, said a plan to increase prices in a bid to offset rising commodity costs had not affected sales, putting the company on track to reach targets it has set for 2020. However, despite his optimism, investors were unimpressed and shares in the FTSE 100 company fell 1.5%. The shares have been under pressure since the end of August, amid anger among City shareholders at a proposal, pioneered by Polman, to simplify its Anglo-Dutch structure by having a sole headquarters in Rotterdam. Unilever would have exited the FTSE 100, forcing many London-based institutions to remove it from their portfolios. Opposition from investors eventually forced Polman to scrap the plan earlier this month before it was put to a vote. Unilever made no mention of the U-turn in its third quarter statement on Thursday but the chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said the board would take time to consider all the feedback it received from shareholders on the issue before making any further moves. Unilever, whose foodstuffs include Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, said its European division benefited from strong ice cream sales in the three months to the end of September, thanks to sweltering summer weather. Its Brazilian business bounced back after a truckers\u2019 strike hit sales in the second quarter. Despite Polman\u2019s insistence that Unilever had raised prices without harming sales volumes, analysts at UBS said 2.4% growth on the latter measure was disappointing and would make it harder for the group to achieve its target of revenues up 3% to 5% for the full year. \u201cWe think this is achievable but it heightens the risk of a guidance miss if market conditions deteriorate,\u201d they said. The group also completed the sale of its spread division, including Flora and I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter, to the private equity group KKR for \u00a36bn this year as part of an effort to streamline the company and improve shareholder returns.",

      "bodyText": "A strong summer for Britain\u2019s retailers came to an abrupt end in September as weaker demand for food hit supermarkets and dragged down spending overall. The latest spending snapshot from the Office for National Statistics showed the volume of sales for shops and online businesses had dropped by 0.8%, twice the monthly fall analysts had been expecting. September\u2019s fall was not enough to outweigh rising activity in July and August, leaving sales for the quarter, a better guide to the underlying trend than one month\u2019s data, up by 1.2%. Consumers have only recently started to see their wages rise faster than prices, but the ONS said the quantity of goods bought last month was 3% up on the same month a year earlier. Consumer spending came under pressure during 2017 as the fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit referendum pushed up the cost of imports. In recent months, however, a combination of fine summer weather, the lowest official unemployment rate in 43 years, the World Cup and small increases in living standards have underpinned spending. The increase in spending since a weak spell at the start of 2018 has not been enough to prevent a number of high-profile casualties in the high street including Maplin, Toys R Us and Poundworld. Even so, the ONS said all sectors apart from department stores, which endured the collapse and partial rescue of House of Fraser, achieved growth in the last 12 months. The head of retail sales at the ONS, Rhian Murphy, said: \u201cRetail continued to grow in the three months to September, with jewellery shops and online stores seeing particularly strong sales. This was despite a stark slowdown in food sales in September, following a bumper summer.\u201d Hot weather during the summer provided a boost for supermarkets but the ONS said there was a 1.5% drop in food sales in September. Retail sales account for about a third of all consumer spending, and sales over the latest quarter of jewellery, clothes and household goods were all up. Households have been more cautious when it comes to the two biggest ticket items of their spending, houses and cars, which are not included in the official retail sales data. Ruth Gregory, a UK analyst at Capital Economics, said the 1.2% quarterly rise in retail sales would add 0.1 percentage points to growth in the third quarter, but that they were not a good barometer of total consumer spending. She said the 12% fall in new car sales during the latest quarter would probably result in slower consumer spending growth in the third quarter. \u201cFurther ahead, we are more optimistic. Indeed, with inflation continuing to fall back and with pay growth on the up, consumer spending should receive more fundamental support,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cIn our central forecast, which is based on a Brexit deal being struck with the EU [and ratified in parliament], we think that annual consumer spending growth will rise from its current rate of 1.6% to 2% in 2020.\u201d The ONS reported that online sales as a proportion of all retailing fell slightly to 17.8% in September 2018 from the 18% reported in August 2018. Even so, food and clothing stores reported record proportions of internet shopping at 5.8% and 18.2% respectively. Samuel Tombs, the UK economist at Pantheon, said: \u201cRetail sales always were likely to retreat in September following the weather-related surge over the summer. A 1.5% month-to-month fall in food store sales, which had benefited greatly from the hotter-than-usual weather, accounted for nearly all of the decline in total sales.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s unemployment rate is falling faster than anticipated, dropping sharply to 5% last month. The larger than expected decline in unemployment means the labour market is now meeting the Reserve Bank\u2019s definition of \u201cfull employment\u201d, the so-called non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), though economists say it may still not be enough to spark noticeable wage rises. Figures show the unemployment rate fell to 5% in September, from 5.3% in August, hitting the lowest level in six-and-a-half years. In seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 a statistical technique that removes the effects of seasonal variation in employment \u2013 the number of employed persons increased by 5,600 last month, which was much weaker than the 45,000 new jobs in August. It means the average increase in new jobs in the past three months has slowed to 15,000, down from 46,000 in January. But it was still enough to push the unemployment rate down to its lowest level since April 2012 (with some help from a sampling rotation, and a small decline in the participation rate from 65.7% to 65.4%). The prime minister, Scott Morrison, welcomed the news about the unemployment rate, saying 1.15 million jobs had been created in the past five years. \u201c60,000 fewer people are unemployed today than at the last election,\u201d he told parliament. Economists say it is clear the labour market is tightening faster than anticipated. \u201cIn terms of the RBA, officials have previously stressed the data can prove volatile on a month-to-month basis so we doubt they will make any clear policy shifts based solely on today\u2019s number,\u201d JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy wrote to clients on Thursday. \u201cNevertheless, this result should not be dismissed and, should this outcome be \u2018locked-in\u2019 in coming months, then the market would have to acknowledge that progress toward the RBA\u2019s objectives, which has been very slow for many years, now appears more rapid.\u201d According to the NAIRU, if unemployment keeps falling below this point then inflation and wages ought to start rising. However, the NAIRU is difficult to pinpoint, because it can shift up and down with changes in the structure of the labour market, and some economists believe the NAIRU needs to be closer to 4% for wages to start rising seriously. \u201cOur view is that 5% is not the magic number and that the unemployment rate may need to fall closer to 4% to trigger a decent rise in wage growth,\u201d the chief economist of Capital Economics, Paul Dales, wrote on Thursday. \u201cOf course, as the amount of spare capacity in the labour market continues to decline, wage growth will probably edge up. \u201cAnd the fall in the unemployment rate increases the chances that the RBA will want to raise interest rates sooner, but we suspect it may still keep its powder dry until late in 2020.\u201d Data showa the annual rate of job creation is still a healthy 2.3%, with trend employment growth sitting on 26,000 a month \u2013 well above the 17,000 needed to keep putting downward pressure on the unemployment rate. On Wednesday, the RBA deputy governor, Guy Debelle, said Australia\u2019s jobs market was in \u201cpretty good shape\u201d with many indicators suggesting wages should be growing more quickly, but Australia\u2019s employers were finding inventive ways to avoid lifting wages for their staff as the economy improved. He said employment growth was above average, the participation rate was at a high level, the vacancy rate was at an all-time high and the unemployment rate was still trending down. \u201cSome firms are attempting to retain staff by using non-wage incentives, including flexible work arrangements, shares, subsidised gym memberships, development opportunities and additional annual leave,\u201d he said.",
