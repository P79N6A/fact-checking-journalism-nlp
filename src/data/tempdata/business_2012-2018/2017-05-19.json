      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a big week for BHP Billiton. For one thing, it\u2019s not even called that any more. As part of its \u201cThink Big\u201d rebranding theme, the world\u2019s biggest mining company opted to shed the Billiton moniker it acquired in a 2001 merger with a Dutch-South African company and revert to its previous true-blue Aussie name. BHP says the rebranding \u2013 complete with TV ads about how seven ordinary blokes in the outback founded what is now a global business worth $A94bn (\u00a354bn) \u2013 is part of a long-term plan started 18 months ago to reconnect with communities. \u201cThe timing now is good but we don\u2019t look at it as an event,\u201d the company\u2019s chief external affairs officer, Geoff Healy, says. \u201cThis is a clean brand change for the company.\u201d The move appeared to bookend a happy period when the Anglo-Australian mining colossus had rediscovered its direction after 19 people were killed in a disastrous dam burst at an iron ore joint venture in Brazil in 2015 and the share price sank to a 10-year low. But no sooner had BHP put the finishing touches to its fresh look on Monday than it found itself, for the second time in a month, the subject of an unflattering critique by a predatory US hedge fund. Upsetting BHP\u2019s big week was Elliott Advisors, whose Arsenal-supporting billionaire founder, Paul Singer, has earned a fearsome reputation for pursuing change at companies he thinks could make him more money. In April, Elliott wrote to investors demanding that BHP spin off its US oil assets and abolish its \u201cobsolete\u201d corporate structure that means it is listed in the UK and Australia. This week it adopted a more acrimonious tone, sledging BHP\u2019s management for \u201cchronic underperformance\u201d, adopting a \u201cdo nothing\u201d approach and destroying shareholder value to the tune of billions of dollars. BHP has yet to comment but its new image could appeal to the patriotism of its many small Australian shareholders and help rebuff Elliott\u2019s increasingly threatening advances. By evoking the company\u2019s gritty origins as Broken Hill Proprietary in remote New South Wales, BHP may have claimed to be thinking big but in reality is going back to basics. Even the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, got in on the act last week when he dismissed Elliott\u2019s initial suggestions about removing BHP from the Australian stock market as \u201cunthinkable\u201d. For good measure he added that taking the \u201coriginal big Australian\u201d offshore could lead to legal action against executives as it would contravene the terms of the 2001 merger. Morrison\u2019s comments were telling and reveal that Elliott, which once seized an Argentinian warship to extract debt repayment from the Buenos Aires government, may have underestimated the attachment Australians feel towards its corporate champions. While people in the UK are used to seeing companies and utilities bought and sold to the highest bidder \u2013 Cadbury, ICI, British Steel and Jaguar Land Rover have all disappeared or gone into foreign hands \u2013 Australians appear more attached to their big names, especially ones worth billions and which have paid handsome dividends to shareholders and pension funds down the years. Richard Knights of the London-based investment banking and share brokerage firm Liberum Capital says Elliott had misjudged the likely political fallout from its proposal that BHP drop its stock market listing in Australia. \u201cI don\u2019t think they quite grasped how much part of the corporate fabric of Australia BHP is. It has a lot of mum and dad shareholders, a lot of pension money and retirement savings. It\u2019s a different culture to [the UK], where someone else manages your money. There\u2019s more of a direct investment culture so there\u2019s a cultural angle that they missed.\u201d He adds that the mining giant\u2019s rebranding was also a factor. \u201cI think it ties into this whole cultural heritage,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they spun off most of the Billiton assets so what\u2019s left is mostly BHP.\u201d While the finer points of brand awareness might not be a core consideration for a business that is focused on digging millions of tonnes of iron ore, coal and copper out of the ground, the significance is not lost on industry experts. Andrew Holt, the chief executive in Australia of the creative agency VCCP, says the \u201cThink Big\u201d campaign showed BHP was going back to its roots in order to restore its \u201cAustralian-ness\u201d. \u201cThat would seem a timely argument if you\u2019re trying to fight off a foreign investor,\u201d he says. Elliott did admit this week that amid all the discussion of \u201cunderperformance\u201d and \u201cunlocking optimal shareholder value\u201d, there was a cultural dimension to the number-crunching. \u201cWe understood from the start that unification requires BHP to cut through certain complexity and that Australians in particular feel passionate about BHP remaining rooted in Australia,\u201d the hedge fund said. Elliott is promising to fight on. Its latest missive backtracked on scrapping the dual UK-Australia listing but it remains belligerent, claiming that BHP\u2019s purchase of the US shale interests have cost shareholders US$23bn. So although BHP\u2019s CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, has said he would consider selling the US shale oil business for the right price and met representatives of Elliott in Barcelona on Wednesday, it is unlikely the activist fund, which claims to speak for 4.1% of shareholders, will go quietly. Ric Spooner, the chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, says many shareholders agreed with Elliott that BHP would be better off selling the US oil business and reinvesting the proceeds in other parts of the company. \u201cThe problem is BHP management has a dissenting view,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t agree that they would be better off by selling the oil assets. BHP believes that the advantage of oil is that it allows diversification and that it does well when other commodities do badly.\u201d Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat says: \u201cIn our view, BHP\u2019s \u2018chronic underperformance\u2019 is not as chronic as Elliott makes out and some aspects of the Elliott presentation appear disingenuous and/or made with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cWhile BHP has certainly made poor investments, in our view it has been no worse than its peers in this regard.\u201d He admits there might be some merit in BHP selling its petroleum business, adding that the dispute could ultimately work in shareholders\u2019 favour, even if BHP makes no major concessions. \u201cWhatever the outcome, Elliott\u2019s agitation should be good for BHP shareholders, in our view, if only to create greater transparency.\u201d And that could be a big plus at the end of the week.",

      "bodyText": "The number of major show gardens may have been pruned back heavily as some key sponsors have pulled out, but the Chelsea flower show\u2019s gala opening night on Monday remains one of the prime events of the London social calendar. This year there will be just eight show gardens \u2013 down from at least 14 last year as some long-term supporters including the Daily Telegraph, which has sponsored a show garden at Chelsea for at least nine years, and Brewin Dolphin, which had sponsored gardens for five years, have pulled out. Other key names L\u2019Occitane and Harrods have also made their excuses. The show\u2019s main backer M&amp;G, which has sponsored Chelsea for the past eight years, has also said it would step down. No replacement has been confirmed for 2018. Despite the difficulties, the gala night remains a networker\u2019s dream that contributes a large proportion of the \u00a310m-plus raised by the Royal Horticultural Society at the annual Chelsea event. Around 5,000 bankers, business leaders and celebrities are expected to attend on Monday and about half of them will sit down for dinner afterwards. The evening sold out months ago despite tickets going for between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 a head. One regular attendee said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any other date where you get so many important people in one place over two hours. It\u2019s the party of the season.\u201d Last year, the newly married Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall were snapped walking hand in hand among the blooms in a rare public outing. Perennial attendees include the former Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive Sir Stuart Rose, as well as Lord Myners, WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, Stephen Fry, Ringo Starr and Dame Judi Dench. One banking insider said: \u201cIt is like something from Victorian times with people parading up and down and trying to speak to important people. It\u2019s quite difficult if you want to look at the exhibits. If you want to be able to say \u2018hi\u2019 to lots of interesting people and have a brief chat there is nothing like it on the corporate calendar.\u201d The RHS will raise about \u00a33m from corporate entertainment over the coming week, having introduced an extra dinner venue with room for 300 people. It has also brought in celebrity chef Raymond Blanc\u2019s team to improve the attractiveness of its garden dining chalets through the week. Amid the economic uncertainty, it is no surprise companies scaled back their investment in show gardens \u2013 booking space alone can cost at least \u00a3100,000 including designing and building the garden. One former sponsor said:\u201cI think the costs can be really quite prohibitive.\u201d Nick Mattingley, shows director of the RHS, said sponsorship suffered as the timing of applications coincided with last summer\u2019s Brexit referendum. But he said there had been no real impact on the money raised for the RHS which comes form corporate entertainment and tickets sales. The garden sponsorship money largely goes towards plants and designers not the charity. \u201cWe had a lot of application but we do look for quality and we didn\u2019t want to lower the level to fill spaces,\u201d he said, adding that Chelsea was in negotiations with more than one potential sponsor to replace M&amp;G. The missing show gardens have been partly replaced by more of the smaller Artisan and Fresh gardens and five Feel Good gardens fronted by BBC Radio 2 DJs, including the appropriately named Jeremy Vine. A couple of trade exhibitors have also taken larger spaces to develop their sales stand into gardens. Mattingley said the changes had also enabled Chelsea to give space to new talent. \u201cThe show has been going for over 100 years and things are quite cyclical. When we had the credit crunch we had a moment when everything was reorganised and things go around again. We\u2019ve got to work with it and be nimble on our feet and come up with new ideas and be creative,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Marlboro maker accused of using branded tins to sidestep plain packaging rules", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The maker of Marlboro cigarettes has been accused of trying to sidestep new UK laws on plain packaging by rolling out durable tins that look just like ordinary cigarette packets. Philip Morris, one of the world\u2019s largest tobacco companies, came under fire from MPs and anti-smoking campaigners on the eve of the biggest change in tobacco regulation since the smoking ban. From Saturday, retailers will no longer be able to sell branded cigarette packets, as a 12-month grace period to allow tobacco firms to phase out old cartons comes to an end. Instead, retailers will only stock plain packets featuring graphic pictures designed to deter smokers. They will also no longer be allowed to stock packets of 10 cigarettes or smaller sizes of rolling tobacco, as part of a package of measures designed to limit the appeal of smoking. In the run-up to the change, Philip Morris has distributed tin containers, the same size as a 10-pack of cigarettes, to convenience stores around the country. The tins, which were available at chains including Sainsbury\u2019s, Londis and Budgens, are printed with Marlboro branding, and feature deterrent pictures and the message \u201cSmoking kills\u201d. One expert said focusing on smaller packs could impact specific groups. \u201cResearch shows that packs of 10 appeal to young people and the price conscious,\u201d said Karen Reeves-Evans, of the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath. \u201cBy offering packs of 10 in reusable tins, Philip Morris International is knowingly increasing the lifespan of packs of 10 and promoting its brand, if smokers decant their cigarettes into these small branded tins. The fact that these tins appeared almost immediately prior to the branding and size restrictions coming into force is suspicious.\u201d Alex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North and a vocal campaigner for plain packaging, said the move appeared to be a ploy to prolong the visibility of Marlboro\u2019s brand in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s against the whole spirit of what\u2019s intended with the plain packaging legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tobacco companies will stop at nothing in order to retain their branding and sell a product that everyone knows has such tremendous health risks. It\u2019s an immature trick and I hope people will soon put them into their bins and they\u2019ll find their way to the recycling centre.\u201d The chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, Deborah Arnott, said the metal tins appeared to contradict the company\u2019s recent declaration that it was aiming for a \u201csmoke-free future\u201d. She said: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is not what they say but what they do.\u201d Philip Morris said it manufactured the tins before 20 May last year, the cutoff point after which tobacco firms were no longer allowed to produce branded packs. But the legislation gave firms a 12-month grace period to continue distribution, allowing the firm to keep selling them. It said only a \u201crelatively small number\u201d were distributed, although it would not say how many, adding that the stocks would be depleted by the weekend deadline. The tins cost the same as an ordinary pack of 10 cigarettes but, unlike cardboard packets, could help keep Marlboro\u2019s branding visible for years because they are so durable. A thread on Reddit, the messageboard website, suggests the tins havehelped increase the popularity of Marlboro, with users saying they were making an effort to find them. The Guardian understands that some retailers were offered the product but refused to stock it. Philip Morris rival JTI Gallaher has also issued aluminium tins for its Benson &amp; Hedges, Mayfair and Camel brands in the run-up to the plain packaging laws coming into force in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The move was described as \u201cextremely cynical\u201d by Ireland\u2019s former health minister James Reilly, according to the Sunday Times. JTI said it had last offered \u201climited-edition\u201d tins in the UK last year. British American Tobacco, which owns brands including Rothmans and Dunhill, said the company had not issued a similar product. The tobacco industry has previously come under fire for allegedly deploying tactics designed to limit the effect of plain packaging legislation, such as using price stickers to differentiate themselves from other brands. Companies were accused of ramping up production of branded packaging in the days leading up to 20 May last year, in order to stockpile packets for sale during the 12-month grace period in which their sale was still permitted. As well as the ban on branding and packs of 10, a series of new restrictions will come into force on Saturday, including larger health warnings and a ban on descriptions such as \u201clow tar\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d. Flavoured cigarettes and flavoured rolling tobacco will also be prohibited. Cancer Research UK welcomed the legislation, as well as regular increases in excise duty that the charity said mean the average smoker now spends around \u00a32,000 a year on their habit. It said the cost, coupled with tobacco control measures, would deter people from smoking, a pastime it said kills about 96,000 people in the UK every year. \u201cToday marks a momentous victory in the battle for a tobacco free future,\u201d said Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of prevention. \u201cStandardised packs will help protect the next generation from an addiction that kills around half of all regular smokers.\u201d Big tobacco firms have failed in successive attempts to overturn countries\u2019 laws on plain packaging. Philip Morris lost a landmark case against the government of Uruguay, while an attempt to overturn Australia\u2019s plain packaging law via a World Trade Organisation dispute also failed. Kicking the habit Smoking rates have plummeted since the 1970s, when almost half of the British adult population was partial to a regular gasper. In 1974, 46% of British people smoked, according to the Office for National Statistics. That proportion has since fallen to 17.2% in 2015. The steepest declines were seen in the 1970s and 80s, as the public reacted to growing evidence that linked smoking to health problems such as heart disease and lung cancer. The number of smokers making the decision to quit fluctuated in the 1990s but accelerated again after the ban on smoking in public places, imposed in 2007. In developed economies such as the US, UK and France, e-cigarettes have increasingly taken the place of ordinary cigarettes, with recent studies suggesting they are a genuine help in kicking the habit. There remains some difference in the smoking rates between different parts of the UK. England boasts the lowest rate at 16.9%, an all-time low, while Scotland\u2019s rate is highest at 19.1%.",

It\u2019s an immature trick and I hope people will soon put them into their bins and they\u2019ll find their way to the recycling centre.\u201d</p> <p>The chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, Deborah Arnott, said the metal tins appeared to contradict the company\u2019s recent declaration that it was aiming for a \u201csmoke-free future\u201d. She said: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is not what they say but what they do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d7e24a77bb0d5a0a1ff22b2b7124c768e51e0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7d7e24a77bb0d5a0a1ff22b2b7124c768e51e0a/282_0_3718_2231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Under the EU directive, all tobacco packaging will be uniformly green with large images showing the harmful effects of smoking\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warning labels on boxes of cigarettes in a newsagent in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philip Morris said it manufactured the tins before 20 May last year, the cutoff point after which tobacco firms were no longer allowed to produce branded packs. But the legislation gave firms a 12-month grace period to continue distribution, allowing the firm to keep selling them.</p> <p>It said only a \u201crelatively small number\u201d were distributed, although it would not say how many, adding that the stocks would be depleted by the weekend deadline.</p> <p>The tins cost the same as an ordinary pack of 10 cigarettes but, unlike cardboard packets, could help keep Marlboro\u2019s branding visible for years because they are so durable. A thread on Reddit, the messageboard website, suggests the tins havehelped increase the popularity of Marlboro, with users saying they were making an effort to find them.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that some retailers were offered the product but refused to stock it. </p> <p>Philip Morris rival JTI Gallaher has also issued aluminium tins for its Benson &amp; Hedges, Mayfair and Camel brands in the run-up to the plain packaging laws coming into force in the UK and Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>The move was described as \u201cextremely cynical\u201d by Ireland\u2019s former health minister James Reilly, according to the Sunday Times. </p> <p>JTI said it had last offered \u201climited-edition\u201d tins in the UK last year. British American Tobacco, which owns brands including Rothmans and Dunhill, said the company had not issued a similar product.</p> <p>The tobacco industry has previously come under fire for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/09/tobacco-companies-flout-law-plain-packaging\">allegedly deploying tactics designed to limit the effect of plain packaging</a> legislation, such as using price stickers to differentiate themselves from other brands.</p> <p>Companies were accused of ramping up production of branded packaging in the days leading up to 20 May last year, in order to stockpile packets for sale during the 12-month grace period in which their sale was still permitted.</p> <p>As well as the ban on branding and packs of 10, a series of new restrictions will come into force on Saturday, including larger health warnings and a ban on descriptions such as \u201clow tar\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d. Flavoured cigarettes and flavoured rolling tobacco will also be prohibited.</p> <p>Cancer Research UK welcomed the legislation, as well as regular increases in excise duty that the charity said mean the average smoker now spends around \u00a32,000 a year on their habit.</p> <p>It said the cost, coupled with tobacco control measures, would deter people from smoking, a pastime it said kills about 96,000 people in the UK every year.</p> <p>\u201cToday marks a momentous victory in the battle for a tobacco free future,\u201d said Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of prevention. \u201cStandardised packs will help protect the next generation from an addiction that kills around half of all regular smokers.\u201d</p> <p>Big tobacco firms have failed in successive attempts to overturn countries\u2019 laws on plain packaging. Philip Morris lost a landmark case against the government of Uruguay, while an attempt to overturn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/may/05/australias-defeats-wto-challenge-to-plain-packaging-of-tobacco\">Australia\u2019s plain packaging law</a> via a World Trade Organisation dispute also failed.</p> <h2>Kicking the habit</h2> <p>Smoking rates have plummeted since the 1970s, when almost half of the British adult population was partial to a regular gasper.</p> <p>In 1974, 46% of British people smoked, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2015#smoking-data-for-the-uk-from-the-annual-population-survey-2010-to-2015-adults-aged-18-years-and-above\">Office for National Statistics</a>. That proportion has since fallen to 17.2% in 2015.</p> <p>The steepest declines were seen in the 1970s and 80s, as the public reacted to growing evidence that linked smoking to health problems such as heart disease and lung cancer.</p> <p>The number of smokers making the decision to quit fluctuated in the 1990s but accelerated again after the ban on smoking in public places, imposed in 2007.</p> <p>In developed economies such as the US, UK and France, e-cigarettes have increasingly taken the place of ordinary cigarettes, with recent studies suggesting they are a genuine help in kicking the habit.</p> <p>There remains some difference in the smoking rates between different parts of the UK. England boasts the lowest rate at 16.9%, an all-time low, while Scotland\u2019s rate is highest at 19.1%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s voice recognition ID system used by half a million customers for secure access to their bank accounts has been breached by a customer\u2019s twin mimicking his voice. When it was launched last year HSBC\u2019s head of retail banking claimed the new system was secure, insisting that \u201cjust like your fingerprint, your voice print is unique\u201d. But when BBC Click reporter Dan Simmons set up an HSBC voice-ID authenticated account, his non-identical twin, Joe, was able to fool the system and granted him access to his brother\u2019s account. HSBC said it is to review security on its voice-access systems following the breach. Unlike traditional password systems, which lock users out after repeated attempts fail, Joe Simmons tried seven times to mimic his twin\u2019s voice before HSBC allowed access. The bank said it will in future only allow users three attempts to access their accounts using voice ID before blocking them. The HSBC system asks users to say \u201cmy voice is my password\u201d into the phone, which is then matched to an original recording of the person\u2019s voice, allowing access to their account. According to the BBC, the breach did not allow Joe Simmons to withdraw money, but he was able to access balances and recent transactions, and was offered the chance to transfer money between accounts. \u201cWhat\u2019s really alarming is that the bank allowed me seven attempts to mimic my brother\u2019s voiceprint and get it wrong, before I got in at the eighth time of trying,\u201d he said. Voice ID is currently being rolled out to 15 million HSBC customers. At launch, HSBC said: \u201cThe technology is now the ultimate way to bank safely and securely, without the need for passwords. With a couple of choice words, banking with HSBC is as easy as being yourself.\u201d But in a statement issued after the breach was made public, HSBC said: \u201cThe security and safety of our customers\u2019 accounts is of the utmost importance to us and Voice ID is amongst the most secure methods of authenticating customers. \u201cThe introduction of this technology has seen a significant reduction in telephone fraud, and has proven to be more secure than PINs, passwords and memorable phrases. Our VoiceID system does allow us to make changes to different security settings, and following a review we have made changes to make it even more secure.\u201d Embarrassed HSBC officials have suggested that the BBC Click experiment, while real, does not open the door to fraudsters. One said: \u201cThis is not how fraudsters work. This was a twin sitting with his brother. He would just as likely know other security data such as mother\u2019s maiden name, pet\u2019s name and so on. \u201cIn a real situation you would not have a fraudster sitting next to you. If he or she tried recording your voice saying \u2018my voice is my password\u2019 it would not work either, as the system is able to detect synthetic voice characteristics.\u201d Barclays introduced voice recognition software for all its 300,000 wealthiest clients in the UK in 2013. A year later the bank said the technology had been so successful that it would be rolled out to 12 million retail banking customers. Barclays said it had been \u201cincredibly popular\u201d with wealthier clients, with the time taken to verify their identity falling from 1.5 minutes to less than 10 seconds.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For eight years, Britain\u2019s most vilified banker has kept a low profile. But next week in London\u2019s high court a \u00a3520m legal case will force Fred Goodwin into the limelight. Thousands of shareholders in Royal Bank of Scotland are accusing the institution\u2019s former chief executive \u2013 along with three former board colleagues and the bank itself \u2013 of misleading them when they bought the bank\u2019s shares in a failed rescue attempt in April 2008. Goodwin is scheduled to appear at the high court over two days starting on the day of the general election, 8 June. It will be the first time Goodwin has been forced to publicly account for the bank\u2019s \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout since politicians on the Treasury select committee questioned him in February 2009. It will also be the first time senior bankers have been questioned about their role during the financial crisis in a London court. For the 58-year-old Scotsman it will be an unwelcome intrusion into a life that now involves playing golf and tinkering with vintage cars in Edinburgh. But for the 9,000 private shareholders and major institutions bringing the legal action, it is a moment they have been working towards for years. RBS has tried to stop the case getting to court. In the last six months, the bailed-out bank has reached settlements with 87% of the investors that had issued lawsuits in connection with the crucial \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008 at the heart of the case. The shareholders in the high court case, who lost all their money in the failed fund raising when RBS was rescued by the taxpayer that September, argue that they were misled about the scale of the bank\u2019s problems at the time. Sir Howard Davies, the chair of RBS, told the bank\u2019s annual general meeting earlier this month: \u201cThe settlement does not constitute any admission of liability by the bank, but allows us to minimise material litigation expense and management distraction.\u201d The shareholders involved in the high court case \u2013 who include former staff and football club owner Trevor Hemmings \u2013 have not agreed to an out-of-court deal. Others such as former RBS board member Sir Angus Grossart, also a former shareholder, have attempted to join. Unless a settlement can be agreed at the 11th hour, the case involving Goodwin, his former chair Sir Tom McKillop, and two others who were at the helm of the bank during the run-up to its near collapse will begin on Monday. Goodwin\u2019s defence costs will be covered by the bank and have already reached \u00a36.5m \u2013 part of the colossal \u00a3125m legal bill RBS has incurred so far. He is being prepared for the case by his legal team at Clifford Chance who will be advising him on what to expect in court and prepare his formal witness statement. It is a civil case heard before a high court judge without a jury so Goodwin does not face any criminal sanction, but RBS is facing a compensation claim of \u00a3520m plus interest \u2013 which could take it up to \u00a3800m \u2013 from the investors. PR expert Mark Borkowski believes the court appearance \u2013 Goodwin\u2019s evidence is scheduled for next month \u2013 is a moment for the banker to show \u201cchastened humility\u201d. The once-feted banker \u2013 he was awarded Forbes businessman of the year in 2002 \u2013 has \u201cdisappeared off the radar\u201d since his departure from RBS in October 2008 after the bailout, points out Borkowski. Unlike other disgraced public figures who have tried to rehabilitate themselves, Goodwin has shunned charity or voluntary work. He took on an advisory role at architects RMJM before being stripped of his knighthood in 2012. One public affairs guru says that if asked to advise Goodwin, he would tell the former chief executive to expect a more forensic type form of scrutiny: \u201cYou\u2019re being cross-examined by a barrister, not a politician, and a judge will not stand for grandstanding or turning it into a media circus.\u201d In 2009 his appearance before MPs was broadcast live. The public anger was only just brewing then \u2013 he still had his knighthood and full \u00a3700,000-a-year pension \u2013 when he offered his \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d. This time only those who turn up in the public gallery will hear his voice as courts do not permit recording or broadcasting. But Goodwin \u2013 who eventually agreed to reduce his annual pension to \u00a3342,000 \u2013 will still expect an uncomfortable ride as the lawyers bury into the detail in the 140-page prospectus that accompanied the rights issue. The investors\u2019 case centres on this document, which they allege contained untrue or misleading statements that did not give a true picture of the bank\u2019s financial state. Goodwin had also told the MPs about his own personal financial losses \u2013 a \u00a35m fall in the value of his shares \u2013 although this does not appear to have helped him win sympathy from disgruntled shareholders. Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club, a chain of pubs and a stable of racehorses, admits he is among the private investors who have lost a \u201csignificant sum of money\u201d. He is also helping to fund the legal action. \u201cWe want to and will see justice done with fair compensation. That is why I have financially backed the case \u2013 for everyone who lost out,\u201d Hemmings told Reuters this week. Notable among them is John Greenwood, the private investor whose name was used in legal documents to make the original claim in the high court. A 75-year-old retired civil engineer from Huddersfield, Greenwood starting buying RBS shares in 2006 to fund his pension. He backed the cash call before selling out in October 2008, when his loses were put at \u00a345,000. While he will not attend court on Monday he has not decided whether he will make the trip to London when Goodwin is scheduled to appear. The timing for Goodwin is fortuitous: a day when the focus may well be on the politicians fighting for their futures and not the disgraced banker fighting for his reputation.",

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/rbs-agrees-multimillion-pound-settlement-with-shareholders\">the last six months</a>, the bailed-out bank has reached settlements with 87% of the investors that had issued lawsuits in connection with the crucial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/22/royalbankofscotlandgroup.creditcrunch1\">\u00a312bn cash call in April 2008</a> at the heart of the case. The shareholders in the high court case, who lost all their money in the failed fund raising when RBS was rescued by the taxpayer that September, argue that they were misled about the scale of the bank\u2019s problems at the time. Sir Howard Davies, the chair of RBS, told the bank\u2019s annual general meeting earlier this month: \u201cThe settlement does not constitute any admission of liability by the bank, but allows us to minimise material litigation expense and management distraction.\u201d</p> <p>The shareholders involved in the high court case \u2013 who include former staff and football club owner Trevor Hemmings \u2013 have not agreed to an out-of-court deal. Others such as former RBS board member Sir Angus Grossart, also a former shareholder, have attempted to join. Unless a settlement can be agreed at the 11th hour, the case involving Goodwin, his former chair Sir Tom McKillop, and two others who were at the helm of the bank during the run-up to its near collapse will begin on Monday.</p> <p>Goodwin\u2019s defence costs will be covered by the bank and have already reached \u00a36.5m \u2013 part of the colossal \u00a3125m legal bill RBS has incurred so far. He is being prepared for the case by his legal team at Clifford Chance who will be advising him on what to expect in court and prepare his formal witness statement. It is a civil case heard before a high court judge without a jury so Goodwin does not face any criminal sanction, but RBS is facing a compensation claim of \u00a3520m plus interest \u2013 which could take it up to \u00a3800m \u2013 from the investors. </p> <p>PR expert Mark Borkowski believes the court appearance \u2013 Goodwin\u2019s evidence is scheduled for next month \u2013 is a moment for the banker to show \u201cchastened humility\u201d.</p> <p>The once-feted banker \u2013 he was awarded Forbes businessman of the year in 2002 \u2013 has \u201cdisappeared off the radar\u201d since his departure from RBS in October 2008 after the bailout, points out Borkowski. Unlike other disgraced public figures who have tried to rehabilitate themselves, Goodwin has shunned charity or voluntary work. He took on an advisory role at architects RMJM before being stripped of his knighthood in 2012.</p> <p>One public affairs guru says that if asked to advise Goodwin, he would tell the former chief executive to expect a more forensic type form of scrutiny: \u201cYou\u2019re being cross-examined by a barrister, not a politician, and a judge will not stand for grandstanding or turning it into a media circus.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009 his appearance before MPs was broadcast live. The public anger was only just brewing then \u2013 he still had his knighthood and full \u00a3700,000-a-year pension \u2013 when he offered his \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d.</p> <p>This time only those who turn up in the public gallery will hear his voice as courts do not permit recording or broadcasting. But Goodwin \u2013 who eventually agreed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/18/rbs-sir-fred-goodwin-pension\">to reduce his annual pension to \u00a3342,000</a> \u2013 will still expect an uncomfortable ride as the lawyers bury into the detail in <a href=\"http://www.investors.rbs.com/~/media/Files/R/RBS-IR/corporate-actions/rights-issue-june-2008/prospectusfinal.pdf\">the 140-page prospectus</a> that accompanied the rights issue. The investors\u2019 case centres on this document, which they allege contained untrue or misleading statements that did not give a true picture of the bank\u2019s financial state. </p> <p> Goodwin had also told the MPs about his own personal financial losses \u2013 a \u00a35m fall in the value of his shares \u2013 although this does not appear to have helped him win sympathy from disgruntled shareholders.</p> <p>Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club, a chain of pubs and a stable of racehorses, admits he is among the private investors who have lost a \u201csignificant sum of money\u201d. He is also helping to fund the legal action.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to and will see justice done with fair compensation. That is why I have financially backed the case \u2013 for everyone who lost out,\u201d Hemmings told Reuters this week.</p> <p>Notable among them is John Greenwood, the private investor whose name was used in legal documents to make the original claim in the high court. A 75-year-old retired civil engineer from Huddersfield, Greenwood starting buying RBS shares in 2006 to fund his pension. He backed the cash call before selling out in October 2008, when his loses were put at \u00a345,000.</p> <p>While he will not attend court on Monday he has not decided whether he will make the trip to London when Goodwin is scheduled to appear. The timing for Goodwin is fortuitous: a day when the focus may well be on the politicians fighting for their futures and not the disgraced banker fighting for his reputation.</p> <p></p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",

      "bodyText": "UK factories have cashed in on the sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, with export orders at the joint highest level in three and a half years. The stronger than expected findings from a survey by the CBI, the UK business trade body, suggest manufacturers had a decent start to the second quarter, boosting hopes that the sector will help prop up the wider economy as a consumer slowdown takes hold. \u201cThe summer sun has come out early for Britain\u2019s manufacturers. Robust demand at both home and abroad is reflected in strong order books, and output is picking up the pace,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI. Factories also enjoyed strong demand from domestic customers, driving total order books to the highest level in more than two years, according to the CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey. In a further sign of strength, output at Britain\u2019s factories grew at the fastest pace since December 2013, underpinned by the mechanical engineering and chemicals sectors. Firms expected production to rise again in the coming quarter. Of the 432 firms that took part in the survey, conducted between 25 April and 12 May, 22% said their export order books were above normal for the time of year, while 12% said they were below normal. That gave a balance of +10%, the joint highest balance since December 2013. Economists said strong export orders were a sign that manufacturers were benefiting from a drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote last June. The pound is about 13% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the referendum, making British-made goods cheaper abroad. \u201cThe improvement in the export orders balance, to its joint highest since December 2013, indicates that the drop in the pound is still having substantial positive effects for manufacturing exporters,\u201d said Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThe upbeat survey supports our view that the manufacturing sector should perform well this year and help to offset some of the slowdown in consumer spending growth.\u201d Manufacturers have reported factories working at full capacity in recent months to meet demand from overseas customers benefiting from the low pound. The EEF, which represents manufacturing firms, said last week that orders were improving as UK exporters enjoyed an improved competitive position \u201cvis-a-vis the pound depreciation\u201d and global growth picked up strongly from a dip last year. But there is anecdotal evidence that while manufacturers have boosted production, they remain reluctant to increase investment and expand capacity. Many remain nervous that the fallout from the Brexit negotiations may harm the economy. They are also concerned that sterling could rise, wiping out the benefit for exporters, should the Brexit talks proceed smoothly and the UK strike a beneficial trade deal with Brussels. The CBI pointed out that although orders and output were up at UK factories, manufacturers were facing higher costs for imported raw materials. As a result, firms were expecting to raise their selling prices. \u201cOn the other side of the coin, we have mounting cost pressures and expectations for factory-gate price rises are running high,\u201d said Newton-Smith. \u201cBoosting productivity is key to alleviating some of the cost pressures that manufacturers are facing. Sustained investment in innovation and education will be vital to shore up the success of British industry.\u201d The CBI findings ended a mixed week for economic data. The latest official jobs figures show prices rose at a faster pace than pay in the first three months of the year, putting household budgets under increased pressure. But they also show record levels of employment, with unemployment at a 42-year low. Workers\u2019 average earnings rose by 2.1% year on year in the three months to March, while inflation was 2.3% in the same period. Retail sales jumped 2.3% in April, rebounding from a 1.4% fall in March as the warmer weather and Easter holidays encouraged shoppers back on to Britain\u2019s high streets. It was more than double the 1% increase predicted by economists, and suggested consumers were willing to put aside fears over falling living standards.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick round-up. Ahead of Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, Greek MPs have passed a series of new austerity measures introduced to help release the latest tranche of bailout funds from the country\u2019s creditors. While the forthcoming get together of finance ministers is likely to be a long and possibly contentious one, the Athens stock market welcomed the Greek vote and is currently up 0.25%. Other stock markets are also ending the week on a positive note after the mid-week slump following the latest controversies surrounding Donald Trump. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open marginally higher, up around 30 points. Meanwhile oil has moved higher on hopes that next week\u2019s Opec meeting will sanction an extension to November\u2019s agreement to curtail production. In the UK, the CBI has reported that factory orders in May were at their highest level since 2015. The pound has been hovering around the $1.30 level for the second day in a row. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. Looking ahead to Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting, which will discuss the Greek debt situation (yet again): The pound is now back above $1.30, up 0.57% at $1.3009. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, said: The pound lost ground yesterday afternoon but remains on course for weekly gains against the US dollar, having tiptoed back above the psychologically important $1.30 level in early European trade today. The lingering political storm in the US surrounding President Trump continues to heap some pressure on the dollar, casting doubts over whether he can deliver the pro-growth economic reforms which were supporting expectations for the Federal Reserve to carry on lifting interest rates gradually this year. Sterling is having a harder time against the euro and changes hands at \u20ac1.1648 at noon, putting it on track to finish the week below \u20ac1.17 for the first time since Theresa May announced next month\u2019s snap general election. European markets are managing to stay in positive territory, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open marginally higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The gentle return to positive trading continued this Friday, the European indices all reclaiming some of the week\u2019s losses. The FTSE kept hold of its 30 point rise as the morning progressed, though the UK index still couldn\u2019t find the energy to re-cross the 7500 mark. The pound was even perkier, surging half a percent against the dollar to once again surpass $1.30... The CAC actually ended up being the morning\u2019s best performer, the French index jumping 0.6%; the DAX was less enthused, rising 0.3% to clamber over 12600. Neither the Eurozone indices, nor the euro itself, seem too fussed by the news that Greek MPs passed the latest austerity measures required by the eurogroup; investors instead enjoying the lack of Trump/Russia twists and turns. Talking of Trump, the Dow Jones is in for its own green open \u2013 just. The futures have the Dow nudging 0.1% higher after the bell, keeping the US index a few points away from the 20700 mark and roughly 300 points away from Tuesday\u2019s highs. The pound has edged up above $1.30 for the second day in a row, but can it hold on to that level? The CBI survey is an encouraging sign, says economist Howard Archer at IHS Markit: [It] fuels hopes that the UK economy is on course for some pick-up in growth in the second quarter after GDP expansion more than halved to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. Hopes of improved second quarter growth got a significant boost from retail sales picking up markedly in April, although they were helped by warmer weather and serious concerns remain over the squeeze on consumer purchasing power. It needs to be borne in mind that manufacturing output only accounts for 10.3% of UK GDP and that surveys on the sector have recently tended to be stronger than the hard data. Back in the UK, and some positive economic news. Factory orders are growing at their fastest rate since February 2015, according to the latest industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The order book balance for May came rose to +9 from +4 in April, compared to expectations of a flat reading. Factory output growth over the past three months rose to +28 from +22, the highest since December 2013. The weak pound and a recovering global economy are lifting manufacturers at a time when consumer spending is coming under pressure. But there are continuing worries about rising costs, and weak productivity. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: The summer sun has come out early for Britain\u2019s manufacturers. Robust demand at both home and abroad is reflected in strong order books, and output is picking up the pace. On the other side of the coin though, we have mounting cost pressures and expectations for factory-gate price rises are running high. Boosting productivity is key to alleviating some of the cost pressures that manufacturers are facing. Sustained investment in innovation and education will be vital to shore up the success of British industry. The media this morning is of the view that time is very much of the essence if emergency bailout funds are to be disbursed before Greece\u2019s \u20ac7.5bn debt repayment matures in July, reports our correspondent Helena Smith: While issuing a statement saying the ball is now in the creditors\u2019 court, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has also attempted to soften the blow of measures his government would never normally endorse by shifting the narrative to the issue of debt. Ahead of the vote, the leftist leader enthused that soon he could be \u201cforced to wear a tie\u201d. \u201cThe news is so positive that we are having difficulty believing it,\u201d he told parliamentary reporters adding that the German chancellor Angela Merkel had waded in personally saying she would deal with the debt issue. The once fiery anti-austerian has long said he will only wear a tie once the Greek debt problem is solved with substantial debt relief. If Athens is able to write down a debt load now hovering around 180% of GDP \u2013 the equivalent of the GDP of South Africa \u2013 the government hopes Greece will then be included in the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing program, thus opening the way to the country once again tapping international markets. Athens\u2019 dependency on international loans has only exacerbated the debt load. The German media this morning, in extensive coverage of the latest cost-cutting measures Greece has legislated, describes debt relief as the ace up Tsipras\u2019 sleeve. With the systematic passage of policies his Syriza party once vociferously vowed to expunge, the popularity of the leftist-led government has plunged dramatically with the centre-right main opposition New Democracy party leading by 10 % in the latest Prorata opinion poll commissioned by the leftist Syntaktwn newspaper. During the often boisterous debate that preceded Thursday\u2019s late night vote Tsipras insisted that the controversial pension cuts and tax reforms MPs were being called to support would not be implemented if debt relief was not forthcoming. Senior European officials are quoted this morning as saying they are now in a race against the clock. Speculation of a comprehensive deal being deferred to June 15 when the eurogroup next meets would, they say, be too late for the process of having emergency bailout funds ratified by European governments and disbursed in time for the \u20ac7.5bn debt repayment in July. Everything will depend on the International Monetary Fund being brought on board and with ongoing disagreement over the ability of Greece\u2019s economy to grow - vital to calculating debt relief - that is far from sure. The Washington-based organization has said repeatedly that without Greece\u2019s debt being made sustainable, it will not sign up to the bailout. If that happens European officials say there will be no tranche for Greece. \u201cIt may be a difficult night,\u201d Tsipras said referring to Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting. Here\u2019s a downbeat assessment of Greece and the eurozone from Swissquote Bank\u2019s Yann Quelenn, despite the country\u2019s parliament approving the latest austerity measures: It has been a while since Greece was at the top of the market news. We consider this is as a key issue for the European Union so we are still monitoring the country. It is now back into recession (printing two consecutive growth negative quarters) despite the massive austerity policies over the last few years Pension cuts or the increase in taxes do not seem to be sufficient and the cost of servicing the debt is way too massive so we do not see any positive issue on that. Greece cannot devalue its currency and so it is then forced to devalue internally, for instance its public aid (pensions in particular). Since February 2015, Greece has repaid \u20ac35.4 billion and by the end of 2018 Greece must repay \u20ac28 billion (including \u20ac2.7 billion of interest). To put that into perspective, the 2016 nominal GDP was \u20ac176 billion. The economy must then expand by at least more than 1.5% next year. And next year repayments are less than half of what Greece will need to pay in 2019. We don\u2019t see how Greece will be able to reimburse this debt as it is clear that the country won\u2019t be able to print a growth above the cost of servicing its debt. In the short-term, everything looks decent on the single currency side but what will happen when Portugal or Spain have issues as deep as Greece. Uncertainties are far from over on the euro side. Good news - mainly - for Portugal. Moody\u2019s has kept the country\u2019s credit rating at Ba1 with a stable outlook in its annual analysis. This reflects Portugal\u2019s economic recovery and stronger labour market, countered with its very high government debt. Evan Wohlmann, a Moody\u2019s vice president and co-author of the report, said: Portugal\u2019s credit profile is supported by the economic recovery, its return to private capital markets, the economy\u2019s diversification and relatively high average wealth levels. Portugal\u2019s key credit constraint relates to its very high government debt. Although we expect debt to start declining as a share of GDP this year, any debt reduction will only be gradual. Moody\u2019s highlights: Portugal\u2019s gross public debt ratio remains one of the highest in the EU and the highest in the Ba1 space. Debt-to-GDP ratio will gradually decline, supported by an average primary surplus of 2.3% over the next two years and a moderate nominal GDP growth, but will still remain around 125% of GDP in 2020. After improving to 1.8% of GDP in 2017, Portugal\u2019s general government deficit will deteriorate slightly in 2018 to 2.0% of GDP, compared to a deficit of 1.0% next year forecast by the Portuguese authorities given the rating agency\u2019s assumption of more moderate growth and a stronger increase in expenditure. However, the deficit will remain below the 3% Maastricht threshold set by the European Commission. We expect Portugal\u2019s economic recovery to continue, with an increase in GDP growth to 1.7% in 2017, before moderating to 1.4% in 2018. Over in Greece, the Athens market has greeted the news of the austerity vote positively. It is currently up 0.67% at 787.53. Oil prices are rising ahead of a meeting of Opec producers next week, as hopes grow that a production cut agreed in November could be extended by nine months to March 2018. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia, key producers, recently suggested such an extension was possible, pledging to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to tackle a supply glut. Even though US shale producers are taking up some of the slack from output cuts elsewhere, the prospect of such an extension is supporting crude prices. Brent is currently up 1.2% at $53.16 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is up a similar amount at around $50. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Markets currently price in a nine-month extension in OPEC/Russia production cuts and the $50 level has been a reasonable target for those who took the oil recovery bet. [An] additional rise toward the $53/$55 is expected to be bumpier as it would certainly require deeper output cuts and/or any positive surprise at the May 25 meeting. As the markets end the week on a slightly more positive note, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: There\u2019s a general feeling of relief that the US-led sell-off didn\u2019t accelerate last night. Instead, all the major US stock indices managed to post modest gains despite earlier weakness. It may be too soon to sound the all-clear but so far investors are doing exactly what they\u2019ve done for the past eight years: using any significant pull-back in equity markets as a buying opportunity. But what will be of interest is to see if this bounce-back has the strength and conviction to push the indices back up towards or beyond recent record highs. Most of the trading gaps which formed after the first round of the French presidential election have now been filled. So technically there\u2019s every chance of a resumption of a US-led stock market rally. In the near-term much depends on what comes out of Washington. But for now most investors will be happy to go into the weekend with another positive session for the major indices. With the overnight recovery on Wall Street after Wednesday\u2019s slump and a relatively positive performance in Asia - the Nikkei 225 ended up 0.19% - European markets are also making a positive start to trading. The FTSE 100 is up 24 points or 0.33% although pharmaceutical group Hikma is down 6% after cutting its revenue forecasts following a delay to a US drug launch. This takes its total fall this week to 10% so far. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s Dax opened up 0.1% while France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.2%. The pound rose above $1.30 on Thursday for the first time since September, but it did not manage to hold that level. Konstantinos Anthis at ADS Securities said: The pound has had a turbulent 24 hours. A rally through the 1.3000 level yesterday took it to 1.3050 but a few hours later it collapsed to 1.2900 and ended the day around 50 pips higher. The mini flash crash was not related to any particular data set, so the drop was probably down to a combinations of factors. Sterling has risen around 7.5% in value over the past 30 days so the drop may have been traders taking money off the table, or it could have been down to the launch of the Conservative manifesto and the words of Theresa May. It is currently up 0.12% at $1.2953, while against the euro it is down 0.09% at \u20ac1.1641. Speaking of the manifesto, Citigroup analysts said it showed that the Conservatives showed no signs of moving to a \u201cSingapore-upon-Thames\u2019 model of a deregulated, low tax economy. The bank said her bet on an early election should pay off, but rather hedged its bets in terms of a possible Tory majority, saying it could be anything between 104 and 190 seats. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece\u2019s parliament has agreed to the latest austerity measures demanded by its creditors to unlock the next tranche of financial aid. But the proposed cuts to pensions and tax hikes drew angry protestors outside parliament as the vote took place. Some hurled petrol bombs and firecrackers at police, who in turn released tear gas. Now the measures have been approved, the left-led Syriza government now hopes that European finance ministers will agree at a meeting on Monday to release \u20ac7.5bn of bailout funds, as well as looking at granting debt relief which will allow the International Monetary Fund to participate in the bailout. More immediately, it needs cash to repay a tranche of debt which is due in July. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras said (quote from Reuters): We deserve and we expect from Monday\u2019s eurogroup a decision regulating debt relief which will correspond to the sacrifices of the Greek people. The country is still struggling, however, after seven years of crisis, with figures earlier this week showing it had gone back into recession. Here is the agenda for Monday\u2019s meeting as regards Greece: The Eurogroup will be informed about the preliminary agreement reached on 2 May between Greece and the institutions (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the European Stability Mechanism and the International Monetary Fund) on a new set of policy reforms in the context of Greece\u2019s economic adjustment programme, financed by the European Stability Mechanism. The agreement is one of the steps towards completing the ongoing second review of the programme and paving the way for the next disbursement of financial assistance to Greece by the European Stability Mechanism. The Eurogroup will also discuss Greece\u2019s medium-term (from 2018 onwards) fiscal targets and the issues related to the sustainability of the country\u2019s public debt. Elsewhere, after Wednesday\u2019s plunge on Wall Street following the latest accusations against President Trump, US shares managed to regain some ground, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.2%. The recovery was too late to help European markets however, which ended the day in the red. Analysts expect a more positive start to trading today. But David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK said there was still a fairly large amount of fear in the markets: Buying the dip works well when the economic and political outlook appears to be positive, but given the uncertainty that surrounds Donald Trump you can see why we have only seen a small drop in the VIX. The scandal in Washington DC hasn\u2019t gone away and neither has trader\u2019s nerves. Going long too soon could prove to be costly. A political scandal of this scale is going to stay hanging over Mr Trump for some time, and even if nothing comes of it in the end, it\u2019s going to be a long and drawn out process. Having this story lingering away will be enough to unsettle traders. As befits a Friday, as thoughts turn towards the weekend, the agenda is looking a little thin, but the CBI is due to release its latest industrial trends survey later this morning.",

      "bodyText": "Manned air traffic control towers, a reassuring fixture at airports since the dawn of civil aviation nearly a century ago, could soon be made obsolete by technological advances allowing arrivals and departures to be monitored from miles away using live streams of high-definition video. A 50-metre control tower is being built at London City airport but it will be populated by a suite of HD cameras instead of humans, as it vies to become the first major hub in the world to manage its traffic remotely. From 2019, the controllers\u2019 window over the Docklands\u2019 skyline in east London will be a bank of HD screens, joined in a seamless panorama in a digital control room at Nats, the UK\u2019s national air traffic control service, in Swanwick, Hampshire. They will monitor a live feed from 14 cameras at London City, 80 miles away \u2013 and for now, a week\u2019s worth of recorded action shot from a crane before the tower is built. The airport believes it will allow staff to monitor aircraft on the runway and track the skies better than before. The complete 360-degree view has been condensed into a 225-degree arc, meaning the controller can in effect have eyes in the back of their heads \u2013 even if they peruse what appears to be a banana-shaped runway. From this room, the controller can pan and zoom cameras for a detailed view, sharper than the binoculars of old. Sitting in the air traffic controller\u2019s chair in Swanwick, you get a piercingly clear, bird\u2019s-eye view of the aircraft lining the runway and the waves lapping the docks by the Thames, as the sound of engines revving filters through. But what has most enthused controllers is the Pok\u00e9mon Go-style augmented reality that the system brings. Overlaid on the live video image, at the flick of a switch, is all the data that used to occupy several other screens or terminals. While staring out of the virtual window at an incoming plane, the controller can see all the identifying flight and radar information in the skies alongside it. Alison FitzGerald, chief operations officer at London City, said: \u201cYou appreciate the view, but it\u2019s the augmented reality that\u2019s the real game-changer: the aircraft call signs, the ability to detect anything in the airspace, to identify things that normally wouldn\u2019t be clear, weather information, so we can make much better decisions. It\u2019s providing more tools in front of them rather than having to look away.\u201d At night, the contours of the runway can be highlighted with graphics. In low light, visibility can be improved. And should cameras detect anything that is not authorised traffic \u2013 any four-pixel moving dot that could be anything from a passing helicopter to a drone \u2013 the system can automatically zoom in and track it, with a pop-up inset window on the video cityscape. Steve Anderson, head of transformation at Nats, said: \u201cIt\u2019s heads-up, all the info is there while they are looking at the screens, everything they don\u2019t have at the moment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the future.\u201d The sounds of the airport are also played over speakers, to make this virtual world more realistic - potentially noisier, in fact, than some insulated control rooms - after trials showed it helped controllers. \u201cIt sounds a bit silly pumping noise into a control room but it\u2019s something they need to do the job,\u201d Anderson added. The system has been developed by Swedish defence manufacturer Saab, using technology from its Gripen fighter jet. Digital control towers are so far only in operational use in two small airports in Sweden, with a third at Saab\u2019s Link\u00f6ping home to follow this year. Trials have taken place around the world, including in Ireland, the US and Australia. Three separate , independent and secure super-fast fibre networks will transmit the images and data from City to Nats\u2019 control room. The distance from Docklands to Swanwick is dwarfed by that of aircraft manoeuvres monitored in Australian tests: from Alice Springs to an Adelaide control room, 900 miles away, with less than a second\u2019s delay in transmission, according to Saab. Any security fears are dismissed by Mike Stoller, Nats operations director for airports, who said this system is no more hackable than current aircraft control: much of Britain\u2019s airspace outside airports is already managed remotely from Swanwick. Typically, the cost of constructing a traditional aircraft tower \u2013 in the tens of millions of pounds \u2013 as well as staffing it could be potentially prohibitive for smaller airfields. So is this is it for the humans? For now, according to Stoller, there is no prospect of that. But he added: \u201cAt some point in the future, like any other business, we will look at efficiencies down the line.\u201d Controllers can expect to be retrained to work at more than one airport, Stoller said. Paul Winstanley, chair of the Prospect union\u2019s air traffic controllers\u2019 branch, said the technology could bring safety enhancements, but cautioned: \u201cIt must be introduced in a measured and appropriate way. It must never be used to allow a single controller to be responsible for more than one runway at a time.\u201d For now, the virtual London City control room at Swanwick will house the same staff who occupy the tower in London, three per shift. City says cost has not been a consideration in its \u00a3350m expansion plan. London City chief executive, Declan Collier, said: \u201cWe could replicate the current system, but the way technology is moving, this kind of augmented reality is going to be the norm. We want to future-proof the airport.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "National Grid boss says Labour plan will stall green energy drive", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s plan to take the National Grid back into public ownership would harm the UK\u2019s switch to green energy, the grid\u2019s chief executive has said. John Pettigrew said renationalisation was \u201cthe last thing the industry needs\u201d as it invests to accommodate more wind and solar power on the UK\u2019s power grids. \u201cClearly, on nationalisation, we do not think it is a good idea,\u201d Pettigrew said, as the company reported operating profits up 14% to \u00a34.7bn for 2016-17. Its market capitalisation is about \u00a338bn, including its US business. \u201cTo spend tens of billions of taxpayer money on nationalisation I\u2019m just not convinced would be in the interest of taxpayers nor of energy consumers going forward,\u201d he told the Guardian. Labour\u2019s manifesto promised to take energy back into public ownership in order to deliver more renewable energy and cut costs for consumers. But Pettigrew said the grid had coped with the rapid growth in variable power from windfarms and solar panels in the past five years, and argued that such technologies would be hit by instability from the party\u2019s proposal. \u201cWhat industry needs to take advantage of all these clean energies is stable regulation and stable policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing they need is renationalisation.\u201d A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cBritain is going backwards in low-carbon energy and infrastructure. Our national and regional grids are outdated, and are failing to incorporate renewable energy sources quickly enough. Nor are they investing in a smarter grid able to balance more volatile sources of renewable energy and deliver flexible capacity.\u201d Pettigrew, who joined National Grid shortly after it was privatised in 1990, said the costs of transmitting power across the UK had come down 40% since public ownership. Private companies would be better suited than the public sector to paying the \u00a3230bn-\u00a3462bn annual investment needed globally to switch to clean energy, he claimed, citing a figure from a recent report. National Grid spent a record \u00a34.5bn on capital expenditure for its UK and US businesses last year, up from \u00a33.9bn for the previous financial year. Analysts broadly welcomed the company\u2019s \u201csolid\u201d performance and profits on Thursday, which were slightly above expectations. \u201cFor those wanting a reliable income from their investments, National Grid can\u2019t be far from the top of the list,\u201d said George Salmon, equity analyst at investment adviser Hargreaves Lansdown. Separately, investors in two of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies appear to have shrugged off the impact of Theresa May\u2019s price cap on the energy bills. The share price of British Gas owner Centrica was up by 2% and SSE was up 1% on Thursday after the Tory manifesto included only a woolly promise to protect \u201cmore customers on the poorest-value tariffs\u201d, compared with the 17m households the party had pledged before. The Conservatives also said they would remove the need for planning permission for companies undertaking exploratory shale drilling, and create a new shale regulator to speed up development. With public opinion mostly against fracking, the local planning system has caused long delays for the industry, even after ministers attempted to fast-track the process, so the move would be a significant change. Onshore windfarms, which the Tories campaigned hard against in the 2015 general election, were still considered unacceptable in England, but would get support in remote Scottish islands. One notable omission was nuclear power, compared with the 2015 manifesto, which promised a \u201csignificant expansion in new nuclear\u201d. \u201cThe lack of any mention of nuclear energy is telling: it\u2019s clear May doesn\u2019t want to be associated with a beleaguered industry at a time when alternatives like wind and solar are getting ever cheaper,\u201d said Greenpeace UK\u2019s executive director, John Sauven, who was also critical of the support for shale gas. One right-leaning thinktank said the manifesto oversold the benefits of fracking. Sam Hall, a senior researcher for Bright Blue, said: \u201cWhile stringently regulated fracking could meet the UK\u2019s demand for gas for a couple more decades, the Conservatives\u2019 priority should be incentivising cheap renewables, which are attracting the majority of new energy investment worldwide, as part of its modern industrial strategy.\u201d",

Its market capitalisation is about \u00a338bn, including its US business.</p> <p>\u201cTo spend tens of billions of taxpayer money on nationalisation I\u2019m just not convinced would be in the interest of taxpayers nor of energy consumers going forward,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s manifesto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/10/labour-party-manifesto-pledges-to-end-tuition-fees-and-nationalise-railways\">promised to take energy back into public ownership</a> in order to deliver more renewable energy and cut costs for consumers. But Pettigrew said the grid had coped with the rapid growth in variable power from windfarms and solar panels in the past five years, and argued that such technologies would be hit by instability from the party\u2019s proposal. </p> <p>\u201cWhat industry needs to take advantage of all these clean energies is stable regulation and stable policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing they need is renationalisation.\u201d </p> <p>A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cBritain is going backwards in low-carbon energy and infrastructure. Our national and regional grids are outdated, and are failing to incorporate renewable energy sources quickly enough. Nor are they investing in a smarter grid able to balance more volatile sources of renewable energy and deliver flexible capacity.\u201d</p> <p>Pettigrew, who joined National Grid shortly after it was privatised in 1990, said the costs of transmitting power across the UK had come down 40% since public ownership. Private companies would be better suited than the public sector to paying the \u00a3230bn-\u00a3462bn annual investment needed globally to switch to clean energy, he claimed, citing a figure from <a href=\"http://www.energy-transitions.org/better-energy-greater-prosperity\">a recent report</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/10/labour-party-manifesto-pledges-to-end-tuition-fees-and-nationalise-railways\">Labour party's plan to nationalise mail, rail and energy firms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>National Grid spent a record \u00a34.5bn on capital expenditure for its UK and US businesses last year, up from \u00a33.9bn for the previous financial year. Analysts broadly welcomed the company\u2019s \u201csolid\u201d performance and profits on Thursday, which were slightly above expectations. </p> <p>\u201cFor those wanting a reliable income from their investments, National Grid can\u2019t be far from the top of the list,\u201d said George Salmon, equity analyst at investment adviser Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>Separately, investors in two of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies appear to have shrugged off the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/18/tory-general-election-manifesto-key-points-analysis\">Theresa May\u2019s price cap on the energy bills</a>. The share price of British Gas owner Centrica was up by 2% and SSE was up 1% on Thursday after the Tory manifesto included only a woolly promise to protect \u201cmore customers on the poorest-value tariffs\u201d, compared with the 17m households the party had pledged before. </p> <p>The Conservatives also said they would remove the need for planning permission for companies undertaking exploratory shale drilling, and create a new shale regulator to speed up development. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/13/british-public-support-for-fracking-sinks-to-lowest-ever-level\">public opinion mostly against fracking</a>, the local planning system <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/uk-fracking-given-go-ahead-as-lancashire-council-rejection-is-overturned\">has caused long delays for the industry</a>, even after ministers attempted to fast-track the process, so the move would be a significant change.</p> <p>Onshore windfarms, which the Tories campaigned hard against in the 2015 general election, were still considered unacceptable in England, but would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/13/scottish-islands-hold-out-for-government-u-turn-on-windfarm-subsidies\">get support in remote Scottish islands</a>.</p> <p>One notable omission was nuclear power, compared with the 2015 manifesto, which promised a \u201csignificant expansion in new nuclear\u201d. \u201cThe lack of any mention of nuclear energy is telling: it\u2019s clear May doesn\u2019t want to be associated with a beleaguered industry at a time when alternatives like wind and solar are getting ever cheaper,\u201d said Greenpeace UK\u2019s executive director, John Sauven, who was also critical of the support for shale gas.</p> <p>One right-leaning thinktank said the manifesto oversold the benefits of fracking. Sam Hall, a senior researcher for Bright Blue, said: \u201cWhile stringently regulated fracking could meet the UK\u2019s demand for gas for a couple more decades, the Conservatives\u2019 priority should be incentivising cheap renewables, which are attracting the majority of new energy investment worldwide, as part of its modern industrial strategy.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "British consumers are bracing themselves for an expensive and uncertain post-Brexit future, with four out of five fearing price rises on household essentials such as food, drink and clothing, a survey has revealed. Eighty-three percent of Britons admit they are concerned about price hikes in goods and services, while 59% are most worried about the soaring cost of groceries, according to a poll for Mintel\u2019s 27th annual British Lifestyles report. Spiralling holiday costs are a concern for 35%, with 26% fearing higher prices for clothing and shoes. As shoppers have become used to ultra-low food prices following several years of deflation, impending price rises could prove painful for household budgets, the report warns. The slump in the value of sterling following the Brexit vote last June has pushed up the prices of imports, especially of food and clothing. With food prices widely expected to increase in 2017, average spending on grocery shopping looks likely to increase unless shoppers find ways to maintain spending through trading down or reducing waste. Britons have also become less materialistic, the report notes, prioritising spending on leisure activities and experiences over material possessions in what is dubbed \u201cthe experience economy\u201d. Despite political turbulence following the vote to leave the EU, Mintel said consumer spending edged up 3.7% last year to \u00a31.2tn. While growth was seen in nearly all the 17 sectors tracked by Mintel, it was notably lower across all fast-moving consumer goods markets, reflecting supermarket price wars and the impact of discounters Aldi and Lidl. By 2021, it is projected that Britons will spend \u00a31.4tn per annum \u2013 equivalent to 17% growth over the next five years. Beyond concerns over rising prices, Britons are also fretting about \u201cbigger picture\u201d issues. The research (from an online poll of 2,000 people aged 16 and over) was carried out in February before Theresa May called the snap general election. But as many as 81% of UK consumers are concerned about the future health of the NHS, while 68% are worried about the UK economy and 67% are nervous about the state of the environment. In contrast, less than half of all adults (48%) are worried about their ability to pay the bills and less than two in five (37%) are concerned about the burden of personal debt. \u201cOur research underlines particular concern about the rising cost of in-home food, and inflation is undoubtedly going to squeeze household budgets,\u201d said Jack Duckett, the senior consumer lifestyles analyst at Mintel. \u201cHowever, broader consumer confidence is still relatively strong. Despite rising prices, most people still expect their finances to hold up well over the next year. It\u2019s the bigger picture issues that the UK faces, such as the NHS and the economy, that are the main concern, rather than people\u2019s own finances.\u201d Unpicking some notable trends, the report highlights the impact of consumers\u2019 shift towards healthier eating. Fresh fish, nuts, popcorn and \u201cfree-from\u201d foods were all star performers with sales increases in 2016, while sales of pasta, pre-packed bread and processed poultry and meat all slumped. The drive to cut sugar in British diets has led to increased sales of bottled water. Half (48%) of bottled water drinkers admitted concerns over sugar had prompted them to make the switch, triggering sales growth of 9% in 2016 to \u00a32.2bn. Pre-packed bread remains the most troubled segment of the bread and baked goods market, the report noted, with sales in value terms estimated to have fallen by 10% in 2016 to \u00a31.49bn. Declining tea sales are expected to continue \u2013 with traditional teabags losing out to green, fruit and herb varieties \u2013 while a deluge of cheaper, Nespresso-compatible coffee pods have shaken up the sector for consumers wanting to recreate \u201ccoffee shop\u201d versions of their favourite beverage at home. In beauty products and toiletries, 2016 proved challenging for the hair removal market, the report said, as more young women chose to shun shavers. Mintel\u2019s data shows that 83% of women aged 16 to 24 agree there is too much pressure on women to remove or groom body hair, while sales of shaving and hair removal products fell 5% to \u00a3567m. But savvy Britons keen to get away from it all will be putting more legwork into finding a holiday destination this year, with over half (53%) saying Brexit will force them to look for deals and consider cheaper options such as UK staycations.",
