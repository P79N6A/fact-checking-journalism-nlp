      "bodyText": "Boeing announced on Friday it had completed the second test flight of its troubled 787 as it tries to overturn a global grounding of the aircraft. The flight was part of a series to test a new battery system, after problems with lithium-ion batteries in two 787s led to smoke and fire in January. The flight, which began and ended in Everett, Washington, lasted for one hour and 49 minutes and was \"straightforward\" and \"uneventful,\" Boeing said. The company said it would now gather and analyze the data and submit it to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which must give its permission before the planes can carry passengers again. \"We expect to deliver all of the materials to the FAA in the coming days. Once we deliver the materials we stand ready to reply to additional requests and continue in dialog with the FAA to ensure we have met all of their expectations,\" the company said in a statement. Boeing completed the first successful tests of its troubled Dreamliner 787 since the jet was grounded last month. The company had delivered just 50 of the jets when lithium-ion batteries on two of the planes caught fire. The two incidents, one in the US and another in Japan, triggered a global grounding for the Dreamliner. The 787 is the first large passenger jet to make such extensive use of lithium-ion technology. Investigators in Japan and the US are still trying to determine the primary cause of the battery failures and have so far concentrated on the planes' battery system itself. Boeing has not publicly given details of what measures it has taken to fix the issues. It has reportedly encased the battery in a steel box and divided the cells as well as adding a venting tube to dangerous fumes outside the plane.",

    "webTitle": "March jobs report shows slowdown in hiring with only 88,000 jobs added", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The recovery in the US jobs market hit the skids in March with just 88,000 new jobs being created, less than half the figure economists had been expecting. The figure, the first since Washington implemented deep spending cuts, reanimated fears that the still lackluster recovery would suffer a \"spring swoon\". The unemployment rate dipped slightly to 7.6%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced, but the dip from 7.7% came only because 496,000 people stopped looking for work and fell out of the workforce. The surprisingly poor numbers triggered a sell-off on the US stock markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 139 points as the market opened, and closing down over 40 points after two up days. The number was far worse than expected. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast that 200,000 new jobs were created in March \u2013 down from 236,000 jobs added in February. Private companies added only 95,000 jobs. Federal government payroll jobs fell by 14,000 as 12,000 postal workers were laid off. If the trend continues, this would be the third consecutive spring that jobs growth has slowed after good growth through the winter. Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC bank, said it was hard to see anything positive in the report. \"Even wages are flat. It's very disappointing,\" he said. Faucher said tax hikes brought in at the start of the year or business concerns about the the so-called sequester budget cuts may have caused the slowdown. \"It could be a one off. The previous months' figures have been revised up, which is good, but we'll have to wait and see,\" he said. In a statement, Alan Krueger, President Obama's chief economic adviser and chairman of the council of economic advisers, blamed sequestration for the slowdown. \"It is important to bear in mind that the March household and payroll surveys are the first monthly surveys to look at employment since the beginning of sequestration. While the recovery was gaining traction before sequestration took effect, these arbitrary and unnecessary cuts to government services will be a headwind in the months to come, and will cut key investments in the Nation's future competitiveness.\" The data drew fire from Republicans. \"The president's policies continue to make it harder for Americans to find work. Hundreds of thousands fled the workforce last month and unemployment remains far above what the Obama administration promised when it enacted its 'stimulus' spending plan,\" House speaker John Boehner said. He called on president Barack Obama to deliver a balanced budget next week, \"one that includes entitlement reforms that are not conditional on enactment of more tax increases, which will suppress growth instead of encourage it.\" The economy added an average of 187,000 jobs a month from September to February. January's figure was revised up from 119,000 to 148,000, and February's was revised up from 236,000 to 268,000. But the figures follow Thursday's report from the Labor Department, which reported claims for unemployment benefits spiked in the latest week to the highest level in four months. Weekly claims for unemployment benefits have risen for three weeks, the department also cautioned the Easter holidays could have skewed figures. The rise come a month into the government spending cuts agreed to as a compromise over the US budget crisis. The so-called sequestration cuts began on March 1 and affect all areas of government spending from the military to park services. On Wednesday, ADP, the payrolls giant, released its latest survey of private sector employment. According to ADP, the US added 158,000 new jobs in March, below the 200,000 economists had been expecting. Gains were largely in the service sector. Construction, which was hit hard in the recession, added no net jobs over the month following average monthly gains of 29,000 in the three months prior. Commenting on the ADP figures, Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, which helps compile the report, said: \"Job growth moderated in March. Construction employment gains paused as the rebuilding surge in the wake of Superstorm Sandy ended. Anticipation of healthcare reform may also be weighing on employment at companies with close to 50 employees. The job market continues to improve, but in fits and starts.\" The latest jobs news is unlikely to solve the dilemma facing the Federal Reserve. Chairman Ben Bernanke has been pumping $85bn a month into the US economy with the aim of keeping interest rates at rock bottom and encouraging investment in jobs making ventures. But the policy has split the Fed's board of governors with some increasingly vocal in their concern about the long term impact of open-ended bond buying program \u2013 known as quantitative easing. Long-time critic Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said Thursday that the Fed should scale back immediately. \"To be clear, I support an accommodative stance of monetary policy while the economy recovers and unemployment remains high. But I view the current policies as overly accommodative, causing distortions and posing risks to financial stability and long-term inflation expectations, with the potential to compromise future growth. \"As the Fed's balance sheet continues to expand, the risks and costs increase in my view,\" she said in a speech in Oklahoma.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The sale of T-shirts and other artist memorabilia are expected to be at the heart of an optimistic \"we are entertainment\" revival plan for HMV, which was rescued by a turnaround firm in a \u00a350m deal that has secured about 2,500 jobs at 141 of the retailer's stores. Hilco, the new owner, plans to concentrate on selling music and film and step away from selling consumer electronics. Music labels and film studios, keen to ensure that a major entertainment retailer remains on the high street, are understood to have agreed to support HMV with new supply terms. The turnaround firm rescued HMV's Canadian business in 2011 and boosted sales and profits by abandoning diversification into computer games and iPod docks in favour of more lucrative band-branded clothing and coffee mugs branded with the names of artists. HMV was founded in 1921, with its first store on London's Oxford Street opened by composer Edward Elgar, but it went into administration in January amid tough competition from supermarkets and online stores such as Amazon. It has also suffered as shoppers switch to digital downloads of music, films and computer games and use online services such as Spotify and Netflix, rather than browsing for CDs and DVDs on the high street. Paul McGowan, chief executive of Hilco and the new chairman of HMV, said: \"We hope to replicate some of the success we have had in the Canadian market with the HMV Canada business which we acquired almost two years ago and which is now trading strongly.\" Hilco's success there meant it had been widely expected to snap up the UK chain since it paid a reported \u00a340m for HMV's \u00a3176m of debt in January, effectively giving it control over the retailer's future. However, refocusing on music is not without risk. Britons are switching to digital downloads much more quickly than Canadians with nearly 30% of music downloaded last year compared with about 20% in 2010, according to figures from retail analysts Conlumino. By 2015, about 45% of music is expected to be downloaded. Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino, said: \"In the short to medium term, there is an opportunity to make HMV profitable. The worry is that, over the long term, HMV is still a retailer without a proper purpose as every year more and more sales migrate online.\" Music lovers and film fans are not only switching to downloads, but buying more CDs and DVDs from internet stores. Last year, 73.6% of all music and film, including downloads and physical products, such as CDs, was bought online and that is expected to rise to 90% by 2015, according to Conlumino. Hilco, led by McGowan and his business partner Andrew Pepper, has made millions from snapping up ailing retail and consumer businesses in the UK since it was set up in 2000. McGowan, Pepper and Hilco's US parent company shared a \u00a39.7m payout in 2011, on top of \u00a322m the year before. About 80 HMV stores will remain closed but the rescue saves nine branches of the Fopp music chain, including stores in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and 25 HMV stores which had previously been slated for closure. Hilco is also in negotiations with landlords in Ireland in a bid to re-open stores which were closed several months ago after HMV collapsed into administration. HMV relaunched its website on Friday with the strapline \"We are entertainment\", although it was not yet open for trading. Hilco previously rejigged the Habitat household furnishings chain before selling it on to Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. But not all Hilco's rescue attempts have been a success. The company bought the books and entertainment chain Borders in 2009, only to close all its branches and put it into administration four months later.",

Britons are switching to digital downloads much more quickly than Canadians with nearly 30% of music downloaded last year compared with about 20% in 2010, according to figures from retail analysts Conlumino. By 2015, about 45% of music is expected to be downloaded.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino, said: \"In the short to medium term, there is an opportunity to make HMV profitable. The worry is that, over the long term, HMV is still a retailer without a proper purpose as every year more and more sales migrate online.\"</p> <p>Music lovers and film fans are not only switching to downloads, but buying more CDs and DVDs from internet stores. Last year, 73.6% of all music and film, including downloads and physical products, such as CDs, was bought online and that is expected to rise to 90% by 2015, according to Conlumino.</p> <p>Hilco, led by McGowan and his business partner Andrew Pepper, has made millions from snapping up ailing retail and consumer businesses in the UK since it was set up in 2000. McGowan, Pepper and Hilco's US parent company shared a \u00a39.7m payout in 2011, on top of \u00a322m the year before.</p> <p>About 80 HMV stores will remain closed but the rescue saves nine branches of the Fopp music chain, including stores in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and 25 HMV stores which had previously been slated for closure. Hilco is also in negotiations with landlords in Ireland in a bid to re-open stores which were closed several months ago after HMV collapsed into administration.</p> <p>HMV relaunched its website on Friday with the strapline \"We are entertainment\", although it was not yet open for trading.</p> <p>Hilco previously rejigged the Habitat household furnishings chain before selling it on to Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. But not all Hilco's rescue attempts have been a success. The company bought the books and entertainment chain Borders in 2009, only to close all its branches and put it into administration four months later.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the forfeiture committee last year stripped Fred Goodwin of his knighthood for services to banking, politicians lined up to describe the de-gonging as a one-off. George Osborne said there was \"a special case here of the Royal Bank of Scotland symbolising everything that went wrong in the British economy over the last decade\". The forfeiture committee itself spoke of \"an exceptional case\" when it decided Goodwin's knighthood brought the honours system into disrepute. The \"one-off\" argument seemed ridiculous even at the time. It was plain to most observers that HBOS ran RBS a close second in any ranking of \"everything that went wrong\". It was just that no official report had yet said so. But it suited David Cameron and Osborne to paint Goodwin as uniquely incompetent as the government was in the middle of the annual row over bonuses at RBS; a headline-grabbing diversion was politically useful in January 2012. But now the parliamentary commission on banking standards has laid out the horrible truth about HBOS. Like RBS, HBOS over-reached itself via incompetence and the chief architects were the main players in the boardroom, including former chief executive Sir James Crosby. And in both cases, the state was landed with a big bill for a bail-out. What's the difference between the Goodwin and Crosby cases? There isn't one. If the forfeiture committee deals in logic, Crosby's knighthood for services to the financial services industry will also have to be removed. Of course, it might be polite to wait until regulators have published their own full report on HBOS, but that's a technicality if the Financial Services Authority's successor reaches the same damning conclusions as the parliamentary commission. Yet the whole knighthood-awarding and knighthood-stripping lark stinks of hypocrisy on the part of politicians. Ed Miliband joined the cheering when Goodwin was humbled but didn't explain why the last Labour government got so close to the errant bankers it now denounces. Equally, the current government was happy to see Hector Sants, former chief executive of the FSA, ennobled in this New Year's Honours list. Sants was promoted to lead the regulator in July 2007, in time to block RBS's disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro if he had been so minded. And Sants was very definitely the captain of the FSA when HBOS had its foot to the floor on lending in 2008 \u2013 even the FSA's own mini-report was clear about how long the turbo-charged expansion lasted. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the parliamentary commission, opted out of the debate over Crosby's gong by saying: \"I don't think the public are so concerned about knighthoods; what they want is reassurance that they won't get hit by this again.\" Maybe he's right. It's probably true that most people regard as grotesque the game of handing out knighthoods and peerages to well paid bankers and business leaders whose careers are not yet over. It is a formula for mutual back-scratching and the trading of favours. Yes, Crosby's knighthood should follow Goodwin's into the bin for the sake of consistency. But it would be better still to declare that no banker or business leader should receive an award until his or her career can be judged properly. A five-year cooling-off period would save a lot of fuss \u2013 and make politicians' dealings with business people, bankers and regulators modestly healthier. A few years ago earning \u00a35m in a year would have gained a FTSE 100 chief executive a high spot in a league table of big-company bosses' pay. These days it has become almost a par score at a business that is trotting along nicely. The latest recipient of \u00a35m is David Nish of Standard Life. The savings and investment group is indeed performing well. Profits rose strongly last year and shareholders will soon have a special dividend. Eat your heart out, Aviva. And the Edinburgh-based group can argue, correctly, that Nish's dish is mostly the function of a pay-for-peformance plan that was signed off by shareholders three years ago when the share price was much lower than it is today. Everything tickety-boo then? No. Performance-related pay was never meant to mean the sky's the limit. As the Association of British Insurers (prominent member: Standard Life) always points out, the quantum of pay also matters. Is \u00a35m now deemed unremarkable in a good year for the boss of the 47th largest quoted UK company? If so, it would be good if the ABI could tell us when it adopted this yardstick. Maybe Keith Skeoch, head of Standard Life Investments, the fund management division that has traditionally been robust on pay excesses (or rather, more robust than many rivals), could tell us himself. And will he find it harder to preach now that he is in the happy position of having collected \u00a37m himself over the course of a couple of years? \"Standard Life Investments' approach to executive remuneration is consistent with Standard Life's corporate goals which are aligned to the interests of our shareholders,\" says the predictable corporate statement. OK, but \"alignment\" is a slippery concept. Would \u00a310m-a-year for the boss of a successful mid-ranking FTSE 100 company also qualify as aligned? How about \u00a320m? More details please because this spring's crop of annual reports tell the unmistakable tale of sharp inflation in boardroom pay. Share prices are up (except this week), but boardroom pay looks as if it is running much, much faster. Here's a rarity: a Brit joining the supervisory board of a large German company. She is Dame Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who was Tesco's long-serving corporate and legal affairs director until the end of last year. She is joining Metro, the big and international German retailer, and you can understand why the Germans would want her. Metro shares are on the slide, the dividend was cut last month and the group is regarded as too unwieldly with 2,200 stores. The inside-track on some old-style Tesco magic, notwithstanding recent hiccups, could be useful. Hold on though, aren't Tesco and Metro direct rivals in many countries? Yes, in eastern Europe and China among others. It's not quite the same as an ex-Tesco loyalist becoming a non-executive director at Sainsbury's \u2013 but intriguing all the same.",

The criticism by the UK's fourth largest supermarket comes after the advertising standards watchdog launched a probe into the Tesco 'price promise' last month, following a complaint from Sainsbury's. \"We have launched a formal investigation into this,\" a spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Authority said. \"We have raised this with Tesco and invited them to defend their advert.\" If the ASA finds the complaint against Tesco is sound, it can order the retail giant to pull the advert. Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, has pledged to give customers a refund up to \u00a310 if a price comparison check shows they could have bought their groceries cheaper at rivals Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Morrisons said on Friday it was also \"considering\" making a formal complaint to the ASA and accused its rival of \"misleading\" customers. According to Morrisons, Tesco's flawed methodology meant that five Morrisons products were left out of the price promise calculation; when included, a basket of Morrisons groceries was cheaper. \"We are complaining because Tesco's price promise provides a false assurance that it will compensate customers when Morrisons is cheaper, which it mostly is,\" said Crawford Davidson, customer director at Morrisons. Sainsbury's has argued that comparisons with its own-brand products are inaccurate. \"We don't think you can compare the strength of our own brand label with the cut price versions at Tesco and Asda,\" Sainsbury's boss Justin King said last month. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"We use an independent agency to check prices of branded and own label products at other retailers \u2013 online daily for Asda and Sainsbury's, and since they don't have an online grocery service, twice a week at Morrisons stores. The basis for our comparisons is made clear on the price promise website.\" The spat underscores the fierce competition between the UK supermarkets as they battle it out for market share. Tesco, badly damaged by the horsemeat scandal, has seen its market share fall to less than 30%, its lowest level in eight years, according to Kantar research. Sainsbury's and Morrisons, both untouched by the scandal, have seen rising sales.",

New car registrations in March - a proxy for sales - rose by 5.9% to 395,000 registrations. It is the 13th consecutive month of sales growth. Because UK car factories export more than eight out of ten cars that they make, there is not a direct read across for manufacturing, but it is widely believed that a strong domestic market is important for sustaining a production base.</p> <p>Mike Baunton, interim chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite ongoing economic concerns, consistent monthly growth in the market is an encouraging sign of returning consumer confidence as motorists are attracted to forecourts by new models and the latest technologies.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-05T10:28:40.806Z\">at 11.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-515e9e7a95cbd0ecba5ec071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-05T09:50:50.712Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">BoJ market reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for the US jobs figures, Brenda Kelly, Market Analyst, at IG, gives some commentary on today's events.</p> <p>She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While Japan\u2019s Nikkei surged to its highest closing level in over four years, the upbeat mood has not made the journey west.</p> <p>In early morning trade there is little appetite for risk-taking, with the FTSE 100 down 26 points, though it is succeeding in holding the 6300 level.

      "bodyText": "Just a quick look at the Dow before we sign the blog off for the week - it's off around 100 points at 14500. See you next week ... Time for a quick closing European market roundup on the worst day for continental shares this year: Ibex (-0.73%), Dax (-1.99%), Cac (-1.6%). Italy's MIB is up, however. The FTSE 100 has closed down nearly 1.5% at 6249.78 (still settling). The DJIA and the FTSE 100 have come off their lows - Dow is just under 14500 and the FTSE is at 6241. The FTSE is off more than 2% now, at 6214, down 129 points. Yields on Spanish sovereign debt - about 4.83% - and Italian sovereign debt - 4.45% - are attracting chatter in the wake of the US jobs data, as well as the Bank of Japan spending spree, which has sent investors scurrying to European assets. Mr Bergen is saying that Bernanke is very unlikely to turn off QE now, so S&amp;P stocks represent a decent buy opportunity. Here is the first take from Dominic Rushe, our man in New York. Worth noting that the expectation was for 200,000 extra jobs. No wonder the Dow and S&amp;P are feeling a bit rum today. Brent crude has hit a five-month low off the back of the US jobs data, nearing $105 per barrel and dimming the global economic outlook. The DOW is down 1% and the S&amp;P 500 is down 1% in early trading on the jobs data. Marcus Bullus, trading director at MB Capital in London, says: The US economy just hit a major speed bump. Economists are also debating whether Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve, will pull back on the Fed's quantitative easing programme. Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services in Michigan, says: The recent discussions about the Fed backing off from its quantitative easing has been premature. That dread phrase among Japanese manufacturers, ch\u014d endaka or \"super-strong yen\", is back after the dollar fell sharply against the euro and the yen in the wake of the worse-than-expected US jobs numbers. The dollar fell 0.3% to 96.03 yen while the euro hit session highs against the dollar at $1.3026. Much of the reaction relates to the participation rate: too many people dropping out of the workforce, say commentators. US non0farm payrolls are out and they have rattled investors, hitting European shares. American employers hired at their slowest pace in nine months in March, adding just 88,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell a tenth of a percentage point to 7.6%, but this was largely due to people dropping out of the workforce. The former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has demanded that Italy returns to the polls - something investors might not like - unless the centre left agrees to govern with him. The inconclusive February election has left Italy in political gridlock with no bloc receiving enough votes to govern. In a tweet today Berlusconi said \"it's crucial to form a strong and stable government immediately.\" He added that if the centre left Democratic party rejects his call for a coalition \"we must return to the polls\". The FTSEurofirst 300 index hit a one-month low this morning of 1,176 points amid fears that US non-farm payrolls will disappoint. The FTSE is off too, down 1.35% at 6258. Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said: We have seen some moderation in the pace of growth in the United States. The fundamentals are not as supportive as they were this time last year. However, he adds: But the US Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programme isn't going away and hence it's difficult to see, despite my caution on the fundamentals, the market coming off sharply in the near term. Even depositors in the eurozone's largest economy are concerned that the Cyprus bailout, and ensuing haircut on savers, could happen to them. The kind of geo-political development that can take priority over analysing Kuroda's nice charts. Further good macroeconomic news for the UK, albeit of the more modest variety. The monthly housing market survey by Halifax, the mortgage lender, has show that prices rose for the fourth quarter in a row at the beginning of the year. Halifax warned, though, of \"significant constraints\" on housing demand such as weak income growth. The average house price is nearly \u00a3164,000, but still some distance below the peak of \u00a3199,612 recorded in August 2007. That feels like a long time, and a lot of crisis blogs, ago now. Hello Dan Milmo here taking over from Simon Neville for a while. Just a bit of UK macroeconomic news that bodes well for one our most successful manufacturing/retail industries. New car registrations in March - a proxy for sales - rose by 5.9% to 395,000 registrations. It is the 13th consecutive month of sales growth. Because UK car factories export more than eight out of ten cars that they make, there is not a direct read across for manufacturing, but it is widely believed that a strong domestic market is important for sustaining a production base. Mike Baunton, interim chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: Despite ongoing economic concerns, consistent monthly growth in the market is an encouraging sign of returning consumer confidence as motorists are attracted to forecourts by new models and the latest technologies. While we wait for the US jobs figures, Brenda Kelly, Market Analyst, at IG, gives some commentary on today's events. She said: While Japan\u2019s Nikkei surged to its highest closing level in over four years, the upbeat mood has not made the journey west. In early morning trade there is little appetite for risk-taking, with the FTSE 100 down 26 points, though it is succeeding in holding the 6300 level. While equity markets blazed a trail in the last quarter, investors have digested the slew of central bank action and inaction from yesterday and are sticking to the cautious path ahead of the US payrolls number. Initial non-farm payrolls expectations of 200,000-210,000 have been pared back after both the ADP employment report and jobless claims failed to meet forecasts. A good number may serve to temporarily calm the market against recent poor data, but given that the market has a proven addiction to monetary easing one could expect markets to rally if the data prints is a significant miss. Other reaction on Twitter to Japan was pretty succinct Eurozone retail sales for February have just been announced. They show sales volume down 0.3% month-on-month and down 1.4% compared with a year earlier. January's retail data was also revised down from a rise of 1.2% to just 0.9% month-on-month. Trade in French shops was particularly hit, dropping 2.2% between January and February, while sales in Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland also fell. The worst hit year-on-year were Spain, down 9.7% and Portugal down 5.3%. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight has given some reaction to ECB board member, Benoit Coeure's comments earlier that inflation will be carefully monitored. He said: We suspect that likely ongoing disappointing Eurozone economic news and further evidence of muted inflation will continue to push the ECB towards cutting interest rates, and likely sooner rather than later. We expect a cut from 0.75% to 0.50% in the second quarter, and consider a move as soon as May as highly possible. Not only does further Eurozone GDP contraction now seem highly probable in the first quarter, but prospects for the second quarter are looking increasingly worrying. With Eurozone consumer price inflation down at a 31-month low of 1.7% in March, wage growth generally weak and most inflationary measures currently muted, the ECB has ample scope to cut interest rates. The latest minutes from the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee meeting has been published. It said: Banks should continue to exercise restraint on distributions and compensation. In other words - stop paying such huge bonuses. Last week the committee said banks needed an extra \u00a325bn of capital by the end of the year to absorb any future losses. The Committee agreed that a line needed to be drawn under doubts about UK banks' capital adequacy. Meanwhile, over in Paris, ECB board member, Benoit Coeure reiterated his boss Mario Draghi's message from yesterday that it would do what it can to keep to inflation targets. Eurozone inflation fell for the third month in a row in March to 1.7%, compared with the ECB's 2% target. Coeure said: We have a rate of inflation which looks set to move away from the ECB's 2% target over the next 18 months. It is still fairly close to the 2% target but it is moving below that goal and this is something the board of governors is clearly following as we have a goal of 2%. Monetary policy cannot be the main tool used to try and resolve difficulties with credit flows. Monetary policy can contribute but it cannot completely resolve these problems. Well, bond yields might be falling everywhere else, but in the UK, the money flowing out of Japan isn't coming here. Bond yields across Europe are falling on the back of the Japanese stimulus. French 10-year bond yields fell to a record low, hitting 1.81%, down 7 basis points to the lowest level on record. German, Italian, Spanish, Austrian, Dutch and Belgian bonds were all down, as investors turned their attentions to Europe with Japan's bond yield sinking in response to the BoJ's announcement. One trader told Reuters: The view seems to be that the Bank of Japan moves will force money out of Japan and into other markets, and semi-core has always been one of the (Asian) favourites. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, complete with an old-school printed chart, gave a press conference in the early hours on day two of the announcement to pump an unprecedented $1.4tn into the economy. He said: We will be vigilant of the risk of a bubble. I don't think there's a bond or stock market bubble now and I don't see one emerging any time soon. But we will be vigilant of the risk. But the market soon reacted, with yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds following to record lows early in the morning, before rebounding sharply. The 10-year yield climbed 18 basis points to 0.615 percent in the afternoon session after dropping as much as 12 basis points in the morning to a record low of 0.315 percent. Ten-year JGB futures dropped 2.49 points to 143.55 on the day to a near two-month low. They hit a record high of 146.41 in morning trade. Christian B\u00f6rjesson, chief analyst at Nordea Research Strategy tweeted this helpful graph Good morning and welcome to another day of the eurozone crisis live blog, keeping you up to date on the key political and economic events to effect Europe and elsewhere. Overnight, more news from Tokyo, where Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda played down concerns of an asset-price bubble as a result of yesterday's announcement of plans to pump $1.4tn into the economy over the next two years. However, this was a tricky sell, with government bond yields at a record low, the yen hitting a three-and-a-half year trough and the Nikkei soaring to a five-year high. Elsewhere, over in the US, President Obama is expected to offer cuts to welfare programmes in return for Republican support on the budget, creating a compromise on a deficit reduction deal. We will bring you any market reaction to the news. Today, all eyes will remain on the US where the latest non-farm employment numbers will come out at 1.30pm as an indicator of further recovery.

      "standfirst": "London's last remaining traditional brewery to be run by someone from outside group's founding families for first time", 
      "body": "<p>Fuller's, London's last remaining traditional brewery, is to be run by a chief executive from outside the group's three founding families for the first time in its 168-year history.</p> <p>Michael Turner, who has been working in the business since 1978 \u2013 becoming chief executive in 2002 and executive chairman five years later \u2013 is to relinquish control of the day-to-day running of the business, moving to the part-time role of non-executive chairman. He will pass the dray-horse reins to his long-time protege Simon Emeny in July.</p> <p>Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner is listed on the stock market but about 50% of its shares and 75% of its voting rights still rest with descendants of Victorian brewing barons John Fuller, Henry Smith and John Turner.</p> <p>Like many regional brewers, it has come under pressure from outside investors to sell off its huge property assets but has always resisted such moves. In 2006 Fullers' close rival, Young's, sold its Ram Brewery site in Wandsworth, south London, after years of agitation from activist investor Guinness Peat. It has now outsourced beer production and is focused on running pubs and hotels.</p> <p>In response to Young's move out of Wandsworth, Fuller's declared itself \u2013 microbrewers aside \u2013 London's last remaining brewer, headquartered at the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, west London. It too saw Guinness Peat build a stake in its shares in 2010, though the family stood resolutely against quick gains from property selloffs.

      "bodyText": "Fuller's, London's last remaining traditional brewery, is to be run by a chief executive from outside the group's three founding families for the first time in its 168-year history. Michael Turner, who has been working in the business since 1978 \u2013 becoming chief executive in 2002 and executive chairman five years later \u2013 is to relinquish control of the day-to-day running of the business, moving to the part-time role of non-executive chairman. He will pass the dray-horse reins to his long-time protege Simon Emeny in July. Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner is listed on the stock market but about 50% of its shares and 75% of its voting rights still rest with descendants of Victorian brewing barons John Fuller, Henry Smith and John Turner. Like many regional brewers, it has come under pressure from outside investors to sell off its huge property assets but has always resisted such moves. In 2006 Fullers' close rival, Young's, sold its Ram Brewery site in Wandsworth, south London, after years of agitation from activist investor Guinness Peat. It has now outsourced beer production and is focused on running pubs and hotels. In response to Young's move out of Wandsworth, Fuller's declared itself \u2013 microbrewers aside \u2013 London's last remaining brewer, headquartered at the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, west London. It too saw Guinness Peat build a stake in its shares in 2010, though the family stood resolutely against quick gains from property selloffs. The activist group has since sold down its interest. Michael Turner said the promotion of a non-family member to chief executive of Fuller's, which includes more than 380 pubs, was a landmark moment, but did not reflect a change of mood among family shareholders. \"I just think it is high time we had someone else driving the show. And it will coincide with me being 62.\" In addition to Turner, two other founding family members \u2013 Richard Fuller and Sir James Fuller \u2013 will continue to sit on the brewer's 10-strong board.

      "body": "<h2>Sir James Crosby</h2> <p><strong>How did he get to HBOS?</strong></p> <p>A qualified actuary, James Crosby was said to have a detailed grasp of financial risk. At 38, he joined Halifax in its life insurance business and within five years he was running the newly demutualised \u2013 and acquisition-hungry \u2013 mortgage bank.</p> <p>No sooner had he taken the helm than Crosby began plotting a deal that would again transform the business, a bold merger with Bank of Scotland in 2001. He set the group on a fierce expansionary course. Rapid lending to big corporate clients, particularly in property and retailing, was seen as a triumph, and when he departed as chief executive in 2006, Crosby's reputation was unrivalled. He received a knighthood for services to the financial industry, and joined the boards of ITV and catering group Compass.</p> <p>Ministers and regulators also sought his counsel. Alistair Darling asked him to write a report into the UK mortgage finance market. He also sat on the board of the City regulator, the FSA, from 2004, and a year after his departure from HBOS Darling appointed him FSA deputy chairman.</p> <p><strong>What does the report say about him?</strong></p> <p>The commission's report describes him as \"the architect\" of the strategy that caused the downfall of HBOS.</p> <p><strong>What is he doing now?</strong></p> <p>Crosby hung on as deputy chairman of the FSA throughout the 2008 banking crisis and the demise of HBOS. It was not until damaging accusations about him from the bank's former head of regulatory risk Paul Moore were aired in parliament in February 2009 that he stepped down. Crosby insisted there was \"no merit\" in claims that he fired Moore after the risk expert warned of dangerous lending practices at the bank.</p> <p>Crosby left ITV later that year, amid widespread criticism of the board. However, he remains on the board at Compass.</p> <p>In January 2009, Crosby was appointed a director of FTSE 250 banking software group Misys, becoming chairman eight months later. Last summer, after a fierce bidding war, he agreed to sell Misys to a US private equity house for \u00a31.27bn. He also remains on the advisory board of Bridgepoint, the private equity group behind Pret a Manger and Fat Face.</p> <p>Two years ago he became chairman of sub-prime car loans group Moneybarn, where he is also a shareholder.</p> <p><strong>What does he say?</strong></p> <p>Crosby offered no comment.

      "bodyText": "Sir James Crosby How did he get to HBOS? A qualified actuary, James Crosby was said to have a detailed grasp of financial risk. At 38, he joined Halifax in its life insurance business and within five years he was running the newly demutualised \u2013 and acquisition-hungry \u2013 mortgage bank. No sooner had he taken the helm than Crosby began plotting a deal that would again transform the business, a bold merger with Bank of Scotland in 2001. He set the group on a fierce expansionary course. Rapid lending to big corporate clients, particularly in property and retailing, was seen as a triumph, and when he departed as chief executive in 2006, Crosby's reputation was unrivalled. He received a knighthood for services to the financial industry, and joined the boards of ITV and catering group Compass. Ministers and regulators also sought his counsel. Alistair Darling asked him to write a report into the UK mortgage finance market. He also sat on the board of the City regulator, the FSA, from 2004, and a year after his departure from HBOS Darling appointed him FSA deputy chairman. What does the report say about him? The commission's report describes him as \"the architect\" of the strategy that caused the downfall of HBOS. What is he doing now? Crosby hung on as deputy chairman of the FSA throughout the 2008 banking crisis and the demise of HBOS. It was not until damaging accusations about him from the bank's former head of regulatory risk Paul Moore were aired in parliament in February 2009 that he stepped down. Crosby insisted there was \"no merit\" in claims that he fired Moore after the risk expert warned of dangerous lending practices at the bank. Crosby left ITV later that year, amid widespread criticism of the board. However, he remains on the board at Compass. In January 2009, Crosby was appointed a director of FTSE 250 banking software group Misys, becoming chairman eight months later. Last summer, after a fierce bidding war, he agreed to sell Misys to a US private equity house for \u00a31.27bn. He also remains on the advisory board of Bridgepoint, the private equity group behind Pret a Manger and Fat Face. Two years ago he became chairman of sub-prime car loans group Moneybarn, where he is also a shareholder. What does he say? Crosby offered no comment. It took him until December to apologise for his role at HBOS. He told the banking commission: \"I am apologising. I played a major part in building a business that subsequently failed.\" Andy Hornby How did he get to HBOS? A stellar student at Oxford, Hornby and went on to graduate was top of his 800-strong class at Harvard.

Records at Companies House show Stevenson remains a director of a number of charities including the foundation behind the Tate art galleries and the Institute for Government, which provides advice \"to improve government effectiveness\". What does he say? Stevenson did not comment. In December, he told parliament's banking commission that he \"felt awful\" that the board had failed to foresee problems in the bank funding markets on which the bank relied.

    "webTitle": "HBOS: Regulator's findings shame three executives who brought down a bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The three executives who ran HBOS bank in the runup to its near-catastrophic collapse have been slated for their \"colossal failure\" of management in a scathing report which calls for them to be held to account by the City regulator. The highly critical account of the events that led to HBOS being rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 said the responsibility for the management failings rested with the former chairman Lord Stevenson, and the former chief executives Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby, and says the bank would have gone bust even if the global financial meltdown of that year had not happened. The bank, formed out of Bank of Scotland and Halifax in 2001, racked up \u00a347bn of losses on bad loans. In a report entitled An Accident Waiting to Happen, the parliamentary commission on banking standards calls on the trio to apologise for their \"toxic\" mistakes which caused the downfall of the bank and prompted a \u00a320bn taxpayer bailout. The HBOS report comes in another torrid week for the banking industry after a report commissioned by Barclays found its bankers \"seemed to lose a sense of proportion and humility\" in their race for big bonuses. The regulation of HBOS by the Financial Services Authority \u2013 which was shut down last weekend \u2013 is described as \"thoroughly inadequate\", but the responsibility for the management failures is placed squarely on the three men. The report by the commission, set up in the wake of the Libor scandal, said: \"The primary responsibility for the downfall of HBOS should rest with Sir James Crosby, architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster, with Andy Hornby, who proved unable or unwilling to change course, and Lord Stevenson, who presided over the bank's board from its birth to its death.\" Crosby sold two-thirds of his shares just before the banking crisis hit and the bottom fell out of share prices. Unlike former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin, Crosby has retained his knighthood and his \u00a3570,000 annual pension. Under pressure from parliament Goodwin's pension was halved to \u00a3340,000. The commission expressed \"profound regret\" that in the aftermath of the banking crisis the FSA had not imposed \"fitting sanctions for those most responsible in a manner which might serve as a suitable deterrent for the next crisis\". Only one HBOS executive, Peter Cummings, who used to run the corporate division of the bank, has faced sanctions. He has been banned from the City and fined \u00a3500,000. In the first detailed account of what went wrong at HBOS \u2013 valued at \u00a330bn when it was created in 2001 \u2013 the commission concludes that the bad loans alone would have pushed HBOS into bankruptcy. That view contrasts with those who used to run the bank, who blamed the seizure in the financial markets for its downfall. \"The sums would never have added up,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the commission. While the bankers have apologised for failing to spot the crisis, their words \"ring hollow\" and \"an apology is due for the incompetent and reckless board strategy\", the report said. The commission's report calls for City regulators to conduct a review of whether the three former bankers are \"fit and proper\" to ever work in the City again. Another report into HBOS by the successor bodies to the FSA is still under way and Tyrie asked them to consider whether the three should be barred from working in finance in the future. \"Those responsible for bank failures should be held more directly accountable for their actions and face sanction,\" he added. Crosby is now an adviser to Bridgepoint, a private equity business, but that role does not require authorisation. The commission published its report after taking evidence from 16 former HBOS bankers and those who regulated the bank. Stevenson, a crossbench peer who has been employed by governments to conduct a series of high-profile reports, now works for a number of charities. Hornby, who took over as chief executive from Crosby and was regarded as the business wunderkind of his generation, is now boss of bookmakers Coral. The report is scathing about Stevenson, who in his evidence had insisted he was not to blame because he was only \"part time\", despite earning \u00a3735,000 a year and insisting to regulators at the time that he was fully engaged at the bank. Stevenson was \"incapable of facing the realities of what placed the bank in jeopardy from that time until now\". The report added: \"We are shocked and surprised that, even after the ship has run aground, so many of those who were on the bridge still seem so keen to congratulate themselves on their collective navigational skills.\" In other evidence, HBOS board members had described the board as the best they had ever sat on, which sparked the commission to conclude: \"The model of corporate governance at HBOS at board level serves as a model for the future but not in the way in which Lord Stevenson and other former board members appear to see it. It represents a model of self-delusion, or the triumph of process over purpose.\" The three bankers declined to comment, while the Financial Conduct Authority, one of the bodies replacing the FSA, said it was considering the report's findings. \"The FCA will be publishing its report on the failure, that was started under the FSA, at a later date,\" the FCA said. A year ago the FSA decided not to hit the Bank of Scotland arm of Lloyds with a \"very substantial\" fine because it would have been picked up by the taxpayer, but lambasted the division for \"very serious misconduct\" in following an aggressive, high-risk growth strategy.",

While this was the \"immediate cause\" of the collapse of HBOS, it was not the \"fundamental issue\" the report found. Instead, it concluded that if the problems at the bank had only been ones of liquidity, it would not have needed a combined capital injection of \u00a328bn from the taxpayer and Lloyds to keep it afloat and \"there would have been no losses to the UK taxpayer\". Instead, the report says, the key problem was vast, and reckless, lending to UK and overseas companies.</p> <p>Lord Turnbull, the member of the commission who led the HBOS investigation, said: \"This is a story of a retail and commercial bank, rather than an investment bank, brought down by ill-judged lending, poor risk control and inadequate liquidity. Its strategy was flawed from the start.\"</p> <p>Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone Warehouse and former non-executive director of HBOS, had pointed out in his evidence that under the Vickers ring-fencing proposals intended to shield retail banks from riskier investment banking operations, nearly all of HBOS would have been inside the fence.</p> <p>In 2001, the bank's chief executive, Sir James Crosby, set ambitious targets for returns to shareholders. He planned to ramp up lending in an attempt to challenge the \"big four\" banks. But HBOS had a risk department \u2013 meant to be on alert for bad lending decisions \u2013 that could not keep up with the pace of growth, and a management structure that left decisions about lending to division heads.</p> <p>The damning report begins with a warning by a former finance director of HBOS telling the board in January 2004 that the Financial Services Authority felt that the rapid growth being pursued \"may have given rise to an accident waiting to happen\".</p> <p>But it notes that the FSA \u2013 disbanded by the government last weekend \u2013 failed to act on its own concerns. \"The picture that emerges is that the FSA's regulation of HBOS was thoroughly inadequate,\" the report said.</p> <p>\"From 2004 until the later part of 2007, the FSA was not so much the dog that did not bark as a dog barking up the wrong tree,\" the report said, as the regulator moved its focus from prudential risks to a new regulatory system that let banks mark their own homework \u2013 using their own models to measure risks \u2013 and implement new rules on treating customers fairly.</p> <p>\"The experience of the regulation of HBOS demonstrates the fundamental weakness in the regulatory approach prior to the financial crisis and as that crisis unfolded. Too much supervision was undertaken at a too low a level \u2013 without sufficient engagement of the senior leadership within the FSA.\"</p> <p>While the FSA missed opportunities to prevent HBOS from \"pursuing the path that led to its own downfall \u2026 Ultimate responsibility for the bank's chosen path lies, however, not with the regulator but with the board itself.\"</p> <p>The commission estimated that \u00a347bn of losses was incurred \u2013 \u00a325bn in the corporate division, \u00a315bn in Australia and Ireland, and \u00a37bn in the bank's own HQ in its Treasury operations. The report says that those losses on their own would have been enough to bring the bank down. \"Both the relative scale of such large losses and the fact that they were incurred in three separate divisions suggests a systemic management failure across the organisation. Together they would have led to insolvency,\" the report said.</p> <p>To illustrate the scale of the risks being taken on, the report said that in the corporate bank in 2001 the biggest exposure to one single borrower was less than \u00a31m. By 2008 there were nine customers who had each been lent \u00a31bn. One borrower had been advanced \u00a33bn.</p> <p>\"The roots of all these mistakes can be traced to a culture of perilously high risk lending. The picture that emerges is of a corporate bank that found it hard to say 'no',\" the report said.</p> <p>The commissioners said they were \"extremely disappointed\" that HBOS management had tried to blame the closure of wholesale markets rather than the risky lending. In early 2008, the chairman, Lord Stevenson, had argued that the bank was a \"highly conservative institution\". But the report said: \"Far from being a highly conservative institution in a safe harbour, HBOS was in a storm-tossed sea.\"</p> <p>In the days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, some \u00a335bn was withdrawn from customer deposits at HBOS. The bank was rescued by Lloyds three days after the Lehman crash. Eventually \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds was used to prop up the enlarged bank while Lloyds used another \u00a38bn to shore up the troubled loan book.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said: \"The failure of HBOS was a symptom of the financial crisis and the regulatory system in place at that time.\"</p>",

Its strategy was flawed from the start.\" Sir Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone Warehouse and former non-executive director of HBOS, had pointed out in his evidence that under the Vickers ring-fencing proposals intended to shield retail banks from riskier investment banking operations, nearly all of HBOS would have been inside the fence. In 2001, the bank's chief executive, Sir James Crosby, set ambitious targets for returns to shareholders. He planned to ramp up lending in an attempt to challenge the \"big four\" banks. But HBOS had a risk department \u2013 meant to be on alert for bad lending decisions \u2013 that could not keep up with the pace of growth, and a management structure that left decisions about lending to division heads. The damning report begins with a warning by a former finance director of HBOS telling the board in January 2004 that the Financial Services Authority felt that the rapid growth being pursued \"may have given rise to an accident waiting to happen\". But it notes that the FSA \u2013 disbanded by the government last weekend \u2013 failed to act on its own concerns. \"The picture that emerges is that the FSA's regulation of HBOS was thoroughly inadequate,\" the report said. \"From 2004 until the later part of 2007, the FSA was not so much the dog that did not bark as a dog barking up the wrong tree,\" the report said, as the regulator moved its focus from prudential risks to a new regulatory system that let banks mark their own homework \u2013 using their own models to measure risks \u2013 and implement new rules on treating customers fairly. \"The experience of the regulation of HBOS demonstrates the fundamental weakness in the regulatory approach prior to the financial crisis and as that crisis unfolded. Too much supervision was undertaken at a too low a level \u2013 without sufficient engagement of the senior leadership within the FSA.\" While the FSA missed opportunities to prevent HBOS from \"pursuing the path that led to its own downfall \u2026 Ultimate responsibility for the bank's chosen path lies, however, not with the regulator but with the board itself.\" The commission estimated that \u00a347bn of losses was incurred \u2013 \u00a325bn in the corporate division, \u00a315bn in Australia and Ireland, and \u00a37bn in the bank's own HQ in its Treasury operations. The report says that those losses on their own would have been enough to bring the bank down. \"Both the relative scale of such large losses and the fact that they were incurred in three separate divisions suggests a systemic management failure across the organisation. Together they would have led to insolvency,\" the report said. To illustrate the scale of the risks being taken on, the report said that in the corporate bank in 2001 the biggest exposure to one single borrower was less than \u00a31m. By 2008 there were nine customers who had each been lent \u00a31bn. One borrower had been advanced \u00a33bn. \"The roots of all these mistakes can be traced to a culture of perilously high risk lending. The picture that emerges is of a corporate bank that found it hard to say 'no',\" the report said. The commissioners said they were \"extremely disappointed\" that HBOS management had tried to blame the closure of wholesale markets rather than the risky lending. In early 2008, the chairman, Lord Stevenson, had argued that the bank was a \"highly conservative institution\". But the report said: \"Far from being a highly conservative institution in a safe harbour, HBOS was in a storm-tossed sea.\" In the days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, some \u00a335bn was withdrawn from customer deposits at HBOS. The bank was rescued by Lloyds three days after the Lehman crash. Eventually \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds was used to prop up the enlarged bank while Lloyds used another \u00a38bn to shore up the troubled loan book. A Treasury spokesman said: \"The failure of HBOS was a symptom of the financial crisis and the regulatory system in place at that time.\"",
