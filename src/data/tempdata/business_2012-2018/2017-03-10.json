      "bodyText": "When Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, opened a hearing with Charlotte Hogg a week ago he recalled how he had lunched with her grandfather in the members\u2019 dining room at Westminster. Another Conservative MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, recalled Hogg Snr speaking in Greek during a visit to Eton. The 46-year-old deputy governor of the Bank of England has no doubt heard many reminiscences about her paternal grandfather: the late Quintin Hogg, who became Lord Hailsham, nearly succeeded Harold Macmillan as Conservative party leader in 1963. Her family tree spreads its roots through British political history and the nation\u2019s best public schools \u2013 Eton, Stowe and Harrow as well the prestigious Catholic boarding school St Mary\u2019s Ascot, attended by Hogg and her mother \u2013 to Oxford University. She grew up in Kettlethorpe Hall, a country estate in Lincolnshire, famous for its moat after her father \u2013 the former MP Douglas Hogg \u2013 submitted an expenses claim that included \u00a32,200 for cleaning it. Both her parents are peers and both served in John Major\u2019s government. Douglas, who retired from parliament shortly after the expenses scandal, holds the title of 3rd Viscount Hailsham. Her mother, Sarah Hogg, now a baroness, is an economist whose career has spanned newspaper and TV journalism, heading Major\u2019s No 10 policy unit and then becoming the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company \u2013 the venture capital group 3i. Charlotte Hogg\u2019s grandparents and great-grandparents were pillars of the establishment. Baroness Hogg\u2019s father was Baron John Boyd-Carpenter, an MP who served in the Scots Guards and was chief secretary to the Treasury. He had followed his father\u2019s path: Major Sir Archibald Boyd-Carpenter, also an MP who was also a treasury minister. The connections do not end there. On her father\u2019s side, her aunt Mary is a high court judge, while her uncle Thomas on her mother\u2019s side was the deputy chief of defence staff in the mid-1990s. Charlotte Hogg followed the normal family path to Oxford, but then her career path diverged. Instead of politics, she chose a career in business. She started as a graduate trainee at the Bank of England, moving on to consultancy McKinsey and then investment bank Morgan Stanley. She then moved to credit checking agency Experian and the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander before returning to the Bank of England in 2013, where she was appointed chief operating officer. A mother of two, she is married to Steve Sacks \u2013 a management consultant, former Lloyds banker and now an executive at luxury retailer Burberry. Hogg is also an accomplished horse rider and long-distance runner. It is her promotion to deputy governor 10 days ago that led to her appearance before MPs and stoked the controversy over why she had not disclosed that her brother, also called Quintin, is a director at Barclays. She told MPs she took \u201cfull responsibility for the oversight\u201d and that it was \u201cregrettable\u201d she had told them \u2013 erroneously \u2013 that she had already disclosed potential conflicts of interest. Her new role includes oversight of banking, as well a seat on the rate-setting monetary policy committee. Given her family\u2019s history in the public eye, the scrutiny she is facing this weekend from MPs may feel like second nature.",

      "bodyText": "The future of the deputy governor of the Bank of England is in the balance this weekend as MPs weigh up whether to issue a stinging rebuke to Charlotte Hogg, the second most powerful official at the Bank. Pressure has been mounting on Hogg, who only took over as deputy on 1 March, since her admission last week that she failed to disclose a potential conflict of interest over her brother\u2019s position as a key Barclays bank executive. Hogg had told MPs that the Bank, run by governor Mark Carney, was aware of Quintin Hogg\u2019s role at the high street lender. However, days later she was forced to write to the Treasury select committee to admit she had not told colleagues of her brother\u2019s job as Barclays\u2019 director of strategy when she joined the institution in 2013. One of the key roles of the Bank of England is to police other banks. A scion of one of Britain\u2019s most blue-blooded political families, 46-year-old Hogg faces the possibility that MPs on the select committee will cast doubt on her suitability to hold her job. The MPs have already discussed asking the Bank to cancel her promotion and are expected to meet on Monday to determine what action to take. The MPs only have an advisory role with regard to Bank appointments, but their opinion is influential. As deputy governor, Hogg is responsible for monitoring markets and banking, and has also kept her previous job as the bank\u2019s chief operating officer, in charge of day-to-day management at the 300-year-old institution. In that role she helped to write the Bank\u2019s conflict of interest guidelines, which she has contravened. When the controversy erupted last week, Carney moved to draw a line under the matter by issuing Hogg \u2013 regarded as a leading candidate to succeed him \u2013 with a rare verbal warning. However, John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury committee, described her position as untenable. Mann told the Guardian the committee could not sack Hogg but his view was that her promotion should be reversed. \u201cI don\u2019t think she should be promoted,\u201d Mann said, adding he would urge fellow MPs to adopt his view. Few other members of the committee have spoken out publicly, but its chairman, Andrew Tyrie, said MPs would offer an opinion on whether she should go \u201cafter a period of reflection\u201d. At least one MP has privately pledged to support her but another told the Financial Times: \u201cIt\u2019s not looking good for her. She has been hoist by her own petard.\u201d Members of the Bank\u2019s court, the equivalent of a board of directors which oversees its running, have acknowledged the seriousness of the situation. Bradley Fried, the court\u2019s deputy chairman, told MPs at a hearing on Tuesday it would go down as \u201ca watershed moment in Ms Hogg\u2019s professional and public life\u201d. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who sits on the committee, told the Guardian his focus was on the Bank\u2019s governance. \u201cI think the court looked complacent when it came before the committee last week which reopened issues about the bank\u2019s governance that are more important than Charlotte Hogg\u2019s mistake,\u201d he said. David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US and a former Bank policymaker, doubted she would survive, saying: \u201cI think she will have to be a sacrificial lamb.\u201d But Lord Myners, a former member of the court and an ex-City minister, said: \u201cFor some people this will raise questions about the role of the court ... I do not think this error is sufficient to disqualify her from her job.\u201d A week ago, the MPs issued a report on Hogg\u2019s role in which they said there were worried about groupthink at the Bank and \u201cconcerned about the need to develop diversity of view\u201d. The Treasury declined to comment on Friday, but at the time of her appointment the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said Hogg had \u201cexceptional leadership skills and wide ranging experience.\u201d .",

    "webTitle": "US interest rate rise almost certain after bumper jobs growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates next week for only the third time since the financial crisis after the latest job numbers for the world\u2019s largest economy beat expectations. The closely watched Labor department data for February showed that the number of new jobs soared to 235,000, the best month for job growth since July last year, adding to pressure on the central bank to agree the first of three predicted rises this year. Officials meet on Wednesday in the wake of strong employment, manufacturing and consumer data that should persuade the Fed to add further to its December rate rise, which saw the cost of borrowing raised by 0.25% to a range of between 0.5% and 0.75%. President Donald Trump grabbed the chance to hail the strong jobs numbers, covering the first full month of his administration, as a personal victory, despite the momentum clearly springing from the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump retweeted the assessment of conservative outlet the Drudge Report, which was: \u201cGREAT AGAIN.\u201d Earlier this week, Trump had welcomed high jobs estimates from the payroll processor ADP as being part of his project to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. \u201cGreat news. We are only just beginning. Together, we are going to #MAGA!\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday, his optimistic tone showing a marked change from last month\u2019s press conference in which he claimed to have inherited \u201cmany problems across government and across the economy\u201d. Higher interest rates are expected to push up the value of the dollar and suck in foreign funds to the US financial system. Surveys show firms are concerned that the high dollar will dent exports, and Trump has accused China and rival exporting nations of winning trade wars after artificially depressing their currencies. The US economy is now in its 77th consecutive month of growth. Last month\u2019s figures were also stronger than expected, with 227,000 jobs added in January. For December, the last full month of Obama\u2019s term in office, the economy added 178,000 jobs. Economists welcomed the figures, though many warned that wages growth of 2.8% failed to indicate that the economy was overheating. Kathleen Brooks, research director at spreadbetting firm City Index, said: \u201cWhile this jobs data is solid enough, it is not too hot to force the Fed to embark on more than three rate hikes this year, which is what the market expects.\u201d Gus Faucher, chief economist at financial services group PNC, said approvingly that the \u201cunderlying trends for the economy now are similar to those in 2016\u201d, when there was consistently strong jobs growth. John Cannally of stockbroker LPL wrote on Twitter that the market \u201cmay begin to price in\u201d the expected rate hikes this year. \u201cToday, the Fed cleared the last small obstacle on its way to a now virtually certain interest rate rise next week,\u201d said Oliver Kolodseike, senior economist at consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, takes place 14-15 March. Unemployment was down slightly in the new figures from 4.8% to 4.7%, and the number of people unemployed for longer than 27 weeks declined slightly. Black unemployment was nearly double white unemployment, 8.1% to 4.1%. The latter had decreased; the former had not. The preliminary analysis by ADP celebrated by Trump earlier in the week found that the US economy had grown in key sectors and that many of the jobs added were in well-paid, desirable fields. Its estimated figures are usually high \u2013 this time they were more than 60,000 jobs north of the actual figures \u2013 but its breakdown of the statistics is widely respected and caused analysts who had predicted some slowdown to revise figures upward. Trump\u2019s supporters continue to watch for the president to make good on his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs, which were up for the month: other drivers of growth were construction, private educational services, manufacturing, healthcare and mining. Also among the less-praised drivers of economic growth is the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature healthcare legislation, which Trump and congressional Republicans aim to repeal, said Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based thinktank. There is \u201cmore voluntary part-time employment because people can now work part-time and get health insurance,\u201d Gould said, \u201cand then you also see more people self-employed for the same reasons; they have some of the economic risk moved off them.\u201d Still, there are several pockets of stagnation in the Trump economy, and those, too, stem from the Obama era. \u201cPublic sector employment is still lower now than it was when the recession began,\u201d Gould observed. \u201cThere was this pursuit of austerity, and that pursuit has put a chokehold on the speed of the recovery. If you look at one of the essential groups of workers in our economy, public school teachers, we have fewer than we did when the recession began. And we know for certain there are more kids.\u201d",

Last month\u2019s figures were also stronger than expected, with 227,000 jobs added in January. For December, the last full month of Obama\u2019s term in office, the economy added 178,000 jobs. </p> <p>Economists welcomed the figures, though many warned that wages growth of 2.8% failed to indicate that the economy was overheating.</p> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at spreadbetting firm City Index, said: \u201cWhile this jobs data is solid enough, it is not too hot to force the Fed to embark on more than three rate hikes this year, which is what the market expects.\u201d </p> <p>Gus Faucher, chief economist at financial services group PNC, <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/too-early-to-tell-if-trump-bump-seen-in-jobs-numbers-economists-say-2017-03-10\">said approvingly</a> that the \u201cunderlying trends for the economy now are similar to those in 2016\u201d, when there was consistently strong jobs growth.

It\u2019s all about the one after that, and the one after that... Oliver Kolodseike, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research: Today, the Fed cleared the last small obstacle on its way to a now virtually certain interest rate rise next week. Speculation will now turn to the future path of interest rates over the year. Markets will be closely scrutinising policymakers\u2019 communication in coming weeks and months to gauge when and to what extent the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. After March, there will be six more Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings this year, offering plenty of opportunities to tighten monetary policy further. Of course, the US economy will have to remain stable, with GDP, inflation and non-farm payroll figures of particular importance to policymakers. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, gives his view on the US jobs report: The latest US jobs report removes any lingering doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. Following news that the world\u2019s biggest economy generated 235,000 net new non-farm jobs in February, it is a bolt-on certainty that the central bank will push up the cost of borrowing by a quarter of a point. Indeed, the financial markets have already moved on from next week to musing about how many more times the Fed will tighten during the course of 2017. The feeling is that two more rate hikes are in prospect. It certainly seems unlikely that next Wednesday\u2019s rise will be the end of the matter. The report from the Bureau of Labour statistics showed employment up by more than the 190,000 expected by Wall Street and unemployment at 4.7%. Annual wage growth is running at 2.8%. Policy makers at the Fed will look at this data and conclude that inflationary pressures are building as the economy approaches full employment. With US productivity so weak, the central bank will certainly be tempted to move again if and when earnings growth hits 3%. There was plenty for Donald Trump to welcome in these figures. A mild winter has resulted in a big increase in construction jobs. Manufacturing employment was also up. The new president has plans for a big package of tax cuts and spending increases but fiscal easing will mean more aggressive tightening from the Fed, which is already starting to fret about the risks of the economy overheating. President Trump is happy with the non-farm payrolls report, judging by the fact he retweeted the following: The strong US jobs report has underlined expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates next week. James Knightley, senior economist at ING, explains: Ahead of this release financial markets were fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike from the Federal Reserve next week. Today\u2019s data will only cement those expectations. As for the rest of the year, financial markets are pricing in just shy of two more 25 basis point hikes with the Fed\u2019s dot forecasts suggesting FOMC members fully expect two more. We are more cautious in pencilling just one. We sense that the current optimism on the US outlook may be tempered somewhat with Congress likely to push back against some of President Trump\u2019s more aggressive fiscal stimulus plans. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, says a rate hike at the Fed\u2019s March meeting is now certain: The 235,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in February will erase any lingering doubts that the Fed might not hike interest rates next week. It will also be greeted with a cheer from the White House. Although February\u2019s gain was above the official consensus forecasts at 190,000, it was broadly in line with our own 240,000 estimate. Nevertheless, many other forecasters scrambled to revise up their own forecasts earlier this week in response to the news of a bumper ADP figure. The upshot is that the market reaction may be muted. As well as a strong non-farms number and lower unemployment rate, average annual earnings growth ticked up to 2.8% in February from 2.6% in January according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics. Employment rose in construction, private educational services, manufacturing, health care, and mining. The positive jobs reports has sent US futures higher. This: The number of jobs added in February was 235,000, smashing expectations of a 190,000 increase. The figure for January was also revised up to 238,000 from 227,000. The jobless rate fell to 4.7% from 4.8%, as expected. Rate hike here we come! It was only last month that Lloyds Banking Group reported its biggest profits since the financial crisis, despite taking a \u00a31bn hit for payment protection insurance compensation. At the time, the \u00a31bn was something of a relief. There was not a new provision in the fourth quarter and the \u00a31bn was less than the \u00a34bn the previous year. PPI has already required Lloyds to put aside \u00a317bn - more than another bank - to pay out claims and handle the administration. But while it hoped to draw a line under \u00a317bn the bank has not admitted it will need to take another \u00a3350m hit, which will be taken in the first quarter of this year. In a statement to the stock exchange, as it filed its accounts with the US authorities, it said: The additional provision has been taken to reflect the estimated impact of the policy statement including the revised arrangements for Plevin cases, which includes a requirement to proactively contact customers who have previously had their complaints defended, and which is likely to increase estimated volumes and redress. The policy statement also confirmed a two month extension to the time bar to the end of August 2019. Plevin is a reference to a court ruling which gives consumers grounds to complain about PPI if they were not told about commission being paid when they were sold the policy. The time bar is a reference to the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s announcement last week that it is setting a deadline for complaints of August 2019 - rather than June. In news just out, Lloyds Banking Group has revealed it is setting aside another \u00a3350m provision for PPI claims - just two weeks after it published results. Just 10 minutes until US non-farm payrolls... Economists polled by Reuters are expecting the figure for February to come in at 190,000, following 227,000 in January. The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.7% from 4.8%. Over to Greece now, where talks with bailout inspectors have ended inconclusively. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: Visiting bailout inspectors have left Athens reporting progress but asserting that differences still remain, preventing the conclusion of a progress review now key to releasing further funds to the debt-stricken country. The two sides are still believed to be at odds over labour markets reforms, the liberalisation of the energy sector, pension cuts, tax increases and property levies. Despite the improved mood between the Greek government and creditor institutions, hopes are fading fast that the review can be wrapped up in time for the next Eurogroup meeting of eurozone finance ministers on March 20 - a deadline prime minister Alexis Tsipras had hoped to meet. But speaking exclusively to the Guardian, the governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, played down fears that the review would drag on endlessly, pushing the country inexorably towards default when it faces huge debt repayments in July. Sooner or later it will be completed,\u201d he said, insisting that the continued uncertainty engulfing Greece as a result of the delays \u201cis in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d Greece has covered a lot of road. We are 90% there in terms of fiscal adjustment. The government has done well on the fiscal side, less well on the structural reform side. The emphasis now should be on structural reforms and privatisations. Tim Martin, the boss of Wetherspoon who is never afraid to speak his mind, is not happy with Philip Hammond. He used a first-half trading update to criticise the chancellor\u2019s spring budget on Wednesday, which he said would saddle the pub group with nearly \u00a330m of extra charges. Martin said a business rates bill of \u00a37m, a \u00a32m apprenticeship levy and a \u00a34m hit from the sugar tax that will contribute to \u00a329m in extra charges was not good for the sector as a whole. We understand the need for the government to raise taxes. However, there should be a sensible rebalancing of the taxes paid by pubs and supermarkets, if the pub industry is to survive in the long term. In effect, this was a budget for dinner parties, no doubt the preference of the chancellor and his predecessor \u2013 dinner parties will suffer far less from the taxes outlined above, whereas many people prefer to go to pubs, given the choice, he said. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has been speaking about Greece again. Her comments that Greek debt must be restructured were hardly surprising, but it does suggest the IMF is not going to let this one go any time soon. Speaking to French newspaper Le Parisien, Lagarde said the fund could only join the bailout programme if debts became more manageable. \u201cWe also need a sustainable debt,\u201d she told the paper, citing an extension of loan repayment periods and lower interest rates as possible solutions. She said she was trying to convince European leaders that Greece needs debt relief. Brexit, Frexit, it\u2019s all about the exits. Here in the UK, Theresa May is on the verge of triggering article 50, officially kickstarting the Brexit process. Over in France, Frexit appears a pretty remote possibility, reliant first on a Marine Le Pen election victory and then on a referendum vote. But following the shock Brexit result and Trump\u2019s victory in the US, analysts believe it can\u2019t be entirely ruled out. It appears that Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, would agree. Eurozone inflation is back, growth forecasts have been revised up, and yet Draghi was keen to emphasise there were downside risks at yesterday\u2019s ECB press conference. The risk posed by a potential Le Pen victory is clearly on policymakers\u2019 minds. Florian Hense, European economist at the German Bank Berenberg, spells out why policymakers are so fearful of a Le Pen victory: The tail risk that Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Front National, becomes the next president is not negligible (10% probability). Le Pen wants to pull France out of the euro and the EU. If successful, this would spell the end of Europe as we know it.\u200e Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s shadow secretary of state for culture, media and sport, has commented on BT\u2019s Openreach agreement with Ofcom. He says the government must work with unions to protect jobs an pensions: This is a welcome announcement that must now deliver for customers, far too many of whom don\u2019t have access to broadband or put up with a poor quality service. The government\u2019s failure to create healthy competition in the UK\u2019s digital market has caused the rollout of broadband to be far too slow and millions of British households and businesses have paid the price, at a cost of billions of pounds to the economy. While the legal separation of Openreach from BT is clearly a good thing for consumers we must also ensure it works for Openreach\u2019s 32,000 employees and the government must work with the Communication Workers Union to ensure that jobs, pensions and terms and conditions are protected. Now the separation has been agreed the government must waste no time in delivering the broadband infrastructure that UK homes and businesses so badly need. As equities and the dollar rise, gold is down. The precious metal fell to its lowest in more than five weeks, at $1,194.55 an ounce. The dollar is up as investors await the non-farm payrolls report due at 13.30 UK time. The expectation is that the report will pave the way for a Fed rate hike at next week\u2019s meeting. Markets are now pricing in an almost 90% chance of a hike. The dollar was up almost half a cent to 115.495 yen, the highest since 20 January. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was flat at 101.80, but is on track for a fifth straight week of gains, it\u2019s best run in eight months. Hamish Pepper, currency strategist at Barclays, says the dollar\u2019s strength might not have legs: In the near term it\u2019s going to be quite tough for there to be further dollar strength, given how well priced the Fed meeting is next week, and also just how much the market has priced for the year now as a whole. Of course that [pricing] holds some relevance for the labour market report today - it implies that you really need to see quite a significant upside surprise if you\u2019re to see continued dollar strength. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, says that feeding all the data into the supercomputer, we shouldn\u2019t be too downbeat, with the economy likely to grow at a decent pace in the first quarter of 2017: Don\u2019t be misled by all the negative signs! In summary, these data for January, the first month of Q1, make me confident that Q1 GDP growth can easily record 0.5% quarter on quarter still and possibly even 0.6%. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, says there are signs the economy is becoming better balanced. She says industrial output and construction are on course to provide a bigger boost for the UK economy in the first quarter of 2017 than in the final quarter of 2016. Of course, these sectors only account for around 20% of the economy ... But they should nonetheless prevent GDP growth from slowing too much in Q1. Meanwhile, January\u2019s trade figures point to more balanced growth too. All in all then, not only do today\u2019s figures add to the evidence that economic growth has maintained a decent pace at the start of the year but they also suggest that growth is starting to become better balanced. The ONS prefers to look at longer-term data, rather than just a monthly snapshot. Kate Davies, senior statistician, says: Taking the last three months together, construction and manufacturing both grew strongly, with a considerable narrowing in Britain\u2019s trade deficit. However, both manufacturing and construction were broadly flat on the month with the trade balance little changed. Construction orders fell back a little overall in second half of 2016, albeit after strong growth in the first half of the year. Just in, a flurry of UK data for January from the Office for National Statistics. It provides the first official snapshot of how key parts of the economy were performing at the beginning of 2017. Here\u2019s a snapshot: Manufacturing output fell 0.9% (economists forecast a 0.6% drop) Industrial output fell 0.4% (in line with forecasts) Construction output fell 0.4% (economists expected a 0.2% drop) Trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly to \u00a310.8bn Investors have welcomed BT\u2019s agreement to separate from Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure. BT is top of the FTSE 100 leader board this morning, with shares up 4% at the moment (and higher earlier). Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, gives his take on BT\u2019s shares: Shares in BT rallied on the open after the company finally reached a settlement to separate its prized Openreach division. It ends a lot of uncertainty over the future of BT and investors cheered the news with the stock gaining 5% in early trading. It\u2019s a marked contrast to the dark day in January when the shares plunged by a fifth just in just a few hours on troubles at its Italian division. Today\u2019s gains have so far not seen the stock recover to the level it was trading at before news of the accounting trouble in Italy rocked the group. Earlier we had German trade data, which showed a stronger-than-expected rise in imports in January according to the federal statistics office. Imports grew by 3% compared with December, outpacing 2.7% growth in exports which was also a bigger-than-expected rise. Germany imported goods worth \u20ac84bn in January, and exported goods worth \u20ac99bn. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5% increase in imports and a 1.85% rise in exports. Markets have a spring in their step this morning, with European indices following Asian shares higher. Today\u2019s non-farm payrolls are viewed as the last hurdle to get over before the Fed takes the plunge and raises rates next week. So the report is keenly awaited on both sides of the Atlantic. Here are the scores so far this morning: FTSE 100: +0.4% at 7,343 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.4% at 12,024 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 4,996 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.9% at 19,739 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,041 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 374 In terms of corporate news, BT dominates this morning. The telecoms giant has finally reached an agreement with Ofcom to legally separate Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband infrastructure. BT has been in dispute with the regulator over the split for about two years. Under the deal Openreach will be stripped of BT branding and become a \u201cdistinct company with its own staff and management, together with its own strategy and a legal purpose to serve all of its customers equally\u201d. The idea is that an independent Openreach will boost competition in the sector and boost the roll-out of superfast broadband. BT\u2019s rivals, including Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone, have argued that BT has deliberately been slow to open up the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access. Here is our full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s non-farm payrolls day in the US. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting that 190,000 jobs were added in February, following 227,000 in January. It would take an absolute shocker on the downside to derail expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its policy meeting on Wednesday next week. Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, said a rate hike next week is pretty much a done deal: The Fed looks to be locked onto a course that would see it raise the Fed funds target rate range by 25 basis points to 0.75-1.00%, short of a sizeable shock to market sentiment and/or a massive downside surprise in the February payrolls report. Note that with a March hike effectively a done deal, the key focus for markets will be the forward guidance on the prospect of rate rises ahead. Some economists think today\u2019s payrolls number could come a fair bit stronger than consensus expectations, not least because of a strong ADP jobs report on Wednesday, which easily beat expectations. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "BT has reached a deal with the industry regulator to separate its broadband network, Openreach, from the rest of the company. But will it make a difference to consumers? Openreach has long been dogged by accusations of poor customer service, long delays for connections and repairs, and households and businesses in despair over broadband speeds. What has BT agreed to do? Openreach, owned by BT, is a crucial part of Britain\u2019s infrastructure, responsible for bringing landlines and broadband to most homes and companies in the country, not just for BT but also for rivals such as Sky. In a deal with regulator Ofcom, BT will now hive the company off independently, although it will remain the 100% owner. The idea is that Openreach will become a distinct entity with its 32,000 staff serving all customers equally, with the likes of Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone treated no differently to BT when it comes to investment and access. Will we now have faster broadband? Don\u2019t bank on it. Little more than 2% of the country receives ultrafast broadband delivered via fibre-optic lines, compared with 70% in Japan. We\u2019re even behind Turkey and Mexico. Ofcom says \u201cOpenreach will develop its own strategy and annual operating plans\u201d but adds the rider that it will be \u201cwithin an overall budget set by BT Group\u201d. BT promised \u00a36bn last year to bring \u201cultra fast\u201d broadband to 10m homes and businesses. But dig into that figure and it looks more like \u00a31.33bn a year \u2013 hardly enough, critics say, to bring the country up to speed. Rivals say BT has consistently under-invested, but an independent Openreach should at least allow BT\u2019s rivals to more easily invest in their own fibre networks by accessing the group\u2019s underground cables and telegraph poles. Will I have to pay more? The bad news is that Sky and BT have already announced higher prices this year for their phone, TV and broadband packages with some going up 10%. Landline rental \u2013 which most households need in order to access broadband \u2013 has gone up sharply by between 28% and 41% in recent years, even though the wholesale cost of providing those landlines has fallen by 25%. BT itself managed three price rises in the space of just 18 months. The suspicion is that consumers are subsidising fatcat Premier League wages as the telecom companies seek to recoup the massive outlay they have paid to acquire television rights \u2013 with this week\u2019s \u00a31.2bn renewal of Champions League rights the latest major investment. One hope is that smaller operators piggy-backing on a more independent Openreach, which will lease access to the broadband network, may be able to offer cheaper deals. Ofcom also recently ordered BT to cut bills for landline-only customers by \u00a35 a month. Will customer service improve? Fingers crossed. Ofcom says the new Openreach will now serve all its customers equally, not just BT\u2019s. Vodafone, Sky and TalkTalk, all of whom use the network to deliver services, have given approving nods to the deal. But consumer groups say there need to be tougher penalties for when Openreach gets it wrong, better quality of service requirements, and automatic compensation when providers fail to deliver. Will BT\u2019s \u00a31.2bn Champions League deal be affected? The company can\u2019t pass the cost on to Openreach. And if independence fosters better competition and lower prices across the industry, BT\u2019s ability to bid colossal sums for future football rights must be in doubt. Why don\u2019t they just completely separate it? This is a saga that has gone on for years. One problem is BT\u2019s pension scheme, which suffers from a mammoth deficit, and a forced separation would likely have provoked lengthy legal battles. BT\u2019s share price was the fastest riser in the FTSE 100 after the deal was announced, which may suggest that shareholders will win most from this deal rather than householders.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s decision to allow a worker representative to attend its board meetings is not enough to solve the retailer\u2019s deep corporate governance failings, unions and business leaders have warned. The company founded and run by Mike Ashley began the process of appointing a staff representative on Tuesday after caving in to pressure from shareholders and MPs following a series of scandals over the way the company is run and how it treats its staff. However, Britain\u2019s biggest union, Unite, dismissed the move as little more than a \u201cPR exercise\u201d. Meanwhile, in a letter to the Guardian, the Institute of Directors (IoD) business group said Sports Direct had become the media\u2019s \u201cposter-child for corporate governance failings\u201d and more fundamental change than appointing a staff representative was needed to rein in Ashley\u2019s dominance. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: it will do little, if anything, to resolve the corporate governance problems at the company,\u201d wrote Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the IoD. \u201cFor real, long-lasting change for the good of all investors, customers and employees, a radical overhaul of Sports Direct\u2019s governance is necessary. \u201cThere needs to be more independent oversight of Ashley who, because of his shareholding, effectively controls the company. This is not a simple question of appointing a worker to the board. At present, the board has five independent directors, four of whom have been in situ for over five years. Time and time again, they have failed to rein in Ashley and I fail to see how a worker could do anything more. \u201cWithout fundamental and structural reform, a wholesale change in the behaviour of the largest sports retailer in the UK is very hard to imagine.\u201d A parliamentary inquiry into working practices at the retailer - prompted by a Guardian investigation - concluded last year that Ashley had been running Sports Direct like a Victorian workhouse. The billionaire said in a letter to staff published on Tuesday: \u201cI have always believed Sports Direct to be a business that was built by the great people who work here. I therefore believe it is important that your voice is heard at the highest level in order to continue to make a positive difference. \u201cI look forward with immense pride to sitting alongside the UK\u2019s first elected workers\u2019 representative at future board meetings of Sports Direct International.\u201d However, Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary at Unite, was not convinced it would amount to meaningful change. \u201cGiven Sports Direct\u2019s past behaviour and its refusal to involve Unite, we remain deeply sceptical about the process and whether a single unsupported representative will have a meaningful voice on a board which has been severely criticised for poor corporate governance. \u201cWe remain to be convinced whether managers or supervisors directly employed by Sports Direct will actively voice the concerns of this sizeable part of the workforce should they be chosen as the worker representative. \u201cIf the worker is hand-picked by Sports Direct, without union support, training and confidence to speak up, then this risks being little more than a PR exercise rather than a serious attempt to right the wrongs of the past.\u201d Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, was also sceptical about the difference the appointment will make given Ashley\u2019s dominance: \u201cSports Direct blathers on about appointing the first workers\u2019 representative to the board. As if that will stop Mike Ashley doing what he wants to anyway.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s investigation exposed how Sports Direct was failing to pay workers the minimum wage at its Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire after harsh financial deductions for clocking in slightly late and being forced to go through unpaid searches at the end of each shift. MPs on the Commons business, innovation and skills select committee were highly critical of the way Ashley had run the company, concluding that he had used \u201cappalling working practices\u201d and treated his \u201cworkers as commodities rather than as human beings\u201d. Theresa May has promised a crackdown on boardroom excess at large privately owned businesses, last year unveiling proposals intended to hold corporate Britain to account. Candidates for the worker representative\u2019s role who make it through an assessment process will be invited to stand in an election, in which 23,000 Sports Direct staff will be eligible to vote. The appointment will be made for a 12-month period, with a new representative to be elected every year. The first successful candidate will be chosen from the company\u2019s retail division, followed by someone working in the warehouse or head office in the second year. The cycle will then be repeated. In a statement on Tuesday, Sports Direct said the representative would be \u201cinvited by the board to attend and speak at all scheduled meetings of the board on behalf of the people who work at Sports Direct\u201d. This seemed to fall short of what Ashley had pledged in the past, when he said: \u201cI would like to take somebody either from the retail, the warehouse, the office, and make them a fully board member - on the board - to make sure they totally have their say, they totally have a vote. I\u2019m massively in favour of that. I\u2019m totally in agreement with Theresa May.\u201d A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cHaving explored all options, we believe this is the best way to ensure the workers\u2019 representative is free to champion the interests of all staff. We see this as a major step forward in bringing about positive change.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Spring has arrived, so it\u2019s time for WPP to tot up chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s winnings. The workings of the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan, or Leap, aren\u2019t simple but Sorrell got \u00a341.6m for 2016. That was a maximum payout but not as much as last year\u2019s \u00a363m. Still, \u00a3113,000 a day would make even George Osborne jealous. Hold on, you might say, didn\u2019t WPP\u2019s shareholders rise up in anger years ago? Didn\u2019t 60% vote against Sorrell\u2019s rewards back in 2012? Wasn\u2019t the company forced to dismantle the Leap incentive scheme? Correct on all counts, but the concession that WPP made in 2013 to prevent another defeat was limited. Leap operates on a five-year cycle and it was deemed utterly impossible to expect Sorrell and a few senior colleagues to hop off immediately. Thus the cycle was allowed to complete its turn, and the value to Sorrell can now be seen. In total, he has received \u00a3210m in pay, bonuses and awards in the past five years, with Leap doing most of the work. It is staggering sum, even by modern standards. Leap is now history and restraint is promised next year. What is WPP\u2019s definition of restraint? Under the replacement scheme, it is a maximum of \u00a320m-ish a year for Sorrell. Back in 2012, the fuss was about him collecting \u00a36.8m. He has run rings around the pay police. The odd going of Cumming Star fund manager David Cumming\u2019s departure from Standard Life \u2013 announced on Wednesday while the chancellor\u2019s budget was still being digested \u2013 looks very odd. The head of equities has chosen to leave with immediate effect \u201cto pursue other interests\u201d, the usual shorthand companies use when there is more to the tale than they are willing to say. In this case, the obfuscation looks significant since Standard Life announced its \u00a311bn \u201cmerger\u201d with Aberdeen Asset Management only 48 hours earlier. If Cumming or his (now former) employer wanted to plead complete coincidence, they\u2019d surely have spoken up. Let\u2019s deal with the conspiracy theory first. Cumming probably wasn\u2019t heaved out as payback for joining the rebellion in January 2016 against big bonuses at Aberdeen, including for chief executive Martin Gilbert. That would be far too unsubtle, and also silly. Maybe Cumming thinks the deal is a stinker and wants no part of it. That is possible. By way of circumstantial evidence, note that Standard Life\u2019s fund managers weren\u2019t in a position to rebel or conform at Aberdeen\u2019s annual meeting this year because they had sold their holding. But, again, the script feels forced. The prosaic explanation is most credible. It may be that Cumming had simply been given a nod that he is not the frontrunner to be head of equities in the combined operation. These things happen when companies get together. Cumming was one of Standard Life\u2019s most senior figures, had a big following and directly managed \u00a327bn of investments. But, in a merger where shareholders have been promised \u00a3200m of cost savings, not everybody can be deemed indispensable. Or, rather, some people can be. The boards of Standard Life and Aberdeen, remember, have decided that it is vital for the success of the deal that both their chiefs are retained. Thus Keith Skeoch and Gilbert will be co-chief executives, defying convention and examples of failure elsewhere. It rather looks as if one rule applies in the boardroom and another outside. That may not be good for morale in the ranks. Unsurprising U-turn What was it Mike Ashley said about putting a worker on Sports Direct\u2019s board? Here it is, from last September: \u201cI would like to take somebody either from the retail, the warehouse, the office, and make them a fully [sic] board member \u2013 on the board \u2013 to make sure they totally have their say, they totally have a vote. I\u2019m massively in favour of that.\u201d Now he is massively in favour of something less than full board membership. The elected workers\u2019 representative will not be a director. Instead, she or he \u201cwill be invited by the board to attend and speak at all scheduled meetings of the board on behalf of the people who work at Sports Direct\u201d. To be fair to Ashley, he\u2019s gone further than most public companies. But there is a big difference between being a member of a board and being an invited attendee at its meetings. To be doubly fair to Ashley, the prime minister, Theresa May, also performed a U-turn on the idea of putting workers on boards. There may be a reason for doing so: Sports Direct says being a director would constrain the representative\u2019s ability to champion the interests of staff. But it is a U-turn \u2013 and it is a U-turn that reinforces Ashley\u2019s control. Nobody should be surprised.",

    "webTitle": "BT Openreach deal could pave way for cheaper, faster broadband", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumers could look forward to cheaper broadband and better service after BT finally agreed a deal to legally separate Openreach, which controls the UK\u2019s broadband network. For two years the telecoms company had been at loggerheads with the UK media regulator, Ofcom, which wants to strengthen the independence of Openreach to promote competition and boost superfast broadband. \u201cThis is a significant day for phone and broadband users,\u201d said Ofcom chief executive Sharon White. \u201cThe new Openreach will be built to serve all its customers equally, working truly independently and taking investment decisions on behalf of the whole industry \u2013 not just BT.\u201d Conservative MP Grant Shapps, the chair of the parliamentary cross-party British Infrastructure Group, said that the separation agreement should now benefit internet customers. \u201cThere has been significant parliamentary concern about the current setup, which led to 120 MPs backing a report calling for separation,\u201d said Shapps. \u201cNow both BT and Openreach must focus on ensuring that the millions of UK customers receive better broadband.\u201d Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, said: \u201cHouseholds deserve an affordable, reliable broadband connection and a choice of supplier wherever they live. I hope it will eventually mean cheaper and better broadband for everyone.\u201d Now that Openreach will legally separate from BT, Ofcom has agreed to drop its threat to call in European regulators. The newly separate broadband network operator will directly employ 32,000 staff \u2013 almost a third of the telecoms group\u2019s workforce \u2013 who will be transferred across from BT, which Ofcom said would allow Openreach \u201cto develop its own distinct organisational culture\u201d. It will be one of the biggest transfers of employees under UK employment regulations. \u201cWe will carefully monitor how the new Openreach performs, while continuing our work to improve the quality of service offered by all telecoms companies,\u201d said White. \u201cWe have got powers to impose fines [if it fails to implement changes].\u201d A major sticking point in the protracted negotiations is what happens to the pensions of BT staff who transfer to become Openreach employees. To protect those employees the government will have to enact new legislation to extend the crown guarantee that underwrites BT\u2019s \u00a347bn retirement fund to cover Openreach staff. This will take several months and the separation of Openreach will not begin until that has taken place. Rivals \u2013 which include Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone \u2013 argue that BT has deliberately dragged its heels in opening up the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access. Openreach, which began operating in 2006, is responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK. \u201cI believe this agreement will serve the long-term interests of millions of UK households, businesses and service providers that rely on our infrastructure,\u201d said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. \u201cIt will also end a period of uncertainty for our people and support further investment in the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure.\u201d \u201cThis is a welcome step that we have long called for on behalf of our customers,\u201d said a spokesman for Sky. \u201cA more independent Openreach is a step towards delivering better service to customers and the investment that the UK needs. It\u2019s important that today\u2019s agreement is now implemented by BT in good faith and without delay.\u201d Under the deal with Ofcom, Openreach will be stripped of BT branding and become a \u201cdistinct company with its own staff and management, together with its own strategy and a legal purpose to serve all of its customers equally\u201d. \u201cBT has agreed to all of the changes needed to address Ofcom\u2019s competition concerns,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cThe new Openreach will have the greatest degree of independence from BT Group without incurring the delays and disruption \u2013 to industry, consumers and investment plans \u2013 associated with [an alternative] structural separation or the sell-off of Openreach to new shareholders.\u201d In February, BT announced that telecoms industry veteran Mike McTighe as Openreach\u2019s first chairman, and created its own board which has a majority of independent members. The operational structure for Openreach will see the division setting its own strategy and controlling the allocation of its own budget, within an overall budget set by BT. \u201cOpenreach will be obliged to consult formally with customers such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone on large-scale investments,\u201d said Ofcom. \u201cIn future, there will be a \u2018confidential\u2019 phase during which customers can discuss ideas without this being disclosed to BT Group, as well as further protections for confidential customer information.\u201d Openreach\u2019s chief executive will be appointed by, and accountable to, Openreach\u2019s board. BT will be able to veto the appointment of future Openreach chief executives, but will have to notify Ofcom first. The deal with Ofcom marks two victories in a week for Patterson \u2013 following the renewal of a \u00a31.2bn deal for exclusive Champions League rights for a further three years \u2013 who has endured a torrid few months. Patterson has been trying to keep BT on track after the financial and reputational damage of an accounting scandal at its Italian operation triggered one of its biggest ever one-day share price falls and wiping \u00a38bn off its shares. In a carefully timed speech at a conference last week, which included White, Patterson vowed to improve customer service for BT\u2019s millions of residential customers and telecoms companies that rely on its network. His conciliatory tone, after years of wrangling, and acknowledgment of the criticism he has received over the quality of the Openreach national broadband network was taken by analysts as a precursor to a mutually agreeable deal finally being announced. \u201cThis has been a long and challenging review where we have been balancing a number of competing interests,\u201d said Patterson on Friday. \u201cWe have listened to criticism of our business and as a result are willing to make fundamental changes to the way Openreach will work in the future.\u201d",

It will be one of the biggest transfers of employees under UK employment regulations.</p> <p>\u201cWe will carefully monitor how the new Openreach performs, while continuing our work to improve the quality of service offered by all telecoms companies,\u201d said White. \u201cWe have got powers to impose fines [if it fails to implement changes].\u201d<br></p> <p>A major sticking point in the protracted negotiations is what happens to the pensions of BT staff who transfer to become Openreach employees.</p> <p>To protect those employees the government will have to enact new legislation to extend the crown guarantee that underwrites BT\u2019s \u00a347bn retirement fund to cover Openreach staff.</p> <p>This will take several months and the separation of Openreach will not begin until that has taken place.</p> <p>Rivals \u2013 which include Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone \u2013 argue that BT has deliberately dragged its heels in opening up the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access.</p> <p>Openreach, which began operating in 2006, is responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI believe this agreement will serve the long-term interests of millions of UK households, businesses and service providers that rely on our infrastructure,\u201d said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. \u201cIt will also end a period of uncertainty for our people and support further investment in the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is a welcome step that we have long called for on behalf of our customers,\u201d said a spokesman for Sky. \u201cA more independent Openreach is a step towards delivering better service to customers and the investment that the UK needs.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The John Lewis partnership is cutting its annual bonus for staff. The group, which owns dozens of department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, has also been cutting jobs and reining in expansion. The cost savings come despite a 21.2% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3370.4m, before the staff bonus and one-off items, while sales rose 3.2% to \u00a311.4bn. So why is John Lewis reducing payouts to its workers, known as \u201cpartners\u201d as they jointly own the business? Pay rises The introduction of the new minimum wage for over 25s \u2013 \u201cthe national living wage\u201d \u2013 has increased costs for all retailers. John Lewis has always tried to attract better quality staff, and retain them for longer, by offering pay above the legal minimum alongside other benefits ranging from a decent pension to the use of company holiday homes. Maintaining that differential, and ensuring even better pay for staff who have been in place longer or have taken on additional responsibilities, cost the company \u00a336m. Simply complying with the national living wage would have cost it only \u00a33m. On average, non-management staff pay rose 5% to \u00a38.67 per hour last year. As a result, those staff members still saw an overall increase in the combined value of their pay and bonus for the year.. John Lewis said pay would be going up again in April when the national living wage increases to \u00a37.50 an hour from \u00a37.20. Pensions Part of John Lewis\u2019 attraction as an employer has always been its pension scheme. In 2015, the group was one of the last to move away from a scheme based entirely on final salary. It now offers a cheaper hybrid scheme based on a mix of staff contributions and final salary and has pumped more than \u00a3300m in additional contributions into the scheme in the past year. But low interest rates have delivered lower returns for the scheme\u2019s investments and it had a deficit of \u00a3479m in March this year. Partly because of this deficit, the group\u2019s total debts have increased to more than four times its annual cash flow. With uncertain times ahead as the UK undertakes the complex process of leaving the EU, John Lewis\u2019s management say they need cash to reduce this burden. Yes it\u2019s Brexit The company didn\u2019t use the B-word, but the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro since the Brexit vote has made life more difficult for retailers. The cost of goods, such as clothing and electronics, has risen dramatically because contracts are agreed in dollars. At the same time, shoppers\u2019 disposable income is being squeezed by rising fuel and food costs, so retailers\u2019 battling for attention are finding it difficult to put up prices. That squeeze is only likely to increase this year, meaning retailers must find other ways to cut costs. Shift to online John Lewis and Waitrose have led the way as their wealthier customers have been keen adopters of shopping online. Online sales for the department store jumped 16.2% as shopping via mobile phones soared 73% last year while sales in stores fell 1%. Waitrose did not break out its online performance for the full year, but internet sales rose 4.3% in the first half while store sales fell. The shift online requires major development of infrastructure, such as automated warehouses to process parcels efficiently as well as investment in IT to keep pace with shoppers\u2019 constantly evolving demands. The department store chain alone is spending \u00a3500m over five years on IT and distribution systems \u2013 so costs must be saved elsewhere. Better stores and exclusive products The ease of online shopping means that high street stores have to work harder to tempt people away from the sofa. Waitrose has been installing cafes and wine bars and these food services increased sales by nearly 5% last year, helping to offset falling grocery sales. The group is rolling out sushi counters and looking for other ideas, all of which will be costly to install. John Lewis has hired extra designers to help it produce more exclusive products that will help it rise above the whirl of commodified price checking online. It is also installing more services, such as spas and cafes.",
