      "bodyText": "Debenhams is under fresh pressure after it emerged credit insurers have reduced cover for suppliers to the department store chain in the latest sign of the challenges facing Britain\u2019s high streets. Suppliers use credit insurance to protect themselves from the risk of not being paid. Euler Hermes, a leading insurer, is among those to have reduced cover. It comes a month after Debenhams issued its third profits warning this year, saying full-year profits would be well below City expectations, and announced plans to sell Magasin du Nord, the Danish department store, in a bid to strengthen its finances. Credit insurers Coface and Atradius have also reduced coverage for new shipments to Debenhams in recent days, according to a report by the Sunday Times. A withdrawal or reduction in cover tends to mean that suppliers demand payment upfront, putting increased strain on a retailer\u2019s working capital. However, credit insurers have not cut cover for Debenhams completely and a spokesman for the retailer said it was still in a \u201chealthy\u201d cash position. He said: \u201cDebenhams has a healthy balance sheet and cash position. All the credit insurers continue to provide cover to our suppliers and we maintain a constructive relationship with them. \u201cIt is well-documented that market conditions are challenging, but Debenhams continues to be profitable, has a clear strategy in place and is taking decisive actions to strengthen the business\u200e.\u201d Debenhams has 176 stores in the UK and employs about 27,000 people. It expects annual profits this year to be between \u00a335m and \u00a340m, compared to more than \u00a3150m five years ago. Rival department store chain House of Fraser announced last month that it would close 31 of its 59 stores in the UK, including its flagship shop on London\u2019s Oxford Street, with the loss of about 6,000 jobs. The John Lewis Partnership has warned it will make no profit in the first six months of this year and is to close five Waitrose stores as tough trading on the high street takes its toll. An unnamed source quoted by the Sunday Times said the clothing market was being trashed by \u201cone desperate player\u201d \u2013 House of Fraser \u2013 heavily discounting prices and forcing others to follow in order to compete. A number of Britain\u2019s biggest high street names have revealed problems in recent months as those with a large physical presence suffer from higher costs, waning consumer confidence and competition from online-only retailers. Last week, administrators in charge of finding a buyer for the ailing Poundworld chain announced the closure of more than 100 stores with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. The discount chain collapsed into administration in June after rescue talks with potential buyers failed. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst and advisor, said the decision by credit insurers to reduce cover for Debenhams suppliers was \u201ca massive warning light\u201d. \u201cI regard credit insurance reduction as a very significant warning signal. They are not dong it for laughs, they are doing it because of how the risk is unfolding. It suggests a change in that risk and a deterioration in the underlying trading performance.\u201d Euler Hermes declined to comment and Coface and Atradius did not respond.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There are tourists punting on the river and cyclists thronging the street. On this summer day, many of the trains have been cancelled or face severe delays. It\u2019s more than a century since the Victorian economist Alfred Marshall taught at Cambridge University \u2013 where the economics library still bears his name \u2013 yet he would still recognise plenty of things about the city today. More than a century ago, the mentor to John Maynard Keynes developed the idea of the \u201cindustrial district\u201d to explain how bringing jobs and businesses together in specific locations can help improve the productivity of work. There are advantages in huddling together; of encouraging technical dynamism in particular places. Knowledge can spread more quickly, often by accident. People with similar skills are drawn together to pursue careers in the same field. In 1890 the most common examples of clustering were the cotton mills of 19th century Lancashire. Marshall suggested that, in a concentrated area, \u201cthe mysteries of the trade become no mysteries; but are, as it were, in the air\u201d. Modern day Cambridge might lack the dark satanic mills and Brexit might threaten the future of British industry. But there is still something in the clean, crisp Cambridgeshire air that could prove useful for the economy as Britain leaves the EU. Recent years have seen the increasing development of Cambridge as a world-beating life sciences cluster, with around 430 companies ranging from tiny startups spawned from the university to global leaders in the pharmaceutical industry. There are more than 15,500 jobs generating about \u00a32.9bn per year for the British economy. Forming one corner of an economic golden triangle from Oxford in the west to London in the south, the wider regional life sciences cluster supports 24,000 jobs creating more than \u00a38.4bn per year for the economy. Even in the days of thousands of Skype meetings, people still appear to prefer living and working in close proximity. The FTSE 100 pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is making Cambridge its home for exactly these reasons. Spending about \u00a3500m building a global strategic research and development site, the company wants some of the rarified air identified by Marshall, and could breathe further life still into the area. More than 2,600 of the drugs company\u2019s staff and scientists now work there, even before the completion of its new headquarters on the edge of Addenbrooke\u2019s hospital. Pharmaceutical companies have struggled with weaker levels of productivity in recent years having become reliant on drugs developed decades ago. Open collaboration with startups and universities could help them create new medicines. AstraZeneca has about 130 projects with Cambridge University, having only run half a dozen a decade ago. According to a report by the consultancy Development Economics for the drugs firm, seen by the Guardian, the Cambridge cluster could create an additional 6,000 jobs over the next decade, generating an extra \u00a31bn for the British economy. Most of the gains are from co-location. But there are risks. The report warns a hard Brexit could curtail access to European research funding vital for life sciences, free movement of highly skilled scientists, and make it harder for firms to access startup finance. Combined, this could cost the cluster 4,300 jobs and almost \u00a34.6bn in economic output by 2032. Cambridge University is dependent on research funding for around 40% of its income each year and receives about 15% of that from the EU, or around \u00a360m a year. Around a fifth of staff come from the EU. AstraZeneca has between 300 and 400 EU employees, while some senior scientists are already choosing not to move to the UK. All of this might sound a bit like propaganda prepared for a multinational company, with business interests in both Britain and Sweden. Brexiters have attacked Airbus and BMW for warning of job losses and withholding investment in Britain in recent weeks. So the argument goes: why would they leave Britain? We are too important to ignore. But there are serious dangers. Official figures show business investment has fallen since the EU referendum, linked directly by economists to the uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with Brussels. The economy has almost ground to a halt and manufacturing output has fallen. AstraZeneca has begun parallel testing of drugs manufacturing at its Swedish site in Gothenburg because of Brexit. Additional major investments at its manufacturing facility near Macclesfield are on hold until the company has greater clarity. Rival science clusters around the world could gain ground, from Boston to Amsterdam and emerging centres of excellence in the far east. Faced with the prospect of losing access to 500 million potential customers in the EU should Brussels rules prevent the sale of UK-made drugs after Brexit, the company says it has no choice. Andy Williams, who is overseeing AstraZeneca\u2019s move to Cambridge as vice-president for strategy and operations, says: \u201cBrexiters say: \u2018ah, well, it\u2019ll get sorted out, as it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019 \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right it doesn\u2019t, but when it\u2019s your whole business and you\u2019ve got patients waiting for those medicines, you can\u2019t take that risk. It\u2019s fine for politicians to take that risk but we can\u2019t do that.\u201d Besides Brexit, there are domestic barriers also facing Cambridge. There are plenty of lessons for ministers. If investment in trains and housing needs to improve even here in the affluent south-east, think of the rest of the country\u2019s needs. Recent chaos on the Great Northern and Thameslink line to the city attest that more work needs to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great impression if we say Cambridge is a global centre, and then no one can get there from London,\u201d says Williams of the recent delays and cancellations. Failure to provide adequate local transport could result in a growth penalty of around 990 net jobs by 2032, according to the Development Economics report. Housing is also becoming an increasing issue for younger workers moving to the area, as prices in Cambridge skyrocket. Businesses also complain about the bus service and the state of the roads. The government\u2019s industrial strategy attempts to fix this, with a sector deal for the life sciences industry, but fails to go far enough. There is a commitment to lift R&amp;D funding to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, yet taking a decade to get there and only bringing the UK into line with the OECD average - as opposed to where competitors such as the US and Germany already are. But there are factors from clustering that could also protect jobs and the economy should Britain crash out of the EU. There are lessons from huddling together for warmth. Stuart Hayes, a research scientist at Cancer Research UK, who works alongside AstraZeneca at the sprawling technology and biopharmaceutical campus of Granta Park, near Cambridge, said the benefits of clustering could help immunise the area from Brexit, to a degree. \u201cYou reach a critical mass of scientific knowledge that actually you have the ability to overcome barriers, obstacles and people\u2019s fears [about moving to the UK]. This is still the best place to work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fat-cat pay rows have never been confined to just the privatised industries, but the often lavish rewards handed out to bosses of the vital services sold off by successive governments seem to cause particular ire. Think back to Cedric the pig, the poor porker paraded at a British Gas annual meeting to protest against the 75% pay rise for Cedric Brown, who was chief executive. From water company directors to rail bosses, what were often monopoly businesses have consistently paid out remuneration packages that have left investors unimpressed. Even in these days of increased competition the trend continues. Just last week BT suffered the embarrassment of a 34.2% vote against its remuneration report, which included a \u00a32.3m pay packet for its outgoing chief executive, Gavin Patterson. On Thursday it will be the turn of Royal Mail to defend its pay policies to unhappy shareholders. In particular the business is under fire for the \u00a3640,000 base salary it is awarding to its new chief executive, Rico Back, which is 16.8% higher than the one given to predecessor Moya Greene. Two prominent investor advisory groups, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, have also taken issue with the planned termination bonus of \u00a3900,000 for Greene, who stepped down as chief executive last month and leaves the company in September. Glass Lewis said it could not support the improved deal given to Back: \u201cWe believe shareholders should question the appropriateness of the increase. In particular, we note that an increase to base salary has a compounding effect on the amount of short- and long-term incentives granted to an executive, since such awards are often granted as a fixed percentage of base salary.\u201d On the bonus for Greene, ISS said this was above the normal amounts given out by British businesses to departing executives. \u201cThe company\u2019s treatment of the former CEO\u2019s bonus is not considered to be on a cost-neutral basis for shareholders and the disclosures in previous years have fallen short of accurate representation on termination provisions that have now fallen due,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, one shareholder, Royal London Asset Management, said it would vote against the remuneration report: \u201cWe have serious concerns regarding the decision to appoint a new CEO on a salary substantially above that of their predecessor (16.8%) and that remuneration remains geared towards short- rather than long-term performance.\u201d In response Royal Mail said it was aware that executive remuneration was \u201ca sensitive issue in the current economic environment\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have sought to ensure that Rico Back and Moya Greene\u2019s overall fixed cash remuneration \u2013 their base salary, pension entitlements and benefits \u2013 are broadly the same. So, Rico Back\u2019s annual salary is higher than Moya Greene\u2019s to compensate for the halving of the cash pension allowance he would have received were this the same as the pension allowance Moya Greene received.\u201d It also defended the payout to the departing chief executive, saying: \u201cMoya Greene is an exceptional executive and we have made the right remuneration arrangements to reward the generation of shareholder value in the longer term and to honour our contractual obligations.\u201d Two days before shareholders have their say, the company is due to release a first-quarter trading update, which may make uncomfortable reading. George Salmon, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWith recent reports suggesting conditions in the UK postal market are set to remain tough, it\u2019s difficult to see where meaningful growth comes from. \u201cLetter volumes are expected to fall by between 4 and 6% this year. The combination of new data protection rules and ongoing business uncertainty means it\u2019s likely to be at the upper end of that range. Meanwhile labour costs are expected to weigh on margins in the international business and a highly competitive UK parcels business means pricing is tough. \u201cCost reduction will remain a key focus this year, but with the group only just preventing industrial action last Christmas, it looks like future savings might not be as easy to deliver.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Donald Trump\u2019s chief trade adviser went to Beijing in May with proposals to open up China\u2019s vast domestic market to American goods \u2013 and thereby reduce a ballooning trade deficit with China \u2013 the mission was declared a failure. Before Robert Lighthizer set off, the veteran rightwing economist told Congress: \u201cIt is not my objective to change the Chinese system. It seems to work for them \u2026 But I have to be in a position where the US can deal with it, where the US isn\u2019t the victim of it. And that\u2019s where our role is.\u201d Chinese officials wanted to appear flexible. They said China needed to protect domestic businesses from being crushed by foreign rivals, but agreed to loosen China\u2019s rules on foreign ownership. Lighthizer, who was accompanied by Trump\u2019s top team, including treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro, and new White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, deemed the offer insufficient. Two months later and the world is gripped by fears of an all-out trade war, with higher tariffs already levied, or about to be, on almost $1 trillion of goods traded between the US and China, the US and Europe, and the US and its partners inside the Nafta trade area, Canada and Mexico. It shows how tough Lighthizer believes the US needs to be to force Beijing into action. It shows how his boss is prepared to back him, even when corporate America is telling him the opposite. Chinese academics fear that Communist party officials have underestimated Trump and allowed a small problem to escalate out of control. After all, China has a trade surplus of around $340bn with the US and much more to lose. In that respect, the latest trade data is only making the US argument stronger: China\u2019s trade surplus with the US in June stood at a record $28.97bn. China\u2019s exports to the US climbed to $42.62bn, also a record high. On one level this isn\u2019t China\u2019s fault. The US economy is booming and sucking in imports left, right and centre. It is the single largest destination for exports for dozens of countries, including the UK. But there are more reasons for Lighthizer to fight hard. By most measures the dollar is overvalued in international currency markets, including against the yuan. It means Chinese goods are artificially cheap. China, to keep the wheels of its industry turning, has driven down the yuan after reversing its tight monetary policy. It has done this by telling banks to loosen their credit criteria and cut loan interest rates. This is going on while the Japanese continue to use their central bank to drive down the yen and Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank pumps money into the economies of the 19 eurozone countries with the clear side-effect of driving down the euro\u2019s value. From the White House, with the Federal Reserve around the corner doing the opposite of its foreign counterparts (it\u2019s increasing interest rates and reversing quantitative easing), it must seem like an uphill battle to make America Great Again. Yet Lighthizer\u2019s version of winning strangely ignores the feedback loop that comes from hurting your rivals. The economies of Europe, Japan and China are already slowing. Once trade tariffs begin to bite and exports to the US falter, world growth will slow further, in turn harming US exporters. Even if the US continues to import as much as it did before, rising import costs will jack up inflation and hit workers\u2019 living standards. But as the US midterm elections approach, this has been good politics for the Trump base. The economic fallout will come later \u2013 which means team Trump is playing a clever game. China, and the rest of the world, should be wary. The UK needs to get plugged in to creating a useful charging point network Who could have predicted the humble plug socket taking such a starring role in public debate? People ranging from ministers and government advisers to the National Grid and industry leaders weighed in last week on charging infrastructure for electric cars: how many, where, how fast, who pays, how smartly they will work. Transport secretary Chris Grayling, presenting the UK\u2019s plan for zero-emission cars, envisaged a \u201cmassive expansion of the plug-in network\u201d, helped by charging points in new lamp-posts. The government is even looking at requiring all new homes to have electric car chargers. Today, there are around 14,000 public charging points. The \u201crange anxiety\u201d felt by electric-car sceptics is somewhat negated by improving battery capacity and the fact that 95% of car journeys are less than 25 miles. Yet perception is important. For motorists contemplating a first switch to a plug-in car, the availability of charging points matters, even if in practice they end up mostly charging at work and home. And while the number of points is growing, and the entrance of players such as BP and Shell is welcome, there is a long way to go. Electric car drivers tell of faulty points, dedicated spaces blocked by conventional cars, and a fractured market requiring membership of multiple charging networks. This is important to more than just owners of plug-in cars. A proper nationwide network will offer a \u201cchance for the UK to get ahead\u201d, government advisers said last week. The national infrastructure commission reports that in the past the UK failed to adopt new infrastructure as quickly as other countries because of a lack of coordination, short-term interests, endless debate and delays. But it added: \u201cThis time can be different.\u201d In the Sky bidding war, it\u2019s heads Murdoch wins \u2013 and tails he wins too We learned last week that when Sky is sold, it will go for a princely sum, and Rupert Murdoch will benefit either way. The tussle is between Murdoch\u2019s Fox, trying to buy the 61% of Sky it does not own, and the US cable group Comcast, which is also trying to snap up Sky. Earlier last week, in a day of quickfire bidding, Murdoch upped his offer for Sky to \u00a314 a share. Within hours this was trumped by Comcast, offering \u00a314.75 a share, valuing the business at \u00a325.9bn. In the background is Disney, which has agreed to buy Fox and, ultimately, Sky. Whether Murdoch is a loser or a winner over Sky, with Comcast circling Fox as well, he will have no regrets whatever happens. In the UK, Sky\u2019s share price is running almost \u00a31 higher than Comcast\u2019s latest offer, which means investors believe there is more to come from Murdoch. Because Fox has a takeover agreement in place with Disney, Fox has to ask Disney\u2019s consent each time it makes a new bid for Sky. Disney, which has called Sky a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d, has agreed to pay the cost of any new Sky bid over \u00a313 a share. This means it will cost Disney just over \u00a31bn for each \u00a31 by which the bid is raised. There is a theory that Disney and Comcast could compromise to avoid a costly bidding war and agree to share the spoils, with the former taking most of the Fox assets, including its film studio, and the latter landing Sky. That said, many observers are still betting that the bidding war will go the distance, with analysts forecasting that a knockout blow will require a bid valuing Sky at more than \u00a331bn. When Murdoch was first interviewed about agreeing a deal to sell off most of Fox to Disney, he said Sky would be the asset he would be saddest to see go. Now, with his favourite business bound into an escalating bidding war, he\u2019s set to be saying goodbye with a smile on his face.",

People ranging from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-emissions-from-road-transport-road-to-zero-strategy\" title=\"\">ministers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nic.org.uk/publications/national-infrastructure-assessment-2018/\" title=\"\">government advisers</a> to the <a href=\"http://fes.nationalgrid.com/fes-document/\" title=\"\">National Grid</a> and industry leaders weighed in last week on charging infrastructure for electric cars: how many, where, how fast, who pays, how smartly they will work.</p> <p>Transport secretary Chris Grayling, presenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/09/hybrid-cars-to-be-exempt-from-2040-petrol-and-diesel-ban\" title=\"\">the UK\u2019s plan for zero-emission cars</a>, envisaged a \u201cmassive expansion of the plug-in network\u201d, helped by charging points in new lamp-posts. The government is even looking at requiring all new homes to have electric car chargers.</p> <p>Today, there are around 14,000 public charging points. The \u201crange anxiety\u201d felt by electric-car sceptics is somewhat negated by improving battery capacity and the fact that <a href=\"https://www.licencebureau.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/road-use-statistics.pdf\" title=\"\">95% of car journeys are less than 25 miles</a>. Yet perception is important. For motorists contemplating a first switch to a plug-in car, the availability of charging points matters, even if in practice they end up mostly charging at work and home.</p> <p>And while the number of points is growing, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/28/bp-buys-uks-biggest-electric-car-charger-network-for-130m\" title=\"\">the entrance of players such as BP and Shell</a> is welcome, there is a long way to go. Electric car drivers tell of faulty points, dedicated spaces blocked by conventional cars, and a fractured market requiring membership of multiple charging networks.</p> <p>This is important to more than just owners of plug-in cars. A proper nationwide network will offer a \u201cchance for the UK to get ahead\u201d, government advisers <a href=\"https://www.nic.org.uk/publications/national-infrastructure-assessment-2018/\" title=\"\">said last week</a>.</p> <p>The national infrastructure commission reports that in the past the UK failed to adopt new infrastructure as quickly as other countries because of a lack of coordination, short-term interests, endless debate and delays. But it added: \u201cThis time can be different.\u201d</p> <h2>In the Sky bidding war, it\u2019s heads Murdoch wins \u2013 and tails he wins too</h2> <p>We learned last week that when Sky is sold, it will go for a princely sum, and Rupert Murdoch will benefit either way. The tussle is between Murdoch\u2019s Fox, trying to buy the 61% of Sky it does not own, and the US cable group Comcast, which is also trying to snap up Sky.</p> <p>Earlier last week, in a day of quickfire bidding, Murdoch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/11/rupert-murdoch-ups-his-offer-for-takeover-of-sky-to-24bn\" title=\"\">upped his offer for Sky to \u00a314 a share</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/12/comcast-26bn-offer-sky-rupert-murdoch-bid\" title=\"\">Within hours this was trumped by Comcast, offering \u00a314.75 a share</a>, valuing the business at \u00a325.9bn.</p> <p>In the background is Disney, which has agreed to buy Fox and, ultimately, Sky. Whether Murdoch is a loser or a winner over Sky, with Comcast circling Fox as well, he will have no regrets whatever happens.</p> <p>In the UK, Sky\u2019s share price is running almost \u00a31 higher than Comcast\u2019s latest offer, which means investors believe there is more to come from Murdoch.</p> <p>Because Fox has a takeover agreement in place with Disney, Fox has to ask Disney\u2019s consent each time it makes a new bid for Sky. Disney, which has called Sky a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d, has agreed to pay the cost of any new Sky bid over \u00a313 a share. This means it will cost Disney just over \u00a31bn for each \u00a31 by which the bid is raised.</p> <p>There is a theory that Disney and Comcast could compromise to avoid a costly bidding war and agree to share the spoils, with the former taking most of the Fox assets, including its film studio, and the latter landing Sky. That said, many observers are still betting that the bidding war will go the distance, with analysts forecasting that a knockout blow will require a bid valuing Sky at more than \u00a331bn.</p> <p>When Murdoch was first interviewed about agreeing a deal to sell off most of Fox to Disney, he said Sky would be the asset he would be saddest to see go.</p> <p>Now, with his favourite business bound into an escalating bidding war, he\u2019s set to be saying goodbye with a smile on his face.</p>",
