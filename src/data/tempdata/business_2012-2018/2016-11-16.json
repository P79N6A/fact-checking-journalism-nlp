      "bodyText": "There is a lot of fake news around on social media these days, but there is a specific reason why we cannot be 100% certain that the owner of Snapchat has filed for an initial public offering (IPO), or flotation. Regulations in the US allow companies with revenues of less than $1bn (\u00a3800m) to keep the process private in its early stages. Snap, as the parent is called, falls into that category, thus the plan to go public has not been announced, merely hinted at. Hold on, you might say, if Snapchat isn\u2019t even bringing in $1bn-a-year in revenue how can it possibly be worth the rumoured $20bn-$25bn? Well, quite. This IPO takes us back to a world of hype in which heroic assumptions are made about a social media newcomer\u2019s ability to attract advertising dollars. Last time it was Twitter, which was going to be the next Facebook until it became clear it wasn\u2019t. Twitter\u2019s shares were priced at $26 at IPO in 2013, zoomed as high $70, but are now $19. The problem with Twitter as a vehicle for advertisers is exactly as predicted: unlike Facebook, the medium is fast and furious and users tend to resent commercial intrusions. Snapchat, which allows users to send disappearing messages from their smartphones, seems even less equipped to turn itself into an effective advertising billboard. Yet Wall Street seems similarly smitten by the statistic that Snapchat\u2019s has 150 million daily users. It makes no sense. This is a four-year-old company with modest revenues (an estimated $350m for 2016) that is still creating its business model. Maybe it will be worth $20bn-$25bn if it can overcome the challenges \u2013 but the valuation would be absurd today. Morrisons cosies up to Amazon It\u2019s a strange sort of \u201cexclusivity\u201d deal that allows you to jump into bed with whoever takes your fancy. But Morrisons insists its tie-up with Amazon doesn\u2019t infringe upon the contract it signed with Ocado. In the new \u201cMorrisons at Amazon\u201d operation, it is acting as a wholesaler supplying the US titan. By contrast, Morrisons is the customer in the arrangement whereby Ocado operates the morrisons.com website. Confused? One assumes David Potts, Morrisons chief executive, had his lawyers check every possible wrinkle before signing with Amazon. If he is indeed on solid ground, one can understand why Ocado\u2019s share price tumbled 8.5%. Life has become even trickier for the Hatfield-based technology whizzes. Ocado still relies on one big supplier, Waitrose, for goods for its own online operation; but Waitrose operates a competing service and shows occasional signs of having itchy feet. Now Morrisons, the only firm to pay to use Ocado\u2019s kit, is getting cuddly with Amazon. On the plus side, \u201cMorrisons at Amazon\u201d seems aimed primarily at commuters who can\u2019t be bothered to visit a shop on their way home and are willing to pay \u00a36.99 to have their evening grub delivered within the hour. On the other hand, there is a free same-day offer for those prepared to wait a little longer and the range of Morrisons goods runs to \u201cthousands\u201d of lines. That, potentially, is more dangerous from Ocado\u2019s point of view. It is a trial, confined to \u201cselected\u201d postcodes in London and Hertfordshire, so could yet fizzle out. But it will probably make it harder for Ocado to sell its services to those overseas retailers it has been wooing for ages. None has signed so far and now Morrisons has invented a new online model for supermarkets \u2013 being a wholesaler to Amazon. Mind you, Potts shouldn\u2019t spend too much time congratulating himself on his own cleverness. The point about being a wholesaler is that you can\u2019t dictate retail prices. If Amazon tries to undercut Morrisons on Morrisons-branded goods, he has a problem. There is also a moral for all supermarkets: the Amazonian beast is inventive and intends to hang around. RBS faces up to US Department for Justice If freelance diplomat Nigel Farage wants to make himself properly useful maybe he could have a word with his American chums about Royal Bank of Scotland. The US Department for Justice will hit RBS with a fine of $5bn-$12bn, or possibly more, says James Leigh-Pemberton, head of the body that oversees the state\u2019s stake in the bailed-out bank. The estimate tallies with the City\u2019s guess of the penalty for mis-selling mortgage securities in the pre-crisis years. Unfortunately, nobody\u2019s diplomacy will make any difference. The justice department operates to its own rules and RBS is towards the back of the queue of miscreant banks, probably the worst place to be.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is gaining powers to curb any lax lending in the fast growing buy-to-let mortgage sector, an area it has identified as posing a potential risk to the financial system. The Treasury is to give Threadneedle Street the ability to restrict the size of loan relative to the value of a property and also limit the size of loans relative to the amount of rent landlords receive to cover interest payments. It follows a consultation which was launched by the Treasury in December, at a time when the Bank was warning about the impact of the sector, because of concerns that landlords would be more likely to sell if they ran into payment difficulties; in turn, the markets could be flooded with properties and affect home buyers. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cIt is crucial that Britain\u2019s independent regulators have the tools they need to keep our financial system as safe as possible.\u201d The powers are technically being given to the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC), which was set up following the banking crisis to look for the large risks to financial stability. \u201cExpanding the number of tools at the financial policy committee\u2019s disposal will ensure that the buy-to-let sector can continue to make an important contribution to our economy, while allowing the regulator to address any potential risks to financial stability,\u201d Hammond said. The Bank is expected later this week to set out its ideas for how it might use its powers. It will be able to use the powers next year once legislation is approved by MPs and peers. It has already taken some action to curb the buy-to-let mortgage market, which has fuelled lending growth. In March the FPC set out measures intended to reduce the number of new buy-to-let mortgages by between 10% and 20% during 2018. The measures included requiring lenders to consider landlord costs associated with letting properties, including tax, and verifying incomes if earnings were to be used to support a loan. The Bank is also alert to tax changes, to see if they will have an impact. From 2017 tax relief for buy to let will be reduced to a flat rate of 20% compared with the current 40% or 45%, while an extra 3% has been added to stamp duty on buy-to-let purchases. Some lenders are already making changes to their borrowing terms. In June 2014, the Bank intervened in the residential mortgage market, barring lenders from granting more than 15% of their mortgages to customers needing to borrow four-and-half times their income.",

The bailed-out bank has not set aside any money for a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) over the mis-selling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) before the 2008 banking crisis. Uncertainty about the scale of the penalty is one of the reasons cited by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for abandoning any hope of further reducing the taxpayer stake, which currently stands at 73%. However, the chairman of UK Financial Investments laid out the possible financial impact of the looming fine at a hearing of the Treasury select committee on Wednesday. James Leigh-Pemberton pointed to negotiations under way between the DoJ and Deutsche Bank, which have started at $14bn. He said the RBS fine \u201cmight be $5bn, it might be $12bn\u201d. He added: \u201cBased on what happened to Deutsche Bank it could be more.\u201d He said the assessment of the fine was based on market estimates: analysts are expecting the bank to set aside between \u00a34.2bn and \u00a39bn of further provisions for RBS to cover fines and legal fees in the next three years. The bank has set aside \u00a33.8bn to cover other aspects of RMBS and billions more for other misdemeanours. RBS admitted in September that \u201cRMBS litigation and investigations may require additional provisions in future periods that in aggregate could be materially in excess of the [current] provisions\u201d. RBS shares fell 2% to 208p \u2013 below the 502p average price at which taxpayers bought the stake in 2008 and 2009 and below the 330p at which a 5% shareholding was sold in August 2015.",

      "bodyText": "With Wall Street falling back after several days of rises, investors were pausing for breath a week after Donald Trump\u2019s shock victory in the US election. The mixed picture from the UK employment data - jobless rate down, claimant count up - added to the uncertainty. But the pound held firm against the euro although it edged lower against a resurgent dollar. The US currency was boosted by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise interest rates next month, as well as the continuing expectation of a Trump spending boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The mood across most equity markets remains subdued, with modest losses being posted. Investors are evidently still cautious about the new [American] administration, with the steady drip of news relating to appointments and the like keeping the market in check. About the only thing still surging is the US dollar. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 43.02 points or 0.63% at 6749.72 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.66% to 10,663.87 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.78% at 4501.14 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.73% to 16,559.84 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.56% lower at 8638.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.44% to 592.26 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 73 points or 0.39%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Ahead of Italy\u2019s referendum next month, there is some unwelcome analysis from S&amp;P, which paints a fairly uninspiring picture of the prospects for the country\u2019s economy. It said: The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u201cOnly A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy\u201d). \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. Italy is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u201d said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u2019s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u2019s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth. \u201cIn the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u201cLooking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u201d Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering. After the American Petroleum Institute reported a higher than expected stock build last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration. The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase. Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose. But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u2019s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month. So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17. US president Barack Obama might be pushing for debt relief for Greece, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u2019s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting). Reuters reports: Germany on Wednesday opposed calls for debt relief for Greece after U.S. President Barack Obama offered support for such a mechanism for the recession-hit euro zone state during a trip to Athens. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said late on Tuesday granting Greece debt relief would do it a disservice. \u201cWhoever says \u2018we will relieve your debts\u2019 is doing Greece a disservice,\u201d the finance ministry confirmed Sch\u00e4uble as saying after the Passauer Neue Presse daily reported it. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s comments were not made directly in response to Obama, a finance ministry spokesman added. Athens signed up to a third economic bailout package of up to 86 billion euros last year but wants long-term debt restructuring to exit its crisis. Germany, which has long said there is no immediate need for debt relief for Greece as it would discourage much-needed structural reforms, said it noted the comments from Obama, who flies to Berlin later on Wednesday. \u201cWe have noted that President Obama has pointed to the importance of debt relief. The euro group agreed in May on a timetable on exactly that subject .. regarding measures for the short term, and later in 2018 for mid-term measures,\u201d said government spokesman Steffen Seibert at a news conference. In May, euro zone governments offered Greece debt relief in 2018 but left key details to be decided later in a compromise between Germany\u2019s tough stance and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s call for decisions immediately. A finance ministry spokesman said there was nothing new to say. \u201cOur position is unchanged. Obama\u2019s visit has not changed anything,\u201d he said at the government news conference. The prospect of higher US interest rates has brought an end to the rally which has seen leading US shares hit new heights. After rising for seven straight trading sessions in the run up and aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s shock US presidential election victory, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.3%. The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.25% while Nasdaq was 0.4% lower. Back with the UK, and the Bank of England\u2019s Jon Cunliffe has said recent currency movements had made setting interest rates move difficult. Reuters reports: Sterling\u2019s sharp fall since Britain voted to leave the European Union has made it harder to set monetary policy, BoE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Wednesday. Cunliffe said he fully backed the central bank\u2019s neutral stance regarding its next move in interest rates, as announced earlier this month, and its latest quarterly set of forecasts which see a modest slowdown next year. The British economy probably still needed interest rates to be negative in \u2018real\u2019 or inflation-adjusted terms, but the fall in sterling meant the BoE would not necessarily be able to stick to this, Cunliffe said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the University of Manchester. US industrial production figures have come in slightly worse than expected. It was unchanged in October compared to forecasts of a 0.2% increase. The September figure was revised down from a 0.1% rise to a 0.2% fall. On his final day in Greece, US president Barack Obama repeated his belief that debt relief was vital for the country. The Athens News Agency - Macedonian Press Agency reports: Speaking at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation on Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama once again highlighted the need for Greece\u2019s creditors to agree to debt relief, in accordance with the advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), noting that the country, and especially its young people, needed to see hope and a future. \u201cThe IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are to be sustained, people here need to see hope and they need to see progress.\u201d Young people, in particular, needed to know there is a future, there is an education, and jobs that were worthy of their potential, he added. Obama also had time for a tour of the Acropolis: And then it was off. Next stop: Berlin. Here\u2019s IHS Markit on the UK employment data: Over in Europe, and the latest on the draft budgets put forward by member states. Reuters reports: Italy and five other countries are at risk of breaking European Union budget discipline rules with their 2017 draft budgets, the European Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. The five other countries are Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, Slovenia and Finland. \u201cThe Draft Budgetary Plans of these Member States might result in a significant deviation from the adjustment paths toward the respective medium-term objective,\u201d the Commission said. The medium-term objective is a budget balanced in structural terms, which means excluding one-off spending and revenue and the effects of the business cycle. Italy\u2019s structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and economic cycle swings in income and spending, has been rising every year since 2014 and is to jump to 2.2 percent in 2017 from 1.6 percent in 2016 and then further to 2.4 percent in 2018, according to Commission forecasts last week. This goes clearly against EU rules which say that countries have to cut their structural deficit by at least 0.5 percent of GDP every year until they reach balance or surplus. Italy says the higher structural deficit is due to extraordinary spending on migration and post-earthquake reconstruction. But the structural deficit indicator does not take into account such one-off items and the Commission called the explanation \u201cnot constructive\u201d. On Wednesday, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici sounded more accommodating. \u201cThe significant part of the deviation is due to the cost of the seismic activity in the country, very serious this year and to migration inflows,\u201d Moscovici told a news conference. \u201cWe will take that into account,\u201d he said. The pound\u2019s renewed dip came after an early gain in the immediate aftermath of the UK unemployment figures. Chris Saint, Senior Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Service, said: Sterling has drifted lower against the euro and US dollar during European trading hours this morning, finding itself back around the \u20ac1.16 and US$1.24 levels by midday. There was some tentative support for the pound after today\u2019s UK labour market figures, but the gains were short-lived...On the face of it the headline numbers suggest the jobs market has remained buoyant in the first few months since the EU referendum, although the data probably does little to alter the Bank of England\u2019s future policy path at this stage as pay growth is still relatively contained. The stronger dollar has helped send the oil price lower, after a surge in crude on Tuesday. Talk of an informal meeting on Friday in Doha between oil producers to prepare plans for an output agreement later this month had sent crude soaring around 5% on Tuesday. But the dollar strength, along with news from the American Petroleum Institute that US crude stocks jumped by 3.6m barrels last week rather than showing the expected 1.5m rise, has send crude slipping lower again. Brent is down 1.13% at $46.42 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 1.2% lower at $45.23. The dollar continues to strengthen as the odds of a US interest rate rise next month continue to shorten. Federal Reserve board member James Bullard is the latest to back an increase, saying that unless there are any major shocks, rates will be hiked. Given how the market has reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in the US election, it is hard to know what major shock would upset the market at this point. But Bullard, who was in London as a UBS banking conference, added that a single rate rise might be enough to move monetary policy to a neutral setting. So the dollar index - against a basket of currencies - has hit a 14 year high of 100.52, while the pound is down 0.17% to $1.2431. Naeem Aslam at Think Markets said: The strength in the dollar index does represent a risk for the emerging markets and it can also eat into corporate profit for the US firms. The current move is also massively backed by bets that the Fed is going to raise the interest rate and odds are standing at 94%. It is important to keep in mind that come in December, it is the tone of the Fed for the future trajectory of the interest rate hike which is going to impact the dollar. And here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott\u2019s take on the figures: All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market performed in the first three months after the EU referendum. Unemployment has continued to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome. That said, the tone of next week\u2019s autumn statement will be that big challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National Statistics. UK unemployment falls to 11-year low Read more One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive people \u2013 those who have dropped out of the workforce \u2013 in the latest quarter. Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of unemployment in October. Here\u2019s our report on the UK jobs data. Phillip Inman writes: Unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain\u2019s employers have largely shrugged off the June Brexit vote. In the first health check of the labour market covering the three months since the referendum, official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the lowest since September 2005 and down from 4.9% in August and 5.3% a year earlier. Employment remained at a record high of 74.5% and annual wages rises, excluding bonuses, also nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. But the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had slowed dramatically. The full story is here: Britain\u2019s army of self-employed workers has swelled by over 4.5% in the last 12 months, which is a concern given recent revelations about life in the Gig economy. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that the self-employment total jumped by 213,000 in the last 12 months to 4.79 million, or 15.1% of all workers. In contrast, the number of employees rose by 256,000 to 26.82 million. These self-employed workers don\u2019t enjoy the benefits of employed workers, such as sickness and holiday pay and the minimum wage -- as was highlighted by protests by Deliveroo drivers and the successful court case brought by two Uber drivers. And figures released last month show that self-employed people are actually receiving less than 15 years ago [their pay is not included in the earnings figures]. The government has asked Matthew Taylor, a former top advisor to Tony Blair, to investigate the whole issue. Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, says Britain simply hasn\u2019t kept pace with the rise in self-employment. These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the social security system, such as on maternity pay. FSB is pleased with the announcement of the Taylor Review and we are looking forward to inputting into this.\u201d Over in parliament, Theresa May has hailed today\u2019s unemployment figures, at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. May argues: The unemployment figures show the strength of the fundamental of our economy The employment rate has never been higher, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest in a decade. May also reminded the Commons that search giant Google has just announced it will create 3,000 new jobs, as it builds a new HQ in Kings Cross. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage: Several economists are concerned that British pay packets will be gnawed by inflation next year. Today\u2019s labour market report shows that total pay rose by 2.3% over the last year, unchanged on a month earlier. That\u2019s more than inflation, which fell to 0.9% in October. But inflation is likely to jump to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Bank of England\u2019s latest forecasts, which would erode earnings growth. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, fears that bosses won\u2019t be able to provide inflation-busting pay rises: \u201cAnnual pay growth remained at 2.3% on a three-month average basis, suggesting that workers are in a weak position to offset what is likely to be a sizeable rise in inflation over the next year. Indeed, the capacity of employers to pay more will not be supported by continued weak productivity growth. Overall, prospects of the labour market taking a turn for the worse in the not-too distant future are looking more likely.\u201d TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is also worried that real pay growth is stalling, as inflation picks up \u201cReal pay growth is the slowest it\u2019s been since early 2015. Wages are not growing fast enough to withstand the rise in inflation expected next year. Without swift action from the government, working people could soon by paying the price for Brexit with another fall in living standards. The jobless rate in Wales has inched up to 4.4%, from 4.3% a month ago, due to a 3,000 increase in unemployment. But more encouragingly, 19,000 more people were in work than three months earlier. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones argues that the principality is outperforming the rest of the country. \u201cYear on year, Wales has outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to improvements in employment, unemployment and economic inactivity. \u201cUnemployment in Wales, at 4.4%, is lower than in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland and remains well below the UK average. Meanwhile the employment rate remains close to its record high, with 41,000 more people in work across Wales than at this same time last year. Unemployment amongst 18 to 24 year-olds in Wales is down 9.1% on the year and there are also 19,000 fewer people economically inactive than a year ago. This graph, from the BBC, shows how Wales jobless rate dipped to just 4.1% over the summer: Professor Geraint Johnes, director of research at The Work Foundation, has delved into the labour market report to find some interesting details: The labour market statistics indicate that the labour market remains remarkably stable. The rolling three month measure of unemployment shows a fall of some 37,000 over the most recent quarter, with the rate of unemployment now at 4.8%. The unemployment fall has been widely distributed across the country, though there were increases in both the North West and the East. For the UK as a whole, both full-time and part-time employee numbers increased by 31000. The large gains in employment have all been in the service sector \u2013 notably in the retail, hospitality and professional/scientific/technical areas. Britain\u2019s public sector has continued to shrink, to its smallest size in at least 17 years. Today\u2019s figures show that there were 5.33 million people employed in the public sector in June, 13,000 fewer than in March. That\u2019s the lowest since comparable records began in 1999 John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, also fears that unemployment will rise in 2017, even though there\u2019s no sign of a Brexit shock yet: \u201cUnemployment tends to be a lagging indicator, and we could yet see a modest rise in the jobless total next year as uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations dampens business investment and slows overall economic growth. But we do not expect the UK economy to go into recession, so would not expect any large increases in unemployment. Several City experts are concerned that the number of Britons signing on for unemployment benefit jumped by almost 10,000 last month. Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group says it\u2019s an \u2018early warning sign\u2019 of problems ahead. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that UK unemployment will rise in the next few months: The UK\u2019s labour market continues to surprise with its resilience to the Brexit shock. The unemployment rate fell unexpectedly to a new 11-year low of 4.8% in the three months to September. This is yet more evidence that the labour market and the wider economy have fared better than expected since June\u2019s referendum. However, there could be storm clouds gathering on the horizon. The claimant count \u2013 which in a quirk of the data is a more recent figure than the unemployment rate \u2013 jumped by 9,800 in October, with September\u2019s figure revised upwards from 700 to 5,600. All in all, it does seem likely that unemployment could tick up somewhat during the coming months, though dire predictions made in the immediate aftermath of the vote appear wide of the mark. David Cheetham of trading firm XTB.com is also concerned: The rise in the claimant count change - which is a fairer representation of the current environment as this data point covers the period until the end of last month - takes the shine off the good news at the very least and possibly even usurps it. In rising to 9.8k, this indicator came in at its highest level since November 2012 and when you also consider the upward revision of the prior print (to 5.6k from 0.7k) this could be taken as a warning sign that everything may not be quite as rosy as it appears for the labour market.\u201d ONS statistician David Freeman has sounded an important note of caution. He points out that employment growth is slowing; just 49,000 people found work in the July-September quarter, which is the slowest rate since March. \u201cUnemployment is at its lowest for more than ten years, and the employment rate remains at a record high. Nonetheless, there are signs that the labour market might be cooling, with employment growth slowing. Freedman also points out that there\u2019s no sign that the Brexit vote has cut the number of EU workers in Britain: \u201dThe Labour Force Survey also includes information on the nationality and country of birth of workers. That limited evidence suggests the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force. As this chart shows, the number of workers from other EU countries in Britain rose by 221,000 in the last year, to 2.26m, while the number of nationals from non-EU nations rose by 20,000 to 1.23 million. Employment minister Damian Hinds has hailed the news that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has hit its lowest rate since July to September 2005. Hinds says: \u201cYet again we have a strong set of figures, with employment continuing to run at a record high and unemployment falling to an 11-year low. \u201cGrowth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK labour market. \u201cThe measures we have taken have put our economy in a position of strength, and we will work to ensure more people can benefit from these opportunities as we build a country that works for everyone.\u201d Today\u2019s unemployment report shows that the number of people in work rose in the last quarter, and the number of people out of work fell. That kept the employment rate at a record high, but There were 31.80 million people in work, 49,000 more than for April to June 2016 and 461,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 23.24 million people working full-time, 350,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.56 million people working part-time, 110,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate was 74.5%, the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.60 million unemployed people, 37,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 146,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 4.8%, down from 5.3% for a year earlier and the lowest since July to September 2005. There were 803,300 people claiming unemployment-related benefits in October, up from 793,00 in September. Both men and women benefitted from the drop in unemployment, as this chart shows: There are now 876,000 men classed as unemployed men, 15,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 82,000 fewer than for a year earlier. And there are 728,000 unemployed women, 22,000 fewer than for April to June 2016 and 64,000 fewer than for a year earlier. We have a small, and welcome, rise in average earnings too. Average pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.4% annually in the July-September quarter, up from 2.3%. But pay including bonuses rose by 2.3%, matching last month\u2019s figures. The number of people signing on for unemployment benefit has jumped, by much more than economists expected. The claimant count rose by 9,800 in October, the ONS reports. And September\u2019s number has been revised up too; 5,600 people signed on for benefits, not the 700 first reported. Breaking: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8% in the three months to September. That\u2019s a new 11-year low, down from 4.9% a month earlier. More to follow... Barratt Development have sent a shiver through the UK property market this morning by revealing it has cut the price of some high-end London properties, worth over \u00a31m. Barratt CEO David Thomas told shareholders that. \u201cMarket conditions in London at higher selling prices remain more challenging. To mitigate these risks we have taken pricing action on a number of our sites in London.\u201d Thomas explains that prices have been cut by 5% to 10% on a few of its most expensive, centrally located London sites in zones one and two. The company has 385 sites in the UK, about 20 of which are in London, with six or seven classed as higher-end in the capital. The wider market, though, is still performing well since the Brexit vote, Barratt said, with \u201cconsumer demand is strong supported by good mortgage availability\u201d But the City isn\u2019t impressed; Barratt shares have fallen over 2% this morning, with rival builders Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey shedding over 1%. One of the big threats facing Britain\u2019s labour market is the risk that City banks start to shift operations across to Europe, following the EU referendum. So it\u2019s encouraging that Swiss bank UBS isn\u2019t poised to flee London. Chairman Axel Weber told a conference this morning that: \u201cWe are not planning to change anything any time soon and we will wait and see where the dust settles\u201d Weber (who used to run Germany\u2019s central bank) also predicted that the Brexit process will be volatile, with the key decisions only made at the climax of negotiations. Over in Athens, they\u2019re getting ready to welcome US president Barack Obama to the historic Acropolis site - by imposing a massive security clampdown in the area. Obama will then give a speech to the Greek people, which will probably cover Europe\u2019s migration crisis, and Greece\u2019s own financial crisis. Last night, there were clashes in Athens as groups of protestors demonstrated against Obama\u2019s visit: Ocado\u2019s share price is getting an early morning drubbing, down almost 5%. The online supermarket is suffering because Morrisons have just announced a new deal with Amazon, to deliver shopping to its Prime customers within two hours (in parts of London and Hertfordshire anyway). Morrisons\u2019 shares jumped over 1% at the open, with ETX analyst Neil Wilson calling it a \u201cpotential game-changing tie-up\u201d. It\u2019s pure profit for the supermarket - the scheme is \u201ccapital light\u201d and will contribute to a \u00a350m-\u00a3100m incremental profit opportunity outlined in the 2015/16 preliminary results. This is a big money-spinner for Morrisons and gives it a massive edge over Tesco and Sainsbury in the home delivery market. With prices being slashed and competition fierce, this is the kind of deal that will make a big difference to the bottom line. Retail analyst Mark Brumby says the service could be another blow to Ocado (which also has a delivery deal with Morrisons). There\u2019s no drama in the financial markets this morning. The pound is bobbing around the $1.247 mark this morning, up a measly 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 index has dipped by just 7 points to 6785. Everyone\u2019s waiting for the jobs report at 9.30am, says Conner Campbell of Spreadex, even though it may not be too dramatic Both the unemployment rate and wage growth readings are forecast to remain unchanged at 2.3% (though it could creep a bit higher to 2.4%) and 4.9% respectively; the jobless claims figure, on the other hand, is set to see a bit more movement, rising to 1,900 from the 700 seen the month previous. RBC Capital Markets believe Britain\u2019s unemployment rate may have actually fallen in the July-September quarter to 4.8%, a new 11-year low. That would cause much celebration on Downing Street, I\u2019m sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean that next year won\u2019t be tough, RBC say: The unemployment rate could actually fall this month to 4.8% from 4.9%. The headline rate is the average of the last three single-month estimates and with the last two months both printing at 4.7% it looks highly likely that we see a tick down by one-tenth. This does though feel more like a short-term quirk than reflective of the outlook where a more challenging macroeconomic outlook in 2017 should put some modest upward pressure on unemployment. Accordingly our expectation for the range of employment gains over the last three months is 60-100k as a central case. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale doesn\u2019t expect many fireworks at 9.30am, though, predicting that: We\u2019re looking for unemployment and wage growth both to be pretty unchanged, which wouldn\u2019t provide any obvious support for the pound. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s labour market has been surprisingly resilient to the shock of the EU referendum, with the unemployment rate remaining low but wage growth somewhat modest. So the big news this morning should be the latest jobs report, due at 9.30am. It will show if this trend continued into the Autumn, or if there are signs that Brexit is now hurting Economists predict that the unemployment rate remained at 4.9% in the three months to September. That would match last month\u2019s 11-year low, and reassure the City about the state of the UK economy. The more timely claimant count report is expected to show that 2,000 more people signed on for unemployment benefit in October; any rise might indicate that firms are starting to cut jobs. But the real story could come in the earnings figures. Average wages over the last year may have risen by 2.4% (both including and excluding bonuses), up from 2.3%. We saw yesterday that inflation has dipped to 0.9%, but economists still expect it to rise over 2% in 2017. If wages don\u2019t keep pace, households face another real wage squeeze soon. Also coming up.... Barack Obama is due to give a speech in Athens, and tour the Acropolis, as his final tour of Europe continues. Yesterday, the outgoing US president put more pressure on Greece\u2019s creditors to offer meaningful debt relief -- an issue which may not be top of his successor\u2019s agenda. And in the corporate world, we\u2019re getting results from housebuilder Barratt, engine-maker Rolls-Royce, commercial property firm British Land and City broker ICAP.",

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Italian economy is likely to achieve only slow growth of less than 1% of GDP per year over 2016-2018, say S&amp;P Global Ratings economists in a report published today (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/showArticlePage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;object_id=9865022&amp;rev_id=1&amp;elqTrackId=73388d9285554dad95048fb0523f625b&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Only A Modest Recovery In Sight For Italy</a>\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t expect the Italian economy to return to its pre-crisis output peak before the middle of the next decade because productivity remains very depressed. <a href=\"https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/entityPage.do?sp_mid=75191&amp;sp_rid=2071633&amp;entityId=107135&amp;elqTrackId=cd1e11bd9f4640f3ab243fd182183f9c&amp;elq=ff72ce07824e45c2bd22b179d4815176&amp;elqaid=75191&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=\">Italy</a> is the only European country not to have recorded any productivity gains since 2000,\u201d said Jean-Michel Six, Chief Economist for EMEA at S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p> <p>Despite a significant fall of the euro rate in 2014 and early 2015, Italy\u2019s real export performance has been lackluster and is lagging behind other eurozone countries. Italian real exports were 4% above their pre-crisis peak in the second quarter of 2016, which is still very modest compared to euro area partners that are 15%-25% above the pre-crisis peak. </p> <p>The lack of dynamism in productivity that could have lifted overall potential growth and boosted foreign competitiveness, remains Italy\u2019s major weakness, the report says. Competitiveness has suffered from a misalignment between stagnating productivity and rising wages, leading to a gradual appreciation of unit labor costs and of the real effective exchange rate. Labor market reform and attempts to address the high rate of nonperforming loans have yet to make significant progress in lifting growth.</p> <p>\u201cIn the short term, the uncertainty surrounding the referendum on the senate reform in early December is likely to weigh on the business climate, said Mr. Six. \u201cLooking ahead, the slow improvement in the labor market will support a modest rise in household consumption, while we expect investment to pick up gradually, albeit remaining highly vulnerable to setbacks.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582c7bc7e4b090fc812818b3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:48:14.506Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Oil volatile after stocks reports and Russian comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil prices continue to be volatile, coming under pressure after </strong><strong>more evidence of growing stockpiles but then recovering.</strong></p> <p>After the American Petroleum Institute reported <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf#block-582c569ce4b06ac41294e2cf\">a higher than expected stock build </a></strong>last week, comes a similar tale from the US Energy Information Administration.</p> <p>The EIA said crude stocks rose by 5.27m barrels last week to 490.28m, compared to forecasts of a 1.5m increase.</p> <p>Gasoline and distillate stocks - which were both forecast to fall - also rose.</p> <p>But after falling further on these figures, crude recovered after Russia\u2019s energy minister said he saw a big chance of Opec agreeing an output deal at its meeting at the end of the month.</p> <p>So Brent crude, which had fallen as low as $46.25 a barrel, is currently up 0.6% at $47.17.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:48:41.716Z\">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582c75d1e4b06ac41294e374\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-16T15:12:39.054Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany's Sch\u00e4uble dismisses Greek debt relief talk</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US president Barack Obama might be pushing for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/nov/16/uk-unemployment-rate-wage-growth-earnings-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b#block-582c6556e4b090fc8128181b\">debt relief for Greece</a></strong>, but unsurprisingly Germany disagrees (which should make Obama\u2019s upcoming meeting with Angela Merkel interesting).

      "bodyText": "Curious George must find a new home. The only shop dedicated to the mischievous fictional monkey is being booted out of its building at One JFK Street in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, forcing the children\u2019s book and toy store to look for a new home. Real estate investment trust Equity One bought the building last year, and has announced plans the gut the building. A stairwell will replace the current store, named the Only Curious George Store in the World, according to development plans obtained by the Guardian. Curious George is a mischievous fictional monkey in a children\u2019s book series originally written and illustrated by Margret and HA Rey. The creators of the now-famous series settled in Cambridge after fleeing Paris during Nazi occupation on bicycles with book manuscripts in their backpacks. Seven books were published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, beginning in 1941. The series later expanded after the deaths of the Reys, and has been made into a television series. Houghton Mifflin granted permission to friends of the Rey\u2019s to open a Curious George-themed bookstore in Harvard Square in 1995. After a brief closing in 2011, the store re-opened in April 2012, with new owners Adam and Jamie Hirsch, and with a new name: the World\u2019s Only Curious George Store. Some products are solely available at the store. The Hirsches would like the store to remain in Harvard Square, and are currently looking for a new space to rent out. \u201cThere is a cultural and deep-rooted connection between Cambridge and Curious George that we and other groups would like to see continued,\u201d Adam Hirsch said. The store attracts over 100,000 visitors a year, according to the Hirsches. The small corner store bustles with exuberant children, and a cashier makes room for a stroller behind the counter as a child pulls his mother toward a rack of toys. The classic books sit next to stuffed animals, hats and puppets. Hirsch said, \u201cIt puts smiles on everyone\u2019s faces of all ages. It\u2019s a place to escape for 20 minutes. It\u2019s linked to literacy, education and learning. People want to hold onto that.\u201d The store recently celebrated George\u2019s 75th birthday with a block party that drew over 1,000 attendees, according to Hirsch. Taped to a window overlooking the square is a colorful letter to Cambridge officials from eight-year-old Vanessa Tavares. Her family drives to Harvard Square from the South Shore to specifically visit the store. Her mother Jennifer Hagan said: \u201cI bought her first book there as a baby. We always go to the store when we\u2019re in Cambridge. She saw it on the news, and I told her, \u2018Honey, they might close the store,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Where are my markers?\u2019\u201d The building on JFK Street was owned by the Dow Family Trust for over 100 years, and was sold to Equity in fall 2015. Equity One representatives have not responded to repeated requests for comment. In the meantime, a petition has been signed by more than 5,000 customers and George enthusiasts, urging community members and Commission leaders to support the store in its transition. The Commission will hold a public hearing on 1 December, in which alterations to the property will be discussed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons has extended its relationship with Amazon, enabling customers to order their weekly grocery shop for delivery within an hour in London and Hertfordshire. The announcement of the new service for Amazon\u2019s Prime Now members sent shares in Ocado, the online grocery specialist which supports Morrisons\u2019 website, down by 8.5% at the end of the day. Morrisons began supplying goods from its central warehouse to Amazon in June and already offers thousands of products via the US company\u2019s Fresh grocery delivery service, which currently only operates in London. Under the Prime Now service, which will be called Morrisons at Amazon, orders will be picked at a local Morrisons store by the supermarket\u2019s staff then collected and delivered by Amazon either within one hour for \u00a36.99 or in a two-hour slot for free in selected areas of London and Hertfordshire. Mariangela Marseglia, the director of Prime Now EU, said the deal would add 10,000 items to its ultra-fast delivery service. David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cAs foodmaker and shopkeeper, we have unique skills to help build a broader new Morrisons through capital-light growth. Morrisons at Amazon is another exciting joint opportunity and makes Morrisons\u2019 good quality, great value-for-money products available to even more customers.\u201d He said the Amazon deal would contribute towards Morrisons\u2019 target of generating \u00a350m to \u00a3100m in additional profits from online, wholesaling, manufacturing and services. Morrisons shares closed down 1.5% on Wednesday, but improved trading since the arrival of Potts in March last year and canny wholesale deals with Amazon and petrol forecourts operator Motor Fuel Group have helped drive a 50% rise in the supermarket\u2019s share price this year. Earlier this month, the Bradford-based chain reported a 1.6% rise in sales, excluding fuel, at established stores for the 13 weeks to 30 October \u2013 well ahead of bigger rivals Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda. Ocado has handled the distribution network and IT behind Morrison\u2019s website since it launched in 2014. It delivers in north London and most of the rest of England but not East Anglia, the north-east or Scotland. This year the two companies agreed to jointly develop a new distribution centre in Erith, south London, and a new IT system to allow the supermarket to serve online shoppers from its stores. Both arrangements are intended to help Morrisons extend its delivery network as it tries to tap into the fast growing online market as shoppers switch away from traditional supermarkets. But the new Ocado warehouse will not open until 2018 and the store-picking system will not start being tested until next year. The agreement with Amazon gives Morrisons a headstart on delivering groceries from its stores, potentially boosting sales. While only available in limited locations initially, Amazon has a history of rolling out successful services relatively quickly. Prime Now launched in London in June 2015 and is now available Surrey, Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Portsmouth, South Yorkshire and Glasgow as well as parts of London and Hertfordshire. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this stage what the deal means for the prospect of in-store picking with Ocado, but it will certainly give Morrisons much better negotiation power in the discussions. It should also improve the bargaining position for any other retailer looking to sign a deal with Ocado.\u201d Ocado said it was making good progress with developing its new distribution centre in Erith and store pick model for Morrisons. \u201cAlthough we are not aware of the details, we have been assured by Morrisons that they acknowledge and respect the exclusivity provisions in our agreement, which oblige Morrisons to operate their online grocery business only through the Ocado arrangements,\u201d a spokesperson for Ocado said. Clive Black, at Morrisons\u2019 broker Shore Capital, said: \u201cWe believe this announcement suggests that Morrisons\u2019 initial experiences with Amazon (and vice versa) have been encouraging, whilst the store-based retailer\u2019s broader ambitions and capabilities online appear to be extending \u2026 If successful, it could also catapult Morrison\u2019s access to the convenience market where it has no physical presence.\u201d However, Monteyne said Morrisons would only be supplying Amazon via an extension of its wholesale agreement so the US company would be able to set prices. \u201cWithout being able to control pricing this puts a material risk on the Morrisons brand and the risk of Amazon undercutting Morrisons\u2019 offer,\u201d he said. Fast food revolution Morrisons\u2019 tie-up with Amazon brings it up to speed with the trend towards ever faster online grocery deliveries. Amazon kicked off the race last year when it launched Prime Now, a one-hour delivery service for frozen and chilled foods. Morrisons has now tapped into that service. Sainsbury\u2019s is the only other major grocery retailer to offer one-hour delivery. The London-based chain has developed an app called Chop Chop, through which shoppers can order up to 20 items to be delivered by bicycle. Ocado offers same-day delivery if time slots are available, while Tesco is testing same-day deliveries. Asda offers a same-day \u201cclick and collect\u201d service, but its fastest delivery arrives the day after ordering.",

      "bodyText": "Shell is to shift nearly 400 jobs overseas as it looks to shore up its finances against persistently low oil prices by hiring cheaper workers in the developing world. The Anglo-Dutch company told 380 staff at its finance operations in Glasgow that the office would be closed and they were facing \u201cinvoluntary severance\u201d. Scottish MPs said the announcement was a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to staff. The jobs will be moved over a 15-month period to locations such as Shell\u2019s offices in Chennai in India and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The overall effect on Shell\u2019s headcount will be negligible, although the firm has announced 12,500 job cuts since last year. Senior managers told staff of the looming cuts at the Bothwell Street office at a meeting on Wednesday. Speaking after the meeting, a Shell spokesperson said: \u201cFor Shell to remain competitive, difficult choices continue to have to be made to improve efficiency and value for money across all of our businesses and functions. Employees currently based in the Glasgow office will likely face involuntary severance.\u201d Shell signalled earlier this year that more staff could be affected, as it tries to trim costs as rock-bottom oil prices continue to dent profits. \u201cThis decision is driven by increasing pressures on our business to reduce cost and generate cash, and reflects the fact that the capability of our other centres has evolved to be able to handle the activities that are currently performed in Glasgow, but at a significantly lower cost,\u201d Shell said. \u201cWe understand this is very difficult news for employees. During the transition period we are committed to ensuring ongoing regular employee engagement and support.\u201d The Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesperson, Liam McArthur MSP, said: \u201cThis news will be a devastating blow to those directly affected and their families. We cannot afford to lose these skills and every effort must be made to provide training and advice to give workers the best chance to secure new roles. \u201cIt is also important that Scottish and UK governments look again at the tax regime and take urgent action to stop decommissioning contracts floating away from Scotland to our international competitors.\u201d Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative Glasgow MSP, said Shell\u2019s decision was \u201cregrettable\u201d. \u201cThe movement of jobs abroad is a challenging issue and it is as important as ever that both the UK and Scottish governments work together to ensure that things pick up in the future. The only silver lining to this story is that the announcement has been made over a year ahead of most employees leaving the company,\u201d she said. \u201cI would urge the Scottish government therefore to use this time, along with its agencies, to make sure the process of redundancy is made as comfortable as possible for the workers and their families.\u201d The Glasgow office is part of a division that manages financial reporting, corporate governance risk and travel and expenditure.",

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport select committee said it had heard \u201cdisturbing\u201d evidence about the close relationship between touts and ticket resale websites during an evidence session this week. The committee said it believed a fuller investigation into the whole area of ticketing was needed. \u201cThe committee intends to write to the secretary of state urging her to study the submitted evidence regarding the under-reporting of income by known touts, and to raise this with HMRC as an area which warrants their investigation.\u201d It said evidence from security consultant Reg Walker, who said touts\u2019 company accounts often did not match up to the sales they made via secondary websites such as StubHub and Viagogo, suggested a tax inquiry was also needed. A spokesman for FanFair Alliance, which campaigns against ticketing abuse, said: \u201cThis is fantastic news for all UK music fans and those who have campaigned so long for action. \u201cThe dysfunctional market and bad practices of the big four secondary ticketing websites were laid bare before members of the culture, media and sport committee. We anticipate that a fuller investigation of this market will lead to much-needed reform. \u201cThe FanFair Alliance fully supports further actions into the fraudulent activities of online ticket touts and the industrial abuse of this market, as well as an amendment to the digital economy bill to ban the misuse of bots.\u201d The committee initially intended to look into touts\u2019 use of automated software known as \u201cbots\u201d to harvest tickets at the expense of genuine fans, in order to make a profit by reselling them at a mark-up. But it said the evidence session, which included allegations that ticket firms were colluding with touts, had convinced committee members that a broader investigation was needed. \u201cThe evidence session \u2026 has shed a light on much more far-ranging and disturbing factors in the market, including clear indications of too close relationships between those selling tickets on the primary market and sellers on the secondary market,\u201d said the committee. \u201cWitnesses\u2019 failure to give satisfactory answers to the committee\u2019s questions about where companies\u2019 main profits are made, the possibility of even Chinese walls between parts of the same company, and the willingness of the ticket selling companies to even try to identify, let alone bar, large-scale ticket touts and fraudulent sellers have led us to conclude that a fuller investigation of the whole area of ticketing is needed.\u201d Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, plans to chair a round table discussion about ticket abuse this month, while the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is due to conclude its investigation into whether ticket touts are breaking consumer protection laws. In the meantime, the committee will recommend the use of bots be banned, weeks after member Nigel Adams, MP for Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire, proposed that touts who used them should face prison sentences. The committee said it would decide how to proceed after the CMA\u2019s report had been published.",

    "webTitle": "Barratt cuts price of \u00a31m-plus London homes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders has started cutting prices on some of its most expensive London homes because of waning demand at the top end of the market. Barratt Developments said that although overall market conditions were healthy, it was proving more difficult to sell homes priced above \u00a31m in the capital because of too much supply. David Thomas, Barratt\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cMarket conditions in London at higher selling prices remain more challenging. To mitigate these risks we have taken pricing action on a number of our sites in London.\u201d Activity at the top end of the London housing market has fallen since the then chancellor, George Osborne, overhauled stamp duty in December 2014. Buyers have been deterred by the higher upfront costs of homes priced at more than \u00a3936,000, and sentiment has not been helped by the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Recently, estate agent Strutt &amp; Parker reported that the number of sales in prime parts of central London had fallen by 47% between the summers of 2015 and 2016. Barratt has 385 sites in the UK, about 20 of which are in London, with six or seven classed as higher-end in the capital. Thomas said the company was lowering prices by about 5% to 10% on a few of its most expensive, centrally located London sites in zones one and two. He said that in another move to \u201cde-risk\u201d its London portfolio, Barratt had exchanged on a \u201cbuild and sale\u201d agreement, selling a whole development of 39 apartments for \u00a347m. Under such an arrangement, a housebuilder would sell at a reduced price, but avoid the cost and uncertainty of running show homes and offices from the new development. In a trading update for the period between 1 July and 13 November, Thomas said that more broadly the Brexit vote had not dampened consumer demand for new homes, largely because of good mortgage availability and a national housing shortage. \u201cThis has been another good trading period for the group. Consumer demand is strongly supported by good mortgage availability. We are mindful of the potential for economic uncertainty created by the outcome of the EU referendum. However, market fundamentals are robust, and we remain a housebuilder of choice.\u201d Forward sales over the period rose by 4.3% to \u00a32.56bn, which was equal to 11,733 plots. Barratt said sales rates were weaker in London compared with the same point last year, but were strongly up in the northern and central regions. The housebuilder said it had taken a cautious approach in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, buying fewer sites than usual for the time of year, but it was on track to meet its full-year targets for land ownership. Earlier in November, rival builder Persimmon said it had seen \u201cencouraging\u201d trading since the referendum and activity had risen in autumn, but added that uncertainty after the Brexit vote had made it cautious about purchasing new land. Thomas said Barratt was taking a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach following the referendum. \u201c[The UK is] not building enough homes, so there is an opportunity for us to increase building and housing supply,\u201d he added. Some developers have offered incentives to buyers of prime London flats, with Barratt meeting stamp duty costs on some of its high-end properties, and giving rental guarantees to investors. Barratt shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, dropping about 3% to 469p. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the tone of the group\u2019s trading update remained positive, but noted its concerns over the London market. The capital \u201cis particularly exposed to any damage a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 could cause, and high prices mean that the government\u2019s support [help to buy] is less of a factor,\u201d Salmon said. Henry Pryor, a buying agent for wealthy clients, said he was receiving calls from agents and developers \u201coffering to help me and my clients \u2018take advantage of some spectacular deals\u2019.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Christmas sales have come early this year,\u201d he said. \u201cDevelopers of new-build properties have momentum, they have stock that will be ready come what may and they will be thinking very hard now about what they can do other than to slash the price.\u201d",

To mitigate these risks we have taken pricing action on a number of our sites in London.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/14/taylor-wimpey-housing-demand-still-strong-after-brexit-vote\">Taylor Wimpey: housing demand still strong after Brexit vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Activity at the top end of the London housing market has fallen since the then chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/03/george-osborne-stamp-duty-reform-key-facts-autumn-statement\">George Osborne, overhauled stamp duty in December 2014</a>. </p> <p>Buyers have been deterred by the higher upfront costs of homes priced at more than \u00a3936,000, and sentiment has not been helped by the uncertainty surrounding the UK\u2019s Brexit vote. Recently, estate agent Strutt &amp; Parker reported that the number of sales in prime parts of central London had fallen by 47% between the summers of 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>Barratt has 385 sites in the UK, about 20 of which are in London, with six or seven classed as higher-end in the capital. Thomas said the company was lowering prices by about 5% to 10% on a few of its most expensive, centrally located London sites in zones one and two.<br></p> <p>He said that in another move to \u201cde-risk\u201d its London portfolio, Barratt had exchanged on a \u201cbuild and sale\u201d agreement, selling a whole development of 39 apartments for \u00a347m. Under such an arrangement, a housebuilder would sell at a reduced price, but avoid the cost and uncertainty of running show homes and offices from the new development.</p> <p>In a trading update for the period between 1 July and 13 November, Thomas said that more broadly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit vote</a> had not dampened consumer demand for new homes, largely because of good mortgage availability and a national housing shortage.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been another good trading period for the group. Consumer demand is strongly supported by good mortgage availability. We are mindful of the potential for economic uncertainty created by the outcome of the EU referendum. However, market fundamentals are robust, and we remain a housebuilder of choice.\u201d</p> <p>Forward sales over the period rose by 4.3% to \u00a32.56bn, which was equal to 11,733 plots. Barratt said sales rates were weaker in London compared with the same point last year, but were strongly up in the northern and central regions.</p> <p>The housebuilder said it had taken a cautious approach in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, buying fewer sites than usual for the time of year, but it was on track to meet its full-year targets for land ownership.</p> <p>Earlier in November, rival builder Persimmon said it had seen \u201cencouraging\u201d trading since the referendum and activity had risen in autumn, but added that uncertainty after the Brexit vote had made it cautious about purchasing new land.</p> <p>Thomas said Barratt was taking a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach following the referendum. \u201c[The UK is] not building enough homes, so there is an opportunity for us to increase building and housing supply,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Some developers have offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/17/housing-market-london-developers-incentives-buyers-free-tube-travel\">incentives to buyers of prime London flats</a>, with Barratt meeting stamp duty costs on some of its high-end properties, and giving rental guarantees to investors.</p> <p>Barratt shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, dropping about 3% to 469p. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the tone of the group\u2019s trading update remained positive, but noted its concerns over the London market. <br></p> <p>The capital \u201cis particularly exposed to any damage a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 could cause, and high prices mean that the government\u2019s support [help to buy] is less of a factor,\u201d Salmon said.</p> <p>Henry Pryor, a buying agent for wealthy clients, said he was receiving calls from agents and developers \u201coffering to help me and my clients \u2018take advantage of some spectacular deals\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if the Christmas sales have come early this year,\u201d he said. \u201cDevelopers of new-build properties have momentum, they have stock that will be ready come what may and they will be thinking very hard now about what they can do other than to slash the price.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 11 years in September in a further indication that Britain\u2019s employers have largely shrugged off the Brexit vote. Official figures show the unemployment rate was 4.8%, the lowest since September 2005 and down from 4.9% in August and 5.3% a year earlier. The fall in unemployment by 37,000 from the previous quarter to 1.6 million people was held up by the employment minister, Damian Hinds, as the mark of a strong labour market in the wake of the EU referendum. He also welcomed the employment rate, which remained at a record high of 74.5%, and figures showing that annual wage rises, excluding bonuses, nudged higher to 2.4% from 2.3% in August and 2.1% in July. \u201cGrowth is being fuelled by full-time professional jobs while wages are continuing to perform strongly, which underlines the resilience of the UK labour market,\u201d he said. But figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the claimant count in October jumped by its highest number since May, and analysts warned that the rate at which employers were taking on new workers had slowed dramatically. Employment growth dropped to 49,000 in the three months to September from 106,000 in August and 173,000 in the three months to July, while the claimant count jumped by almost 10,000 to 803,300. The figures for the three months to September are the first health check of the labour market where all the data applies to the period following the referendum. The Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and Paris-based thinktank the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) had all predicted that a UK vote to leave the EU would take its toll on employers and push up unemployment. Most forecasters now expect GDP growth to slow and inflation to rise in the coming months, overtaking wage rises and threatening the living standards of most workers during 2017. The Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke said: \u201cOur only hope is that wage inflation will rise in tandem with inflation. However, I suspect that given the leads and lags, wages will not rise quickly enough to offset the squeeze to real incomes in 2017.\u201d John Philpott, the director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said that while the post-Brexit period had proved calmer than many had previously thought, the prospect of leaving the EU was unlikely to aid productivity growth, which remains stuck at 0.4%. \u201cWhen higher price inflation is also in the pipeline, even a strong labour market may struggle to deliver sustained real wage improvements for most UK workers.\u201d The only compensation for mortgage borrowers will be that interest rates remain low. Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor, Sir Jon Cunliffe, said Threadneedle Street was likely to \u201clook through\u201d rises in inflation next year if they are driven mainly by the post-Brexit fall in sterling. In a speech at Manchester University, he said global forces were keeping general inflationary pressures near zero, which meant central banks would be forced to keep interest rates lower for longer. The Federation of Small Businesses said the continuing rise in self-employment was another indication of the shift to insecure employment and the increasingly fragile state of the labour market. The number of self-employed people has increased by 213,000 since the same time last year to reach 15.1% of those in work. Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, said: \u201cThe UK has so far failed to keep pace with the rapid rise of self-employment. These figures are another signal that more needs to be done to support the self-employed, including on developing a clear legal definition of self-employment and on issues like access to mortgages and income protection, and addressing the discrepancies between the self-employed and employees in the social security system, such as on maternity pay.\u201d Independent thinktank Fathom Consulting said the uncertainty generated by the Brexit vote \u201cwill go on for months, if not years\u201d, hitting business investment first, and resulting in greater job losses. ONS statistician David Freeman said the slowdown in employment growth showed the labour market \u201cmight be cooling\u201d. He added that the limited information on the flow of foreign workers \u201csuggests the referendum outcome and subsequent devaluation of sterling has had little impact so far on the number of EU workers in the UK labour force\u201d.",

The UK engine maker said the short-term outlook in some markets was tough but that it was on track to meet forecasts for annual profit. Cost savings for the year will be about \u00a3200m, the high end of its guidance, it said in a trading update. The Derby-based engineering company is one year into an overhaul under its chief executive, Warren East, after a slowdown in some of its biggest markets prompted repeated warnings about financial performance. East, who took over in July 2015 and previously ran ARM Holdings, has cut layers of management and reorganised the business after finding what he said was a lumbering company too slow to react to market demands. East said: \u201cWe have made significant progress over the last 12 months implementing the findings of our operating review, including key changes to the management and structure of our company. \u201cAt the same time, we are taking actions that are adding pace and simplicity to our processes. It is now time to look further ahead. Together with my new team, our focus is turning towards the group\u2019s long-term goals.\u201d For more than two decades Rolls was a symbol of British manufacturing excellence as one of the world\u2019s top makers of engines for aircraft, ships and industrial use. But it published five profit warnings in 18 months from early 2014, including two under East as he got to grips with the business. The company\u2019s problems included falling oil prices, which cut sales at its marine division, and weaker demand for some aircraft engines, including for corporate jets. East concluded the company had become bureaucratic and bloated, making it vulnerable to slowing sales and too slow to pick up on customers\u2019 demands. In the trading update, East said Rolls-Royce\u2019s long-term order book was close to record levels but that markets in the short run were mixed, with difficult trading persisting in some. Demand for engines for extra-wide-body civil aircraft was strong, but there was further weakening in business aviation and no sign of recovery in offshore oil and gas markets for marine, where orders were \u201cvery weak\u201d. East said: \u201cWe have an outstanding portfolio of businesses with highly differentiated products and services that, with appropriate investment, are well positioned to create significant value long into the future, despite some near-term market-led challenges.\u201d East has promised to rid Rolls-Royce of the \u201caccounting fog\u201d that made the company impenetrable to analysts and investors by making recording of TotalCare servicing contracts and research and development costs clearer. Rolls-Royce said applying a new accounting standard to its 2015 results would have knocked \u00a3700m off operating profit and revenue at its civil aerospace division. The adjustments included recording payments for after-sales servicing of engines when the work was done instead of upfront.

      "bodyText": "All things considered, the government will be happy with how the labour market performed in the first three months after the EU referendum. Unemployment has continued to fall and at 4.8% of the workforce is at its lowest level for 11 years. Employment has continued to rise and there are plenty of jobs to be had. Ministers would not have expected anything better than that in the turbulent post-Brexit weeks and would have feared a much worse outcome. That said, the tone of next week\u2019s autumn statement will be that big challenges for the economy remain, and there are hints of possible trouble ahead from the latest labour market data from the Office for National Statistics. One warning sign is the 49,000 increase in the number of economically inactive people \u2013 those who have dropped out of the workforce \u2013 in the latest quarter. Another is the rise of almost 10,000 in the claimant count measure of unemployment in October. The claimant count is by no means a perfect measure of joblessness since it only picks up those who are unemployed and eligible for certain state benefits. That\u2019s why more attention is normally paid to the labour force survey measure, based on an internationally agreed methodology, and considered to be a more reliable yardstick. But the claimant count is a more timely measure and it does come into its own when there are turning points in the labour market, picking up developments before the labour force survey. Some economists believe the economy has arrived \u2013 or will soon arrive \u2013 at one such turning point. The Bank of England certainly thinks so. It is forecasting the unemployment rate to rise to 5.5% by the middle of 2018 and remain at that level throughout 2019. There are reasons for believing that the current state of the labour market is as good as it gets for a while. Private investment is unlikely to be strong while the government negotiates Brexit, while consumer spending is going to be hit as the cost of living rate catches up with the rate of earnings growth. For the past few years, the unusually low annual inflation rate has meant solid real income rises. It might be wondered why the Bank is predicting a relatively small increase in unemployment, but that\u2019s because policy will remain supportive of jobs. Interest rates will remain at rock bottom levels and there will be modest steps in the autumn statement to boost demand.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not often the water sector causes many ripples of excitement, but Severn Trent is bucking a downbeat trend after it unveiled an agreed takeover deal. It is buying Dee Valley Group, a neighbouring business which operates in Wrexham and Chester, for \u00a378.5m or \u00a317.05 a share. Dee Valley, which has been supplying water for 150 years, has 125,000 customers in northeast Wales and northwest Cheshire. Severn chief executive Liv Garfield said: [This] represents an opportunity for Severn Trent to apply its successful operating model for the benefit of customers across an enlarged asset base. Dee Valley chairman Jon Schofield said: We believe the acquisition provides attractive value to Dee Valley shareholders. Severn Trent shares are up 51p at \u00a321.90 on the news. The sector has also benefitted from Citigroup raising its recommendation to neutral on Severn, Pennon, 15p better at 791p, and United Utilities, up 7.5p at 883p. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 11.01 points at 6781.73 as investors pause for breath again, and the UK jobless rate falls to an 11 year low but benefit claims rise. Rolls-Royce is leading the fallers, down 26p at 728.5p after the aero engine maker said it aimed to deliver cost savings at the top end of its guided \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m range to cope with mixed markets. It also announced more details of a change in accounting policy. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Five profit warnings in the 20 months up to November 2015 means Rolls-Royce shareholders have had anything but a smooth ride recently. Over this time, the group\u2019s credibility took a pasting and its accounting policies were widely criticised. For example, Rolls previously accounted for aftermarket revenues, the maintenance and service work done after the engines are initially sold, upfront. But when customers started to retire old planes rather than have existing ones serviced, much of that cash never materialised. The new accounting policies mean that last year\u2019s profits will be restated, and adjusted down by \u00a3900m. However, that doesn\u2019t affect what is actually coming in to the group\u2019s coffers, only when it\u2019s accounted for. The new system should mean greater clarity moving forward. Operationally, the group is undergoing some major restructures. Investors will hope that it emerges as a leaner and more transparent company. However, the road ahead could be a long one, and as Rolls-Royce has found, it is best not to count any chickens before they have hatched. Barratt Developments has fallen 12.5p to 470.4p after the housebuilder\u2019s latest update showed it cutting London prices at the top end of the market. Among the mid-caps B&amp;M European Value Retail continues to rise following Tuesday\u2019s update, adding 10.9p to 255.9p as Jefferies moved from hold to buy with a 285p target. It said: We believe B&amp;M\u2019s 33% share price fall since peak provides a buying opportunity. We think B&amp;M is well positioned for a tough UK consumer environment and Jefferies\u2019 latest consumer survey results support our view that B&amp;M can gain market share and maintain resilient margins. But Ocado has dropped 19.1p to 263.1p as one of its partners Morrisons unveiled an increased deal with Amazon. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein said: It\u2019s unclear at this stage what the deal means for the prospect of in-store picking with Ocado but it will certainly give Morrisons much better negotiation power in the discussions. It should also improve the bargaining position any other retailer looking to sign a deal with Ocado.",

      "bodyText": "The world could face an oil supply shortage by the end of the decade, triggering large swings in the price of the commodity, the International Energy Agency has warned. In its annual publication World Energy Outlook, detailing expectations for global energy trends, the IEA warned that the recent low price of oil could have serious ramifications within years. A barrel of Brent crude has more than halved in price since early 2014 from $112 (\u00a390) to around $44 in mid-November this year, having fallen to $32 earlier in the year amid oversupply. The IEA said this was deterring oil companies from investing in new oilfields, a trend it said could turn the global oil glut into a supply shortage within years. Between 2000 and 2014, oil companies approved an average of $15bn of new projects a year but that figure fell to just $6.5bn last year, a level not seen since the 1950s. \u201cAs things stand, two years of low approvals is manageable but what we warn about is if investment stays low in 2017,\u201d said Tim Gould, one of the report\u2019s authors. He said the drop-off in investment would be felt in a few years\u2019 time, when projects that never got off the ground due to the low oil price would otherwise have come to fruition. \u201cAn unprecedented effort would be required to make up lost ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking now about a gap towards the end of the decade and in the 2020s.\u201d The oil price has fallen again in the past month, as the Opec group of oil-producing countries struggles to reach agreement on limiting production. But the IEA said any future supply shortage would force the price of oil up again, triggering instability in global oil markets. \u201cWithout a pickup in investment, or a slowdown in demand, the stage may be being set for the next boom and bust cycle for oil,\u201d its report said. While an oil shortage might seem like good news for environmental campaigners, the IEA warned this may not be the case. \u201cSupply shortfalls, and any accompanying price instability, would undoubtedly complicate the transition towards a lower carbon, more sustainable, global energy system.\u201d But it said low oil prices had accelerated the decline in fossil fuel subsidies, as governments had less need to spend taxpayers\u2019 money to keep fuel costs down. Fossil fuel subsidies slumped from $500bn in 2014 to $325bn last year, compared with subsidies for renewable energy, which reached $150bn. The IEA issued a range of long-term predictions on the oil price, depending on how quickly the world adopts low-carbon policies. If countries do not implement new green policies, a barrel of Brent crude could rise to $150 by 2040, it predicted, whereas a huge investment in renewables could see it limited to $80.

      "bodyText": "Shoppers are being warned that Black Friday deals might not live up to the hype, after an investigation found that many products promoted as being \u201con sale\u201d last year were actually cheaper before or after the event. Currys and AO are singled out by Which?, the consumer group, which claims they may have broken government guidelines by inflating the \u201cwas\u201d price to make promotions look more appetising. \u201cConsumers should be wary of claims of massive savings this Black Friday as they may not be as spectacular as they seem,\u201d said Pete Moorey, the head of campaigns at Which?. \u201cShoppers might be surprised to learn that only half of Black Friday deals are actually cheapest on Black Friday.\u201d Which? investigated 178 deals from Black Friday 2015 tracking the daily price moves of 20 popular electrical gadgets on Amazon, AO, Argos, Currys and John Lewis for three months before and two months after Black Friday. They found that only 90 deals were cheapest on Black Friday. A Currys promise of a \u00a3101 saving on a Samsung TV was not as good as it looked, as the \u00a3748 price tag was only a pound less than on the eve of Black Friday and it had been on promotion at \u00a3699 in September. AO trumpeted a \u00a3200 saving on a Vax vacuum cleaner at \u00a399, yet it had been on sale for \u00a369 the previous day and on average for \u00a396.50 in the three months leading up to Black Friday. Amazon introduced Black Friday discounts to Britain in 2010 but the event is now a fixture of the retail sales calendar with Currys, John Lewis and Argos key players in an event increasingly focused on aggressively discounted electronics and domestic appliances. For many the last weekend of November coincides with the last pay day before Christmas, and analysts at PwC predict Britons will spend \u00a32.9bn over the four days starting on 25 November, up from \u00a32.1bn in 2015. Initially Black Friday, which always falls after the US Thanksgiving holiday, was a 24-hour sale but this year it has been stretched over nearly a fortnight with Amazon starting its event on Monday, offering up to 50% off thousands of products ranging from 70in TVs to cordless screwdrivers and advent calendars. When promoting a discount the \u201cwas\u201d price is supposed to be the most recent price the item has been sold at for 28 consecutive days or more. Which? said it found numerous examples where it thinks AO and Currys were not following the government\u2019s pricing practices guidance (PPG) by using an older, higher \u201cwas\u201d price. Black Friday has been Currys biggest trading day for the past three years. The retailer, which is part of the group that owns PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said it \u201cfundamentally disagreed\u201d with the approach taken by Which?. \u201cWe comply fully with the PPG guidelines, displaying a clear date from when the \u2018was\u2019 price was taken, allowing customers to make a fully informed decision. Currys offered thousands of deals on leading brands over Black Friday in 2015 and this year\u2019s event is set to be even bigger.\u201d An AO spokesperson said: \u201cThe internet is the most transparent marketplace ever created for consumers to be able to compare price and service associated with it and we work hard to be exceptional on both fronts. This has been recognised many times by Which? themselves. \u201cWe work hard to ensure that any promotions we make are clear and take our obligations to consumers very seriously. \u201cThe sheer scale of Black Friday\u2019s great offers means that these are planned up to 12 months in advance to maximise the value and service for our customers. That demands significant planning for a very fluid trading environment across hundreds of offers and we are always focused on offering the best price match promise all year and especially around Black Friday.\u201d",

Workers at the Ritzy in Brixton and the Hackney Picturehouse, both in London, are planning strikes to coincide with screenings of the Potter spinoff film between Thursday this week and Monday next week as the latest move in a campaign for the independently verified living wage. Kiv Legate, from the Ritzy cinema, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s strike has now been going on for over six weeks with five strike days to date. Picturehouse strikers from the Ritzy cinema and Hackney Picturehouse, along with our union Bectu are being ignored by Cineworld and Picturehouse management, leaving workers with no alternative option but to intensify our action. We welcome a meaningful return to the negotiation table by Cineworld CEO Mooky Greidinger, and urge the company to accept Acas\u2019s invite to settle the dispute once and for all.\u201d The workers say Picturehouse reneged on a promise, made after protests two years ago, to progress towards payment of the independently calculated London living wage, which now stands at \u00a39.75 an hour. The pay rate, based on the amount needed to meet basic living costs, is considerably more than the government-backed legal minimum of \u00a37.20 an hour for over 25s known as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. In 2014 Ritzy workers campaigned to secure the London living wage but instead won a stepped 26% pay rise, which was less than they demanded. Cinema staff, most of whom are on zero-hours contracts, are paid \u00a39.10 an hour which they say is not enough to live on in the capital. At the Ritzy, workers get regular shifts although these are not guaranteed by their contracts. Staff who have worked less than a year do not get company sick pay. Longer term employees only get sick pay if they have been off work for eight days. Workers want sick pay for all staff from the first day they are off ill. The pressure for a pay rise comes as Cineworld, the owner of the Picturehouse group, revealed an 8.4% rise in UK and Irish revenues in the 45 weeks to 10 November. The company described Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which opens in the UK on 18 November, as one of two remaining major releases of the year alongside Star Wars: Rogue One, which opens in the UK on 15 December. The appeal of the boutique cinema chains has been tarnished by rows over the use of zero-hours contracts and low pay. Film fans have criticised poor pay and conditions when they are paying \u00a313 or more to watch a film. After protests in 2014, the Curzon chain agreed to pay the living wage to some staff and earlier this month became fully accredited to the Living Wage Foundation as it said all staff, including agency workers, would get the independently agreed rate. The Everyman chain recently pledged to move hundreds of staff off zero-hours contracts by the end of next year, although it does not pay the living wage.",

    "webTitle": "UK investment in tech and transport among world's worst, says TUC", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain ranks among the worst performers in the developed world for spending on new technology, industrial machinery and transport equipment, according to a study by the TUC of investment spending in the public and private sectors. The UK came 34th out of the 34 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) for spending on transport equipment. Illustrating the meagre spending in recent years on the latest technology and industrial kit by UK firms, the study also found Britain ranks near the bottom \u2013 20th out of 21 countries for which data is available \u2013 in spending on IT systems and 23rd out of 27 countries for investment in other types of machinery. The report helps explain why the UK\u2019s productivity rate has failed to recover since the 2008 crash, the TUC said, and heaps pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to boost investment across the public and private sectors in next week\u2019s autumn statement. Hammond is expected to use his first set-piece statement in parliament to highlight the UK\u2019s persistently low productivity rate, which many analysts have blamed on a reluctance by businesses to invest in new machinery and processes while the outlook remains uncertain. The EU referendum result has added to business concerns that the economy will slow next year and that investments in new equipment might be wasted. Hammond has played down the likelihood of extra public spending on new infrastructure projects, preferring to focus on tax allowances and other incentives to encourage business investment. Last month, following a visit to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, he said: \u201cNow is a good time to invest in genuinely productivity-enhancing infrastructure, and to take advantage of low borrowing costs and our ability to borrow. \u201cBut this is not about a fiscal splurge. It is about supporting the economy in a measured and balanced way.\u201d The OECD and IMF have urged the UK to increase investment spending, arguing that it has the borrowing capacity to boost digital infrastructure and skills training for workers to operate the latest equipment. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t just waltz into Brexit with our fingers crossed. If the government doesn\u2019t invest in Britain, it could go very badly wrong. And working people will pay the price with fewer jobs, lower wages and higher prices.\u201d She added: \u201cBut if the government invests in Britain, we can build an economy strong enough to thrive.\u201d The UK is better at constructing new homes and office blocks, but even in these sectors, the UK is still well below the OECD average. The only area where the UK is ahead of the OECD average is in intellectual property, ranking 13th of 34 countries. In total, UK capital investment was 16.6% of GDP in 2014, matching Italy\u2019s spending as a proportion of national incomes, while the average across all OECD countries was 20.8%. Germany fell just below the average with a figure of 20%, but France edged higher to register spending equal to 21.8% of GDP. Only Greece and Portugal invested less than the UK, leaving it to rank 33rd out of 35 countries. O\u2019Grady said: \u201cWe need investment in rail and roads. We need investment in new homes and clean energy. And we need investment in skills, education and fair pay for a world-class workforce. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do for better jobs and higher wages.

      "bodyText": "BP has not withdrawn its application to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight \u2013 despite saying it had abandoned its controversial plans \u2013 and could transfer the rights to another company if it gets the green light, the regulator has told a Senate inquiry. In addition, Chevron, which is also applying to drill for oil in the Bight, has said it remains committed to its plans there. BP, which was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, has been one of several companies seeking to tap one of the world\u2019s last untapped oil frontiers. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars pursuing its plans to exploit the deep waters off South Australia, BP announced in October it was pulling out. But, since then, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) has said it has granted BP an extension to its application process. The chief executive of Nopsema, Stuart Smith, told a Senate inquiry into exploration in the Bight on Wednesday that both of BP\u2019s current applications were proceeding. \u201cThey\u2019ve advised us that their environmental plans are still in play, they sought an extension for responding to a request for further information and that request was granted,\u201d Smith said. Under questioning from the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Smith also confirmed that if BP received approval for its environmental plan it could transfer or sell its right to drill to another company. A spokeswoman for BP told Guardian Australia the extension to its application process would help it work with its partner in the venture, Statoil, to figure out the next steps. She would not confirm whether or not the company would seek final approval for it\u2019s drilling program nor whether the company would sell any approval it was granted. Hanson-Young said the process has been \u201cfarcical\u201d since the beginning. \u201cWe\u2019ve only found out now that BP are continuing with their application, potentially so that once they\u2019re approved they can sell it on to the highest bidder,\u201d she said. \u201cAny deep sea mining for oil in the Great Australian Bight will put our stunningly beautiful coastline, as well as thousands of tourism and fisheries jobs, at risk.\u201d The South Australia director of the Wilderness Society, Peter Owen, called for BP to withdraw its application to drill. \u201cBP needs to come clean with the Australian people and follow through its promise to stop its drilling program and withdraw its applications with Nopsema to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight, not leave the applications hanging like a sword above the Australian people,\u201d he said. Representatives from Chevron also appeared before the hearing and told the senators they remained committed to drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight. \u201cChevron remains committed to its exploraiton program in the Bight,\u201d said David Moffat, the general manager of exploration at Chevron. \u201cTwo seasons of seismic acquisition have been completed ... They provide early but very promising evidence that the Bight presents a tremendous opportunity.\u201d He said they plan to drill four wells in two separate wells, probably starting in 2018. He said they had initially planned to drill in 2017 but they needed more time to analyse the results of the seismic testing. Moffat said within the next few months they would finalise the locations of their well locations and begin consulting with stakeholders early in 2017.",

      "bodyText": "In the years since the global financial crisis, proposals from Nobel laureates and professors of economics for fiscal policy stimulus to boost growth have been met with widespread derision. This was mainly from the proponents of fiscal austerity, who can only see cuts to government spending as a solution to all economic ills, despite the moribund state of the global economy. But such economic quackery is being called out by someone who, oddly, appears to the master of quackery, the US president-elect, Donald Trump. What a turn-up for the books. But the Trump win and his economic agenda has exposed a critical problem for the progressive side of politics in Australia and around the world. When a bombastic businessman, with a void of economic understanding, accidentally becomes president of the United States and indicates that he will oversee a fiscal stimulus based on an infrastructure and defence spending spree, there is a surging stock market, forecasts of stronger economic growth and all-of-a-sudden analysis that such policy stimulus is overdue. As Basil Fawlty might say, \u201cspecial subject, the bleeding obvious\u201d. It is intriguing to see the instant analysis from many unworldly Wall Street analysts and Washington thinktank specialists that the US economy will be strong because of the extra government spending Trump is outlining. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. Not that long ago, the Obama administration and US government was brought to the brink of closure when the Republicans in Congress postponed the rise in the debt ceiling until the 11th hour because it judged fiscal policy to be too loose. They and their ilk demanded cuts in spending to address what was a moderate problem on the US budget even though economic growth was weak, unemployment was high and deflation pressures were building. The US economy was held to ransom by the fiscal austerity economic pretenders and suffered as a result. Having demanded a reduction in government debt from about 90% of gross domestic product a few years ago, there now seems to be an acceptance that a path of US debt to 120% of GDP \u2013 but under Trump and not Obama or Clinton \u2013 is great economic policy. That said, there are other economic threats from the Trump policy agenda and these are not just to the rest of the world but also to the US economy. There is much more to Trumpenomics than the current focus on the fiscal stimulus measures. Even if the Trump proposals for a preposterous 45% tax on Chinese imports and the accusations of currency manipulation are watered down, there is little doubt that Beijing and other capitals hurt by any rise in US trade restrictions would retaliate in kind. US companies might encounter difficulties in a world where trade flows are inhibited. US businesses make more than $2tn a year from their overseas operations and, if their access to global markets is constrained, this figure would obviously be under threat. For every job saved in the US from import restrictions, there may well be a different one or even two jobs lost from damage to US exports, trade and investment. For years now, the Australian Labor party and other progressive left parties around the world have been too scared to strongly argue the case for an increase in the size of government, including higher spending, as they have been hamstrung by fear of the political difficulties. This has also been evident in the agenda when trying to make a case for, let alone implementing, policies that redistribute income from the well-off to the less well-off. But it appears that Trump is about to trump the left on the issue of fiscal stimulus as a virtue for growth. If only the Democrats had made the case in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, the US economy would have been stronger, the disaffected voters would have been less inclined to swing to Trump and Hillary Clinton would likely be president.",

      "bodyText": "The wages of Australian workers are growing at their slowest rate on record. According to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, the annual rate of wage growth is now a historically low 1.9%, after slowing noticeably in the September quarter. The bureau says wage growth is relying heavily on increases to the national minimum wage and modern awards, and regularly scheduled enterprise agreement increases. It is also relying on salary reviews timed to coincide with the financial year. Economists say the breadth of the drag on incomes across the economy, coupled with thinning corporate profits, suggests core inflation is unlikely to move materially higher for some time. JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said it meant the Reserve Bank may have to cut the official cash rate again next year \u2013 from a record low of 1.5%. \u201cWages are undoubtedly weak in the expected places (mining and construction) but this is far from just a mining story, with the deceleration having been very broad across sectors,\u201d Kennedy wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \u201cThis is symptomatic of a broad internal devaluation process unfolding as the real exchange rate stays too high, and consolidates the sense that unit labour costs should be well contained over the medium term. \u201cCore inflation is unlikely to move materially higher anytime soon. For this reason, we remain of the view that the RBA still has more work to do in 2017.\u201d The record low wages growth comes despite an apparently healthy unemployment rate of 5.6% (which has fallen from 6.2% in May 2015). But data shows the underemployment rate \u2013 a measure of the number of workers would like to work longer hours \u2013 has risen from 8.9% to 9.2% since November 2015, and economists say that suggests the demand for labour, and the composition of labour, is still insufficient to make wages rise in a significant way. The Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, confirmed in the last Reserve Bank board minutes that Australian wages had been growing more slowly than implied by their historical relationship with the unemployment rate. \u201c[But] the decline in wage growth had been a helpful part of the adjustment of the economy to the end of the resources boom,\u201d he said. The ABS data, released on Wednesday, illustrates how the fortunes of different workers have been affected by the huge shifts occurring in the economy. They show the mining industry has recorded the lowest wage growth of any industry over the last year, with a meagre 1%. The strongest wage growth has occurred for workers in the healthcare and social assistance industry, at 2.4%. The data also shows public sector wages are growing more strongly, at 2.3%, with private sector wages growing at an annual rate of just 1.9% (excluding bonuses). Ged Kearney, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the figures showed why unions were important. \u201cCritics are always trying to scream out that unions are irrelevant, but 60% of the workforce are covered by some form of industrial agreement that unions actually negotiate for,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cUnions are doing their bit in a very difficult environment, where even getting small wages outcomes are hard. The rules and regulations around taking industrial action are very harsh, but we\u2019re still trying to get a bigger share of the pie for workers.\u201d Scott Morrison said the weak wages growth highlighted the need for stronger economic growth, and pressured Labor to support the government\u2019s $48bn tax cut plan. \u201cWith the rest of the world looking to stimulate investment and growth through more competitive tax rates, Australia, as a net importer of capital, risks falling behind and becoming uncompetitive,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cLabor knows this is true, which is why they used to support a more competitive tax system and campaigned for lower taxes when they were in government, but the opportunistic Bill Shorten would rather wreck the economy to get elected than work with the government to secure jobs, promote employment and increase real wages.\u201d But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has criticised the government\u2019s stewardship of the economy, saying it is \u201cembarrassing\u201d that wages growth has sunk to a record low under Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership. \u201cThe prime minister and treasurer talk about jobs and growth yet we are seeing an economic trifecta of record underemployment, record low wages growth and the loss of 100,000 full time jobs since the beginning of the year,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWith families around Australia facing higher costs, particularly with purchasing a new home, slowing wages growth and worsening job security under the Turnbull government just makes things that much harder.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Technically, the Marks &amp; Spencer fashion showcase is a reveal of hemlines and heel heights, but within two minutes of arriving at the new season preview I am talking feelings with the retailer\u2019s CEO, Steve Rowe. The store\u2019s latest advert stars a Hillary Clinton-esque Mrs Claus saving the (Christmas) day in on-trend hygge knitwear, and includes the most feelgood helicopter moment since James Bond and the Queen flew into the Olympic stadium for the opening ceremony of London 2012. The advert is a poignant, Sliding Doors vision of the feminist happy ending that 2016 appeared destined to have but didn\u2019t, and Rowe keeps hearing from people who say it made them cry, which we agree is a very good sign. (Rowe, ever mindful of the bottom line, is even more cheered by the fact that the red, sequinned trainers that feature in the ad have done storming business since the advert dropped.) Emotion is never far from the surface at a store which is part of the British national conversation in ways that are about more than its \u00a310bn annual revenue. The public does not care about many FTSE 100 companies in this fashion. So the recent news that it will close 30 stores and convert 45 to being food only was keenly felt by many observers, who interpreted a switch of focus from clothing (first bras, school uniform, affordable cashmere) into the passionless territory of prawn sandwiches and chicken kiev as a sign of an M&amp;S beating a cultural retreat. Belinda Earl and Jo Jenkins, the leadership team of the fashion business, issued a flat denial that their part of the company was being squeezed. They argue that forfeit of floor space reflects how customers now shop \u2013 17% of M&amp;S fashion sales are made online, and this is rising \u2013 and a commitment across the business to streamlining, so that there is one great pair of velvet trousers on sale rather than three. (Footnote: straight after the meeting, I ordered a pair of the Autograph wide leg velvet trousers, \u00a359, which two of the team were wearing.) \u201cWe remain completely committed to clothing, but we need to make space work harder,\u201d Jenkins said. Note the buzzwords and phrases most often repeated by the team on our tour of the showroom: \u201cedit\u201d, \u201cfocus\u201d, and \u201ckey details\u201d. Instead of being home to 20 variations on the twinset, the new M&amp;S aims to have a tighter collection of more eye-catching pieces. Case in point: the new season is strong on simple blouses with interesting sleeve shapes, a feature adopted from catwalk and street style for the M&amp;S customer. \u201cShe wants that detail that gives her a reason to buy, but she doesn\u2019t want overcomplicated clothes \u2013 a simple body with something happening on the sleeve is flattering and easy to wear,\u201d said Jenkins. A crisp blue-and-white striped blouse with buttons at the shoulder and fluted sleeves echoes the cult fashion brand Ellery, but for less than \u00a330, while a \u00a365 Autograph hot pink, fashionably loose dress with bell sleeves and back cutout is very Victoria-Beckham-at-JFK (that\u2019s a good thing these days, if you haven\u2019t been paying attention). Prints have been given a much-needed overhaul: a graphic print that nods to Hokusai\u2019s images of Mount Fuji makes for an excellent \u00a335 silk dress. While most of the collection goes on sale in early 2017, the See Now Buy Now capsule collection introduced for the first time this year continues with an accessory edit that channels next season\u2019s trends but goes on sale immediately. (The \u00a335 cutwork boots, comfortable partywear with the patented technology that M&amp;S have devised to rebalance the foot and make heel-wearing comfortable, are a standout, as are the \u00a345 ankle-tied ballet slippers.) That this puts accessories in the spotlight at a crucial juncture for M&amp;S reflects the way the fashion business is shifting, away from blanket-coverage basics and towards key pieces. My hot tip for next season\u2019s pink coat? A pair of pearl-studded black high-heeled sandals.",

Prints have been given a much-needed overhaul: a graphic print that nods to Hokusai\u2019s images of Mount Fuji makes for an excellent \u00a335 silk dress.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b071fc3d3cbf188e5467c435f958cde56923bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b071fc3d3cbf188e5467c435f958cde56923bc/0_2283_3743_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cutwork boots, \u00a335.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cutwork boots, \u00a335.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark &amp;Spencer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While most of the collection goes on sale in early 2017, the See Now Buy Now capsule collection introduced for the first time this year continues with an accessory edit that channels next season\u2019s trends but goes on sale immediately. (The \u00a335 cutwork boots, comfortable partywear with the patented technology that M&amp;S have devised to rebalance the foot and make heel-wearing comfortable, are a standout, as are the \u00a345 ankle-tied ballet slippers.) That this puts accessories in the spotlight at a crucial juncture for M&amp;S reflects the way the fashion business is shifting, away from blanket-coverage basics and towards key pieces. My hot tip for next season\u2019s pink coat? A pair of pearl-studded black high-heeled sandals. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
