      "bodyText": "Higher borrowing costs and lower tax receipts could deprive Philip Hammond of up to \u00a314bn when he presents his autumn statement next month, denying him vital funds to boost the economy after the Brexit vote, a leading tax and spending thinktank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that an unexpected downturn in the public finances in September was likely to be repeated in the next few months and bust the government\u2019s annual borrowing limits set earlier this year. Thomas Pope, an economist at the IFS, said the Treasury\u2019s room for manoeuvre would be tight after figures for the first six months of the financial year showed tax receipts had failed to match projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). He said: \u201cBorrowing looks set to be higher than the OBR forecast in March, possibly by a reasonable margin. The trend so far suggests that over the year as a whole receipts could undershoot by \u00a314bn.\u201d Pope said income from other sources could limit the hole in the Treasury\u2019s budget to \u00a38bn, but it could nevertheless act as a brake on plans to support a wide range of infrastructure projects and provide incentives for businesses to invest. The IFS report followed a collapse in corporation tax receipts to the lowest level since 2009 that helped widen the budget deficit in September to \u00a310.6bn. A slowdown in the growth of VAT receipts was also blamed for pushing the deficit \u00a31.3bn higher, or 14.5%, than the same month last year and above the \u00a310.5bn recorded in August. City analysts, who had expected an \u00a38.5bn shortfall, said the OBR would need to rip up its pre-Brexit vote forecasts after a run of projections from all the major economic institutions showing GDP growth and tax receipts slowing next year. In recent months Hammond has sent conflicting signals about the likely size and scope of extra spending to compensate for the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and forecasts of growth for next year that have halved from around 2.2% to nearer 1%. Immediately after the vote he ripped up George Osborne\u2019s fiscal rule of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament, and talked about the need for extra spending to create jobs and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. But he has sought to dampen expectations by emphasising that he is constrained by volatile international money markets, which could drive up the government\u2019s borrowing costs if he is seen to be reckless. Hammond said on Friday: \u201cWe have already made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, reducing the deficit by almost two-thirds since 2010, but our debt and deficit remain too high. We remain committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows us the space to support the economy as needed.\u201d The weak September figures took the budget deficit to \u00a345bn for the first six months of the year, down nearly 5% from the same period in 2015. The Office for National Statistics could not offer a reason for the dive in corporation tax receipts. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said if the public finances continued on the current trend, borrowing would overshoot the OBR\u2019s forecast of \u00a355.5bn for the financial year by about \u00a317bn. He said: \u201cEven before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u2019s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic. But the weaker economic prospects over the next few years as a result means that these forecasts are likely to be revised substantially in the autumn statement next month.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British American Tobacco has offered to pay $47bn (\u00a338bn) for full control of Reynolds American in a takeover that would create the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company. The cash-plus-shares deal would plunge BAT back into the US market after a 12-year absence and is also expected to speed the development of e-cigarettes and vapes. BAT, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Benson &amp; Hedges, already owns 42.2% of Reynolds and is offering to buy the remainder of the firm, which traces its roots back to before the American war of independence. The British firm has owned a stake in Reynolds since 2004, when it merged its US subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson with RJ Reynolds Tobacco to create Reynolds American. \u201cFrom the moment Reynolds American was born, this was always the most likely outcome,\u201d said Cenkos Securities analyst Rae Maile. \u201cThe US marketplace is fundamentally very attractive and offers a source of sustainable profit growth.\u201d BAT said it was prepared to pay $56.50 a share, comprising $24.13 in cash and $32.37 in shares. The offer, structured as a merger, is worth 20% more than Reynolds\u2019 closing price on Thursday and values the US company at \u00a366bn. The combined firm would be valued at about \u00a3157bn. BAT\u2019s shares, the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index this year, initially rose before closing down nearly 3% at \u00a346.66, despite a strong trading update for the first nine months. Revenues were up 8.1% stripping out exchange-rate movements, while it sold 497bn cigarettes, 2.2% more than last year. Speculation has been rife for months that BAT might decide to buy out Reynolds as tobacco companies jockey for position. BAT said that buying the number two US tobacco company, after Philip Morris, would give it a leading position in the American market, the world\u2019s second biggest after China. Reynolds has a 35% market share in the US, where it owns the low-cost market leader Pall Mall, Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette, and Camel, a mid-market brand popular with younger Americans. BAT could produce its own brands in the US via Reynolds\u2019 factory in Tobaccoville, North Carolina. While smoking rates in the US are declining, analysts said it remains a market with huge growth potential. Population growth means that while smoking rates are falling, the number of smokers has remained relatively constant at about 45 million people for several decades. US cigarettes are also relatively cheap compared with prices in the UK, leaving scope for the company to boost profits by raising prices. A tie-up would also allow BAT and Reynolds to build on their existing technology-sharing partnership in e-cigarettes and vapes. The nascent market for what Reynolds calls \u201ccigalike products\u201d has no dominant player, but BAT would be able to combine its Vype brand with the US firm\u2019s Vuse products. BAT said it expected cost savings of $400m, a relatively low figure for such a large merger because its lack of presence in the US means there is limited overlap in their businesses. Nicandro Durante, BAT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe proposed merger of our two great companies is the logical progression in our relationship and offers all shareholders a stake in a stronger, truly global tobacco and next-generation products company.\u201d BAT said Reynolds shareholders would gain from the deal by holding shares in a bigger company with the clout to sell Reynolds\u2019 brands round the world. Guy Ellison, the head of UK equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, said that while the timing of the move was a surprise, the strategic rationale made \u201cperfect sense, pivoting BAT further towards the high-value US market, consolidating some strong brands and Reynolds\u2019 position in next-generation tobacco\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The removal of Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood after the BHS scandal is far from certain despite the tycoon\u2019s censure by MPs, according to people with knowledge of the process. Insiders say the path to rescinding Green\u2019s honour remains unclear because the panel charged with the task \u2013 the honours forfeiture committee \u2013 meets only when there is a case to consider. MPs voted on Thursday to strip Green of his knighthood in a symbolic move that carries no official sanction. According to the official honours guide, the criteria for removal by the committee is having damaged the honours system\u2019s reputation. It gives examples such as being convicted of a criminal offence or struck off by a professional body \u2013 neither of which applies to Green following the BHS collapse. However, it also offers the vague statement that \u201cother reasons for forfeiture can also be considered\u201d. For instance, when the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, Fred Goodwin, lost his knighthood the committee said that the \u201cscale and the severity of the impact of his actions as chief executive officer of RBS made this an exceptional case\u201d. The forfeiture committee is an ad hoc panel chaired by Sir Jonathan Stephens, a senior civil servant, who also heads up the main honours committee. Once assembled, the discussions are confidential with the panel\u2019s membership drawn from the chairs of the specialist honours committees, a pool that currently includes Sebastian Coe, medical professor Sir John Bell, retail executive Sir Ian Cheshire and charity boss Mary Marsh. If the forfeiture committee decides an honour should be withdrawn, the Queen is informed by the prime minister. The Queen then has the final say, with her decision published in the London Gazette. Paul Myners, a former City minister who was chair of Marks &amp; Spencer when Green launched a failed takeover bid in 2004, said: \u201cI\u2019m not in favour of his knighthood being withdrawn. If there\u2019s any issue with bringing the honours system into disrepute that lies with the people who gave it to him. The Philip Green I see today is the Philip Green I knew when it was given to him. It was very silly to give him a knighthood and that brought the system into disrepute \u2013 not what he has subsequently done.\u201d Green has been accused of leaving BHS with a \u00a3571m pension deficit, taking nearly \u00a3400m in dividends from the retailer and selling the business for \u00a31 in March 2015 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Green has robustly defended his track record at BHS, saying he invested substantial sums in the business. He was knighted by the Blair government in 2006. Several people close to the matter suggested Green\u2019s knighthood would remain in the balance until the postmortem into the collapse of BHS is complete. Although MPs have completed their inquiry, the Pensions Regulator is investigating the funding of the BHS pension scheme, while simultaneously trying to thrash out a settlement with Green who has promised to \u201csort\u201d the matter. The Insolvency Service is also investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse.",

The Queen then has the final say, with her decision published in the London Gazette.</p> <p>Paul Myners, a former City minister who was chair of Marks &amp; Spencer when Green launched a failed takeover bid in 2004, said: \u201cI\u2019m not in favour of his knighthood being withdrawn. If there\u2019s any issue with bringing the honours system into disrepute that lies with the people who gave it to him. The Philip Green I see today is the Philip Green I knew when it was given to him. It was very silly to give him a knighthood and that brought the system into disrepute \u2013 not what he has subsequently done.\u201d </p> <p>Green has been accused of leaving BHS with a \u00a3571m pension deficit, taking nearly \u00a3400m in dividends from the retailer and selling the business for \u00a31 in March 2015 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Green has robustly defended his track record at BHS, saying he invested substantial sums in the business. He was knighted by the Blair government in 2006. </p> <p>Several people close to the matter suggested Green\u2019s knighthood would remain in the balance until the postmortem into the collapse of BHS is complete. Although MPs have completed their inquiry, the Pensions Regulator is investigating the funding of the BHS pension scheme, while simultaneously trying to thrash out a settlement with Green who has promised to \u201csort\u201d the matter. The Insolvency Service is also investigating the retailer\u2019s collapse.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Few of Britain\u2019s migrant workers are as well paid as Mark Carney and none of them are as well known. But this weekend the governor of the Bank of England is having the same post-Brexit vote thought as every other foreign-born worker: am I still welcome here? At the end of a bruising month, the Canadian could be forgiven for wondering whether he is really wanted. Appointed with a fanfare by George Osborne, Carney is internationally admired and received praise for providing calm during the frenetic weeks immediately after the EU referendum. But the governor has made important enemies during his three years in the job. Some were made during the months leading up to the Brexit vote when critics in the leave camp accused him of being far too supportive of George Osborne\u2019s so-called Project Fear. There are also remain supporters who think permanently low interest rates and large-scale money creation are storing up big problems for the future. Those nettled by Carney\u2019s high-handed approach have been waiting for a moment to attack. Theresa May unwittingly provided that opportunity. The prime minister called open season on Threadneedle Street when she used her Conservative party conference speech to note that ultra-low borrowing costs and quantitative easing \u2013 the Bank\u2019s two main policy tools for boosting growth for the past seven-and-a-half years \u2013 were having adverse side-effects. Two other Conservatives, one from each side of the Brexit debate, have weighed in this week. Lord William Hague said central banks had \u201clost the plot\u201d and provided 10 reasons why permanently low borrowing costs and QE were a bad idea. Hague\u2019s argument was that central banks needed to get interest rates back up and would face consequences otherwise: \u201cIf they fail to do so, the era of their much-vaunted independence will come, possibly quite dramatically, to an end.\u201d While Hague declined to mention the Bank of England or Carney by name, his former cabinet colleague Michael Gove showed no such restraint. Gove compared the governor to a Ming emperor of China, who wielded absolute power and had those who challenged his authority flayed alive. \u201cCarney should ponder the fate of the Chinese emperors overwhelmed by forces they could not control because they could not bear to accept any criticism, and recognise that nothing so enhances authority as a dash \u2013 now and then \u2013 of humility.\u201d If Gove\u2019s plan was to get under the skin of the governor, his comparison with an oriental potentate worked. Carney cut his teeth as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where the credo tends to be kill or be killed rather than turn the other cheek. Publicly, he will shrug the attacks off. Those who know him say that in private he would not have been so relaxed. \u201cHe will have have been furious, absolutely livid,\u201d said one. Carney could get his own back. He was lured to Britain by Osborne to take charge at Threadneedle Street in 2013 on an \u00a3800,000-a-year salary. The then-chancellor wanted the Canadian to serve for eight years but Carney said he would only stay for five. The implication was that he had political ambitions back in Canada and did not want to tie himself down in the UK for too long. But Justin Trudeau\u2019s election victory means there is not likely to be a vacancy as prime minister at any time soon. Other options have also been closed off. Carney might be considered a good bet to run the International Monetary Fund, but Christine Lagarde has just been given a second five-year term. As a result, the attractions of staying on at the Bank for eight years have increased over time. Having been committed to leaving in 2018, Carney has been keeping his options open and has said he will make a final decision by the end of the year. But is Carney ready to walk? If the governor thought that he had lost the confidence of the prime minister and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the answer would be yes. As it is, a charm offensive is being mounted to persuade him to stay. The Treasury says there is no \u201cGet Carney\u201d campaign being mounted in Whitehall. On the contrary, Hammond went out of his way in New York earlier this month to say he wanted the governor to stay on until 2021. For her part, May took immediate steps to smooth things over with the Bank as soon as it became clear that her comments were being interpreted as an attack on the governor. Downing Street called Threadneedle Street on the morning after the speech to say sorry. The Bank accepted the apology and says it was a cock-up rather than a conspiracy. The backdrop to the debate about the governor\u2019s future is the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote. Sterling has fallen sharply on the foreign exchanges, the economy is slowing and the Treasury is planning to announce higher borrowing in the autumn statement next month. Former members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee say this is not a good time to be questioning Threadneedle Street\u2019s independence or to be pushing the governor towards the exit. Former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker said: \u201cI don\u2019t think Carney should go. To remove him in a way that looks political would be really, really unhelpful.\u201d Another former MPC member, Andrew Sentance, thinks there is an argument for changing the Bank\u2019s inflation target in order to make life easier for savers and pensioners, but added: \u201cThe government has got so much on its plate with Brexit that it does not want to go and pick a fight with the Bank of England.\u201d Those who know the governor say the decision is finely poised but won\u2019t be affected by what is written about him. Instead, it will depend on whether he sees being in charge at the Bank until 2021 as a challenge that will burnish his reputation or a poisoned chalice from which he doesn\u2019t need to drink.",

      "bodyText": "American football\u2019s expansion into the UK will take a major step forward when the New York Giants and the Los Angeles Rams descend on Twickenham. The match will be the first fixture in the National Football League (NFL), the most valuable sports league in the world, to be played in the UK outside Wembley stadium. The NFL started playing matches at Wembley in 2007. It expanded to two matches a year at Wembley in 2013 and three in 2014. The man overseeing the international expansion of NFL is Mark Waller, a Briton poached from an executive role at Diageo, the drinks group, in 2007 to bring a fresh perspective and business know-how to the organisation. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of the match at Twickenham in outer south-west London, which is expected to attract 75,000 fans, Waller said he wants to establish a permanent team, or franchise as they are known in the NFL, in the UK. \u201cI think there will be [a franchise]. I passionately believe that ultimately the best expression for a fan is to have their own team and I believe we will get to that point,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThe way I have tried to explain it recently is LA. We were out of LA for 20 years and every year for 16 or 17 years the question would be asked \u2018Well, when are you going back and why aren\u2019t you back?\u2019 There was never visible progress, then a couple of years ago two or three owners decided it was time to be back in LA and we are back in LA. That to me is the nature of the NFL. Things will move when owners are ready for them to move but that doesn\u2019t mean that progress isn\u2019t being made.\u201d Waller, who joined the NFL in 2007 after spending 17 years working for Diageo and its predecessor companies, said the organisation had been \u201cmethodical\u201d in its expansion into the UK. Its plans were heavily backed by George Osborne, the former chancellor, who publicly courted the NFL and talked up the prospects of a permanent team in London. The NFL agreed a deal to play at Twickenham, the home of English rugby, as a stepping stone to expanding further in the UK and potentially establishing a permanent London-based franchise. Other scheduled events at Wembley mean it could not expand the number of matches played there. The organisation has also struck a deal to play at least two matches a year for a decade at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s new stadium from 2018. \u201cWe are trying to work our way through, in a disciplined way, the issues of putting a team here so you can look everybody in the eye and show them you have done the due diligence,\u201d Waller said. \u201cTo me, the big issue for us putting a team here is that team has to be competitive.\u201d Waller said that the NFL\u2019s progress in the UK was ahead of their expectations and that the NFL highlight shows on the BBC are \u201cbringing in literally the youngest demographic of any show on the BBC\u201d. The NFL will also play a game in Mexico this year and is looking to expand in Canada, Germany and China. However, Waller insisted that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU would not change the NFL\u2019s strategy and could actually help the sport. \u201cNo, we have to manage that,\u201d Waller said when asked whether Brexit changed anything. \u201cOne of things you learn in an international business is that you can\u2019t control any of the environments that you operate in so you have to be agile and adept at managing changing circumstances. I don\u2019t think anybody yet knows what the implications of Brexit will be and they will be different to what we currently anticipate them to be I am sure. But I am pretty sure we will find a way like everyone else to not only manage around it but make the most of it \u201cObviously in the short term you have currency fluctuations and those are both positive and negative for us. The currency takes the revenues down, but the expenses go down as well. I think the biggest impact will be what the implications are for free movement of labour and moving backwards and forwards across borders.\u201d The NFL is expected to generate record revenues of more than $13bn (\u00a310.7bn) this year \u2013 a mixture of TV income, sponsorship deals, ticket sales and merchandise \u2013 up 50% on 2010, well ahead of the \u00a33.3bn recorded by the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs, which includes ticket sales. The NFL has a significantly different business model to the Premier League. While English football clubs are effectively free to spend as they wish, the NFL has a salary cap, a draft system that means the worst team in the league gets the first pick of the best college graduates, and shares the money generated from television, ticket and merchandise sales between all the teams. The NFL is effectively a socialist system in the biggest free market economy in the world. \u201cI think the beauty of our model is that its socially equitable and economically allows all teams to be more or less equal,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThat is the heart of what being a fan is about \u2013 the belief that any team can win on any day. I think our league has structured itself and our ownership has consciously taken decisions to keep the competitive and economic equity and keep balance. That I think is a huge strength but there is a lot of work that is required to keep that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "US telecoms giant AT&amp;T is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner, the media company whose star assets include HBO, Warner Brothers and CNN. A deal could come as early as this weekend, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both companies declined to comment. A merger of the two firms would come as telecoms companies have shown an increasing interest in media and tech takeovers. Verizon is currently in negotiations to buy Yahoo and has already bought AOL, owner of Huffington Post. AT&amp;T, the second largest wireless telecoms company in the US behind Verizon, owns a portfolio of mobile, broadband and satellite TV services that it promotes using Time Warner\u2019s entertainment assets, among others. But a deal to buy the Time Warner empire would rival the last major telecoms and media merger, Comcast\u2019s 2011 takeover of NBCUniversal. It would also awaken memories of another, ill-fated, Time Warner takeover. In 2001 AOL took over Time Warner in a deal now regarded as one of the worst mergers in history. It took a decade to unwind the transaction. Time Warner\u2019s share price rose 9% on the news while AT&amp;T\u2019s dipped close to 3%. Time Warner is valued at $73.5bn, AT&amp;T is valued at $227bn. Brian Wieser, lead researcher at analytics firm Pivotal, said that the deal was a possibility but would present the new entity with potentially insurmountable difficulties. Wieser said that while the marriage of a producer and a distributor might at first look similar to the successful Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, an AT&amp;T-Time Warner entity presented unique challenges. Other entities, he said, made more sense for the always-a-bridesmaid Time Warner. \u201cDirecTV and Time Warner in a lot of ways is more similar than Time Warner and AT&amp;T. It looks like a hedge against the commoditization of infrastructure.\u201d Cash rich telecoms companies like AT&amp;T are facing a crisis as their wireless businesses reach maturity and fixed line income continues to erode. \u201cAT&amp;T is an acquisition machine and interested in empire preservation if nothing else,\u201d said Wieser. \u201cTime Warner has always been for sale at the right price. It\u2019s not a position that creates any synergies, and it does create some dis-synergies, like the problem of managing a global media company from Texas. It\u2019s a standalone entity that gets lost when it\u2019s part of a much bigger conglomerate.\u201d But AT&amp;T is at a crossroads, Wieser said. \u201cIf the prospects for wireline growth are negative and the prospects for wireless growth are tepid, what do you do to make sure your business grows?\u201d Time Warner too faces headwinds. The trend toward \u201ccord cutting\u201d \u2013 where people get their TV needs over the internet \u2013 has eaten into the cable subscriptions that are vital to its networks. Traditional media companies are also facing increased competition from players including Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google\u2019s YouTube. In August Time Warner bought a 10% stake in Hulu, another streaming service owned by a consortium of established media players. HBO, whose shows include Westworld and Game of Thrones, was once one of the crown jewels of the cable industry. But the rapid changes in the industry forced Time Warner to launch a standalone digital HBO service. A transaction is bound to attract regulatory attention. Comcast, the US\u2019s largest cable company, faced intense regulatory scrutiny during its takeover of NBCUniversal.",

It is the second wave of job cuts announced by the Canadian manufacturer in a year, meaning it will shrink its workforce by about 20% in two years. The multinational did not give full details of where the jobs would be lost other than 2,000 redundancies in Canada, while confirming that two-thirds of the total would be in Bombardier Transportation, the division that builds and maintains trains and track systems. However, it is thought that the group\u2019s Belfast operations are the most vulnerable to further cuts among its UK units. Bombardier employs 5,000 aerospace workers in Northern Ireland and has 3,400 rail staff in the UK, about half of whom are employed in a manufacturing plant in Derby. As part of the first wave of global job cuts, the firm announced in February that just over 1,000 jobs would go over the next two years in Belfast, where the group makes the wings for its C Series passenger jet.

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing the blog for today. Thank you for all your great comments, and have a good weekend. We will be back on Monday. The eurozone consumer confidence figures from the European Commission are out. The flash estimate rose by 0.2 points to -8 in October from -8.2 the previous month, in line with market expectations. In the wider European Union, consumer confidence edged down 0.1 point to -6.5. To put this into context, consumer confidence in the eurozone averaged -12.30 between 1985 and 2016, reaching an all time high of 2.40 in May of 2000 and a record low of -34.30 in March of 2009. The pound continues to slide, and has fallen below $1.22. It is currently trading at $1.2192, down 0.5% on the day. At her first EU summit, Theresa May has been given a stark warning from both Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande that Britain faces a \u201crough\u201d and \u201chard\u201d negotiation \u2013 as she pursues a tough approach to Brexit negotiations, including a clampdown on immigration. According to Reuters, Burberry and US rival Coach are NOT in active merger talks, despite an earlier report from financial blog Betaville. Reuters cited two unnamed sources. We\u2019ve had some technical issues here, hence the long silence. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published its analysis of the UK public finance figures. Thomas Pope, a research economist at the respected think tank, said: At the half way point in the financial year, tax receipts have disappointed while central government spending has been slightly lower than official forecasts for the year imply. Overall, borrowing looks set to be higher than the OBR forecast in March, possibly by a reasonable margin. The trend so far suggests that, over the year as a whole, receipts could undershoot by \u00a314bn. The next few months might however contain some better news on receipts. The recent rise in income tax on dividend income is likely to have led to some owner-managers bringing forward their dividend payments. As a result we can expect strong growth in income tax receipts on dividend payments to arrive around the self-assessment deadline at the end of January. Therefore a better estimate for receipts this year is for an undershoot of \u00a38bn, driven by with weak receipts from income tax and National Insurance on earnings, and from VAT on purchases.\u201d On 23 November, the new chancellor will present his response to a much changed economic outlook at the Autumn Statement. Borrowing looks likely to be larger this year than his predecessor expected in March, which will make the challenge he faces more difficult. The full analysis is on the IFS website. Let\u2019s have a look at the markets. The FTSE 100 index is trading 25 points higher at 7051.89, a 0.36% gain. It has been hovering around this level most of the day. Germany\u2019s Dax has slipped 0.03% to 10,699.45 while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.16% to 4532.31. On currency markets, growing expectations of a Fed rate hike in December mean that the dollar is on course for its third consecutive week of gains, measured against a basket of currencies. The dollar index is up 0.27% at 98.581. Amid worries over a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d sterling is sliding against the dollar, losing 0.6% to $1.2182, as Theresa May attends her first EU summit. Against the euro, the pound is flat. The UK public finances worsened unexpectedly in September, with the government borrowing \u00a310.6bn rather than \u00a38.5bn as forecast by the City. There was a rare fall in corporation tax receipts. This knocked the public finances further off course and will present a headache for chancellor Philip Hammond, who is preparing for the autumn statement on 23 November. Meanwhile, Brian Murphy, head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, says: The data released this morning from HMRC suggests a healthy level of transactions for last month, given the context that the average property transaction will take 12 to 14 weeks to conclude, meaning that the data compiled for September completions is based on those who would have committed to their purchase in late June or early July, e.g. directly after the referendum result. August completions reflect purchases which were started in May, which is typically a busy month as it\u2019s the tail end of the Spring market, rather than June which generally sees the start of the summer holiday hiatus, and September 2015 was exceptionally busy due to pent up demand following the General Election. Looking at the bigger picture... we would anticipate that by the end of the year, the total number of residential property transactions could stand at around 1.2m. This would certainly be in line with 2014 and 2015 levels, and a substantial increase on transaction volumes in 2011, 2012, 2013. Here is some reaction to the fall in property transactions in September, reported earlier. Nick Davies, head of residential development at Stirling Ackroyd, says the slowdown in sales is due to a shortage of homes coming onto the market. While the demand for homes continues to grow and interest rates are at a record low, the lack of properties available is reducing sales and driving up house prices. If government wants to support the property sector and help first-time buyers, they will need to increase the circulation of homes on the market. In order to achieve this, they first need significantly step-up the construction of new homes - David Cameron\u2019s Government built the fewest new homes of any administration since the 1920s. Theresa May must do better. More also needs to be done to encourage older people to consider downsizing, freeing up more homes for families and younger buyers. Reducing Stamp Duty rates would provide a greater incentive to move home, increasing the flow of properties onto the market and ensuring house prices remained stable. Burberry shares have jumped more than 5% to \u00a315.27 after financial blog Betaville (citing sources) reported that US rival Coach was working with investment bank Evercore on a potential merger with Burberry. Property conference MIPIM UK, a three-day event (the UK offshoot of the annual Cannes conference) draws to a close today. It was attended by 3,000 investors, housing experts and developers. The conference focused on how the property market will be affected by the Brexit vote. The organisers noted that Theresa May\u2019s government has stressed the commitment to boosting housing and developing infrastructure. Industry analysts say that despite uncertainty caused by the referendum, the weak pound is attracting international investors. Sir Howard Davies, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, echoed these comments when he opened the conference on Wednesday, saying sterling\u2019s slide had made the UK more attractive to dollar investors. But Davies also predicted slower economic growth post-Brexit, and noted that \u201cthe froth has gone off the London property market\u201d as a number of banks are preparing to move operations elsewhere in the EU. Guy Hands, the financier who founded buyout firm Terra Firma, was quite blunt in stating: \u201cnobody has any real idea of what\u2019s going to happen\u201d the property market. But he pointed to Britain\u2019s \u201cchronic housing shortage,\u201d estimated at about 1.2m homes. He also challenged the notion that the eurozone could claim London\u2019s financial crown, saying US banks were more likely to relocate to New York than Frankfurt or Paris. The Unite union said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Bombardier\u2019s Belfast workforce, which is involved in every Bombardier line of production. Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier has announced another big round of redundancies, the second this year. The company said today that it would cut a further 7,500 jobs globally over the next couple of years, or 10% of its workforce. This includes 2,000 job losses in Canada. Bombardier chief executive Alain Bellemare told Reuters: We understand these are difficult decisions ... but in the end what we are going to be left with is a leaner, stronger organisation. Returning to the dire government borrowing figures... Commercial property deals are also down, to 9,670. This is a 3.9% fall from the August number and 3.8% below September 2015. The number of residential property transactions in the UK fell to 93,130 last month, according to seasonally adjusted figures from HMRC. The number is down by 4.3% compared with August, and 11.3% below last September\u2019s figure. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says the public borrowing figures were \u201ca bit of a cold shower for the chancellor after the recent run of generally favourable post-referendum economic data\u201d. It is therefore looking increasingly difficult for the Chancellor to meet the OBR forecast from March that total public borrowing in 2016/17 will be \u00a355.5 billion, which would require borrowing in the second half of the year to come in at just \u00a310 billion. A more likely outcome based on the available data is that the budget deficit this year will come in at around \u00a365-70 billion. We would not, however, expect the Chancellor to take any immediate action in the Autumn Statement to correct this budget deficit overshoot, as this could be counterproductive and further weaken the economy. Instead we would expect some increase in planned public sector investment over the next few years, allied to a commitment to eliminate the current budget deficit (excluding net investment) before 2020 and to keep the ratio of public sector debt to GDP on a gradual downward path in the medium term.\u201d Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit, says of the borrowing figures: This highlights the fact that the Chancellor has limited room for fiscal stimulus in the Autumn Statement if he is to maintain credible adherence to fiscal discipline. Both the Prime Minister and Chancellor have stressed the need for fiscal responsibility. The UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union clearly put the fiscal target for 2016/17 out of reach and the longer-term targets are now clearly off the table as the Theresa May government has acknowledged by abandoning the target of a budget surplus by 2019/20. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at economic consultancy Capital Economics, expects government borrowing to overshoot the OBR\u2019s forecast of \u00a355.5bn for the fiscal year by around \u00a317bn. The latest outturn puts the public finances well off track to meet the OBR\u2019s March forecast. Even before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u2019s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic. But the weaker economic prospects over the next few years as a result means that these forecasts are likely to be revised substantially in the Autumn Statement next month. Indeed, we think the OBR will present the Chancellor with forecasts for borrowing that are about \u00a325bn higher in 2019/20 than the previous forecast. However, this shouldn\u2019t trouble the Chancellor too much. In fact he has already suggested that he will allow an easing of the fiscal squeeze in the near term in order to provide the economy with some support. Austerity is far from over, but the fact that the economy is now not set to face a significant ramping up of the pace of fiscal consolidation over the next few years is another reason to think that growth won\u2019t slow too sharply. The bigger September deficit means that borrowing for the first six months of the year is \u00a345.5bn \u2013 down nearly 5% from the same period last year, but closer to the \u00a355.5bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the entire year. Hammond has indicated that he will reduce the deficit more slowly than his predecessor George Osborne, to help the economy weather the shock of the Brexit vote in June. The latest figures, and the likelihood of weaker tax revenues if the economy slows in the wake of the referendum, pile further pressure on the chancellor, as he prepares for his autumn statement on 23 November. The UK ran a budget deficit of \u00a310.6bn in September, much bigger than expected. This is a major setback for Philip Hammond, the chancellor, ahead of his autumn statement next month. The budget shortfall was 14.5% higher than in September last year, and wrongfooted City economists who had expected the public finances to improve (to an \u00a38.5bn deficit). Receipts from corporation tax and property transactions both fell in September, compared with a year ago, while VAT receipts grew at a slower pace. The Office for National Statistics said it was the first fall in corporation tax revenues seen in the month of September since 2009. It was unable to provide a reason. The growth in VAT receipts was the slowest for the month of September since 2012. The euro remains under pressure, trading at its lowest level against the dollar since March, after Mario Draghi\u2019s comments on quantitative easing yesterday. As UBS Wealth Management\u2019s Paul Donovan put it: The first rule of Fight Club is you don\u2019t talk about tapering. The second rule of Fight Club is you DO NOT talk about tapering. The ECB did not talk about tapering. The ECB did not talk about talking about tapering. The ECB will probably taper its quantitative policy. Back to BAT\u2019s proposed takeover of Reynolds, a $47bn deal. Guy Ellison, head of UK equities at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, said: The timing is a surprise, but the strategic rationale makes perfect sense, pivoting BAT further towards the high value US market, consolidating some strong brands and Reynold\u2019s position in next generation tobacco. Despite relatively modest synergies, the deal is still seen adding value for shareholders in the first full-year after completion. The ball is now in the court of Reynolds board and shareholders to consider the offer. The ECB\u2019s latest survey of economists\u2019 long-term inflation expectations shows they remain near the central bank\u2019s target \u2013 but GDP growth is expected to be weaker than previously thought. Inflation is currently running at 0.4% but is expected to rise to 1.8% by 2021, in line with previous projections, the survey of 47 forecasters showed. Inflation has been below the ECB\u2019s target of nearly 2% for years amid high unemployment, high debt levels, weak services and falling oil prices. The economic growth outlook appears to have worsened, with economists now predicting 1.5% growth for 2018 and 1.6% for 2021, each 0.1% percentage points lower than three months ago. However the growth outlook for this year has improved, with the survey predicting 1.6% expansion this year, above the previous forecast of 1.5% growth. It is still slightly below the ECB\u2019s own forecast of 1.7%. The other big news is that Britain\u2019s competition watchdog will investigate online betting firms and whether they are treating customers fairly. They could face fines and be forced to change their practices. Alexandra Topping writes: The Competition and Markets Authority will investigate allegations that online bookmakers are using the small print of contracts to change the odds on winning bets so less money is paid out, to limit the amount successful gamblers can bet and to deny some users access to promotions. The companies have been issued with notices requiring them to give evidence. If companies are found to be in breach of consumer law, the CMA can take enforcement measures against them. Here\u2019s our full story on BAT wanting to buy out US rival Reynolds, the main corporate story of the day. Reynolds owns Pall Mall, the biggest US low-cost brand, Newport, the top-selling menthol cigarette, and Camel, a mid-market name that is the third-biggest seller in the US. Turning to the UK\u2019s public finance figures for September, out at 9.30am UK time, Investec analyst Chris Hare has sent us his thoughts. The main measure of the government deficit, PSNB, came in at \u00a310.5bn in August. This was a touch larger than we had expected, but still represents a year-on-year borrowing decline of \u00a30.9bn. Were borrowing to continue to improve at this pace for the remainder of the financial year we would be looking at an outturn of \u00a364.7bn, close to \u00a310bn above the OBR\u2019s March Budget forecast of \u00a355.5bn. Over time, we expect a post-referendum slowdown in economic activity to weigh on tax receipts. So the fiscal year borrowing overshoot will probably be larger than described in the thought exercise above. But in the near term, the post-Brexit vote economy seems to have held up rather well. So we are forecasting another (\u00a30.4bn) year-on-year decline in borrowing, with a PSNB outturn of \u00a38.9bn. Portugal\u2019s 10-year government bond yields are holding around 3.23%, near a six-week low of 3.16%, as analysts are expecting Lisbon to pass a crucial ratings review, according to Reuters. Canadian credit ratings firm DBRS will review Portugal\u2019s investment-grade debt rating after market close. A downgrade would mean that the country would not be able to participate in the ECB\u2019s asset purchase programme. But analysts were confident that DRBS will keep the rating unchanged, after the Portuguese government pledged budget deficit cuts for next year. However, the rating outlook could be lowered from stable to negative \u2013 and this would make a rating cut more likely at the next review in six months\u2019 time. European markets have defied spreadbetters\u2019 predictions and opened higher, after yesterday\u2019s pro-stimulus talk from ECB president Mario Draghi. Only the Italian market has turned negative. FTSE 100 in London up 0.09% at 7033.77 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.07% at 10,708.46 France\u2019s CAC up 0.16% at 4547.24 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.2% at 9080.20 Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib down 0.16% at 17,113.36 The euro has fallen to its lowest level against sterling since the 7 October flash crash: it has dropped to 88.96p, down 0.2% on the day, as markets digest yesterday\u2019s ECB comments, which pointed to more quantitative easing in December. British American Tobacco has swooped on US tobacco firm Reynolds with a $47bn offer \u2013 a mega deal that would bring together Newport, Kent, Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes and create the world\u2019s biggest listed tobacco company. The UK group already has a 42% stake in Reynolds and wants to buy the remaining 57.8% for $47bn \u2013 $20bn in cash and $27bn in shares. BAT shares rose 2.3% to \u00a349.14 on the news. BAT also said it had performed well in the first nine months of the year, driven by its focus on key brands Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Rothmans. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the day after the European Central Bank\u2019s monthly meeting. Markets reacted positively to the press conference, with stocks finishing higher, but are expected to open slightly lower today. What did we learn yesterday? ECB president Mario Draghi hinted that the central bank could announce more QE in December. He also indicated that an abrupt end to the \u20ac1.7tn asset purchase programme was \u201cunlikely\u201d. However, the governing council did not discuss extending QE or tapering at the meeting. The euro jumped initially before hitting a four-month low. Portugal\u2019s government bond yields are hovering near six-week lows, ahead of a key review by Canadian ratings firm DBRS, out after markets close. Lisbon is expected to survive the test. If it were to be downgraded it would fall out of the ECB\u2019s QE programme. Asian and US stocks were mostly lower overnight as the price of oil slid, with the dollar hitting a seven-month high against a basket of currencies. The dollar index touched 98.564, the highest level since March. The Hong Kong stock market closed as typhoon Haima drew closer. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.3%, the South Korean exchange lost 0.37%, Australian stocks shed 0.2%, Singapore fell 0.6% and the Shanghai market was 0.06% lower. The main piece of data today is the UK public finances, which are expected to show a a slight improvement. Economists are predicting that public sector net borrowing came in at \u00a38.2bn in September, from \u00a310.5bn in August. We will also get consumer confidence figures for the eurozone for October at 3pm UK time.",

The trend so far suggests that, over the year as a whole, receipts could undershoot by \u00a314bn.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The next few months might however contain some better news on receipts. The recent rise in income tax on dividend income is likely to have led to some owner-managers bringing forward their dividend payments. As a result we can expect strong growth in income tax receipts on dividend payments to arrive around the self-assessment deadline at the end of January. Therefore a better estimate for receipts this year is for an undershoot of \u00a38bn, driven by with weak receipts from income tax and National Insurance on earnings, and from VAT on purchases.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>On 23 November, the new chancellor will present his response to a much changed economic outlook at the Autumn Statement.

If government wants to support the property sector and help first-time buyers, they will need to increase the circulation of homes on the market. </p> <p>In order to achieve this, they first need significantly step-up the construction of new homes - David Cameron\u2019s Government built the fewest new homes of any administration since the 1920s. Theresa May must do better. More also needs to be done to encourage older people to consider downsizing, freeing up more homes for families and younger buyers.

    "webTitle": "How criticising Mark Carney became the new Tory sport", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Conservative politicians have lined up to criticise Mark Carney in the most sustained pressure applied to a governor of the Bank of England since the central bank gained independence over monetary policy in 1998. In the run-up to the EU referendum, Tories accused Carney of interfering in the campaign by warning about the economic effects of a vote to leave. Since the vote, Carney has faced a series of rebukes over the effects of low interest rates and quantitative easing, triggering talk of an effort to pass the blame for the economic consequences of Brexit to the BoE or to drive the governor out of his job. Here are some of the Tory criticisms of Carney: On 8 March, the backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Carney of intervening in the referendum debate when the BoE should have kept out. What concerns me is that the influence and the strength of the Bank of England is in its Olympian detachment from day to day political partisanship. And in your evidence, in your letter and in your speech you are getting into political partisanship, removing yourself from your Olympian detachment, damaging the Bank\u2019s ability to regulate through influence, which has historically been just as important as the letter of the law. On 13 June, Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, wrote to Carney telling him to stay out of the referendum debate just as he would a general election. You are prohibited from making any public comment, or doing anything which could be construed as taking part in the referendum debate. I have taken legal advice from Speakers\u2019 Counsel . . . [and] wanted to take the opportunity to stress the importance of this matter. I very much hope you will avoid doing anything which could suggest you or the Bank have disregarded parliament\u2019s wishes. On 16 June, cabinet member Boris Johnson said the BoE risked undermining economic confidence by issuing warnings about the potential effects of a vote for Brexit. We shouldn\u2019t be talking this country down. It\u2019s a great country and a great economy. I think it will flourish outside the EU. Also on 16 June, former Tory leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard included the BoE in an attack on scaremongering about the economic implications of a vote to leave the EU. There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury, and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis. They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain. On 22 September, the former chancellor Nigel Lawson called on Carney to resign and accused him of being a doom-monger before and after the referendum. He\u2019s behaved disgracefully. I have known all six of his predecessors as governor of the Bank of England and not one of them would have thought it proper to behave as he has done, particularly during the campaign when he joined in the chorus of scaremongering. He wasn\u2019t the worst but he shouldn\u2019t have joined in it at all. Now he is seeking to validate the improper remarks he made during the campaign. It is appalling and I think the sooner he stands down from the governorship, the better. On 6 October, Theresa May criticised the BoE\u2019s decisions on monetary policy in her party conference speech. While monetary policy \u2013 with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer. A change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it. When Carney responded on 14 October by saying the BoE would not be directed by politicians, the Tory backbencher David Davies tweeted that it was right for May to issue instructions. On 18 October, William Hague, the former foreign secretary, wrote in the Telegraph that low rates and QE had hit savers and pension funds and increased inequality. Eight years after the global financial crisis [central banks] are still pursuing emergency policies that are becoming steadily more unpopular and counterproductive. Unless they change course soon, they will find their independence increasingly under attack \u2026 The policies of any one central bank may well be perfectly rational, including the recent decisions of the Bank of England after the referendum. But so is a decision by any one sheep to run with the flock when in danger. On 21 October, Michael Gove, the former justice secretary and Tory leadership candidate, said Carney could not accept criticism and that questioning his decisions was treated like a thought crime. Mr Carney should ponder the fate of the Chinese emperors, overwhelmed by forces they could not control because they could not bear to accept any criticism, and recognise that nothing so enhances authority as a dash \u2013 now and then \u2013 of humility.\u201d",

I have known all six of his predecessors as governor of the Bank of England and not one of them would have thought it proper to behave as he has done, particularly during the campaign when he joined in the chorus of scaremongering. He wasn\u2019t the worst but he shouldn\u2019t have joined in it at all. Now he is seeking to validate the improper remarks he made during the campaign. It is appalling and I think the sooner he stands down from the governorship, the better.</p> </blockquote> <p>On 6 October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/oct/05/theresa-may-speech-tory-conservative-conference-theresa-mays-speech-politics-live\">Theresa May criticised the BoE\u2019s decisions on monetary policy in her party conference speech</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While monetary policy \u2013 with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s public finances suffered a shock setback in September after a collapse in corporation tax receipts widened the budget deficit to \u00a310.6bn. A slowdown in the growth of VAT receipts was also blamed for pushing the deficit \u00a31.3bn, or 14.5%, higher than September last year and higher than the \u00a310.5bn recorded in August. City analysts, who had expected an \u00a38.5bn shortfall, warned that the figures were a setback for Philip Hammond as he prepares to boost public spending in his autumn statement next month. The chancellor is seeking ways to boost growth next year to cushion the economy against a widely expected slowdown following the Brexit vote. In recent months he has sent conflicting signals about the likely size and scope of extra spending to compensate for the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and forecasts of growth for next year that have halved from around 2.2% to nearer 1%. Immediately after the vote he ripped up George Osborne\u2019s fiscal rule of achieving a budget surplus by the end of the parliament, and talked about the need for extra spending to create jobs and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. But he has sought to dampen expectations by emphasising that he is constrained by volatile international money markets, which could drive up the government\u2019s borrowing costs if he is seen to be reckless. The weak September figures took the budget deficit to \u00a345bn for the first six months of the year, down nearly 5% from the same period in 2015. The Office for National Statistics said it could not offer a reason for the dive in corporation tax receipts. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said if the public finances continued on the current trend, then borrowing would overshoot the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR) forecast of \u00a355.5bn for the financial year by about \u00a317bn. He said: \u201cEven before the vote to leave the EU, the OBR\u2019s fiscal forecasts were looking optimistic. But the weaker economic prospects over the next few years as a result means that these forecasts are likely to be revised substantially in the autumn statement next month.\u201d Government expenditure since April has been kept in check, rising by \u00a35.9bn or 1.7%, to \u00a3348.7bn while tax receipts from the biggest sources of income \u2013 income tax and national insurance \u2013 increased at a faster pace. National insurance was 7% higher at \u00a359.3bn and income tax rose 2.7% to \u00a378.7bn. These improvements were undermined when the usually strong September corporation tax receipts proved much weaker, limiting the tax take to \u00a321bn in the first half of the year. The interest bill on the government\u2019s debts caused another headache for the Treasury after it increased by \u00a3800m, or 9%. The OBR said the rise in debt interest payments and a change in the monthly profile of contributions to the EU budget opened up a gap between central government expenditure and income to 4.5% from the first six months last year. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the rise in government borrowing underscored the weakness of the UK economy. \u201cThe UK\u2019s ability to generate tax revenue has diminished following the financial crisis, and this underlying weakness is likely to be exacerbated further if the UK economy slows as we predict,\u201d he said, adding it was vital the chancellor offered incentives to \u201cinvest, create jobs, and support growth\u201d. Hammond said: \u201cWe have already made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, reducing the deficit by almost two-thirds since 2010, but our debt and deficit remain too high. We remain committed to fiscal discipline and will return the budget to balance over a sensible period of time, in a way that allows us the space to support the economy as needed.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2017. An earlier version said incorrectly that corporation tax receipts fell in September to the lowest level since 2009.",

      "bodyText": "Intellectual capital has not featured prominently in the UK\u2019s Brexit debate. Media outlets and commentators have instead concentrated on UK trade and capital flows. Yet, as a key input for innovation and productivity, intellectual capital matters for maintaining the UK\u2019s prosperity and potential to grow. A hard Brexit that prioritises immigration controls over access to the single market poses several risks to the free flow of intellectual capital, in our view. This threatens to erode the competitive edge the UK has gained in key sectors intensive in science and technology. Intellectual capital is about people \u2013 their education, expertise and skills. But importantly, it encompasses intangible assets, such as software, research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities, as well as networks connecting universities, research partners and the corporate sector; it also includes property rights, such as patents and trademarks, which protect innovative products. Because it is largely intangible, measuring intellectual capital is difficult, yet it is crucial for a country\u2019s ability to innovate and become more productive. It generates new ideas and creative output methods, as well as the know-how to solve problems. It is also important for gaining and maintaining a nation\u2019s competitive edge, particularly for economies oriented to services and reliant on processing big data and information. Intellectual capital is key for the sort of innovation needed to improve the efficiency with which people and capital interact to produce output. Depending on the terms the UK negotiates, a hard Brexit may carry negative implications for the UK\u2019s wealth of intellectual capital, particularly in the area of research. The UK\u2019s business spend on R&amp;D is skewed towards hi-tech manufacturing (46%) and knowledge-intensive services (23%). This has given the country a competitive advantage in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, aerospace, transport equipment, information and communication technology, as well as business and financial services. This competitive advantage could be put at risk if Brexit reduces the UK economy\u2019s openness, particularly if it restricts the free movement of intellectual capital and investment associated with new technology and specialisation. The problem is not so much funding. While it is well known that the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, readers may be surprised to know that the UK is a net recipient of EU research funds. Remarkably, the UK is the country that receives the most EU funds allocated on a competitive basis (on par with the Netherlands and measured as a share of GDP), a testament to the excellence of the UK\u2019s research abilities. But these funds are small: net receipts represent only 0.2% of GDP. And even if no longer accessible in the future, depending on exit negotiations, they could conceivably be replaced by government funds or venture capital. A sizeable portion of the UK\u2019s R&amp;D funding is already financed by the private corporate sector. Perhaps a greater challenge is that the UK\u2019s ability to influence the direction of EU funding research could wane. If it negotiates the status of an \u201cassociated country\u201d, such as Norway, for example, it would still be able to participate in EU-funded projects, but without steering them and possibly subject to conditions (as in the case of Switzerland, which has a \u201cpartially associated country\u201d status). The biggest threat, in our view, comes from the prospective migration restrictions, which could impede international collaboration and erode the UK\u2019s ability to attract talent. International collaboration is key to academic and corporate sector research: it creates synergies, builds on the best expertise, provides access to equipment, reduces costs and facilitates the sharing of new ideas. With a hard Brexit, the UK\u2019s attractiveness to students, academic staff and researchers could diminish over time. It could also lessen the country\u2019s allure as a base for new, shared pan-European research infrastructure, many of which have found a home in the UK in the past because of its research competencies. The extent of the threat to intellectual capital depends on the formulation of the government\u2019s new rules (for example, whether a visa point-based system is introduced) and on what sort of Brexit deal will be negotiated. True, the UK can count on the advantage of the English language and an unrivalled business-friendly environment in the EU that is conducive to innovation and risk-taking, boasting low barriers to entrepreneurship, well-functioning institutions (including a good insolvency regime), and a healthy venture-capital system. This advantage will not dissipate quickly, but with a hard Brexit the UK risks the slow erosion of its competitiveness and of its appeal to investors as a base from which to access the EU market to scale activity internationally.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has become the latest senior Conservative to criticise the governor of the Bank of England, accusing Mark Carney of being intolerant of criticism and lacking in humility. Gove compared Carney to the Chinese emperor Ming whose \u201cperson was held to be inviolable and without imperfections\u201d and whose critics were flayed alive. Writing in the Times (\u00a3), Gove said: \u201c[Carney\u2019s] position is held to be independent and without any error. And so any criticism of his actions is regarded as a thought crime \u2013 and those who dare to question his rule are flayed in the press with dire warnings left hanging in the air to emphasise the governor will brook no challenge to his authority.\u201d Gove\u2019s attack on Carney follows comments by Theresa May in her recent Tory party conference speech in which she criticised low interest rates and money printing \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 for damaging returns for savers while making owners of assets richer. The prime minister said: \u201cA change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it.\u201d Carney rebuked May a week ago by saying the BoE, which operates independently of the government, would not take instruction from politicians. But on 18 October William Hague, the former foreign secretary, said central bankers could lose their independence if they ignored anger about low interest rates. Hague\u2019s intervention prompted talk of an effort by Conservatives to pass the blame for the economic consequences of Brexit to the BoE or to unsettle Carney, who is considering whether to remain as governor beyond his planned departure date of 2018. Gove, like Hague, raised the prospect of some kind of comeuppance for the governor. He said: \u201cMr Carney should ponder the fate of the Chinese emperors, overwhelmed by forces they could not control because they could not bear to accept any criticism, and recognise that nothing so enhances authority as a dash \u2013 now and then \u2013 of humility.\u201d The BoE cut interest rates to a then-record low of 0.5% after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 threatened to send the world economy into a depression. Ratesetters, led by Carney, cut borrowing costs to 0.25% in August and expanded its quantitative easing (QE) programme of buying up bonds to support economic activity. Gove said QE and August\u2019s rate cut were \u201cmisjudged\u201d and that May was right to say the BoE\u2019s policies had created significant economic problems. The BoE has suggested it could cut rates further, to about 0.1%, but Carney has said monetary policy has borne too heavy a burden and called on the government to use tax and spending to support the economy. The BoE\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, published a paper this week rebutting critics and arguing the BoE\u2019s response to the Brexit vote had reduced long-term borrowing costs for the government and business. Gove, the former justice secretary and Tory leadership candidate, who ridiculed experts when campaigning to leave the EU, cited research by two economists showing those who declare themselves experts are error-prone because they fail to acknowledge mistakes. His comments were ridiculed by Stephen King, an economic adviser to HSBC, and Roland Rudd, who chairs the Open Britain campaign to stay in the single market. Carney has faced criticism from other Conservatives during the referendum campaign and since. The backbencher William Rees-Mogg called on the governor to resign for warning about possible economic problems if there was a vote to leave the EU and Boris Johnson accused Carney of talking down the economy.",

    "webTitle": "Reckitt Benckiser sued by 35 US states for 'profiteering' from opioid treatment", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dozens of US states have accused a British multinational company of \u201cshamelessly preying on patients in need of help\u201d by profiteering from a drug at the forefront of combating America\u2019s opioid epidemic. Thirty-five states are suing Reckitt Benckiser for allegedly running \u201can unlawful, multi-pronged scheme\u201d using patent laws and false safety concerns to dominate the market and maintain an artificially high price for Suboxone, a drug used to fight addiction to prescription painkillers and heroin. Federal authorities have been investigating the company over similar issues for the past four years. In 2010, Reckitt \u2013 which manufactures well-known brands in the UK from household cleaners to Durex condoms \u2013 was fined after it admitted manipulating Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) to direct doctors away from a rival generic and toward one of its own more expensive drugs. Two years earlier a company whistleblower revealed memos that showed executives spoke about using safety and patent issues to maintain market dominance. The legal action comes amid federal investigations and congressional hearings into the escalating costs of treatments and life-saving drugs used to combat an opioid addiction crisis that has claimed more than 250,000 lives in the US over the past 15 years. Suboxone contains two drugs \u2013 a painkiller, buprenorphine, and an opiate blocker, naloxone \u2013 which were out of patent at the time the medicine came on to the market. But in 2002 Reckitt was granted a seven-year licence to exclusively sell Suboxone tablets because of its work devising and testing the drug. It went on to earn Reckitt hundreds of millions of dollars a year as the opioid crisis widened and the number of patients seeking treatment for painkiller or heroin addiction rose. Government programmes such as Medicaid met the cost of treatment for some people. The legal action by the states and the District of Columbia alleges that shortly before its Suboxone licence expired in 2009 the company conspired with a New Jersey firm, MonoSol RX, to create a new version of the drug as a film dissolved under the tongue. It has a patent until 2022. Reckitt is accused of having incrementally increased the price of its tablets until they were 50% more expensive than the film in order to encourage patients and doctors to switch. According to the lawsuit, once most prescriptions had moved to the film, the company took the tablets off the market. Reckitt then allegedly expressed \u201cunfounded concerns\u201d to the Food and Drug Administration about children getting access to Suboxone tablets in order to delay approval of generic versions of the drug. The company filed papers with the FDA claiming that the packaging for its film was more difficult for children to open than the bottles for Suboxone tablets. The safety claim was based on a single study paid for by Reckitt. The FDA took two years to reject the move and suggested that pills were probably safer than film. But by then Reckitt had ensured that 85% of prescriptions were written for the film version of Suboxone, earning it about $1bn a year \u2013 20% of the company\u2019s profits. The states taking legal action contend that this was a device to delay the sale of generic Suboxone tablets and allow Reckitt to keep the price of its film, and profits, artificially high. The company is facing questions as to why, if it believed selling Suboxone in bottles put children at risk, it did not act while it was still using them and why it continued to sell its pill version in bottles in other parts of the world. The US\u2019s Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of Reckitt in 2012. Two years later, Reckitt sold off Suboxone manufacturing as a new company, Indivior. In September, Senator Edward Markey wrote to the chair of the FTC, Edith Ramirez, requesting it to use \u201cthe full force of its authority to accelerate its investigation\u201d into whether the company and others have \u201cthwarted competition, unlawfully increased profits or illegally extended monopolies\u201d. Markey also accused it of attempting to stall the investigation by withholding thousands of documents from the FTC. Reckitt did not respond to a request for comment. Indivior, which is also named in the lawsuit, said: \u201cWe cannot comment in detail about pending litigation, but we disagree with a number of the claims made by the attorneys general, and we will contest this lawsuit vigorously.\u201d MonoSol Rx said the allegations \u201care wholly without merit and the suit is both factually and legally deficient\u201d. It said that Suboxone film \u201chas saved countless lives\u201d. It is not first time Reckitt has been accused of manipulating regulators with supposed concerns about safety and of using stalling tactics to hold up rival drugs. In 2008, leaked emails showed Reckitt employees discussing how to delay the introduction of a generic version of Gaviscon liquid, a heartburn remedy prescribed in large quantities by the UK\u2019s NHS. Reckitt internal documents revealed the existence of Project Eric, a secret plan by the company to manipulate doctors and regulators which a whistleblower said cost the NHS tens of millions of pounds. The memos revealed that Reckitt executives planned what they described as \u201ca clever idea\u201d to switch from Gaviscon liquid to an almost identical product with a different name. In one of the memos a manager said the company could use \u201cthe rationale of health and safety\u201d to design a slightly different product to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d. The new product was Gaviscon Advance, essentially the same as the liquid but with increased strength. A senior whistleblower from the drug company told the BBC at the time: \u201cReckitt cheated the National Health Service. It could have saved the NHS millions of pounds. But not just the NHS \u2013 patients, doctors. They\u2019ve cheated health professionals. I felt it had to be exposed.\u201d Reckitt denied doing so, saying it was \u201cunhappy with some of the language and the sentiment \u2026 in the internal correspondence which are inappropriate\u201d but said that the memos did not reflect its actions which were within the law. However, in 2010, Reckitt admitted manipulating the NHS computer system to direct doctors away from prescribing cheaper versions of Gaviscon by delisting the drug after its patent expired but before the generic came on the market. The result was that when doctors searched using the brand name it failed to show the generic alternative and instead directed them to Gaviscon Advance. The company admitted breaching UK and European competition law and was fined \u00a310m by Britain\u2019s Office of Fair Trading. In April 2016, Reckitt was fined by the Australian authorities over one of its painkillers, Nurofen. The company packaged the drug in different forms, claiming that each version targeted specific pains, such as migraine. It charged twice the price of the regular packets of Nurofen but they were identical products. An Australian court ordered Reckitt to pull the drugs from shops.",

The company <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.naabt.org/documents/Reckitt_Benckiser_Pharmaceuticals_Inc_2012_FDA_Citizen_Petition.pdf\">filed papers with the FDA</a> claiming that the packaging for its film was more difficult for children to open than the bottles for Suboxone tablets. The safety claim was based on a single study paid for by Reckitt. </p> <p>The FDA took two years to reject the move and suggested that pills were probably safer than film. But by then Reckitt had ensured that 85% of prescriptions were written for the film version of Suboxone, earning it about $1bn a year \u2013 20% of the company\u2019s profits.</p> <p>The states taking legal action contend that this was a device to delay the sale of generic Suboxone tablets and allow Reckitt to keep the price of its film, and profits, artificially high. The company is facing questions as to why, if it believed selling Suboxone in bottles put children at risk, it did not act while it was still using them and why it continued to sell its pill version in bottles in other parts of the world.</p> <p>The US\u2019s Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of Reckitt in 2012. Two years later, Reckitt sold off Suboxone manufacturing as a new company, Indivior. </p> <p>In September, Senator Edward Markey <a href=\"http://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LTR-FTC-Suboxone%20antitrust%209-27-16.pdf\">wrote to</a> the chair of the FTC, Edith Ramirez, requesting it to use \u201cthe full force of its authority to accelerate its investigation\u201d into whether the company and others have \u201cthwarted competition, unlawfully increased profits or illegally extended monopolies\u201d. Markey also accused it of attempting to stall the investigation by withholding thousands of documents from the FTC. </p> <p>Reckitt did not respond to a request for comment. Indivior, which is also named in the lawsuit, said: \u201cWe cannot comment in detail about pending litigation, but we disagree with a number of the claims made by the attorneys general, and we will contest this lawsuit vigorously.\u201d </p> <p>MonoSol Rx said the allegations \u201care wholly without merit and the suit is both factually and legally deficient\u201d. It said that Suboxone film \u201chas saved countless lives\u201d. </p> <p>It is not first time Reckitt has been accused of manipulating regulators with supposed concerns about safety and of using stalling tactics to hold up rival drugs. </p> <p>In 2008, leaked emails showed Reckitt employees discussing how to delay the introduction of a generic version of Gaviscon liquid, a heartburn remedy prescribed in large quantities by the UK\u2019s NHS. Reckitt internal documents <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/mar/07/health.nhs\">revealed the existence of Project Eric</a>, a secret plan by the company to manipulate doctors and regulators which a whistleblower said cost the NHS tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>The memos revealed that Reckitt executives planned what they described as \u201ca clever idea\u201d to switch from Gaviscon liquid to an almost identical product with a different name. In one of the memos a manager said the company could use \u201cthe rationale of health and safety\u201d to design a slightly different product to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d. The new product was Gaviscon Advance, essentially the same as the liquid but with increased strength. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-money-blog/2015/sep/27/daraprim-profiteering-cost-prescription-drugs-martin-shkreli\">Daraprim 'profiteering' controversy lifts lid on soaring cost of prescription drugs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A senior whistleblower from the drug company told the BBC at the time: \u201cReckitt cheated the National Health Service. It could have saved the NHS millions of pounds. But not just the NHS \u2013 patients, doctors. They\u2019ve cheated health professionals. I felt it had to be exposed.\u201d</p> <p>Reckitt denied doing so, saying it was \u201cunhappy with some of the language and the sentiment \u2026 in the internal correspondence which are inappropriate\u201d but said that the memos did not reflect its actions which were within the law. </p> <p>However, in 2010, Reckitt admitted manipulating the NHS computer system to direct doctors away from prescribing cheaper versions of Gaviscon by delisting the drug after its patent expired but before the generic came on the market. The result was that when doctors searched using the brand name it failed to show the generic alternative and instead directed them to Gaviscon Advance. The company admitted breaching UK and European competition law and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/15/reckitt-benckiser-fined-oft-gaviscon\">was fined</a> \u00a310m by Britain\u2019s Office of Fair Trading. </p> <p>In April 2016, Reckitt was fined by the Australian authorities over one of its painkillers, Nurofen. The company packaged the drug in different forms, claiming that each version targeted specific pains, such as migraine. It charged twice the price of the regular packets of Nurofen but they were identical products. An Australian court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/nurofens-maker-admits-misleading-consumers-over-contents-in-painkillers\">ordered Reckitt</a> to pull the drugs from shops.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eight employees of BHP Billiton face criminal charges over the Samarco dam collapse a year ago that left 19 people dead and hundreds homeless, amid accusations that the company put profit before safety. Brazilian prosecutors on Thursday charged 26 people, 21 for qualified homicide, for their alleged roles in the disaster, which sent a tidal wave of mining waste hundreds of miles through the Minas Gerais region in November 2015. Prosecutors claimed that employees of BHP and Vale, who jointly owned the Samarco mine, knew the dam could fail but prioritised their profits over the safety of local people. \u201cWe are yet to receive formal notification of these proceedings,\u201d said BHP, adding that employees and former staff at the company and its Brazilian subsidiary had been charged. \u201cBHP Billiton Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the affected individuals. \u201cWe will defend the charges against the company, and fully support each of the affected individuals in their defence of the charges against them.\u201d The charges, filed before the federal courts of Ponte Nova in Minas Gerais, have been laid against BHP\u2019s eight representatives on the Samarco board, including three who have since left the company. BHP is expected to argue it could not have predicted the disaster and that the safety of the dam was monitored and advised on by external experts. The criminal charges came as BHP Billiton admitted it has \u201cmore to do\u201d to compensate those affected by the disaster but warned that \u201cridiculous claims\u201d could cost local people jobs. Chief executive Andrew Mackenzie faced a stormy annual shareholder meeting in London on Thursday, including colourful protests outside the event, as the board was grilled for hours over its environmental and safety record. Chairman Jac Nasser also announced his impending retirement, saying he had delayed the decision in order to help steer the clean-up effort after the 5 November 2015 collapse of the dam. Despite BHP\u2019s effort to show contrition, representatives of villages where 19 people were killed, hundreds left homeless and large areas of farmland destroyed said they were not satisfied. Responding to claims that many people were still awaiting compensation more than a year later, Nasser said this was partly the result of the company\u2019s efforts to respond as quickly as possible. \u201cAs fast as we were, and as effective as the group has been, you miss some things,\u201d said Nasser. \u201cWe know that we have more to do.\u201d Mackenzie added: \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019re not done registering people to be compensated or paying out the compensation.\u201d He said BHP, which has so far booked $2.2bn (\u00a31.8bn) of costs linked to the accident, had issued 7,000 \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d cards that allow affected people to buy food, adding that the firm had made a \u201csuperhuman effort\u201d to support people. But campaigners who travelled from Brazil to air their grievances accused the company of dragging its feet over compensation, given that nearly a year has passed since the accident. Maria do Carmo Dangelo, a farmer whose land was hit by a wall of mud some 45 miles from the dam, said: \u201cI lost my land and my parents lost everything. My family has lost its income, which came from producing milk. I haven\u2019t received any compensation,\u201d she said. Asked about the answers BHP gave at the annual meeting she said: \u201cI expected something more concrete.\u201d She said she was indignant at the firm\u2019s claim that the speed of its response to the disaster was to blame for the fact that she and others are still awaiting compensation. Rodrigo de Castro Am\u00e9d\u00e9e P\u00e9ret, a Franciscan friar from the area, said BHP should involve local people more in decision-making about compensation and the clean-up. \u201cThey [victims] don\u2019t want only to be consulted, they want to have active participation in the decisions,\u201d he said. Peret added that it was currently up to the company to decide who had been affected by the disaster, leaving some victims in danger of missing out. Dean Dalla Valle, BHP\u2019s chief commercial officer, said he hoped that the mine, which employed about 6,000 people in the Minas Gerais region, could win approval to reopen next year. He said this would depend on factors including negotiations with the national and regional government about environmental penalties and permits. But he warned that while the firm was committed to paying compensation, \u201cridiculous claims\u201d could threaten the Samarco dam\u2019s survival. The annual meeting came 24 hours after BHP promised to aim for a 50:50 ratio of men to women in the company by 2025.",
