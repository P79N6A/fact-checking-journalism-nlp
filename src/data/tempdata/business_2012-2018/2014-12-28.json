      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s ten biggest housebuilders will see profits climb to more than \u00a32bn this year despite the industry falling far short of local government targets on affordable homes. While profits surge back to levels not seen since the last credit-fuelled property boom, the number of affordable homes built in England has fallen to an eight-year low. Analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shows that the country\u2019s biggest builders, who between them control enough land to create 480,000 homes, will make pretax profits of more than \u00a32.1bn in 2014 \u2013 a 34% jump on last year. The total is based on reported and projected profits for firms including Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt, many of which have seen sales boosted by the government\u2019s Help to Buy schemes. The return to pre-crash profit levels comes as official figures forecast 42,710 affordable homes will be built in England in the year to April \u2013 the lowest number since 2006, and a 26% fall since 2010. Jon Sparkes chief executive of homeless campaign group Crisis, said: \u201cAt a time when the country faces a housing crisis and with homelessness having risen significantly in recent years, we desperately need developers to provide more affordable homes.\u201d Steve Turner of the Home Builders Federation whose members account for 80% of houses built in England and Wales, said: \u201cThe industry was devastated in the financial crash, profits initially fell very steeply, or disappeared into losses, and many companies disappeared. Only now are profits returning to pre-crash levels allowing companies to rebuild, restructure and replace lost capacity.\u201d Affordability campaigners suggest part of the reason why developers have failed to achieve targets for cheaper homes is to be found in an opaque part of the planning system, known as the financial viability test. This is widely used by housebuilders to reduce, perfectly legally, the number of affordable homes to below local authority targets. More than half of affordable homes in England are built by private developers through what is known as the Section 106 system, in which tests of financial viability are key. These assessments form the basis of negotiations with local authorities when developers want to reduce the number of low-cost homes below the local authority\u2019s targets. Targets typically range between 25% and 40% of the total number of homes in a scheme and are set according to local housing need. The assessment works by combining all the costs linked to a housing development, including a 20% margin for the developer but excluding the land price. These costs are then subtracted from a scheme\u2019s projected sales revenue based on current values. If the resulting total is not much higher than its current use value, the scheme is likely to be considered unviable by developers who will then argue the number of affordable homes required must be cut. This means assumptions on sales and costs are crucial. The bureau\u2019s research has found that: \u2022 The process is shrouded in secrecy with many developers regularly refusing to disclose to the public the assessments on which their figures are based. \u2022 Councils rarely employ external experts to scrutinise housebuilders\u2019 figures contained in financial viability submissions. \u2022 Sales projections used in viability assessments are frozen at the time a scheme receives planning consent preventing the council from sharing in any benefit from rising house prices. Housing campaign groups point to 1.4m households on council waiting lists \u2013 a 34% rise since 1997 \u2013 and 85,000 children living in temporary accommodation, equivalent to more than the entire population of the Hertfordshire town of Stevenage. They argue the government now has to put pressure on builders to meet affordable housing targets. Joanna Kennedy, chief executive of housing and welfare campaign group Z2K, said: \u201cIf Whitehall genuinely wants to tackle the housing crisis they should be supporting boroughs in challenging developers\u2019 questionable viability assessments, instead of undermining council\u2019s efforts to secure planning gain through section 106.\u201d A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \u201cIt is for local authorities to agree an appropriate level of contribution to affordable housing with developers.Our guidance is clear that changes in costs and property value should be considered in longer term developments, and councils should use appropriate methods and expertise, whether in-house or external, to determine these.\u201d",

The problem, however, was that they could not tell the architects and designers they talked to what they wanted done to their four-bedroom property from the images that were in their head.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the right terminology,\u201d says Tatarko. \u201cMost of us are not professionals from the industry. We are not designers or architects or contractors, so when people came to our house and asked us, \u2018Would you like to have \u2026 coffered ceilings here?\u2019, we looked at them and said, \u2018What?\u2019 We started digging in books and magazines and reading a lot and trying to educate ourselves but the whole process was really difficult.\u201d</p> <p>From that frustration has emerged <a href=\"http://www.houzz.co.uk/?irb=1\" title=\"\">Houzz</a>, a website and app that acts as a hub for home improvement, featuring seemingly countless pictures of the insides and outside of homes and flats, which can be flicked through until something catches the eye. The rapid rise over the past five years of the Californian company has led it to an estimated value of more than $2bn (\u00a31.3bn), with Tatarko and Cohen now listed among the tech sector\u2019s power couples.</p> <p>The galleries of living rooms, gardens and extensions are mostly put up by architects, builders and interior decorators. The site includes details of lamps, beds and tables used to create the effect \u2013 in effect, the portfolios of home improvement professionals. On the other side is the Houzz \u201ccommunity\u201d of 25 million users, who use the galleries to find what they are looking for, or to link up with professionals.</p> <p>The site is designed to bridge the gap between homeowners frustrated at being unable to explain what they want and professionals struggling to interpret clients\u2019 ideas.</p> <p>\u201cThe first users of Houzz were 20 parents from our kids\u2019 school, who we talked to and we said it would be wonderful if we could talk to each other and share ideas, and see ideas and talk to professionals and have it all very visual and have the technology,\u201d says Tatarko, who started Houzz in the San Francisco Bay area in 2009.</p> <p>\u201cProfessionals were also frustrated. They said, \u2018Well you\u2019 \u2013 pointing to us as homeowners \u2013 \u2018you think that you see a picture in a magazine and then you call us and you want to have something similar. Unfortunately what you see in the picture cost somebody hundreds of thousands of dollars but you say that you only have a $20,000 budget. Or what you see there is meant to work in a very big house but you have a very small house \u2013 that is not going to work.\u2019 They said somebody needs to educate homeowners because their expectations are not realistic.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to remove the barriers between homeowners and great design, and make the whole process way more fun and productive by applying technology.\u201d</p> <p>Tatarko and Cohen had no marketing budget and their business was running on only $2,000 a month, but the idea soon spread by word of mouth outside of California and across the US. The couple built a network of professionals and users before they decided in the autumn of 2010 to commit to the business fully themselves, hire staff and seek investment to expand.</p> <p>By 2013, more than one-third of the users were from outside the US. A London office was opened last summer, and the UK network now numbers 15,000 tradespeople, designers and architects, and 1.5 million users.</p> <p>Algorithms dictate what style of room and furnishings appear when users search galleries on the site, while there are tags to identify and buy pieces of furniture or pinpoint the type of paint used in a room. Typically, professionals such as builders or lighting specialists upload their own pictures, but householders who have had their own home renovated also put up galleries of the finished project. Users create \u201cideabooks\u201d of their favourite posts and can ask questions about, for example, where a desk was sourced or what type of wood was used.</p> <p>After the US, Houzz expanded to Australia, Germany and France as well as the UK \u2013 adapting to cultural differences along the way, such as swapping \u201celevator\u201d for \u201clift\u201d. Tatarko and Cohen now intend to move into Japan.</p> <p>\u201cI can see something that someone is doing in Australia and say, \u2018This is exactly what I want to do here, and I don\u2019t care that nobody did it in my neighbourhood before \u2013 as long it is doable, I am going to do it,\u2019 \u201d says Tatarko. An unexpected side-effect of the international expansion, she adds, is that architects and other professionals are getting jobs outside of their own country.</p> <p>From being run on a shoestring by the couple from their home, Houzz has attracted in excess of $200m in investment. Revenues come from advertising by home furnishing and improvement companies, professionals registering their services, and the commission from sales of items such as lamps and chairs.</p> <p>Despite some of the elaborate houses on the site, Tatarko says that Houzz aims to cater for all types of home decorator, from those trying to renovate a mansion to someone who is fitting out a one-bedroom flat on a modest budget. The philosophy of the company dictates that it stays away from celebrity homes and focuses on realistic ideas about what people can do to their properties.</p> <h2>Houzz-eye view of Britain <br></h2> <p>Unsurprisingly, when British users went to the site, they tended to type in \u201csmall\u201d as a reference term, reflecting the more limited space available compared with homes in the US.</p> <p>Adi Tatarko says that the trend for building down into basements, which has caused neighbour disputes because of the disruption involved, is clear in some of the content appearing on Houzz from the UK. \u201cBecause there is not enough space, people are either going up or down and trying to add to basements, or going up the top. But sometimes they do have a little space in the backyard.\u201d</p> <p>Other trends in the UK, she says, include \u201cglass box\u201d extensions \u2013 sometimes featuring glass walls and ceilings.</p>",

A London office was opened last summer, and the UK network now numbers 15,000 tradespeople, designers and architects, and 1.5 million users. Algorithms dictate what style of room and furnishings appear when users search galleries on the site, while there are tags to identify and buy pieces of furniture or pinpoint the type of paint used in a room. Typically, professionals such as builders or lighting specialists upload their own pictures, but householders who have had their own home renovated also put up galleries of the finished project. Users create \u201cideabooks\u201d of their favourite posts and can ask questions about, for example, where a desk was sourced or what type of wood was used. After the US, Houzz expanded to Australia, Germany and France as well as the UK \u2013 adapting to cultural differences along the way, such as swapping \u201celevator\u201d for \u201clift\u201d. Tatarko and Cohen now intend to move into Japan. \u201cI can see something that someone is doing in Australia and say, \u2018This is exactly what I want to do here, and I don\u2019t care that nobody did it in my neighbourhood before \u2013 as long it is doable, I am going to do it,\u2019 \u201d says Tatarko. An unexpected side-effect of the international expansion, she adds, is that architects and other professionals are getting jobs outside of their own country. From being run on a shoestring by the couple from their home, Houzz has attracted in excess of $200m in investment. Revenues come from advertising by home furnishing and improvement companies, professionals registering their services, and the commission from sales of items such as lamps and chairs. Despite some of the elaborate houses on the site, Tatarko says that Houzz aims to cater for all types of home decorator, from those trying to renovate a mansion to someone who is fitting out a one-bedroom flat on a modest budget. The philosophy of the company dictates that it stays away from celebrity homes and focuses on realistic ideas about what people can do to their properties. Houzz-eye view of Britain Unsurprisingly, when British users went to the site, they tended to type in \u201csmall\u201d as a reference term, reflecting the more limited space available compared with homes in the US. Adi Tatarko says that the trend for building down into basements, which has caused neighbour disputes because of the disruption involved, is clear in some of the content appearing on Houzz from the UK. \u201cBecause there is not enough space, people are either going up or down and trying to add to basements, or going up the top. But sometimes they do have a little space in the backyard.\u201d Other trends in the UK, she says, include \u201cglass box\u201d extensions \u2013 sometimes featuring glass walls and ceilings.",

If he fails to secure 180 votes, there will be a snap election that the anti-austerity Syriza party is currently favourite to win. That would prompt fears of a fresh leg to Europe\u2019s debt crisis, which began in Greece more than six years ago.</p> <p>This is something Europe can ill afford. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/04/ecb-cuts-eurozone-growth-forecasts-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">eurozone economy is barely growing</a>; the German locomotive is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/14/germany-france-eurozone-gdp\" title=\"\">slowing</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/16/uk-inflation-falls-12-year-low\" title=\"\">falling oil prices</a> bring with them the threat of deflation. The issue for the European Central Bank in 2015 is whether to take the plunge with a quantitative easing programme, something the Germans have resisted up until now.</p> <p>Berlin\u2019s hardline stance has, however, softened in recent months as the situation in Russia \u2013 the key emerging market to watch \u2013 has deteriorated. Europe\u2019s trade links with Russia are not all that important, but there are two big concerns. The first is of heightened geopolitical risk. Russia is being squeezed by western sanctions and now faces the inevitability of a deep recession in 2015. This might make Vladimir Putin more willing to come to terms over Ukraine, but it might not.</p> <p>The second risk is that the collapse of the rouble puts intolerable strain on Russian companies and Russian banks, with corporate losses ricocheting through the entire global financial system through the sort of highly leveraged derivatives trades that caused the 2007 meltdown.</p> <p>With so much cheap money sloshing around the global markets, a second financial crisis cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>The third E is equality, brought to prominence in the past year not just by the bestselling book <em>Capital</em> by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/22/we-need-a-wealth-tax-thomas-piketty-2014s-most-influential-thinker\" title=\"\">French economist Thomas Piketty</a>, but by evidence from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that inequality is bad for growth. Standing trickle-down economics on its head, the OECD said recently that UK growth in the two decades from 1990 to 2010 would have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/09/revealed-wealth-gap-oecd-report\" title=\"\">nine percentage points higher</a> had it not been for widening inequality.</p> <p>Given that the trend towards greater inequality has been evident for the past three decades, it is worth asking why it has become a political issue now. The answer is simple. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, incomes were rising across the board. People on low and middle incomes didn\u2019t mind all that much that the bankers and hedge fund owners were earning stratospheric sums when their own pay packets were going up.</p> <p>But the squeeze on real incomes during the crash and in its aftermath has been brutal. That\u2019s why the fourth E \u2013 earnings \u2013 will be such a big issue at the general election. Research out today by the Resolution Foundation shows there is both good and bad news for George Osborne.</p> <p>The good news is that real earnings are rising. Falling unemployment, lower inflation and a higher minimum wage have all helped to make workers better off. The bad news is that it will take until the end of the decade to recoup all the lost ground. The election may hinge on the answer to two questions. Labour\u2019s will be: are you better off than you were five years ago? The Conservatives\u2019 will be: do you think you will be better off under Labour?</p> <h2>Takeover problem still needs a cure<br></h2> <p>One of the big UK corporate stories of the year has not quite been resolved. We don\u2019t know if US pharmaceutical group Pfizer will return in 2015, or thereafter, to have another go at hustling British rival AstraZeneca into a takeover. It\u2019s a shame, then, that the debate about the UK\u2019s easy takeover regime was also left unresolved. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/26/pfizer-abandons-attempt-astrazeneca-pharmaceutical\" title=\"\">Pfizer departed</a> \u2013 defeated by the AstraZeneca board\u2019s demand for a higher price \u2013 the politicians lost interest. That is unfortunate since it is hard, and probably misguided, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/13/vince-cable-foreign-firms-takeover-promises-uk\" title=\"\">make policy on the hoof</a>.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not forget what nearly happened. A successful UK-based pharmaceutical company came close to being swallowed by a US rival with a record, over many years and over many acquisitions, of putting cost-cutting before investment in original scientific research. David Cameron extracted a few <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/10/pfizer-chief-astrazeneca-takeover-win-win-society\" title=\"\">pledges from Pfizer</a> about its commitment to the UK. But it was unconvincing stuff.</p> <p>If the government is serious about protecting the UK\u2019s scientific base, it would be sensible to make provision now for such takeovers to be blocked. Calls for a national-interest test tend to provoke screams of outrage from business lobbyists. Politicians will end up repeating doomed experiments from the 1970s in picking winners, they argue.</p> <p>Nonsense. A thriving scientific base is central to how the UK earns its living in the 21st century. It could be woefully counterproductive to allow a company like AstraZeneca, accounting for 9% of R&amp;D spending in the UK, to fall into foreign ownership.</p> <p>Not all foreign owners are alike, of course, and it would be absurd to argue that all takeover bids from overseas are unwelcome. But there ought to be a mechanism for blocking those that, like Pfizer\u2019s, lack commercial logic. Ministers could distance themselves by appointing a council of wise heads to provide advice.</p> <p>Ed Miliband, as he casts around for a coherent approach to business, ought to get a formal policy in place now. Pfizer may never return, and the Labour leader may never make it to Downing Street. But best to be prepared.</p> <h2>BT could queer Sky\u2019s football pitch<br></h2> <p>Among football purists it is a well-established gripe that wWhile the multibillion-pound Premier League franchise brings glitz and big names to the national sport, it has produced victims too: the neglect of the grassroots game and the underperformance of the national team. Next year Sky could be added to the list, if the latest TV rights sale reduces the satellite broadcaster to a marginal figure in the game. BT dented Sky by taking two of the seven Premier League packages <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/13/premier-league-tv-rights-3-billion-sky-bt\" title=\"\">last time around </a> and then inflicted a sharp commercial blow by winning exclusive broadcast rights to the Champions League. Should BT win the lion\u2019s share of Premier League rights this time, Sky will lose a key factor in recruiting subscribers just when it faces the rising threat of Virgin Media and BT with their \u201cquad play\u201d offering of home phone, mobile, internet and TV. Next year could be the toughest in Sky\u2019s 25-year history.</p>",

If he fails to secure 180 votes, there will be a snap election that the anti-austerity Syriza party is currently favourite to win. That would prompt fears of a fresh leg to Europe\u2019s debt crisis, which began in Greece more than six years ago. This is something Europe can ill afford. The eurozone economy is barely growing; the German locomotive is slowing; and falling oil prices bring with them the threat of deflation. The issue for the European Central Bank in 2015 is whether to take the plunge with a quantitative easing programme, something the Germans have resisted up until now. Berlin\u2019s hardline stance has, however, softened in recent months as the situation in Russia \u2013 the key emerging market to watch \u2013 has deteriorated. Europe\u2019s trade links with Russia are not all that important, but there are two big concerns. The first is of heightened geopolitical risk. Russia is being squeezed by western sanctions and now faces the inevitability of a deep recession in 2015. This might make Vladimir Putin more willing to come to terms over Ukraine, but it might not. The second risk is that the collapse of the rouble puts intolerable strain on Russian companies and Russian banks, with corporate losses ricocheting through the entire global financial system through the sort of highly leveraged derivatives trades that caused the 2007 meltdown. With so much cheap money sloshing around the global markets, a second financial crisis cannot be ruled out. The third E is equality, brought to prominence in the past year not just by the bestselling book Capital by the French economist Thomas Piketty, but by evidence from the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that inequality is bad for growth. Standing trickle-down economics on its head, the OECD said recently that UK growth in the two decades from 1990 to 2010 would have been nine percentage points higher had it not been for widening inequality. Given that the trend towards greater inequality has been evident for the past three decades, it is worth asking why it has become a political issue now. The answer is simple. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, incomes were rising across the board. People on low and middle incomes didn\u2019t mind all that much that the bankers and hedge fund owners were earning stratospheric sums when their own pay packets were going up. But the squeeze on real incomes during the crash and in its aftermath has been brutal. That\u2019s why the fourth E \u2013 earnings \u2013 will be such a big issue at the general election. Research out today by the Resolution Foundation shows there is both good and bad news for George Osborne. The good news is that real earnings are rising. Falling unemployment, lower inflation and a higher minimum wage have all helped to make workers better off. The bad news is that it will take until the end of the decade to recoup all the lost ground. The election may hinge on the answer to two questions. Labour\u2019s will be: are you better off than you were five years ago? The Conservatives\u2019 will be: do you think you will be better off under Labour? Takeover problem still needs a cure One of the big UK corporate stories of the year has not quite been resolved. We don\u2019t know if US pharmaceutical group Pfizer will return in 2015, or thereafter, to have another go at hustling British rival AstraZeneca into a takeover. It\u2019s a shame, then, that the debate about the UK\u2019s easy takeover regime was also left unresolved. When Pfizer departed \u2013 defeated by the AstraZeneca board\u2019s demand for a higher price \u2013 the politicians lost interest. That is unfortunate since it is hard, and probably misguided, to make policy on the hoof. But let\u2019s not forget what nearly happened. A successful UK-based pharmaceutical company came close to being swallowed by a US rival with a record, over many years and over many acquisitions, of putting cost-cutting before investment in original scientific research. David Cameron extracted a few pledges from Pfizer about its commitment to the UK. But it was unconvincing stuff. If the government is serious about protecting the UK\u2019s scientific base, it would be sensible to make provision now for such takeovers to be blocked. Calls for a national-interest test tend to provoke screams of outrage from business lobbyists. Politicians will end up repeating doomed experiments from the 1970s in picking winners, they argue. Nonsense. A thriving scientific base is central to how the UK earns its living in the 21st century. It could be woefully counterproductive to allow a company like AstraZeneca, accounting for 9% of R&amp;D spending in the UK, to fall into foreign ownership. Not all foreign owners are alike, of course, and it would be absurd to argue that all takeover bids from overseas are unwelcome. But there ought to be a mechanism for blocking those that, like Pfizer\u2019s, lack commercial logic. Ministers could distance themselves by appointing a council of wise heads to provide advice. Ed Miliband, as he casts around for a coherent approach to business, ought to get a formal policy in place now. Pfizer may never return, and the Labour leader may never make it to Downing Street. But best to be prepared. BT could queer Sky\u2019s football pitch Among football purists it is a well-established gripe that wWhile the multibillion-pound Premier League franchise brings glitz and big names to the national sport, it has produced victims too: the neglect of the grassroots game and the underperformance of the national team. Next year Sky could be added to the list, if the latest TV rights sale reduces the satellite broadcaster to a marginal figure in the game. BT dented Sky by taking two of the seven Premier League packages last time around and then inflicted a sharp commercial blow by winning exclusive broadcast rights to the Champions League. Should BT win the lion\u2019s share of Premier League rights this time, Sky will lose a key factor in recruiting subscribers just when it faces the rising threat of Virgin Media and BT with their \u201cquad play\u201d offering of home phone, mobile, internet and TV. Next year could be the toughest in Sky\u2019s 25-year history.",

Once Biffen, a popular figure with journalists, had been described by Bernard Ingham \u2013 Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Alastair Campbell \u2013 as \u201csemi-detached\u201d, his days were numbered. Fast forward and we find the present chief secretary, Danny Alexander, is also proving to be semi-detached. He has had several run-ins, but last week he excelled himself by accusing his chancellor of being bent on the \u2018\u201cwilful destruction of important parts of our public services\u201d. He is, of course, quite right. Despite his affable manner on big occasions, David Cameron seems to have lost the confidence of most people I meet. But until recently, people entertained a reluctant admiration for George Osborne\u2019s perceived political skills. No longer, it seems. His relentless attack on the public services, with promises of lots more to come, has frightened the horses and offered an opportunity for Labour. For, whatever Ed Miliband and Ed Balls may feel it necessary to say to appease the Conservative press, they are emphatically not intent on a policy of damaging public services to finance even more tax cuts for the rich. Quite apart from the questionable morality of what he\u2019s up to, Osborne has exposed a flank to a Labour party in need of a new line of attack. Now it is difficult to see how Cameron or Osborne can fire the chief secretary. For one thing, he has gone along with their programme so far, and the dispute relates to policies for the next parliament. For another, Alexander is a Liberal Democrat, an important coalition partner. However, in effect, the May election campaign has begun, and relations between the Tories and Lib Dems are likely to become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, Osborne has other problems. His boast that the UK\u2019s was the fastest-growing economy in the group of seven leading industrial nations was always based on some adventurous interpretations of the comparison with the US. But the latest revisions from the Office for National Statistics have completely destroyed his claim. In the third quarter of this year, the US economy was expanding at an annual rate of 5% (in real terms, after allowing for inflation), while the UK figure was 2.6%. Even the Australian economy was expanding faster. Furthermore, latest figures demonstrate that the balance of payments position is sensationally bad, showing a current account deficit of 6% in the third quarter. I have long argued that the chancellor has been obsessed with the wrong deficit. What matters is the balance of the economy, not the budget. The overseas trading position reflects the combination of our productive capacity, our ability to export, and our appetite for imports. Decent levels of productivity allow for respectable rates of growth which, in turn, offer the solution to concerns about budget deficits. This has long been a neglected area of our economy and the publication of a new book by a former director of the National Economic Development Office brings back memories of when the neglect began and the rot set in. Younger readers can be forgiven for wondering what Nedo is, or rather was. It was a well-intentioned body that brought government, industry and unions together in an effort to improve the nation\u2019s productivity. Nedo was wound up by the Thatcher government as part of the reaction to the perceived failure of the economic policies of the 1970s. Sir Ronald McIntosh was director of Nedo during those turbulent times. Indeed, the sprightly 95-year-old has made Turbulent Times the title of his memoirs (Biteback Publishing). It is a pity they did not come out earlier. Perhaps the present chancellor would have benefited from Sir Ronald\u2019s advice to a previous occupant of his office: \u201cCuts in public expenditure are deflationary and the last thing this country needs just now is another dose of deflation ... deflationary action at home is bound to depress investment intentions.\u201d This is precisely what happened when Osborne embarked in 2010 on his so-called \u201clong-term plan\u201d. As my old friend David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says: \u201cThe stark revision in annual growth confirms that the pace of recovery is slowing. The most concerning aspect of these figures is that the current [balance of payments] deficit has risen to an unsustainably high level \u2013 owing to the fall in net investment... further efforts are needed to boost business investment and to help businesses export.\u201d Yes, Osborne\u2019s strategy has been shown up for what it is: a mess. It is the season of goodwill, but I find it difficult to feel sorry for this cocky chancellor. I recall a lunch I had with Biffen after he had been sacked by Thatcher and, some years later, she herself was in serious trouble with the party. I remarked, somewhat carelessly: \u201cMrs Thatcher must be suffering.\u201d He stared for ages at his plate and replied: \u201cYes \u2013 but is she suffering enough?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After vintage years in 2012 and 2013, the committee of the Observer\u2019s business awards annual lunch was concerned whether the industry could again deliver such a ripe crop of farce, scandal and crookery again in 2014. We should have had more confidence. When the Rev Paul Flowers again opened proceedings by saying grace, the judges knew they would be facing some chewy passages \u2013 in addition to the rather average boeuf bourguignon mains. Apart from the reverend, the gathering consisted of some of the usual esteemed panel. One-time rogue trader Nick Leeson, plus former banking legend and knight Fred Goodwin were retained; but retired Lehman Brothers boss Dick Fuld was replaced by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, who arrived fresh from attending the riotous Black Friday sales, where he insisted everything was progressing serenely \u2013 although he could not comment on what might have taken place after his departure. Meanwhile, Asil Nadir, who had given years of service to the committee \u2013 first via the medium of a reverse charge phone call to northern Cyprus, and then while being patched in via a public telephone inside Belmarsh \u2013 stepped down. He was replaced by former minister-turned-broadcaster David Mellor, who arrived in a cab booked via his Uber app, while the former Ponzi Endowment for Financial Services was replaced with a new award bearing the old rascal\u2019s name (Nadir\u2019s, not Mellor\u2019s). Asil Nadir silver hacksaw This had always been a much sought-after prize, during its former life as a gong for sharp practice in the financial services sector. But the competition really hotted up now it\u2019s awarded to businessmen spending \u2013 or preparing to spend \u2013 time within the confines of a state\u2019s more secure establishments. The year ended with arrests of those accused of rigging foreign exchange markets, which may or may not produce a bumper crop for 2015. But of those convicted in 2014 the judges paid particular tribute to Julian Rifat \u2013 a former trader at hedge fund Moore Capital \u2013 who faces prison after pleading guilty to insider dealing in November. The panel also commended Mathew Martoma, a former Wall Street portfolio manager at SAC Capital, who was sentenced to nine years in prison in September for insider dealing and forced to forfeit $9.38m. However, the judges had little doubt that this year\u2019s winner had to be Chris Ronnie, the former chief executive of JJB Sports, jailed in December for pocketing \u00a31m in a \u201cvery greedy\u201d fraud \u2013 which involved taking money from two suppliers, some of which the tycoon spent on property in Florida. Apart from the details of the crime, the judges were particularly taken with the notion that the four-year stretch made the former executive the second most famous Ronnie to do a spell of porridge. Jeremy Clarkson award for foreign relations An incredibly competitive field this year, which saw entries from the likes of Vladimir Putin for his work in central Europe, Kim Jong-un for winding up President Obama (and George Clooney) over North Korea\u2019s alleged hack at Sony, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission and former prime minister of Luxembourg, for somehow turning most of Europe against him, following revelations of work the grand duchy had been doing around tax avoidance in cahoots with accountants PwC. Still, the judges were unanimous that the prize should be presented to Andy Street, the managing director of John Lewis, for a courageous portrait of France, which he described as \u201csclerotic, hopeless and downbeat\u201d, before advising British entrepreneurs doing business in the country to pull out. Just to make sure he scooped the gong, Street added that France was \u201cfinished\u201d, and that: \u201cI have never been to a country more ill at ease\u2026 nothing works and nobody cares about it.\u201d His tirade seemed to be motivated by a business trip to Paris, which included a return journey to London on a delayed Eurostar train from Paris Gare du Nord (\u201cthe squalor pit of Europe,\u201d he fumed). It is not known if, when making the remarks, drink had been taken. Kevin Pietersen diamond earring for abrupt departures Oracle founder and erstwhile richest man on the planet, Larry Ellison, announced in September that he was stepping down from the software company he had created, which in turn created a problem for all of those who love the old Silicon Valley gag that Oracle actually stands for: One Raging Asshole Called Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, Ellison\u2019s compatriot Bill Gross, the legendary bond trader who can provoke similar tributes from former colleagues, also left the firm he\u2019d created \u2013 Pimco, the world\u2019s largest bond trader - and quickly re-emerged at rival Janus. However, the judges thought there were two standout entries in this category. Firstly Euan Sutherland, the former boss of the Co-op Group, who shocked the business world in March by leaving shortly after his heroic pay package was leaked to the Observer. And secondly, November\u2019s news of Harriet Green\u2019s departure from Thomas Cook. Green got the nod, partly because the committee had been informed of a City pact which compelled at least one organisation to give her an award every calendar month. But she also triumphed because of the sheer cheek of the PR effort that went into pretending her departure had been agreed, after just two years at the helm. That was despite Green musing five days before her ousting: \u201cYou can\u2019t do a transformation on this sort of scale in a year or two years. I usually say it\u2019s about six years... we\u2019re absolutely not done.\u201d But it turned out that she absolutely was. Mr Burns award for pay restraint Pay has been a major issue since the financial crisis. Yet no matter how much the general public moans about it, company chairman after chairman (and executive after executive) nods in agreement at the arguments for restraint, but then carefully explains how all of those valid points do not apply to them and their companies. They make extraordinary awards for their extraordinary executives, they say, and nothing has ever gone wrong with such a justification. Still, the issue gets debated again and again. Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley was at it again in 2014, with the support of his biddable board who seem to believe the founder\u2019s line that he can\u2019t possibly be motivated to do his best for the firm without the chance to trouser more shares (already owning more than half the company doesn\u2019t quite cut it). Then there was Christopher Bailey, the new man at the top of fashion brand Burberry, who is now about one year (and one pay revolt) into his new job. His board thought that his brilliance deserved huge payouts not predicated on performance. The company\u2019s owners disagreed. But for the sheer quantum, the golden coin goes to Helge Lund \u2013 aka the Norwegian Wedge \u2013 who was hired to save BG Group on a possible pay deal of \u00a325m. Shareholders revolted and BG was forced to make concessions \u2013 so even before he\u2019s started his new job Lund\u2019s reputation is all about his pay, rather than his abilities. Which is why City wags delighted in pointing out that Lund should change two letters in his name, and then he\u2019d officially be called Hedge Fund. Michael Fish award for foresight Another category packed with stellar entries. Former Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond drew praise for campaigning for an independent Scotland on the assumption that the oil price would be around $110 a barrel (it is now around $61) \u2013 although the country\u2019s voters appeared more far-sighted. Retail billionaires Mike Ashley and Sir Philip Green also came close after both were left nursing multimillion pound paper losses following a savage profit warning caused close to \u00a3140m to evaporate from the value of MySale, the website that runs clearance sales for fashion brands. However, all came up short in this field dominated by retail analysts, many of whom were shocked to discover that a very warm British autumn meant the shops they were supposed to be studying had sold far fewer woolly jumpers. Still, even among that group of geniuses, one man stood out as a titan. Step forward Bruno Monteyne, the Bernstein analyst and former Tesco employee, who last month broke away from the pack and mused how there was little embattled Tesco \u201ccan do wrong in the next two years that isn\u2019t in [the share] price\u201d. He then told the Times: \u201cThe discussion now is whether we\u2019ll merely see Tesco stabilise or whether this is the start of a major recovery\u201d. That final quote appeared the very morning that the grocer unveiled its latest massive profits warning, which prompted another slump in the shares. Incredible work, worthy of honours. Jason Bourne silver salver for amnesia At the Labour party conference in October, Ed Miliband appeared to have ensured that this category was a race containing a solitary horse. He forgot the deficit, as well as a lectern from which to deliver his speech, and any kind of aura suggesting he might be up to moving into No 10. Yet within days Miliband amazingly had a challenger for this prize. At the Conservative party conference the pre-election sweetener was prime minister David Cameron announcing \u00a37bn of unfunded tax cuts, which even caused the odd eyebrow to arch among staunch Tories. So, while Miliband forgot to mention the deficit, the PM seemed to forget we had one. For surprise value alone, Dave pips it. Douglas Carswell tie-pin for conversions Who would have have predicted that we would have witnessed so many Damascene conversions in 2014? Dalton Philips, the boss of supermarket Morrisons, had spent years trying to emulate the online services of rivals and sorting out the group\u2019s computer systems \u2013 but rarely did he bother to talk about something as vulgar as cutting prices. Yet such was the pressure on him following the remarkable change in the grocery sector during 2014, that Philips suddenly became a convert. Meanwhile, Wonga said it had seen the light regarding its many previous indiscretions, be they impersonating solicitors, or the small matter of admitting that it should have never lent \u00a3220m to 375,000 borrowers. Still, the biggest change of heart surely came from the International Monetary Fund, which had been one of the most vocal critics of George Osborne\u2019s economic plans. In a remarkable U-turn, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, decided to urge the rest of Europe in October to continue with painful British-style austerity measures to restore the trust in their economies. Just 18 months before that advice, Blanchard was attacking Britain for \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by pursuing that strategy. Who\u2019d have thought it?",

It is not known if, when making the remarks, drink had been taken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"70e64448f238f76b30e8d5dc54e1e404441c973f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419431526072/1c234f1c-89e9-4434-992e-2bcef12c7b2d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Harriet Green.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Kevin Pietersen diamond earring for abrupt departures<br></h2> <p>Oracle founder and erstwhile richest man on the planet, Larry Ellison, announced in September that he was stepping down from the software company he had created, which in turn created a problem for all of those who love the old Silicon Valley gag that Oracle actually stands for: One Raging Asshole Called Larry Ellison.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ellison\u2019s compatriot Bill Gross, the legendary bond trader who can provoke similar tributes from former colleagues, also left the firm he\u2019d created \u2013 Pimco, the world\u2019s largest bond trader - and quickly re-emerged at rival Janus.</p> <p>However, the judges thought there were two standout entries in this category. Firstly Euan Sutherland, the former boss of the Co-op Group, who shocked the business world in March by leaving shortly after his heroic pay package was leaked to the Observer. And secondly, November\u2019s news of Harriet Green\u2019s departure from Thomas Cook.</p> <p>Green got the nod, partly because the committee had been informed of a City pact which compelled at least one organisation to give her an award every calendar month. But she also triumphed because of the sheer cheek of the PR effort that went into pretending her departure had been agreed, after just two years at the helm. That was despite Green musing five days before her ousting: \u201cYou can\u2019t do a transformation on this sort of scale in a year or two years. I usually say it\u2019s about six years... we\u2019re absolutely not done.\u201d But it turned out that she absolutely was.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a3d4ba11388d6b00c33e1150a0602c592d64fdc7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419431569568/992f9510-9d92-4689-a63e-7ea186a7c2ba-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Helge Lund\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Mr Burns award for pay restraint<br></h2> <p>Pay has been a major issue since the financial crisis. Yet no matter how much the general public moans about it, company chairman after chairman (and executive after executive) nods in agreement at the arguments for restraint, but then carefully explains how all of those valid points do not apply to them and their companies. They make extraordinary awards for their extraordinary executives, they say, and nothing has ever gone wrong with such a justification.</p> <p>Still, the issue gets debated again and again. Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley was at it again in 2014, with the support of his biddable board who seem to believe the founder\u2019s line that he can\u2019t possibly be motivated to do his best for the firm without the chance to trouser more shares (already owning more than half the company doesn\u2019t quite cut it).</p> <p>Then there was Christopher Bailey, the new man at the top of fashion brand Burberry, who is now about one year (and one pay revolt) into his new job. His board thought that his brilliance deserved huge payouts not predicated on performance. The company\u2019s owners disagreed.</p> <p>But for the sheer quantum, the golden coin goes to Helge Lund \u2013 aka the Norwegian Wedge \u2013 who was hired to save BG Group on a possible pay deal of \u00a325m.</p> <p>Shareholders revolted and BG was forced to make concessions \u2013 so even before he\u2019s started his new job Lund\u2019s reputation is all about his pay, rather than his abilities. Which is why City wags delighted in pointing out that Lund should change two letters in his name, and then he\u2019d officially be called Hedge Fund.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa6fddd87c22ab595f374e1a67e3345da9ec92c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419431613564/e03399ca-a798-4527-a992-911e5223c188-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bruno Monteyne\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Michael Fish award for foresight<br></h2> <p>Another category packed with stellar entries. Former Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond drew praise for campaigning for an independent Scotland on the assumption that the oil price would be around $110 a barrel (it is now around $61) \u2013 although the country\u2019s voters appeared more far-sighted.</p> <p>Retail billionaires Mike Ashley and Sir Philip Green also came close after both were left nursing multimillion pound paper losses following a savage profit warning caused close to \u00a3140m to evaporate from the value of MySale, the website that runs clearance sales for fashion brands.</p> <p>However, all came up short in this field dominated by retail analysts, many of whom were shocked to discover that a very warm British autumn meant the shops they were supposed to be studying had sold far fewer woolly jumpers.</p> <p>Still, even among that group of geniuses, one man stood out as a titan. Step forward Bruno Monteyne, the Bernstein analyst and former Tesco employee, who last month broke away from the pack and mused how there was little embattled Tesco \u201ccan do wrong in the next two years that isn\u2019t in [the share] price\u201d. He then told the Times: \u201cThe discussion now is whether we\u2019ll merely see Tesco stabilise or whether this is the start of a major recovery\u201d.</p> <p>That final quote appeared the very morning that the grocer unveiled its latest massive profits warning, which prompted another slump in the shares. Incredible work, worthy of honours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"048ff82ffbc8ca3358c22db5ac543ff339db78eb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419431651168/5270fd47-da79-4c79-8207-16e87d0258ec-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Jason Bourne silver salver for amnesia<br></h2> <p>At the Labour party conference in October, Ed Miliband appeared to have ensured that this category was a race containing a solitary horse. He forgot the deficit, as well as a lectern from which to deliver his speech, and any kind of aura suggesting he might be up to moving into No 10.</p> <p>Yet within days Miliband amazingly had a challenger for this prize. At the Conservative party conference the pre-election sweetener was prime minister David Cameron announcing \u00a37bn of unfunded tax cuts, which even caused the odd eyebrow to arch among staunch Tories. So, while Miliband forgot to mention the deficit, the PM seemed to forget we had one. For surprise value alone, Dave pips it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dbcb534d2a2e93f3ebe6a939e3e27d8d57f983c3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/24/1419431715109/89d77fd9-cf99-4615-8365-004f59f0111b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Olivier Blanchard.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Douglas Carswell tie-pin for conversions<br></h2> <p>Who would have have predicted that we would have witnessed so many Damascene conversions in 2014?</p> <p>Dalton Philips, the boss of supermarket Morrisons, had spent years trying to emulate the online services of rivals and sorting out the group\u2019s computer systems \u2013 but rarely did he bother to talk about something as vulgar as cutting prices.</p> <p>Yet such was the pressure on him following the remarkable change in the grocery sector during 2014, that Philips suddenly became a convert.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Wonga said it had seen the light regarding its many previous indiscretions, be they impersonating solicitors, or the small matter of admitting that it should have never lent \u00a3220m to 375,000 borrowers.</p> <p>Still, the biggest change of heart surely came from the International Monetary Fund, which had been one of the most vocal critics of George Osborne\u2019s economic plans.</p> <p>In a remarkable U-turn, the IMF\u2019s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, decided to urge the rest of Europe in October to continue with painful British-style austerity measures to restore the trust in their economies.</p> <p>Just 18 months before that advice, Blanchard was attacking Britain for \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by pursuing that strategy.</p> <p>Who\u2019d have thought it?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world economy enters 2015 at a fork in the road. One track leads to the self-sustaining vigorous recovery that policy makers have sought in vain ever since the financial crisis erupted in 2007. Lower oil prices get consumers spending and businesses investing. Memories of the biggest recession since the 1930s are finally banished. The rest of the world starts to look like a revitalised US. The other track leads back towards recession. Problems that have been stored up since 2008-09 can be contained no longer. A financial crisis erupts in the emerging markets. China has a hard landing. Greece sparks off a fresh phase to the eurozone\u2019s struggle for survival. Deflation sets in. The rest of the world starts to look like Japan. Here, then, are five issues that will define a make-or-break year. Russia and the Ukraine The Russian economy will go into deep freeze in 2015. Even before the dramatic plunge in the rouble in the weeks running up to Christmas, the central bank was predicting a fall in output of 4.5%. Pushing up interest rates from 10.5% to 17% in one move may well help to stabilise the rouble and prevent further capital flight \u2013 but at a cost. Neil Shearing of Capital Economics says history is about to repeat itself; just as after the debt default of 1998, Russia is \u201cstaring down the barrel of a deep recession\u201d. The depth of that slump, Shearing says, will depend on what happens to the price of oil and whether the west lifts the economic sanctions that it has gradually been intensifying since last spring. Two other things are also unclear. Firstly, how Vladimir Putin will respond. The Russian president offered the people a bargain: accept a hard man in the Kremlin in return for rising living standards. That deal will be broken in 2015, and there is no guarantee that it will encourage the Kremlin to take a softer line over Ukraine. On the contrary, a failing economy could spur Putin into acts of nationalist defiance. That would not just intensify the recession; it would also have knock-on effects for Russia\u2019s neighbours and for the eurozone. The second unknown is whether Russia will be a special case. The fear is that it will set off a chain reaction across other emerging markets that have attracted the copious amounts of footloose capital generated by the quantitative-easing (money-creation) programmes of the world\u2019s central banks. Turkey and Indonesia and are two big countries to look out for. Oil In the summer of 2014, a barrel of Brent crude was changing hands at $115 a barrel. By Christmas it could be obtained for barely half that price. The big drop in the oil price is positive for global growth: it puts more spending power in the hands of consumers and it cuts costs for businesses. The link between the cost of crude and the world economy is well established: the long booms of 1948-1973 and the 15-year period that preceded the great recession of 2008-09 were both built on cheap oil. The four recessions of the postwar era (1974-75, 1981-82, 1990-91 and 2008-09) have all been associated with rising oil prices. Trevor Greetham, director of asset allocation at Fidelity Solutions, says: \u201cA low oil price is a stimulus for consumers. Global growth should pick up over 2015 and there are as yet few signs of the kind of inflation that would necessitate meaningful monetary tightening.\u201d But there is a caveat. Greetham says the plunging oil price could prompt \u201ccredit stress\u201d. This would affect governments, such as Russia, Venezuela and Iran, that can only balance their books if the oil price is at $100 a barrel or more. And it would affect the shale gas sector in the US, where much of the investment has been financed by high-yielding but risky junk bonds. As the Bank of England points out in its recent Financial Stability Review: \u201cAs US oil and gas exploration firms account for 13% of outstanding debt in US high-yield bond markets, an increase in the preceived or realised credit risk in this sector could lead to sales by investors and potentially illiquidity in the broader high-yield market\u201d. In other words, shale could be the next sub-prime. China China will be crucial to the performance of the global economy in 2015. Depending on the yardstick used, it is now the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is also, according to Kenneth Culkier of the Economist magazine, a net exporter of foreign direct investment. China could soon join the select club of countries with a reserve currency. But 2014 has been an uneasy year, as Beijing has tried to mop up the credit excesses left behind after the growth-at-all-costs approach adopted during the deep downturn of late 2008. Policy makers have been running a tight ship and the constraints on credit have started to bite. Growth will be lower in 2015: the question is how much lower. A marked slowdown would affect the rest of the world in two big ways. First, exports to China would weaken. This would affect countries such as Germany, which sell the machine tools needed for China\u2019s industrial expansion, and those, such as Australia, that provide China with its raw materials. A sluggish Chinese economy in 2015 will compound a low oil price. Second, China will export deflation to the rest of the world. The prices of goods leaving China are already falling and that trend will continue. The US and Europe will be flooded with cheap Chinese goods, driving down inflation. In the case of the eurozone, it may result in deflation. Central banks, faced with inflation being well below target, will be cautious about raising interest rates even if their economies are growing at a healthy rate, risking the recreation of the conditions that led to the pre-2007 asset bubbles. US Next year will be hugely significant for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve, and for global markets. A focus for investors in the new year will be the timing of the first rise in interest rates. Rates have been in a record low range of between zero and 0.25% since December 2008, but the economy has been gaining momentum in recent months. The Fed has already called time on its $4.5tn bond-buying programme, completing its final purchases in October. Winding the clock back to May 2013, then chairman Ben Bernanke triggered a so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d when he suggested the Fed might start slowing the rate of its bond-buying sooner than markets were expecting. Investors \u2013 hooked on ultra-loose monetary policy since the crisis fully erupted in 2008 \u2013 took fright and triggered a fresh wave of volatility. Given we\u2019re talking about the world\u2019s largest economy, speculation on the first rate rise will have repercussions around the world. Investors will scrutinise Fed statements for any change in tone that might indicate when the first increase will come. Until it does come, uncertainty \u2013 despised by markets \u2013 will reign. At its latest policy meeting in December, the Fed dropped its insistence that rates would be kept on hold for a \u201cconsiderable period\u201d, replacing it with the message that it could be \u201cpatient\u201d about policy changes. Within minutes of the statement, New York\u2019s Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 1.5%, as investors interpreted it as a signal that there would be no mad rush to raise rates. However, if the economic data in the coming weeks and months continues to reflect a strengthening US economy, the Fed\u2019s patience may wear thin. Expect market volatility when the central bank drops its cautious tone as it paves the way for the first rate rise since the great recession. Eurozone The eurozone is the crisis that keeps on giving, and there is every reason to believe this will remain the case in 2015. Mario Draghi, the eloquent president of the European Central Bank, lifted the single currency bloc out of the worst phase of the crisis in the summer of 2012 simply by saying that he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. But he now faces one of his biggest challenges yet. In 2014, the story in the eurozone was one of a recovery that failed to get off the ground and of the mounting threat of deflation. Neither of those problems has gone away, with growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter of 2014 and an annual inflation rate of 0.3% at last count in November. Greece and Spain are already stuck in a deflationary rut and there is concern that a dangerous deflationary spiral will spread to the rest of the region. The fear is that as prices continue to fall, businesses and consumers will delay spending plans as they expect prices to fall further. With a backdrop of weak growth, low oil prices and general lack of inflationary pressures, the ECB\u2019s battle against deflation will continue well into 2015. Measures announced in 2014 \u2013 including charging banks to park cash with the central bank in a bid to encourage more lending \u2013 have failed to provide a silver bullet. The bank has one weapon left up its sleeve: full-blown quantitative easing. So far the eurozone\u2019s policymakers have failed to take the plunge with QE, largely as a result of forceful opposition from Germany. But 2015 could be the year to abandon the hints and throw the kitchen sink at the problem. More weak data from the eurozone will make investors nervy. Failure to press the QE button in the face of weakness could trigger outright panic. The relevance for the UK is huge: policymakers at the Bank of England and within government have repeatedly warned that fragility in the eurozone is one of the biggest threats to the UK recovery, not least because it is Britain\u2019s biggest trading partner.",

A sluggish Chinese economy in 2015 will compound a low oil price.</p> <p>Second, China will export deflation to the rest of the world. The prices of goods leaving China are already falling and that trend will continue. The US and Europe will be flooded with cheap Chinese goods, driving down inflation. In the case of the eurozone, it may result in deflation. Central banks, faced with inflation being well below target, will be cautious about raising interest rates even if their economies are growing at a healthy rate, risking the recreation of the conditions that led to the pre-2007 asset bubbles.</p> <h2><strong>US</strong></h2> <p>Next year will be hugely significant for Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve, and for global markets. A focus for investors in the new year will be the timing of the first rise in interest rates. Rates have been in a record low range of between zero and 0.25% since December 2008, but the economy has been gaining momentum in recent months. The Fed has already called time on its $4.5tn bond-buying programme, completing its final purchases in October. Winding the clock back to May 2013, then chairman Ben Bernanke triggered a so-called \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d when he suggested the Fed might start slowing the rate of its bond-buying sooner than markets were expecting. Investors \u2013 hooked on ultra-loose monetary policy since the crisis fully erupted in 2008 \u2013 took fright and triggered a fresh wave of volatility.</p> <p>Given we\u2019re talking about the world\u2019s largest economy, speculation on the first rate rise will have repercussions around the world. Investors will scrutinise Fed statements for any change in tone that might indicate when the first increase will come. Until it does come, uncertainty \u2013 despised by markets \u2013 will reign. At its latest policy meeting in December, the Fed dropped its insistence that rates would be kept on hold for a \u201cconsiderable period\u201d, replacing it with the message that it could be \u201cpatient\u201d about policy changes. Within minutes of the statement, New York\u2019s Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 1.5%, as investors interpreted it as a signal that there would be no mad rush to raise rates. However, if the economic data in the coming weeks and months continues to reflect a strengthening US economy, the Fed\u2019s patience may wear thin. Expect market volatility when the central bank drops its cautious tone as it paves the way for the first rate rise since the great recession.</p> <h2><strong>Eurozone</strong></h2> <p>The eurozone is the crisis that keeps on giving, and there is every reason to believe this will remain the case in 2015. Mario Draghi, the eloquent president of the European Central Bank, lifted the single currency bloc out of the worst phase of the crisis in the summer of 2012 simply by saying that he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. But he now faces one of his biggest challenges yet.</p> <p>In 2014, the story in the eurozone was one of a recovery that failed to get off the ground and of the mounting threat of deflation. Neither of those problems has gone away, with growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter of 2014 and an annual inflation rate of 0.3% at last count in November. Greece and Spain are already stuck in a deflationary rut and there is concern that a dangerous deflationary spiral will spread to the rest of the region. The fear is that as prices continue to fall, businesses and consumers will delay spending plans as they expect prices to fall further. With a backdrop of weak growth, low oil prices and general lack of inflationary pressures, the ECB\u2019s battle against deflation will continue well into 2015.</p> <p>Measures announced in 2014 \u2013 including charging banks to park cash with the central bank in a bid to encourage more lending \u2013 have failed to provide a silver bullet. The bank has one weapon left up its sleeve: full-blown quantitative easing.</p> <p>So far the eurozone\u2019s policymakers have failed to take the plunge with QE, largely as a result of forceful opposition from Germany. But 2015 could be the year to abandon the hints and throw the kitchen sink at the problem. More weak data from the eurozone will make investors nervy. Failure to press the QE button in the face of weakness could trigger outright panic.</p> <p>The relevance for the UK is huge: policymakers at the Bank of England and within government have repeatedly warned that fragility in the eurozone is one of the biggest threats to the UK recovery, not least because it is Britain\u2019s biggest trading partner.</p>",

The warning came as thousands of passengers suffered major disruptions to their journeys as all trains into and out of London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross were cancelled on Saturday due to overrunning engineering works. The shock move brought chaotic scenes to parts of the capital and disgruntled travellers took to social media to vent their anger at Network Rail, which found itself trending on Twitter for all the wrong reasons. The company could find itself on the receiving end of a multimillion-pound fine after the Office of Rail Regulation said an investigation would be launched into the disruption. A spokesman for the regulator said: \u201cThe immediate priority is for Network Rail to ensure disrupted parts of the railways are back up and running again for passengers as soon as possible. Network Rail, working with the rest of the industry, must learn lessons and prevent problems like this happening again.\u201d The company said the work near King\u2019s Cross was part of a \u00a3200m Christmas investment programme and described the move to cancel all services as \u201cregrettable and unfortunate\u201d. More travel misery is predicted when overnight temperatures drop to as low as -14C in parts of the country this week. Motorists are being warned to take extra care today, when the snow that has brought chaos to Yorkshire and the East Midlands gives way to icy conditions. On Saturday the Met Office issued a severe weather alert \u2013 predicting temperatures would fall sharply, with the risk of widespread ice forming on untreated surfaces. \u201cThe most widespread ice is expected where melting snow cover refreezes and where showers occur,\u201d the Met Office said, adding that there was a 90% chance of severe cold, ice or snow in parts of England between today and New Year\u2019s Eve. The amber \u2013 level three \u2013 alert is one below a national emergency and is the signal for social and healthcare services to target \u201chigh-risk\u201d groups, such as the very young or old, or those with chronic diseases. Public Health England also urged people to look out for vulnerable friends and family and neighbours during the cold weather. The plunging temperatures saw Christmas Day night become the coldest night of the year so far, with minus 8.5C recorded at Braemar in Aberdeenshire.In the days to come a brisk northwesterly wind could make it feel more like -11C to -14C across the Brecon Beacons and Snowdonia, the Met Office said. It predicted further snow on higher ground in places such as the Cheviot hills in the Scottish Borders, the Yorkshire Moors and the Pennines. The cold snap has already brought treacherous conditions to roads, with motorists in Sheffield forced to abandon their cars after becoming snowed in on Friday night. Liverpool\u2019s John Lennon Airport and Leeds Bradford International also temporarily closed as snow was cleared from runways. Thousands of homes across the country were left with no power as snow brought cables down. Loughborough, Pontypridd and Taunton were three of the worst affected towns. In Leek, Staffordshire, 11cm of snow fell. Nottinghamshire and Bingley, near Bradford, were hit by flurries of up to 7cm. Drivers also became marooned by heavy snow in Chesterfield and the Peak District. A coachload of people travelling from Sheffield to London had to take refuge after their bus became stuck in the snow. which also made conditions difficult for some of Boxing Day\u2019s football matches. The stranded passengers spent the night at Our Lady and St Thomas Church in Sheffield. Parishioner Gemma Cort, 44, said local children were helping drivers by pushing cars up the steep A61 in Sheffield when they spotted the coach and a decision was taken to open the church. \u201cThe coach couldn\u2019t move for the rest of the evening so we made bits of food and the children took them a load of toast and we made lots of tea,\u201d she said. The bad weather struck as train passengers who had intended to use King\u2019s Cross were forced to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park, a few miles away in north London. However, the station was unable to cope with the surge in numbers coming through its doors. Irate passengers took to Twitter to express their anger as Finsbury Park was temporarily closed to ease congestion. Steve Bird tweeted: \u201cI feel like getting into Finsbury Park station today warrants some form of life-time achievement award.\u201d Gemma Tate complained: \u201c#KingsCrossTrains could now have travelled halfway to Caribbean in time it\u2019s taken on Leeds to Finsbury Park train \u2026 still not arrived.\u201d Malcolm Connolly, 52, from Chelmsford, and his wife were planning to be in Leeds for a party on Saturday night, but were forced to give up due to the travel chaos. \u201cThere are people coming over from America for it and we\u2019ve been planning it for three years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m raging that tonight\u2019s not going to happen.
