      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s first interest rate rise will come no earlier than July next year but probably by the end of September, according to economists polled by Reuters. It found that 32 of 50 mainly City economists forecast the Bank of England\u2019s base rate will increase to 0.75% in the third quarter of 2015, six months later than previously thought. The revised forecasts brings the majority of economists in to line with financial markets that were already betting on a first rise late next year. It seems clear from recent figures that shoppers with mortgages to pay have also concluded that rate rises are fast disappearing over the horizon. Consumer confidence and retail sales are expected to make for a buoyant Christmas, according to the latest surveys, so those workers in continuous employment and enjoying decent pay rises feel confident a steep rise in monthly costs is not imminent. Even those on modest incomes getting low pay rises are feeling more comfortable borrowing and spending now that a rate rise could be pushed back even as late as 2016, if HSBC economists are to be believed. Speeches by the Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane and governor Mark Carney are behind the sense of relief after they both struck a dovish tone and emphasised that growth may be strong but it is built on weak foundations \u2013 in particular, low wage rises and low inflation, holding the monetary policy committee (MPC) back from jacking up rates. More than 90% of new mortgages being given out are for fixed rates lasting two years or more, according to figures from several brokers. But most existing mortgage payers are on variable/tracker deals and quite often the standard variable rate if their mortgage is still distressed. Their number could swell if customers conclude that interest rates are simply going to stay at rock bottom for years rather than months. That said, five-year fixed rate deals on offer at 2.5% (for those with high levels of equity or large deposits) could prove tempting enough to continue the trend because they appear to be a zero-cost hedge against future rises. And to some extent, apart from an arrangement fee, they are. Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank, told Reuters: \u201cFollowing the recent downgrade of the BoE\u2019s inflation forecasts, which I fully buy into, it is difficult to see the MPC pulling the interest rate trigger any time soon \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see a rate hike until such times as the inflation rate has stabilised ... particularly in view of the mounting evidence from Sweden that the Riksbank acted too hastily to normalise policy.\u201d Stockholm tried to raise rates to more \u201cnormal\u201d levels only to find the extra borrowing costs killed off high street spending and sent economic growth into reverse.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vincent Tchenguiz has launched a claim for \u00a32.2bn in damages against accountants Grant Thornton and the estate of the failed Icelandic bank Kaupthing in connection with the collapse of a Serious Fraud Office investigation that was heavily criticised over a dawn raid it made on the property developer. Tchenguiz accuses Grant Thornton, the administrator to Kaupthing, of having manipulated the SFO into launching its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the bank\u2019s collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. The investigation was abandoned in 2012 after a series of setbacks, including a high court ruling that the search warrants used for high-profile raids on Tchenguiz and others were illegal and that there had been no grounds for suspecting him of criminal offences. The claim also names three individuals and was filed in the high court by Tchenguiz who in July this year, settled with the SFO, receiving an apology from its director David Green and an estimated \u00a36m in damages and legal costs. Tchenguiz also brought the claim on behalf of Consensus Business Group, which advises his family trust, Tchenguiz Family Trust. Tchenguiz said: \u201cIt is clear to me that the Serious Fraud Office was deliberately manipulated into investigating me by people who intended to cause me harm and were driven by commercial gain and self-interest. \u201cThis was, I believe, quite simply a conspiracy by the defendants to use a criminal investigative authority for their own personal ends and to cause irreparable harm to me and my business interests, and I intend to see them held fully accountable.\u201d His claim in the high court also names Stephen Akers and Hossein Hamedani, who are partners at Grant Thornton, and Johannes Johannsson, a member of the winding-up committee of Kaupthing. All three have been appointed by courts to act in the interest of creditors to the failed bank. Grant Thornton denied the claims on behalf of itself and two of the individuals, partners at the firm. In a statement, it said: \u201cGrant Thornton UK LLP, Steve Akers and Hossein Hamedani deny all of the claims made. We have all acted appropriately and in accordance with our professional responsibilities and legal obligations throughout. After years of speculation in the media, we will now have the opportunity to defend ourselves through the court process. Given that this is now a matter of legal proceedings, we will not be commenting further at this time.\u201d Tchenguiz\u2019s home and offices in the upmarket Park Lane area of London were raided in March 2011, and the high-profile investigation is alleged to have had repercussions for his business empire. The now abandoned case also involved Tchenguiz\u2019s brother Robert, against whom all criminal investigations were also abandoned. He too has sued the SFO, reaching a settlement and receiving an apology. Vincent Tchenguiz used equity from his property business to provide collateral for a loan granted by Kaupthing to his brother. They had both been seeking \u00a3300m of damages from the SFO after the search warrants used in the raid were ruled to be illegal. The SFO was accused of \u201csheer incompetence\u201d by the judge for failing to keep records of the information used to obtain the warrants. Kaupthing\u2019s winding-up committee said: \u201cNeither Kaupthing nor Mr Johannsson have been served with court documents as yet, so we are not in a position to comment in detail. In any event it is not Kaupthing\u2019s general policy to comment on specific business-related matters. What we can however say is that the allegations made by Vincent Tchenguiz about the conduct of Kaupthing and Johannes Runar Johannsson have absolutely no basis in fact or in law and will be very vigorously contested.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s top tax advisers at PricewaterhouseCoopers has been summoned to give evidence before MPs in the wake of revelations about controversial tax deals for PwC clients in Luxembourg. Kevin Nicholson, PwC UK\u2019s head of tax, who worked as an HRMC tax inspector in the early 1990s, will appear on his own before parliament\u2019s public accounts committee on 8 December. No one from PwC Luxembourg is expected to join him, nor will Rick Stamm, PwC\u2019s New York-based global head of tax, be present. The Guardian and more than 20 other news outlets around the world published analyses this month of a cache of hundreds of leaked tax rulings secured by PwC Luxembourg on behalf of its clients. They exposed patterns of aggressive tax avoidance. The revelations triggered an emergency debate in the European parliament as politicians from all sides called into question the track record of the new European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who had dominated Luxembourg politics as prime minister between 1995 and 2013. During that time large numbers of multinationals shifted functions such as internal financing and intellectual property licensing to the Grand Duchy. Juncker has sought to brush aside criticisms, insisting: \u201cI am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d On Thursday, he comfortably survived a censure vote as his centrist allies saved him from humiliation at the hands of anti-EU parties of the right. On the parliament\u2019s left there has also been anti-Juncker sentiment, but it was unable to muster the 10% of MEPs needed to bring a motion, and the bloc refused to vote with the far-right parties. A motion brought by Britain\u2019s Ukip, France\u2019s Front National, and Italy\u2019s 5 Star movement described Juncker as unfit to lead the EU executive because of his track record in Luxembourg. It was defeated by 461 votes, with 101 voting in favour and 88 abstaining. The hearing next month will not be the first time Nicholson has had to account for PwC\u2019s record to MPs on the public accounts committee, which is chaired by Margaret Hodge MP, a fierce critic of tax avoidance. Last year he appeared alongside counterparts from Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and Deloitte. He was quick to blame deficiencies in the international rules on tax, which, he said, needed updating. \u201cOne of the challenges now is we\u2019re seeing a lot of discomfort, unrest and unhappiness around the fact that businesses are selling a lot in the UK but they are not seeing the profit [in the UK],\u201d he said. \u201cAnd part of the reason for that is the way the international rules were designed puts the value in different places. One of the debates we need to have now is how do you get tax and profits in the right places.\u201d During the hearing Hodge confronted Nicholson with a leaked tax structuring document relating to a string of London\u2019s best-known office blocks. She said she was shocked by the structure of ownership set out in a diagram which showed corporate entities in Jersey, Luxembourg and Delaware. On that occasion Nicholson was able to simply say he did not know the structure and could not comment. PwC said: \u201cWe stand by the evidence we gave to the public accounts committee in January 2013 and are very willing to clarify any of the points made.\u201d Next month, however, Nicholson can expect to be grilled on intricate details of a host of leaked Luxembourg tax agreements, many of them relating to UK and Irish clients. With documents now published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and widely reported on, it will be harder for Nicholson to deflect scrutiny. It remains to be seen, however, whether he will seek to defend the track record of PwC Luxembourg, which is a distinct legal partnership from PwC in the UK. Nicholson is also expected to face questions over the level of involvement that UK staff have had in tax advice officially emanating from Luxembourg. Last year PwC made revenues of \u00a32.81bn of which \u00a3714m came from its tax advisory practice. Meanwhile, PwC Luxembourg had turnover of \u20ac276m (\u00a3219m) for the year to June 2013, up more than 12% on the previous 12 months. Tax advice accounted for 29% of revenues, up from 24% two years ago. The Luxembourg partnership employs about 2,300 \u2013 equivalent to one in every 240 people resident in the small country. New offices for the fast-growing practice were officially opened last week at a ceremony attended by prime minister Xavier Bettel.",

On that occasion Nicholson was able to simply say he did not know the structure and could not comment.</p> <p>PwC said: \u201cWe stand by the evidence we gave to the public accounts committee in January 2013 and are very willing to clarify any of the points made.\u201d</p> <p>Next month, however, Nicholson can expect to be grilled on intricate details of a host of leaked Luxembourg tax agreements, many of them relating to UK and Irish clients. With documents now published by the<a href=\"http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks\" title=\"\"> International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a>, and widely reported on, it will be harder for Nicholson to deflect scrutiny.</p> <p>It remains to be seen, however, whether he will seek to defend the track record of PwC Luxembourg, which is a distinct legal partnership from PwC in the UK. Nicholson is also expected to face questions over the level of involvement that UK staff have had in tax advice officially emanating from Luxembourg.</p> <p>Last year PwC made revenues of \u00a32.81bn of which \u00a3714m came from its tax advisory practice. Meanwhile, PwC Luxembourg had turnover of \u20ac276m (\u00a3219m) for the year to June 2013, up more than 12% on the previous 12 months. Tax advice accounted for 29% of revenues, up from 24% two years ago. The Luxembourg partnership employs about 2,300 \u2013 equivalent to one in every 240 people resident in the small country. <a href=\"http://www.wort.lu/en/business/ban-de-gasperich-sneak-peek-video-reveals-pwc-s-new-crystal-park-building-interior-542135cfb9b398870806a012\" title=\"\">New offices for the fast-growing practice were officially opened last week</a> at a ceremony attended by prime minister Xavier Bettel.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices have crashed to a new four-year low, below $72 per barrel, after a major split inside Opec forced the cartel to hold production at current levels rather than make cuts to try to turn the market around. The reduced cost of energy - prices are now down 37% since the summer - should be a boost to British consumers and the wider economy, but experts warned the North Sea oil industry is now facing a slump in investment and major job cuts. There are now predictions that the price of Brent blend could fall to as low as $60, which would be disastrous for countries with high producing costs and economies dependent on oil and gas, such as Russia and Iran. Norway, an important oil and gas producer outside OPEC, saw its Krona currency hit a five year low against the dollar while Shell and BP saw their shares battered. Lower prices have already led to lower petrol and diesel bills for motorists and the transport sector which should feed through into manufacturing. But cheaper fuel will also lower the UK inflation rate, which at 1.3% is already well below the Bank of England\u2019s target rate of 2%. Prior to a crunch meeting at its Vienna headquarters, OPEC was under under huge pressure from some members to reduce output in a bid to counter the five month slide in Brent blend prices from $115. Prices have fallen due to increased US shale production and faltering demand as growth slows in China, Europe and emerging markets. Abdalla El-Badri, the Opec secretary-general, put on a brave face to hide the split between rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, which want to hold prices, and others such as cash-strapped Venezuela which are desperate for output cuts. He insisted that there was unity between all the cartel members, even though the Venezuelan oil minister stormed out of the meeting in protest. \u201cMy ministers have agreed and are happy so I am happy, he said after the meeting in Vienna, where OPEC\u2019s secretariat is based. \u201cWe are not sending a message to anyone. We are just trying to set a fair price.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe (global oil) price decline does not mean we should rush to do something...We don\u2019t want to panic. We want to see how the price reacts (to OPEC maintaining output levels).\u201d But the decision not to cut output for at least six months was viewed by analysts as an illustration of OPEC\u2019s weakness - that it was unable to find a unified solution to the problems posed by rival oil supplies from the US shale fields. \u201cThe group\u2019s credibility is definitely under the spotlight,\u201d said Miswin Mahesh, oil analyst at Barclays Capital in London. \u201cIf it does not cut it brings up arguments about what is OPEC for. If it had cut by 500,000 barrels a day it would not have been enough and it had cut by 1m enforcing it (on its members) would be very tricky.\u201d OPEC is already producing almost one million barrels a day more than its stated 30m target. . Venezuela\u2019s embattled foreign minister, Rafael Ramirez, criticised US frackers as he arrived at the Opec meeting, suggesting they should be reined in: \u201cThe US is producing in a very, very bad manner. The shale oil, I mean it is a disaster from the point of view of climate change.\u201d Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, the Iranian oil minister, insisted after the meeting he was not angry about the decision but also made clear it was \u201cnot in line with what we wanted.\u201d The cartel\u2019s first female president, Nigeria\u2019s petroleum minister Diezani Alison-Maduek, who was elected yesterday, said it was a tough decision whether to cut output, saying it was \u201ca toss of the coin\u201d whether a cut would have forced up prices. High costs and lower oil prices are already leading to hundreds of job losses in the UK North Sea, ramping up pressure on George Osborne to introduce more tax breaks for oil and gas operators in his autumn statement next week. Mike Tholen, economics director at the Oil &amp; Gas UK lobby group, said: \u201cNumerous oil companies - household names in Aberdeen - are already pulling back, some of them gently and some robustly. The Treasury\u2019s review into the North Sea fiscal regime must deliver a positive outcome both to ease the burden on existing production and to attract new investment.\u201d Shell, Chevron and others each announced hundreds of job cuts this summer, and Jake Moolo, Aberdeen-based organiser for the RMT, said his members faced a \u201cbleak\u201d future of redundancies and a lack of investment. James Bream, a director at Aberdeen &amp; Grampian Chamber of Commerce, warned the chancellor things were getting bleak: \u201cCompanies are not convinced they can get a fair return on their investment and in a global industry, it is very simple for them to move their capital elsewhere.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "I\u2019m going to pause now, as the oil price seems to have stabilised after both main benchmarks tumbled 6.3% to new four-year lows. Brent crude is hovering around $72.80, down $5 today. And US crude has marked Thanksgiving by losing $4.60 to $69.05. My earlier summary has the story of how Opec triggered the rout, and unleashed a price war on the shale industry. And I\u2019ll try to pop back in tonight if anything develops.... Thanks. GW Late news from Vienna -- Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister had told Latin American TV station Telesur that a fair oil price would be $100/barrel. Rafael Ramirez (who stormed out of the Opec meeting) added that lower oil prices will hurt the fracking industry too. The slide in the oil price is bad news for Britain\u2019s North Sea industry. And with civil servants racing to finalise the details of next week\u2019s Autumn Statement, energy companies are urging the Treasury to offer more tax breaks to help them. Otherwise, they warn, extractors could abandon the North Sea for other areas. More here: Plunging oil price piles pressure on George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement Citi, the Wall Street bank, has come up with four theories to explain Saudi Arabia\u2019s reluctance to cut oil production. One is that Saudi\u2019s finances are quite strong today, so it can take the hit of lower revenues. Another is that the Kingdom\u2019s top officials are focused on other matters, such as the health of the Royal Family. Opec has effectively fired the starting gun on a new price war in the energy industry. And the target is America\u2019s shale industry, as Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix consultancy explains (via Reuters). \u201cWe interpret this as Saudi Arabia selling the idea that oil prices in the short term need to go lower, with a floor set at $60 per barrel, in order to have more stability in years ahead at $80 plus. \u201cIn other words, it should be in the interest of OPEC to live with lower prices for a little while in order to slow down development projects in the United States.\u201d Reuters also reports that Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister, Rafael Ramirez, was \u201cvisibly angry\u201d as he left the meeting. Venezuela had been pushing for an output cut. I think it might be helpful to recap. The oil price has plunged this afternoon after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) decided not to cut production levels (see 3pm onwards for highlights). At a five-hour meeting in Vienna, Opec resisted pressure from some members to lower their output, from the current target of 30 million barrels per day. Analysts say that Opec members, led by Saudi Arabia, have decided to focus on protecting their market share rather than slashing production in an attempt to push the price back up. Opec said the decision was not a reason for alarm. In a statement, it said: ....the Conference concurred that stable oil prices \u2013 at a level which did not affect global economic growth but which, at the same time, allowed producers to receive a decent income and to invest to meet future demand \u2013 were vital for world economic wellbeing. Secretary general Abdalla El-Badri told reporters that: \u201cWe\u2019re going to produce 30m [million barrels per day] for the first half of the year We have no target price, we are looking for a fair price.\u201d The news sent reverberations through the sector, even though Opec members such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait had hinted that production would not be cut. US crude oil is now changing hands at $67.75 per barrel, down from $73.69 last night. And Brent crude is now down to $71.25 per barrel, down from $77.50 last night. In the long term, the decision could help Opec fight back against the rise of the shale oil industry, as a lower oil price will probably rein in their output. As Bill Farren-Price, head of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, put it to the FT this afternoon: \u201cThose [Opec] producers that have been hardest hit by the oil price drop have been persuaded that an output cut may have been ineffective and that the only way to counter the surge in US shale oil production is to allow lower prices to pare back supply over time.\u201d In the short-term, though, consumers can look forward to cheaper petrol prices. And global inflation is likely to be restrained too. Oil had already fallen by around a third since the summer, as global growth has slowed and shale production has boosted supplies. This latest slump is going to make oil production more loss-making for some Opec members, and other producers such as Russia: The news also sent the Russian ruble sliding, to 48 rubles to the US dollar. And it also hit the share prices of oil companies; in London, Tullow Oil fell 7%, BG Group lost almost 6%, and Royal Dutch Shell fell 4%. Today\u2019s decision was (like much Opec policy) driven by the wishes of Saudi Arabia, explains Alistair McCaig of IG. OPEC has decided to keep oil production unchanged and the spot oil markets have subsequently collapsed as the template of oversupply and weak demand keeps the pressure on energy prices. The sound bites that came out before this meeting all inferred that Saudi Arabia was happy to maintain its market share. Historically, when it comes to altering supply levels, it has fallen on the Saudi\u2019s shoulders to make the changes, and without their leadership few OPEC members were likely to go it alone. \u201cOpec just declared war on everyone-including itself\u201d, says the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Liam Denning. Today\u2019s decision not to cut production means oil will remain below $100/barrel for several years to come, he adds. More here (\u00a3) Crumbs -- Brent crude has plunged even further, hitting $72.74 per barrel. That means it has fallen by five dollars per barrel today, a massive slump for the oil price. The oil price tumble is turning into a rout, with prices hitting fresh four-year lows as I type. Brent crude has now fallen through the $74/barrel mark to just $73.41 after Opec\u2019s decision. And New York crude has just plunged through the $70/barrel mark, to $69.39. Most oil producers need the crude price to be rather higher to be in profit: Even Opec is pointing out that a lower oil price is good for consumers: Analyst Steve Baines makes a similar point: It\u2019s not *quite* as clear-cut as that, though. Venezuela, for example, was relying on a higher oil price to cover its public spending, so there could be serious consequences there. The oil price is hitting new lows as Opec\u2019s decision reverberates though the markets. Brent crude just hit $74.00 per barrel, the lowest since August 2010. Many US oil traders are on holiday today, for Thanksgiving, so there could be more volatility tomorrow when they return to their desks. It\u2019s doubly official now -- Opec has just published a statement, confirming that it will keep producing 30 million barrels of oil per day. Opec says today\u2019s meeting in Vienna agreed that it is \u201cvital for world economic wellbeing\u201d that the oil price is stable, at a level that allows producers to make a \u201cdecent income\u201d without hurting global growth. Accordingly, in the interest of restoring market equilibrium, the Conference decided to maintain the production level of 30.0 mb/d, as was agreed in December 2011. As always, in taking this decision, Member Countries confirmed their readiness to respond to developments which could have an adverse impact on the maintenance of an orderly and balanced oil market. Opec added that it will remain \u201cvigilant\u201d to the uncertainties and risks in the world economy. The full statement is online here. Our energy editor, Terry Macalister, is tweeting the key points from Opec\u2019s press conference in Vienna now: Abdalla Salem El-Badri, the secretary general of Opec, has insisted that today\u2019s decision is no reason to \u201cpanic\u201d. I\u2019ve taken this quote from fastFT: [The recent price fall] doesn\u2019t mean we have to rush and see where the market will settle; we want to see the market, how the market behaves. Al-Badri also told reporters in Vienna that Opec has \u201cno target price\u201d for oil. It appears Opec has decided to leave production levels alone for the next six months, according to Reuters: Of course, an emergency meeting can\u2019t be ruled out, and countries have been known not to stick to official targets. But that does chim with Saudi Arabia\u2019s desire to sit tight, maintain market share, and see if the oil price settles. It\u2019s official! Opec\u2019s spokesman has just read out a statement in Vienna, confirming that the oil group has decided to leave production targets at the current level of 30 million barrels of crude oil per day. Share prices in oil producers are sliding too following these reports that Opec has left production levels unchanged. They are dominating the list of biggest fallers on the FTSE 100: The Russian ruble has tumbled too, underlining that Russia is likely to suffer from Opec\u2019s decision not to cut production levels. It\u2019s down by 1.5% to around 48 rubles to the US dollar. This slump in the oil price is a boost to households and many businesses; petrol stations should pass at least some of the saving on. It will also push down headline inflation rates - and in the UK, that could mean the consumer prices index falls below 1%, from its current level of 1.3%. That would force Bank of England governor to write a letter of explanation to the chancellor (the target is 2%). And it is likely to intensify the deflationary pressures in the eurozone. New York crude oil, the other measure of the oil price, has also fallen sharply in the last few minutes. Nymex has shed almost 3% to $71.55 per barrel, the lowest since August 2010. Nigeria confirms that Opec will continue to produce 30 million of barrels of crude per day: This chart shows how Brent crude tumbled to a fresh four-year low a few moments ago, as Opec\u2019s meeting broke up without an agreement to cut production levels: The Kuwaiti oil minister has confirmed that Opec resisted calls to cut production at today\u2019s meeting in Vienna. Ali Saleh al-Omair said \u201cno change\u201d to reporters as he left today\u2019s meeting, Reuters and Dow Jones both report. Ali Saleh al-Omair had earlier said that Kuwait would cope with the oil price, whether it was $60 per barrel or $80 per barrel. Another Reuters flash: Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi was asked whether Opec has decided not to cut, replied \u201cthat is right\u201d. And this is sending the Brent crude oil price falling sharply, hitting $74.75 per barrel. That\u2019s a new four-year low. More newsflashes on Reuters... Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi has apparently said that Opec has taken a \u201cgreat decision\u201d, but hasn\u2019t actually said what the deal is! Newsflash on Reuters: the Brent crude price is weakening on reports that the Opec meeting has ended.... Economics editor Larry Elliott has reached back into history to explain how Opec established such a grip on the oil market, and why the cartel is still influential: Here\u2019s his conclusion: There are winners and losers from falling oil prices just as there are winners and losers from tumbling interest rates. Producing nations suffer while consuming nations benefit. The net effect, though, should be positive for growth since producers are more likely to save than consumers. There are two provisos, however. The first is that lower prices stick. The second is that falling oil prices do not lead to a period of outright deflation from which countries find it difficult to escape. Full piece: The Opec oil price still matters (just not as much as before) The Economist has produced a neat chart, showing how Opec\u2019s share of the energy market is expected to fall over the next six years: That adds to the OPEC dilemma: OPEC\u2019s poorer members, whose oil is generally costly to extract, want to cut output to prop up prices\u2014now at four-year lows. Richer ones, who have lower costs, prefer to keep pumping and maintain their market share. More here: Cartelists\u2019 conundrum: OPEC meet Still no news from Vienna, as Opec members continue to talk... Today\u2019s Greek anti-austerity protests are among the biggest \u201csince the huge rallies back in 2011\u201d, according to Odysseus Trivalas, president of the civil servants\u2019 union ADEDY. Unions are estimating that well over 100,000 state workers and private employees took to the streets. Trivalas told our correspondent Helena Smith that: \u201cI think we sent a very strong message to the government and the Troika that the Greek people cannot make any more sacrifices, or tolerate any more behind-the-scenes exchanges of the kind they are now clearly preparing,\u201d Trivalas added that the turnout for the strike action had been \u201cmassive\u201d with more than 90% of workers walking off the job, showing that people will not accept further austerity cuts. The news of Germany\u2019s falling inflation rate may have driven even more money into eurozone government bonds. The price of French 10-year bonds just spiked, driving down the yield (interest rate) on the bonds to below 1% for the first time ever. Traders may be calculating that lower German inflation raises the odds of the ECB launching the long-awaited sovereign bond-buying QE programme. Back in the eurozone... Germany\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to its lowest rate in almost five years, in the latest sign of deflationary pressures stalking the euro area. The German Consumer Prices Index has risen by just 0.6% year-on-year, according to a flash estimate just released, down from 0.8% in October. Prices were flat month-on-month. And on an EU-harmonised basis, annual German inflation fell to 0.5%, from 0.7% last month. That\u2019s the lowest rate since February 2010, according to Reuters data. I think this raises the chances of the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate, released tomorrow, falling to 0.3% from the 0.4% recorded last month. The fall in inflation has partly been driven by the fall in the oil price. Carsten Brzeski, analyst at ING, points out that cheaper consumer goods and a drop in prices for vacation destinations and package tours also pushed inflation down. He\u2019s not worried though, saying: As German employment just reached another record-high in October, this drop in inflation should be inflationary rather than deflationary. Just think of Draghi\u2019s famous words \u201cwith low inflation, you can buy more stuff\u201d. At the current juncture, price expectations of both consumers and producers remain solidly anchored in Germany. Another shot from Vienna this morning: This chart explains how Opec\u2019s muscle has been weakened by the rise of rival energy sources, such as shale: Time for a recap. The oil price has fallen to new four-year lows today as members of the Opec cartel of producers hold a crunch meeting in Vienna. Opec is expected to resist calls to cut production quotas in response to the 36% slump in the crude oil price since June. That has wiped another 2% off Brent crude to around $76 per barrel, the lowest since September 2010. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have indicated that they will stick to existing production levels. Saudi\u2019s Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Naimi refused to give the press any titbits earlier, having already indicated that Opec will reach a \u201cunified position\u201d. The UAE\u2019s representative has said there is no reason to panic. Venezuela, though, is calling for Opec to lower its production goals. Its foreign minister Rafael Ram\u00edrez, told reporters that 2 million barrels of of excess oil are being produced each day, and it should be cut \u201cout of the market.\u201d Ram\u00edrez also blamed the US shale industry for destabilising the market. We should get Opec\u2019s decision this afternoon (perhaps 3pm GMT....) Barclays analyst Miswin Mahesh says that Opec\u2019s refusal to cut production shows that its grip on the energy sector has weakened, and that Saudi Arabia is more concerned with market share than profits. The oil price is likely to fall further if Opec stands pat today. Will Hedden, Premium Client Manager at IG, says: The sheer magnitude of the moves in oil recently have led many analysts to expect a cut to supply, as global growth concerns added to increased US production, and the rise of other hydrocarbons like shale gas pressurise the demand for traditional black gold. Failure to cut supply today will lead to further downward pressure on Brent and Nymex. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services warned that another slide in the oil price will have serious consequences for counties such as Russia. In other news.... Greece\u2019s deputy PM has suggested its bailout exit might be delayed, after failing to reach agreement with the Troika yesterday. Unions are holding a general strike in Greece now - these photos shows crowds of demonstrators, as transports links are hit. Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a record low of 6.6%. And inflation in Spain, and Saxony, has fallen more than expected. ECB chief Mario Draghi is now addressing students at the University of Helsinki. Draghi is explaining that the eurozone needs two elements to ensure its success: The first is that all euro area countries need to be able to thrive independently, the second is that euro area countries need to invest more in other mechanisms to share the cost of shocks. He says there is a strong argument that sovereignty over relevant economic policies should be exercised jointly by Eurozone members. Draghi also reminded his audience that three years ago, some experts believed the eurozone was about to collapse. They underestimated the political will to preserve the euro, he said, but warned that the single currency union needs to work for all its members. The full speech is online here. The deadlock over Greece\u2019s bailout exit comes as unions hold a general strike in protest at the job cuts and other austerity measures demanded by its lenders. The walkout - the first general strike in months - has forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights. Public offices have been shut, and local transport services badly hit. Hospitals are being staffed by emergency workers, while tax and other local public offices are shut today. Members of the main unions are now marching through Athens, calling on the government to refuse to implement further layoffs and tax rises: The private sector GSEE union says austerity is creating a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in Greece, adding: \u201cGSEE is resisting the dogmatic obsession of the government and the troika with austerity policies and tax hikes,\u201d Here\u2019s more photos from Athens: There is also speculation in Greece that next February\u2019s elections to replace outgoing president, Karolos Papoulias, could be brought forward in an attempt to ease the political uncertainty gripping the country. Former foreign minister Dora Baokoyannis told VIMA FM radio this morning that Greece was experiencing \u201ca deep political, not economic crisis\u201d that was now threatening to endanger any progress it had made. She said: \u201cThe picture of instability and uncertainty is at the expense of the Greek economy with every day that passes. The process for the election of the president of the republic should start now, and parliament should not close for Christmas \u2026 we have a deep political crisis. Not an economic crisis.\u201d Just in, Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos has told reporters that the country\u2019s bailout programme could be extended by a few weeks. This follows the failure to reach a deal with its creditors yesterday, Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports. Venizelos told reporters gathered outside the prime minister\u2019s office that: \u201cThe European [side of the] programme expires on 31st December. The aim is for the last installment [of aid] to have been released by the 31st. If for technical reasons some procedures have not been completed, there could be an extension but not a new memorandum [bailout accord].\u201d The delay could be \u201cweeks or a few days\u201d, he added. He was speaking after talks with PM Antonis Samaras, on this week\u2019s abortive negotiations with creditors in Paris (and as unions hold a general strike). Venizelos added: \u201cA new programme means a new loan. That cannot happen.\u201d Government officials saying that negotiations with auditors will continue via email and teleconference calls. Christos Protopappas who represented Venizelos\u2019 Pasok socialist party at the Paris talks, confirmed this morning that the 21-hour negotiations had broken down primarily because the IMF had toughened its stance. \u201cThe budget [for 2015] was the focus of great doubt,\u201d he said adding that the troika wanted cuts in \u201cmajor pensions\u201d and further tax increases. \u201c We told them, these things cannot happen, and are not necessary. They are circulating scenarios about prolonging the memorandum [bailout accord]. We are saying no to a six-month extension.\u201d The deadlock is pushing up Greece\u2019s borrowing costs, on nervousness that the Greek crisis is flaring up again.... The reluctance of many Opec members to agree an output cut shows that the cartel\u2019s grip on the industry has weakened, says Miswin Mahesh, oil analyst at Barclays. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Mahesh explains he doesn\u2019t expect much from today\u2019s meeting in Vienna. If Opec don\u2019t agree to limit production, he says, then they show they no longer have a grasp on the oil sector. But if they were agree to cut production, say by one million barrels per day to 30m/day, it\u2019s not clear they could implement it. And Opec members also know that other suppliers, from outside the cartel, would fill the gap. Mahesh reckons that Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategy is to protect its market share by sitting tight, watching for the oil price to stabilise over the next few months, and then adjust to the situation. Shares in oil producers have fallen this morning, tracking the selloff in crude (Brent is currently down 2.5% at $75.77 per barrel) OPEC\u2019s (likely) reluctance to cut output today has knocked 3.5% off Petrofac\u2019s share price, 1.5% off BG Group and 1.3% off Royal Dutch Shell. Elsewhere in the markets, the yield (or interest rate) on a flock of European government bonds is tumbling again to new record lows. This flow of money into eurozone sovereign debt has driven the yield on French 10-year bonds down to just 1%. It shows traders are anticipating an ECB QE programme, weak eurozone growth, and very low inflation (or worse). Another photo of Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi (shaking hands, on the left) before the press pack were driven from the room. Today\u2019s Opec meeting has officially started, according to a newsflash from Reuters. Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister, Rafael Ramirez, took a swipe at America\u2019s burgeoning shale industry as he arrived at the Opec meeting, suggesting it should be reined in. Ramirez said (via Reuters): \u201cThe U.S. is producing in a very, very bad manner. The shale oil, I mean it is a disaster from the point of view of climate change...\u201d Unlike the environmentally friendly oil industry?! Venezuela is reportedly planning to propose an output cut today; the consensus, though, is that other countries led by Saudi Arabia will resist (see 8.02am onwards for the key quotes) Jonah Hull, Al Jazeera\u2019s man at the OPEC briefing, shows that oil ministers have taken their seats in Vienna and are being interrogated by the press.... Back in Vienna, Saudi oil minister Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Naimi wasn\u2019t keen to engage with the press as the OPEC meeting started. \u201cI\u2019ve made enough comments\u201d, he said, according to this video clip from CNBC\u2019s Rose Michelson: The text of ECB chief Mario Draghi\u2019s speech to the Helsinki parliament has been released. No show-stoppers; Draghi will tell students that monetary policy can\u2019t do all the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d on its own, and repeated his call for a \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d to put the eurozone economy back on track. Italian business confidence has taken another hit this month, as the country\u2019s recession hurts the sector. The monthly index of corporate morale has fallen to 87.7 this month, from 89.1 in October (100 is the long-term average). There is one encouraging sign - manufacturers are slightly less gloomy. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment total had fallen again as its labour market shrugs off the economy\u2019s slowdown. The number of people out of work in Germany fell by 14,000 this month (on a seasonally adjusted basis), to 2.872m. That means Germany\u2019s unemployment rate is just 6.6%, a record low according to reports. October\u2019s figures have also been revised, to show the rate hit 6.6% last month too, not 6.7% as first reported. Germany\u2019s economy skirted recession last quarter, with growth of just 0.1%. But its workforce does not appear to be suffering. The oil price is sliding rapidly to fresh four-year lows, as traders come to the conclusion that OPEC will agree not to cut output at today\u2019s meeting in Vienna. Brent crude has slumped by 2.7%, or over $2 per barrel, to $75.60. And US crude is down by over 2% to $72 per barrel. There\u2019s no news out of Vienna yet, where OPEC members have gathered this morning. Neil Hume of the FT reports that oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Nigeria and Algeria have all declined to speak to the media as they rocked up. Quite a media scrum too: Today\u2019s OPEC meeting is a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d, reckons Marc Ostwald, City analyst at ADM Investor Services, especially if the cartel declines to slice output. He adds: The signals from the various members appear to suggests that the Gulf oil producers (Kuwait, Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia) are set to reject demands from other members (and indeed Russia and Mexico) for an output cut, because they appear to be more concerned about \u201cguarding market share\u201d, which in turn will leave even more questions about the precarious budget positions of the other members. We have worrying inflation data from the eurozone too, which could increase the pressure on the ECB to launch a sovereign bond-buying programme. Spain\u2019s annual consumer prices index has fallen to minus 0.4%, down from -0.1% in October. On a EU harmonised basis, inflation has fallen to -0.5%, an acceleration from -0.2% last month. Inflationary pressures in the German province of Saxony have also weakened this month. Its annual inflation rate fell to +0.7%, from +1.0% last month. And prices shrank by 0.1% during the month. Reminder: We get the wider German inflation rate at lunchtime, and then the eurozone figure tomorrow.... Brent crude has experienced a dramatic slide; down from $115 per barrel in late June to just $76 today, as this chart from Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever shows: But why? There are several factors; weakening global growth means less demand for crude, while the stronger US currency has also pushed down the cost of commodities priced in US dollars. Also, the shale gas revolution has boosted America\u2019s oil production levels to their highest in decades. JP Morgan analysts reckon the oil price will soon fall below $70 without Opec action; other analysts have suggested we could even see $60/barrel. Singapore-based Daniel Ang of Phillip Capital agrees that the \u201cconsensus\u201d reached by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates means no output cuts today: He told Reuters: \u201cDreams of rising oil prices [have been] smashed with pre-OPEC meeting sentiments. Brace yourselves for lower oil prices.\u201d Several other oil ministers have also indicated that Opec will resist pressure to cut output at today\u2019s meeting. UAE oil minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told the FT that the market will, eventually, fix the oversupply in the oil market. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should panic. There is nothing that should cause us to panic.\u201d And Kuwait has suggested that Opec will cope, whether the oil price is $60 or $80. The oil price has hit a fresh four-year low this morning, as speculation grows that producers will not agree output cuts at the crucial OPEC meeting in Vienna today. Brent crude oil slipped by over $1 per barrel, or 1.5%, to $76.58, extending the sell-off that began five months ago and has shaken the commodities market. New York crude has also slipped, to around $73 per barrel. The slide follows a stream of reports from Vienna that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will not agree to cut output at this week\u2019s meeting. Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, has told reporters that Opec will take a \u201cunified position\u201d at today\u2019s meeting. That follows days of leaks suggesting producers will not slash output. Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: Crude oil is trading at another four-year low this morning, as confirmation is beginning to emerge from the OPEC meeting that there will be no output cuts announced later today. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. On the agenda today.... Members of the Opec oil cartel are meeting in Vienna today; despite recent price falls, they are thought unlikely to cut production. More on that in a moment. A general strike has been called in Greece today, to protest against its austerity measures, hours after talks with its lenders over its bailout programme failed to reach a deal. In the eurozone, we get the latest flash estimate German inflation data for November (1pm GMT). Some economists think prices pressures have eased again this month, which could pull the wider euro area closer to deflation this month. The latest German unemployment data is also due, at 8.55am GMT There will probably be fresh chatter about the European Central Bank moving into full-blown quantitative easing today. ECB president Mario Draghi is giving a speech in Helsinki at 11.30am; Germany\u2019s top central banker, the hawkish Jens Weidmann, speaks 45 minutes later in Frankfurt. Not expecting any news from the US, though, as it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And UK shoppers will learn this morning which British supermarkets have been particularly hit by the potentially lethal food-poisoning bug campylobacter. As we report this morning: The Food Standards Agency will publish rates of contamination for each supermarket chain. The industry is bracing itself for the results to be significantly worse than those published by the FSA in August, which found six in 10 chickens were contaminated. Campylobacter rates tend to rise in the summer and averages similar to 75% found by the European Food Safety Authority in 2010 are expected. Full story: Supermarkets prepare to be shamed over chicken contamination I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government has ruled out selling off its remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail before next year\u2019s general election. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said the government would retain the minority stake for \u201cthe foreseeable future\u201d. The coalition had been actively considering selling the remaining shares but scrapped the idea as Royal Mail\u2019s share price continued to decline. The shares, which floated at 330p when Royal Mail was privatised in October last year and quickly soared as high as 600p, have lost 26% of their value so far this year, closing on Thursday night at 420p. \u201cI think we should remain [significant shareholders in Royal Mail] for the time being,\u201d Cable told ITV News. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to do anything within the foreseeable future.\u201d Cable and the government have been roundly criticised for selling off Royal Mail too cheaply. The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, said Cable\u2019s desperation to privatise the company had cost taxpayers at least \u00a3750m. Cable has ordered a review of the government\u2019s sell-off procedures following widespread criticism. There was huge demand for the 60% of the company available, while Royal Mail staff were given 10% of the shares as part of the privatisation. The shares were trading as high as 598p in March, which in theory could have generated almost \u00a31.8bn for the Treasury \u2013 \u00a3530m more than the government could make from selling the shares at Thursday\u2019s price. The department for business, innovation and skills and the shareholder executive \u2013 which oversees state-owned assets \u2013 held talks over selling the remaining 30% in March but decided against it. Labour has ruled out selling any further stakes in Royal Mail if it wins the 2015 election. Ian Murray, Labour\u2019s shadow trade and investment minister, said: \u201cGiven the catastrophic fire sale of Royal Mail, Vince Cable\u2019s announcement will not come as a surprise to anyone. \u201cThe priority of the next Labour government will be safeguarding vital postal services. We will retain the public\u2019s stake in Royal Mail, alongside securing the universal service obligation after its expiry in 2021, ensuring that Royal Mail services continue to be available through the Post Office network and that all postal service operators are subject to high performance and service quality standards. \u201cCable is trying to play catch up with Labour\u2019s plans, but having flogged off Royal Mail, leaving taxpayers short-changed and services at risk, he isn\u2019t fooling anyone in his attempt to pose as a defender of postal services and this is too little, too late.\u201d On Wednesday, Cable accused Royal Mail of \u201cscaremongering\u201d over claims it will not be able to maintain a universal delivery service. His intervention came after Royal Mail stepped up warnings that its public duty to deliver mail anywhere in the country, six days a week, for the same price, is under threat. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: \u201cWe are pleased that the secretary of state recognises the importance of the government retaining its stake in Royal Mail and should see that as a long-term responsibility. \u201cThe public respects their postal service and want to see the universal service protected. The government needs to maintain a strategic overview of the company for not just for the foreseeable future but for the long term\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Asda has expressed its disappointment after it topped a supermarket league table for the presence of the food-poisoning bug campylobacter in fresh chickens. Asda was the worst-performing retailer with 78% of its chickens taken to laboratories testing positive for poterntially lethal campylobacter in the first six months of a year-long study by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Asda was followed by the Co-op (73%), and then Morrison\u2019s, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose, all on 69%, with Marks &amp; Spencer showing an incidence of 67% and Tesco the best at 64%. \u201cWe take campylobacter seriously and it goes without saying that we\u2019re disappointed with these findings,\u201d said an Asda spokesperson. \u201cAlong with other retailers, we\u2019re working hard to find a solution.\u201d At the same time, Britain\u2019s largest chicken processor warned against a hysterical response to the FSA findings, arguing a food scare that put shoppers off buying chicken could \u201cconsquently damage the UK\u2019s food and farming industries\u201d. \u201cIf there was a scientifically proven intervention which would completely eradicate campylobacter, it would have already been implemented,\u201d said 2 Sisters Food Group, added that it had already put \u00a310m into initiatives to tackle the problem and planned to invest more. Asda also fared worst on a second measure that looked at the most heavily contaminated chickens \u2013 those its food scientists identified as having more than 1,000 colony-forming units of campylobacter per gram. Of the Asda chickens sampled 28% were in this bracket which the FSA considers most likely to infect consumers. The industry average was 18%. Asda said last year it had launched \u201cRoast in the Bag\u201d chicken to remove the need to handle raw meat. It added that from next month it would start trialling SonoSteam, a new technology that is designed to kill campylobacter by blasting the chicken\u2019s skin with both steam and ultrasound. The supermarket will be doing this in partnership with its biggest poultry supplier Faccenda Foods. The Co-op said it was also \u201ctesting new technologies to find a long-term solution\u201d, adding: \u201cFood safety is an absolute priority for our business and we are working hard with our suppliers and farmers to tackle campylobacter in farms and during production.\u201d The British Poultry Council (BPC) said the overall results of the study showed how \u201cuniversal and challenging\u201d the campylobacter problem was. \u201cPoultry producers have looked at every part of their production chain to see where new ideas and technology can combat this very complex bacteria,\u201d said a spokesman. The industry group said it hoped the combination of improved biosecurity on farms, new methods in the slaughterhouse and new technologies would help reduce the level of campylobacter in chickens over time. Tesco was found to be leading the pack in the war on campylobacter. Just under two-thirds of its chickens were contaminated with the bug. Only 11% were heavily contaminated, putting Tesco in touching distance of the 10% target the FSA has set the industry for the end of 2015. No retailers are currently meeting this level. Tesco said it would be co-funding the first trial of rapid surface chilling with one of its suppliers, in the early part of 2015. The retailler is also involved with schemes that incentivise poultry farmers for keeeping their flocks free of campylobacter. Supermarkets have been rushing out plans to clean up their poultry supply chains ahead of the FSA announcement. Retailers are desperate to appear to be proactive as they face potentially damaging revelations, just weeks before the second anniversary of the horsemeat scandal that led to a collapse in sales of beef ready meals. Campylobacter thrives in the gut and faeces of poultry and can easily be spread from bird to bird on farms or in abattoirs. The bug is killed by cooking but is easily spread when raw meat contaminates surfaces and utensils in the kitchen. It is the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK, making about 280,000 people ill each year and causing about 100 deaths. Thursday\u2019s test results on chicken come after a decade-long campaign by the FSA to get supermarkets and the poultry industry to clean up their meat. But a Guardian investigation into industry hygiene lapses earlier this year revealed that the majority of fresh supermarket chicken remained contaminated with campylobacter.",

The so-called postwar golden age is also the story of a flatlining oil price, which remained at around $2 a barrel during that period. Five Middle Eastern nations formed the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960 but it was more than a decade before Opec bared its teeth. Then, in the autumn of 1973 the cartel responded to Israeli successes in the Yom Kippur war by announcing an oil embargo of the west. The price of crude rose almost five-fold within six months, raising business costs and threatening living standards. Stagflation \u2013 a period in which inflation and unemployment both rose \u2013 followed. A brief and fragile recovery in the mid to late 1970s was quickly extinguished when the start of the Iran-Iraq war resulted in a further doubling of oil prices. And a second, even more painful, recession. But the slump in the west meant demand for oil fell. Producers could no longer sell all the crude they were pumping and with the key producer \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 ensuring that global output remained at high levels, the price fell to below $10 a barrel by the mid-1980s. Business costs fell, consumers were spending less on filling up their cars and heating their homes. The late 1980s recorded a colossal boom that was already running into inflationary problems when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990. A third oil spike was accompanied by a third global recession. As in the 1980s, producers could not make higher prices stick. And as the price of crude subsided so growth in the west picked up. These were the years in which Bill Clinton balanced the US budget and when the UK embarked on a long period of uninterrupted growth that lasted from 1992 to 2008. By then, though, the global economy was gripped by a fourth oil shock. With the cost of a barrel of crude peaking at almost $150 a barrel, policymakers faced a familiar problem: inflation was rising even while their economies were shrinking, only with the added complication that the banks were on the brink of meltdown. So what are the conclusions of this brief history lesson? It is clear that oil matters. Although economies in the west have become less oil-intensive over the past few decades, that has been offset by the thirst for energy in developing countries such as China and India. Opec has less clout than it once did, partly due to the importance of non-Opec producers such as Russia and partly because of the shale revolution in the US. Members of the cartel have different interests, with Saudi Arabia better placed to deal with lower prices than Venezuela or Iran. But Opec still matters: witness the fall in oil prices as it became clear that there would be no production curbs emerging from the current meeting in Vienna.

      "body": "<p>The latest figures on construction activity released on Wednesday by the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/8755.0Main%20Features1Sep%202014?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=8755.0&amp;issue=Sep%202014&amp;num=&amp;view=\">Bureau of Statistics</a> reveal that the transition of the economy from the mining boom looks to have hit a bit of a speed bump. Building construction in both the residential and non-residential sectors fell in the September quarter while engineering construction continued to plunge. The figures suggest the RBA might need to look at further reducing interest rates even at a time the OECD is warning rates should be raised. </p> <p>The quarterly construction figures allow us to get a good picture of economic activity across the country. The figures are broken into building or engineering construction but within this we can also break building construction down in to residential and non-residential. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 1\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/sPJGf/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Engineering construction involves things like roads and bridges, but also the construction of mines. </p> <p>Since the end of the investment phase of the mining boom, engineering construction has fallen off a cliff. In trend terms it fell 3% in the past quarter and 10% in the past 12 months. </p> <p>The RBA\u2019s strategy has been to lower interest rates in the hope that this would spur housing construction and ease the transition from the mining boom by helping to spur investment and work in the non-mining sectors of the economy. </p> <p>And as we know from house prices in Sydney, the tactic did seem to work. Home loan approvals rose and so too did residential building construction. Annual residential building construction in the past 12 months has grown by 11% in trend terms. This was a massive turnaround from the 12 months to March 2012 when residential building activity fell 7.7%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/S5DHY/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So problem solved? Well, perhaps not. </p> <p>The latest figures released on Wednesday showed that in seasonally adjusted terms residential building work fell 1.6% in the last quarter and non-residential building fell 0.1%. </p> <p>While the trend figure was more positive and suggested such work grew by 1.8% in the quarter, even this is heading the wrong way. The past two quarters have shown less growth than the quarter before it, and the 1.8% growth is the lowest since this time last year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/uQ0EQ/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Given unemployment remains high, and investment in the mining industry continues to fall off the back of falling iron ore prices, now is not a good time for the housing construction boom to end. </p> <p>It all goes to the difficulty of managing this transition. The value of engineering construction in Australia till the end of 2010 was less than the total building construction work. This meant falls in engineering construction could be somewhat easily balanced by lowering interest rates to cause building work to rise. </p> <p>But engineering construction grew so fast in the 21 months from December 2010 till September 2012 that it went from accounting for 50% of total construction to 62%. This means that declines in engineering work require greater growth in housing and other building work to keep things equal. And when you have engineering work falling by 10% in 12 months, that\u2019s hard to muster.</p> <p>Thus while building construction has risen 8% in the past 12 months, total construction work has fallen 3%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/wedBF/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since September 2012 the 14% fall in engineering construction is equal to a fall of around $4.8bn; whereas the 12% increase in building construction in that time is equal to just $2.4bn. </p> <p>The difficulty also lies in a geographical sense. Prior to the mining boom, New South Wales and Victoria together accounted for over half of all of Australia\u2019s construction work; now they account for just 38%, whereas Western Australia and Queensland together account for 51%: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Qzjxm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Except, WA and Queensland are much more dependent upon engineering construction. In WA, engineering construction accounts for 74% of all construction; in Queensland it is 68%. But in NSW and Victoria it is just 41% and 27% respectively:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Qzjxm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So for the RBA\u2019s strategy to work it effectively means that big falls in engineering construction in WA and Queensland need to be countered by very much bigger rises in building construction in NSW and Victoria. </p> <p>But while there were good signs six to 12 months ago, in both states the heat in building construction is coming off the boil:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 7\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/0ozFb/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In Victoria, building construction grew by just 0.13% in trend terms in the September quarter and it actually fell 2.8% in seasonally adjusted terms. That figure might be a bit erratic, but it certainly isn\u2019t headed the right way. </p> <p>The problem as well with trying to create a strong boom in housing construction is that it generally causes a boom in housing prices. That is why yesterday, in its semi-annual economic outlook, the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/economy/australia-economic-forecast-summary.htm\">OECD </a>suggested that the RBA should \u201cwithdraw monetary stimulus\u201d (ie raise interest rates) \u201cin the second quarter of 2015\u201d. It believed the \u201cbooming housing market and mortgage lending will require continued close attention by the authorities\u201d.</p> <p>But while the RBA will pay attention to house prices (which apart from in Sydney, are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/nov/13/sydneys-house-prices-race-up-but-homeowners-arent-feeling-any-richer\">generally growing</a> at below average rates), it will also pay attention to actual construction work \u2013 as that is the primary purpose of the low interest rates strategy. </p> <p>These construction figures would give the RBA some cause for concern that their decision to keep rates steady for 14 months is the right one. </p> <p>The record low interest rates don\u2019t seem to have been low enough to keep the housing market going. New housing construction fell 5.2% in seasonally adjusted terms in the past quarter \u2013 the worst fall since September 2010. </p> <p>The figures show that growth in non-mining construction work looks to have stalled while the mining sector investment and construction continues to plummet. All of which suggests Australia\u2019s transition economy remains a work in progress, and may be in need of some tweaking with even lower interest rates. </p>",

The latest figures released on Wednesday showed that in seasonally adjusted terms residential building work fell 1.6% in the last quarter and non-residential building fell 0.1%. While the trend figure was more positive and suggested such work grew by 1.8% in the quarter, even this is heading the wrong way. The past two quarters have shown less growth than the quarter before it, and the 1.8% growth is the lowest since this time last year: Given unemployment remains high, and investment in the mining industry continues to fall off the back of falling iron ore prices, now is not a good time for the housing construction boom to end. It all goes to the difficulty of managing this transition. The value of engineering construction in Australia till the end of 2010 was less than the total building construction work. This meant falls in engineering construction could be somewhat easily balanced by lowering interest rates to cause building work to rise. But engineering construction grew so fast in the 21 months from December 2010 till September 2012 that it went from accounting for 50% of total construction to 62%. This means that declines in engineering work require greater growth in housing and other building work to keep things equal. And when you have engineering work falling by 10% in 12 months, that\u2019s hard to muster. Thus while building construction has risen 8% in the past 12 months, total construction work has fallen 3%: Since September 2012 the 14% fall in engineering construction is equal to a fall of around $4.8bn; whereas the 12% increase in building construction in that time is equal to just $2.4bn. The difficulty also lies in a geographical sense. Prior to the mining boom, New South Wales and Victoria together accounted for over half of all of Australia\u2019s construction work; now they account for just 38%, whereas Western Australia and Queensland together account for 51%: Except, WA and Queensland are much more dependent upon engineering construction. In WA, engineering construction accounts for 74% of all construction; in Queensland it is 68%. But in NSW and Victoria it is just 41% and 27% respectively: So for the RBA\u2019s strategy to work it effectively means that big falls in engineering construction in WA and Queensland need to be countered by very much bigger rises in building construction in NSW and Victoria. But while there were good signs six to 12 months ago, in both states the heat in building construction is coming off the boil: In Victoria, building construction grew by just 0.13% in trend terms in the September quarter and it actually fell 2.8% in seasonally adjusted terms. That figure might be a bit erratic, but it certainly isn\u2019t headed the right way. The problem as well with trying to create a strong boom in housing construction is that it generally causes a boom in housing prices. That is why yesterday, in its semi-annual economic outlook, the OECD suggested that the RBA should \u201cwithdraw monetary stimulus\u201d (ie raise interest rates) \u201cin the second quarter of 2015\u201d. It believed the \u201cbooming housing market and mortgage lending will require continued close attention by the authorities\u201d. But while the RBA will pay attention to house prices (which apart from in Sydney, are generally growing at below average rates), it will also pay attention to actual construction work \u2013 as that is the primary purpose of the low interest rates strategy. These construction figures would give the RBA some cause for concern that their decision to keep rates steady for 14 months is the right one. The record low interest rates don\u2019t seem to have been low enough to keep the housing market going. New housing construction fell 5.2% in seasonally adjusted terms in the past quarter \u2013 the worst fall since September 2010. The figures show that growth in non-mining construction work looks to have stalled while the mining sector investment and construction continues to plummet. All of which suggests Australia\u2019s transition economy remains a work in progress, and may be in need of some tweaking with even lower interest rates.",
