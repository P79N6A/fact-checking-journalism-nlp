      "bodyText": "A worldwide escalation of the trade tensions between the US and its major trading partners would have consequences for global trade equivalent to the 2008 financial crisis, the World Bank has warned. Using conservative estimates to assess the risks to the world economy from rising economic nationalism of the kind promoted by Donald Trump, the Washington-based organisation warned of \u201csevere consequences\u201d for world trade and economic growth, with the harshest impact reserved for developing nations. Under the scenario outlined in its latest global economic prospects report published on Tuesday, the bank found a broad-based increase in the use of import tariffs worldwide \u2013 to the maximum levels permitted by the World Trade Organisation \u2013 would trigger a decline in global trade amounting to 9%. While that would be similar to the drop experienced during the financial crisis of 2008-09, it warned the impact could be even greater if countries went further than the WTO rules. Franziska Ohnsorge, the lead author of the bank\u2019s report, said: \u201cThe threat of trade protectionism is a real risk. Anything that puts sand in the wheels of global trade is a risk to global growth.\u201d The intervention by the bank, which was established alongside the International Monetary Fund after the second world war to reduce poverty in poor countries and to foster greater international collaboration and economic development, comes amid an increasingly bitter trade dispute between the US and its traditional allies. The Trump administration last week imposed border tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, triggering angry responses and countermeasures, which could unravel decades of political consensus over the benefits of free trade. Concerns also remain over an escalation of tensions between the US and China amid similar threats of protectionism from the White House and a promise of retaliation by Beijing. The bank said the risks from a full-blown trade war would be worse for developing nations, because their fortunes are often linked to the strength of major nations\u2019 economies. Ohnsorge said a 1% decline in growth in the US, China or the euro area could reduce growth in emerging economies over a year or two by up to 1.1%. Without giving precise details for how much a full-scale economic conflict would lower world GDP, she said: \u201cTrade has been an important source of euro area growth, Japanese growth and a lot of emerging market economies are very linked to that growth.\u201d At the same time as sounding the warning on trade, the World Bank maintained a forecast for steady global growth to persist this year and next, in a continuation of the favourable economic conditions that spread around the world last year. Global economic growth is forecast to remain robust at 3.1% in 2018, before slowing gradually. However, it warned there were growing risks since its last assessment made in January. Alongside the threat posed by economic protectionism, the bank cited potential upsets from financial markets as central banks raise interest rates. There are also risks from high levels of debt in some countries, including China.",

    "webTitle": "UK government clears Comcast and Fox takeover bids for Sky \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a busy day for corporate news, two events dominated. This morning the UK government sold a 7.7% stake in the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, raising \u00a32.5bn but crystallising a \u00a32.1bn loss on the price originally paid to rescue the bank. The final cost of the bailout could be \u00a330bn... or perhaps even more. The government defended the timing of the sale but some analysts suggested it was done to get it out of the way before the Brexit vote next week. Critics said it was a wasted opportunity to help reform the banking sector. The other big development was culture minister Matt Hancock\u2019s decision on the bids for Sky. He gave the go-ahead to the Comcast offer, and also the bid from 21st Century Fox, provided the Murdoch-controlled business agreed to sell Sky News to Disney or another buyer. Sky welcomed the news, which is likely to prompt a full takeover battle for the business while 21st Century Fox said it had already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney. But Labour expressed concerns about the sale of Sky News, saying its independence must be protected. Elsewhere the latest snapshot of the UK services sector showed stronger than expected growth which lifted the pound - on the basis it puts an interest rate rise back on the agenda - and sent the FTSE 100 0.7% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here is a handy run-through of the possible timetable for the Sky bids, courtesy of Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis: Comcast\u2019s Rule 2.7 announcement of 25 Apr outlined its intention to make a Takeover Offer for Sky subject to pre-conditions being met. Competition clearance from the EU is now the final pre-condition. A decision will be made by 15 June according to the EC Competition website. Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep). Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky\u2019s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that. In reality, Sky\u2019s board will need to manage timetables such that shareholders are able to give adequate consideration to both offers. Sky shares have edged up 0.29% to \u00a313.54 after the US government cleared the Comcast and Fox bids for the company, albeit the latter was given the go-ahead on the condition that Sky News was sold. Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland has closed down 5.3% at 266p, compared to the 271p a share the government received in the sale of the latest tranche of its shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 0.7% at 7686.8, undermined by a rise in sterling after better than expected service sector figures put a possible interest rate rise back on the agenda. Elsewhere the US tech boom continues: A bidding war for Sky is now on the cards but it is hard to judge how much higher the offers will go, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: Sky shares traded up about half a per cent [on the day] at \u00a313.55 as the Fox and Comcast bids were effectively waved through by culture secretary Matt Hancock. The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u2019s got little European presence. A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. Then it\u2019s up to Comcast and we\u2019ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u2019s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u2019t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u2019s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government. Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said: The culture secretary\u2019s decision to allow the 21st Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content. It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid. This could be a sign that the organisation has recognised that there is a real need for medium and large-scale companies in the sector to leverage their scale. Sky is not immune to the disruption facing the industry, with the rise of agile competitors such as Amazon and Netflix. Attracting the attention of consumers has become more difficult and the business needs to reduce costs where it can, whilst continuing to produce quality content. Other media companies will be willing the bid to complete successfully \u2013 particularly with the outcome of the CMA\u2019s investigation into Trinity Mirror\u2019s proposed takeover of Northern &amp; Shell still pending. More from the CMA: The full CMA report is available here. From the 414 page Competitions and Markets Authority report on the possible Sky bids, here is its view on the timetable for a Sky News sale: Sky shares have done little since Hancock unveiled his decision on both the Comcast and 21st Century Fox bids. They stood at \u00a313.53 when Hancock stood up, and are now almost imperceptibly higher at \u00a313.56. That compares with the \u00a310.75 a share on offer from Fox, and the better offer from Comcast of \u00a312.50 a share. Here\u2019s a link to the full statement from Matt Hancock on both bids for Sky: Here\u2019s the key section from Matt Hancock\u2019s statement -- outlining why 21 Century Fox must sell off Sky News in return for the government approving its takeover for Sky. I agree with the CMA that divesting Sky News to Disney, as proposed by Fox, or to an alternative suitable buyer, with an agreement to ensure it is funded for at least ten years, is likely to be the most proportionate and effective remedy for the public interest concerns that have been identified. The CMA report sets out some draft terms for such a divestment, and Fox has written to me to offer undertakings on effectively the same terms. The proposals include significant commitments from Fox. But there are some important issues on the draft undertakings which still need to be addressed. I need to be confident that the final undertakings ensure that Sky News: remains financially viable over the long-term; is able to operate as a major UK-based news provider; and is able to take its editorial decisions independently, free from any potential outside influence. As a result, I have asked my officials to begin immediate discussions with the parties to finalise the details with a view to agreeing an acceptable form of the remedy, so we can all be confident Sky News can be divested in a way that works for the long term. Under the legislation, I am required to consult formally for 15 days on the undertakings. Subject to the willingness of the parties to agree the details, I aim to publish this consultation within a fortnight. I am optimistic that we can achieve this goal, not least given the willingness 21st Century Fox has shown in developing these credible proposals. However, if we can\u2019t agree terms at this point, then I agree with the CMA that the only effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether. This is not my preferred approach. Here\u2019s a clip of Chris Bryant suggesting that Kay Burley will drive Matt Hancock out of parliament if Sky News hits the buffers. Anything Martin Bell can do, Kay can do too..... Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine says her party has concerns about Fox\u2019s proposed takeover of Sky. She welcomes the plan for Sky News to be divested... but wonders if rival bidder Comcast will give similar reassurances about media independence if it wins the battle for Sky. Matt Hancock replies that Comcast has given undertakings and assurances. By law, he looked at its bid for Sky because of its material size. He concluded that Comcast\u2019s bid did not raise public interest concerns, so the government will not issue an intervention notice. Hancock adds that he hopes the Sky takeover battle will reach a conclusion that \u201cdemonstrates with confidence\u201d that Sky News will be independent and viable, so parliament can be content with the state of media plurality in future. Back in parliament, Labour MP Chris Bryant has criticised the proposal for Sky News to be sold off if 21st Century Fox wins the takeover battle for Sky. He warns that Sky News could be starved of money by whoever buys it (either Disney or another owner). So, in a few years they\u2019ll come back to the government and ask to be subsumed back into Fox. To laughter, Bryant suggests that Matt Hancock could even find himself facing a TV news veteran at the polling booth. Kay Burley will be out of a job, and she\u2019ll stand in West Sussex and defeat him, because most people in this country would prefer a diversity of ownership of media and we want to keep Sky as independence as possible. Hancock replies that he relishes the prospect of a contest in West Sussex with anyone (!) but doesn\u2019t accept that Sky News will be starved of funds in the future. Here\u2019s a clip of Tom Watson telling parliament that Labour has serious concerns about the proposed sale of Sky News, and that the channel\u2019s \u2018independent and rigorous\u2019 independence must be protected. Here\u2019s our media editor, Jim Waterson, on today\u2019s announcement: The UK government has approved a bid from US media giant Comcast to take over Sky, while indicating it is minded to approve a rival bid from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox providing it sells Sky News to another organisation. The decisions are likely to set up a multibillion-pound bidding war for the British broadcaster. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a318.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at \u00a322bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons, while indicating he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul\u2019s family over the UK news business. Here\u2019s his full story: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has also welcomed the government\u2019s decision. In a statement to shareholders, 21CF says it has already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney (to address those concerns about media plurality). Here\u2019s its statement: 21st Century Fox (\u201c21CF\u201d) welcomes today\u2019s announcement by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that he has cleared 21CF\u2019s proposed acquisition of the remaining shares in Sky on broadcasting standards, as recommended by the Competition and Markets Authority (\u201cCMA\u201d). Regarding the effects on media plurality we note that the CMA recommended to the Secretary of State that divestiture is \u201cthe most effective and proportionate remedy\u201d. 21CF has already submitted proposed undertakings to achieve the divestiture of Sky News to Disney. We note that the Secretary of State agrees with this solution and has instructed officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (\u201cDCMS\u201d) to agree final undertakings that he would be prepared to accept and consult on within the two-week timeframe. We now look forward to engaging with DCMS and we are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction. Sky says it welcomes Matt Hancock\u2019s announcements (not a surprise, as it paves the way for a full-blooded takeover battle for the company). It adds: In respect of 21CF\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sky, Sky notes that the Secretary of State considers that the undertakings provided by 21CF have provided a good starting point to overcome the adverse public interest effects of the proposed merger that he has identified, and that DCMS Officials have now been instructed to seek to agree final undertakings with 21CF. The Secretary of State has stated that, dependent on the outcome of these discussions, he would hope to be in a position to consult on any agreed final undertakings within the next two weeks. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson is responding to Hancock now. He warns that selling Sky News to Disney could backfire, if the planned takeover of 21 CF by Disney should collapse. This could leave Sky News vulnerable. The CMA\u2019s and Hancock have concluded that that the takeover would not threaten broadcasting standards. Watson, though, queries this view. He suggests that upcoming court cases brought against The Sun could show maladministration by Fox, which might make the minister change his view. Now onto 21 Century Fox\u2019s takeover bid for Sky. Matt Hancock tells MPs that the Competition and Markets Authority has concluded that 21CN\u2019s bid could operate against the public interest, for two reasons: potential erosion of Sky News\u2019s editorial independence. Increased influence of Murdoch family trust on public opinion and the UK\u2019s political agenda. Hancock says various remedies have been proposed. He says that the idea of divesting Sky News to Disney [which is hoping to take over 21st Century Fox] or to an alternative provider with funding for at least 10 years, is the most proportionate and effective remedy to address these concerns. Hancock is saying he will approve 21 Century Fox\u2019s bid for Sky can proceed - if he is satisfied that Sky News\u2019 independence is guaranteed. Hancock says he has asked officials to begin immediate discussions with 21 CF to draw up a final proposal for Sky News to be divested in a satisfactory way. Culture minister Matt Hancock says he has considered Comcast and 21 Century Fox\u2019s bids for Sky separately. Comcast first.... Hancock rules that the deal does not does not raise public interest concerns. So, he will not be issuing an intervention notice. That\u2019s a green light for Comcast! Heathrow questions are finally over. Matt Hancock has descended from his holding pattern and is giving his statement on the Sky takeover now. Matt Hancock will give his decision on the Sky takeover once transport secretary Chris Grayling finishes answering questions from MPs about Heathrow Airport. The government has decided to back plans to build a third runway at Heathrow, after years of prevarication. Plenty of MPs want their say. Some support the plan -- as do unions and business groups. But other MPs (especially with constituencies in or near West London) are very worried about the environmental impact. It\u2019s also ironic that London is getting another runway while the railways network in the North of England suffers severe disruption after decades of under-investment. Our Politics Live blog has the details: The Financial Times predicts that both Sky takeover offers will get the green light from the government today. The FT\u2019s Matthew Garrahan explains: The fate of competing bids for Sky by 21st Century Fox and Comcast will become clear today when culture secretary Matt Hancock delivers the UK government\u2019s verdict on whether to block or clear each offer. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has been embroiled in regulatory scrutiny for 18 months with its bid to take full control of Sky, offering \u00a310.75 a share, valuing the company \u2014 which was founded by Mr Murdoch \u2014 at about \u00a318.5bn. Comcast made a competing offer earlier this at \u00a312.50 a share, which valued Sky at about \u00a322bn. Mr Hancock is expected to clear both bids \u2014 possibly with some conditions attached \u2014 setting the scene for a bidding war for Sky. Separately, Fox and Comcast are embroiled in another takeover tussle: Walt Disney is attempting to buy Fox\u2019s entertainment assets \u2014 including its 39 per cent stake in Sky \u2014 in a deal worth $66bn including debt. More here. Breaking away from the RBS share sale, the UK government is about to rule whether either Rupert Murdoch or US conglomerate Comcast - or both - should be allowed to take full control of broadcaster Sky. Culture minister Matt Hancock will make a statement on the situation in parliament shortly. Murdoch\u2019s 21 Century Fox (21CF) currently owns 39% of Sky, and launched a full takeover bid in December 2016. However, the bid has been held up by concerns that it will give Murdoch too much control on the UK media landscape. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority said 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid was not in the public interest due to concerns about media plurality. Fox has since offered some concessions, such as making Sky News a legally separative business. Comcast launched its own bid for Sky in April. It could potentially derail Murdoch\u2019s plan to sell most of 21CF to Disney in a $66bn (\u00a347bn) deal. So Hancock\u2019s decision could be extremely significant for Sky\u2019s future, and the wider media landscape.... If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government\u2019s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a \u00a32bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company\u2019s shares for \u00a32.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank \u2013 bailed out by Labour during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Hammond said: \u201cThis sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: \u201cWhy sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.\u201d Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the 625p-a-share break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. More here: Hammond forced to defend RBS shares sale after \u00a32bn loss to taxpayers Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, reminds us JUST HOW BIG Royal Bank of Scotland had become after years of dealmaking under the leadership of Fred Goodwin. \u2018It\u2019s now clear the losses sustained by the taxpayer on the RBS bailout are going to be substantial, though this really reflects the price paid for financial stability in the depths of the global banking crisis. In essence the RBS bailout cushioned the blow of the financial crisis, and spread the pain across many years, a decision which is now beginning to become more measurable. We will never know what the outcome would have been if RBS had been allowed to fail, though it\u2019s important to recognise the scale of RBS at the time. The bank may have its roots in the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, but it became one of the world\u2019s biggest banks, with a \u00a32.4 trillion balance sheet at the height of its power. To put that number in context, it\u2019s bigger than the annual output of the whole UK economy and compares with the $639 balance sheet of Lehman\u2019s Brothers just before it filed for bankruptcy. It\u2019s just possible therefore that the collapse of RBS could have taken all the other dominos with it. Clearly the losses that are now being sustained on the government shareholding are deeply unwelcome, but the alternative to a bailout might have been far worse.\u2019 My colleague Richard Partington has been crunching the numbers... The Unite union have blasted the government over today\u2019s share sale. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, says Philip Hammond and colleagues should use their power as majority shareholders to improve the bank, not sell out at a loss: \u201cThe government is attempting to wash its hands with Royal Bank of Scotland at the expense of the taxpayer. This bargain basement sale of over seven per cent of the bank\u2019s shares is a betrayal of public finances and represents a total loss of over \u00a33 billion for taxpayers since the original bail-out in 2008. Staff are clear that the government should be focusing its attentions on keeping RBS bank branches open and improving the corporate governance of this institution. \u201cThe catalogue of failures across the bank ranging from thousands of staff cuts, closing hundreds of bank branches and also the sale of financial products which resulted in the $4.9 billion US fine demonstrates the systematic failures by the management to effectively run this organisation. Staff across the business are continuing to pay for the mistakes at the top whilst the government merely looks the other way.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, argues that the government is selling up at precisely the wrong moment: He\u2019s referring to the $4.9bn (\u00a33.6bn) penalty which the US Department of Justice hit RBS with last month, for misselling toxic securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. That fine was smaller than expected, so one of the biggest clouds over RBS has finally lifted. That should give the bank\u2019s shares a lift in the coming months. Then again.... there\u2019s still the risk that the UK economy falls into recession, especially if Brexit turns out badly. Jane Sydenham, Investment Director at City firm Rathbones, argues that Philip Hammond is wise to sell some shares while he can: With the economy in relatively good shape and interest rates likely to rise in the not-too-distant future, it\u2019s a good time for the government to start selling the RBS stock. Although the sale of stocks is still loss-making for the tax payer, it\u2019s important that the government gets as much back as possible while they can, instead of waiting too long and potentially seeing the economy move into trouble again. With this risk in mind, there is no point waiting even if it does mean accepting a loss. I\u2019ve just realised that the true break-even price of the RBS bailout is even higher than I thought. The 625p break-even point was set by the National Audit Office last summer, when it assessed the government\u2019s first sale of RBS shares in 2015. It is based on the cost of the government borrowing \u00a345bn to fund the RBS bailout (the NAO estimated that UK bonds were being sold at 3.7% per year at the time.) So, that figure includes the financial cost of the rescue. But, it doesn\u2019t cover the additional cost of repaying the debt since 2015. As this NAO chart shows, the true cost of the bailout keeps rising the longer the taxpayer holds onto its shares. So the break-even price could already be closer to \u00a37.... In City jargon, the government sold part of its stake in RBS through an \u201caccelerated bookbuilding process to institutional investors\u201d In practice, that means 925m shares were sold to banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other organisations who manage our money. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan all acted as \u2018bookrunners\u2019 for the placing, which means they persuaded the institutional investors to take part (readers can speculate why it takes THREE investment banks to handle this sort of thing.....). Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that the buyers will probably make a profit (once RBS\u2019s shares rise above 271p). Some critics say the government is wasting a great opportunity by simply selling their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Labour MP Gareth Thomas argues that the Treasury could turn the bank into a building society with a remit to help the UK economy: Positive Money, a group which campaigns for a fairer banking system, argues that RBS should be broken up. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, says today\u2019s share selloff is a \u2018colossal wasted opportunity\u2019. As well as losing the taxpayer billions of pounds, the government is also losing the ability to reshape Britain\u2019s banking system. \u201cInstead of selling off its majority stake, the government should use its position to break up RBS into smaller, regional banks, with alternative business models that emphasise lending to SMEs and productive industry. \u201cSuch innovation is needed to direct lending to the real economy, which has been been starved of investment in recent years.\u201d Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, recommends that RBS investors hold onto their shares. Spooner argues that the bank\u2019s financial performance is improving, so it should resume paying dividends to investors soon. Spooner says: \u201cInstitutional shareholders paid more or less the market price [in today\u2019s sale] so they must have some confidence in the banks longer-term recovery. As well as this, the bank could be a step nearer to paying a dividend. \u201cThe negative is that the government still have a large holding of 62.4% which is set to overhang the market for some time; the government cannot sell any more for 90 days. \u201cWhile shares are up slightly from a year ago off the back of improved performance and improved confidence leading to a change in our recommendation from a \u2018sell\u2019 to a \u2018hold\u2019, shares in early trading this morning have fallen by 3.4%. We maintain our \u2018hold\u2019 recommendation due to the increased likelihood of a dividend payment and the CEO\u2019s restructuring plans.\u201d Nearly 10 year ago, there were suspicions that taxpayers would never recover the tens of billions of pounds that were injected into Britain\u2019s banks as the world\u2019s financial system was shaking at its foundations. The Labour government announced the bailout of RBS, Lloyds and HBOS on 13 October 2008 - one of many dramatic days during the crisis. Prime minister Gordon Brown declared that taking stakes in the banks would create a \u2018rock of stability\u2019 to help Britain through the unfolding crisis. But George Osborne, then the shadow chancellor, warned that the financial consequences would be severe, telling parliament: But, of course, the scale of what the taxpayer is on the hook for is only just starting to dawn on the British people: this is the biggest bail out in the world so far, paid for by the biggest increase in debt by any peacetime Government and funded by the \u00a311,000 of extra borrowing that will now be heaped on every family in the country. Chancellor Alastair Darling insisted that the government would sell its shares \u2018in due course\u2019: In relation to ordinary shares, we will get a dividend when dividends are payable, and when we sell our shares the money will come back to the taxpayer. There was no suggestion then that Britain would still be a majority shareholder in RBS a decade later.... Prem Sikka, Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the University of Essex, argues that today\u2019s sale is a mistake: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, fears the UK government will suffer further losses on its RBS shareholding: Even with carefully timed sales the government may not be able to regain the full sum it put into keeping the bank afloat. RBS is currently working through a turnaround plan designed to build it back up to its pre-financial crisis strength. Reuters\u2019 columnist Jamie McGeever agrees: Economist Shaun Richards pins the blame on the former Labour chancellor, Alastair Darling for bailing out RBS in 2008: The BBC\u2019s Joe Lynam flags up that RBS\u2019s shares have fallen this morning, as the government\u2019s stake hits the market. Newsflash: The British economy is showing signs of having come through the worst of its recent slowdown triggered by bad weather, as the dominant services sector grew more quickly than expected. The reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 53.0 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. The pound has jumped by half a percent against the US dollar to $1.337, on expectations that the Bank of England might raise interest rates in August. But growth at eurozone companies has slowed to its lowest rate in one-and-a-half years, Markit reports. More on this later.... Unless Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s share price rallies in the next few years, Britain\u2019s taxpayers are going to suffer a massive loss on the 2008 bailout. The government still owns around 7.5 billion RBS shares. If they were all sold at today\u2019s price of 271p, it would create an additional loss of \u00a317bn compared to the 502p purchase price. If you include today\u2019s sale, and the one in 2015, and the total loss would be around \u00a320bn. But using the NAO\u2019s break-even price of 625p, the loss on our remaining RBS shares would actually be \u00a326.5bn. That\u2019s on top of the \u00a33bn loss crystallised today, and the \u00a31.9bn loss on the 2015 share sale - taking the potential loss over \u00a330bn. These are immense sums of money -- not far short of England\u2019s entire schools budget of \u00a339bn. But we need to consider the counter-factual -- what would have happened if the government had allowed RBS to fail in 2008? Alastair Darling, the then-chancellor, later revealed that RBS was about to run out of money unless he stepped in, thanks to its disastrous takeover of Dutch rival ABN Amro, and huge losses thanks to the US subprime crisis. Darling and Brown\u2019s \u00a345bn bailout may have helped avoid a major economic disaster, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: If the rest of the government stake is sold at a similar price then the total loss comes to something in the region of \u00a321bn, a sizeable loss indeed from the original \u00a345bn, but nonetheless probably needs to be measured against what the economic cost might have been if the bank had been allowed to fail. Ultimately taxpayers and politicians of whatever persuasion need to ask themselves if a \u00a32-3bn loss on this particular stake is a price worth paying for a smaller safer bank, as well as banking system, with the upside that the billions of pound it unlocks can be better used for things like the NHS, and other public services. \u2022 This block was amended on 6 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to England\u2019s school budget as that for the UK. Gordon Brown\u2019s government invested \u00a345bn into Royal Bank of Scotland to maintain financial stability following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, not in search of a quick profit. But there\u2019s no argument that RBS has proved a disappointing investment. The bank\u2019s shares haven\u2019t traded above the 502p (the taxpayers\u2019 purchase price) since 2010. And they\u2019ve never hit the NAO\u2019s 625p break-even price since the bailout was finalised at the end of 2008. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each (creating a loss of \u00a31.9bn according to the National Audit Office). The NAO also concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money - and indeed, it looks like a steal compared to today\u2019s share price..... Philip Hammond is \u201cmoving to cash in his chips\u201d by selling some Royal Bank of Scotland shares before the Brexit negotiations reach their climax, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson also points out that RBS looks to be in \u2018decent shape\u2019, compared to a few years ago. Crucially, it has also settled its long-running legal problems in America (over misconduct in the run-up to the financial crisis. He explains: RBS has come a long way in recent years. From racking up c\u00a350bn in losses in ten years due in large part to mega restructuring charges and impairment charges, the bank has turned a corner. As noted a month ago, the settling of the DoJ case was key, removing the last big overhang and paving the way for the government to sell off its stock and for dividends to return. Attributable profits in the last quarter tripled to \u00a3792m, versus \u00a3259m in the same period in 2017, whilst the pre-tax operating profit was up 70% at \u00a31.2bn. The government\u2019s critics will look at these figures, and conclude that we\u2019re selling up at the wrong time. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 3.3% in early trading to 271p -- matching the price which the government sold its shares this morning. The UK government is defending its decision to sell part of its RBS stake for around half the price they paid for it. Treasury Economic Secretary John Glen says it is \u2018unrealistic\u2019 to think that Britain should hold onto all its RBS shares until taxpayers can recoup their full investment in the bank. Glen told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that: I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price, obviously, that is what everyone would like to do, but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions. Glen argues that RBS is in a \u201cmuch healthier position\u201d than a decade ago, and that this is the right time to recover some money for taxpayers. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, is pleased that his largest shareholder has cut its stake: McEwan says: \u201cI am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to re-start the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focussed on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Nearly 10 years after the worst financial crisis in decades, Britain has managed to reduce its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland - but at a hefty loss. The UK government has sold 925 million RBS shares this morning, at 271p each. This lowers the taxpayers\u2019 stake in the bank from 70.1% to 62.4%, raising \u00a32.5bn for the public coffers. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has hailed the move, saying: This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt - this is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future. However, the move also crystallises a hefty loss for taxpayers. Gordon Brown\u2019s government bought its majority stake in RBS for around 502p in autumn 2008, to protect the bank from collapsing (and possibly taking the UK economy with it). So, Hammond\u2019s sale price of 271p means the UK has lost just over \u00a32bn on these shares. And the damage is arguably even worse. Last year, the National Audit Office estimated that the break-even price for an RBS share sale was 625p -- once you factor in the financing costs of acquiring the shares. By the NAO\u2019s logic, that means a loss of nearly \u00a33.3bn today! Opposition MPs are lining up to criticise today\u2019s share sale. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThere is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking reaction to the sale this morning.... Also coming up today: Data firm Markit is releasing its regular healthcheck on the world\u2019s services companies across the globe. Economists predict that the UK services PMI will come in at 53.4, slightly higher than April\u2019s 53.2, indicating growth accelerated a little. We also get the latest UK car registration figures - analysts predict a small rise, for the second month running.

The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it\u2019s got little European presence. </p> <p> A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth \u00a312.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. </p> <p> Then it\u2019s up to Comcast and we\u2019ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky\u2019s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. </p> <p> A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don\u2019t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it\u2019s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b16a0e0e4b069235b5d1f7f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-05T14:44:32.875Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The culture secretary\u2019s decision to allow the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content.</p> <p>It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid.

Amid growing Westminster speculation that an NHS announcement would be made within the next month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the size of the health service meant that any meaningful increase in funding would create problems for Philip Hammond. The chancellor, who has been having discussions with the health secretary Jeremy Hunt about how to fund an increase in NHS spending, is committed to balancing the government\u2019s books by the middle of the next decade. The IFS said that plan already involved \u00a35bn of inflation-adjusted cuts to day-to-day spending together with the continuation of reductions in working age social security benefits. But May has been under pressure to respond to public concerns about the NHS and told MPs in March she wanted a long-term plan for health spending to be announced before next year\u2019s full Treasury spending review. \u201cUltimately, it is for the government to take decisions about spending priorities, and I would suggest that we cannot afford to wait until next Easter. I think in this, the 70th anniversary year of the NHS\u2019s foundation, we need an answer on this,\u201d May said. Increasing NHS spending by 4% \u2013 the annual average real-terms rise between its creation in 1948 and 2010 \u2013 would increase government spending by \u00a321bn.

Either public services will face more years of substantial cuts, or taxes will rise, or social security benefits will be cut further, or yet another set of fiscal rules will, in effect, be abandoned.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If you are looking to have more women on boards, the key issue is whether you are looking for women whose backgrounds replicate those of the men (FTSE firms\u2019 excuses for lack of women in boardrooms \u2018pitiful and patronising\u2019, 31 May). You won\u2019t find many: there are far fewer women in the c-suite and even fewer chief executives of major companies. The true value of bringing more women into the boardroom is to achieve greater diversity, so look to senior women in public services and the many walks of civil society. But first make sure your boardroom is an inclusive place; no woman wants to sit on a board if she is not going to be listened to. There is plenty of evidence that women are interrupted in meetings or, worse, have their contributions attributed to a man. To achieve gender equality in the workplace, from entry level all the way through to the board room, men and women need to work together. At Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, our collaborating with men research found that women feel that it is workplace culture issues that hold them back in their careers \u2013 but the barrier to change is that men are often unaware of these issues. Through working with a number of major companies across the UK, we have shown that making men more aware of the problems that women experience is essential for inspiring change. Barbara Stocking President, Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge \u2022 Many years ago, I was an NHS regional PR and marketing manager. Despite a number of men applying for the post, I got it because I had better qualifications and experience.

You won\u2019t find many: there are far fewer women in the c-suite and even fewer chief executives of major companies. The true value of bringing more women into the boardroom is to achieve greater diversity, so look to senior women in public services and the many walks of civil society. But first make sure your boardroom is an inclusive place; no woman wants to sit on a board if she is not going to be listened to. There is plenty of evidence that women are interrupted in meetings or, worse, have their contributions attributed to a man.</p> <p>To achieve gender equality in the workplace, from entry level all the way through to the board room, men and women need to work together. At Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, our collaborating with men research found that women feel that it is workplace culture issues that hold them back in their careers \u2013 but the barrier to change is that men are often unaware of these issues.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Qatar Airways, who sits on the board of Heathrow, has inflamed a row over sexism in the industry by saying only a man could do his challenging job. Akbar Al Baker made the comments moments after becoming chair of the aviation industry body\u2019s board of governors for a one-year term, Bloomberg News reported. At a press conference in Sydney, where the International Air Transport Association (Iata) held its annual meeting, he was asked what could be done to tackle the lack of women in Middle East aviation. Al Baker replied this was not the case at Qatar Airways, before adding: \u201cOf course, it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201d His comments met with loud groans of disapproval from many journalists in the room. The airline later issued a formal statement from Al Baker, who has run Qatar Airways since 1997. \u201cWhile I am known in the media for some lightheartedness at press conferences, it is crucial that I emphasise the facts as I did today and the importance of women representatives in the airline industry. \u201cQatar Airways firmly believes in gender equality in the workplace and our airline has been a pioneer in our region in this regard, as the first airline to employ female pilots, as one of the first to train and employ female engineers, and with females represented through to senior vice president positions within the airline. With a female work force of more than 33%, as I mentioned today, it would be my pleasure if I could help develop a female candidate to be the next CEO of Qatar Airways.\u201d The Gulf carrier has a close business partnership with British Airways, and is also the largest single shareholder in BA\u2019s parent company, IAG. It has long had an abysmal reputation for its treatment of its predominantly female cabin crew, at one time firing them for being pregnant. The airline is believed to have eased some restrictions on the movement of its crew during non-working hours, which have included curfews, living in monitored accommodation and contractual bans on marriage without express company permission. Alexandre de Juniac, the director general of Iata, admitted that only two women sat on its 31-member board of governors: Christine Ourmi\u00e8res, the CEO of UK regional carrier FlyBe and Maria Jose Hidalgo Gutierrez, the CEO of Spanish airline Air Europa. He said this reflected an industry in which only 3% of chief executives were women. \u201cWe don\u2019t underestimate the scope of work needed to address the gender challenge\u2014 covering process, policy and mindset,\u201d he said. \u201cA combination of individual action by airlines and collective action as industry will move us in the right direction.\u201d Al Baker\u2019s elevation to the Iata chair comes seven years after he launched a ferocious attack on the organisation\u2019s leadership at the annual meeting, and four years after he hosted a sumptuous AGM in Qatar, surprising airline executives with a guest appearance by Kylie Minogue after the evening meal. Some rivals have taken action to promote more women to senior positions. Two-fifths of Qantas Airways\u2019 senior management is female, including the heads of the international and frequent-flier loyalty businesses, according to the airline\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce. Joyce said: \u201cIt\u2019s the right business thing to do and it\u2019s the right moral thing to do.\u201d SkyTeam appointed the Delta executive Kristin Colvile as the chief executive of the airline alliance this week. Heathrow moved swiftly to distance itself from its board member\u2019s comments. The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: \u201cDiversity and inclusion are part of our core values and I have no doubt that a woman could carry out my role. The comments made today are not shared by myself, or Heathrow airport.\u201d",

Kudlow\u2019s comments come as tensions between the US and its two largest trading partners are escalating. On Tuesday Mexico announced it was imposing tariffs on a raft of US goods including including pork, cheese, apples, potatoes, Tennessee or bourbon whiskey and cranberries. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who will host what looks set to be a heated summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations this week, called the tariffs an affront to the longstanding security partnership between Canada and the United States, and announced retaliatory steps. On Friday, Trump said he might prefer to end Nafta in favor of separate bilateral agreements with the two US neighbors. Kudlow said Trump was moving toward that scenario. \u201cHe prefers bilateral negotiations and he\u2019s looking at two much different countries,\u201d he said. \u201cCanada\u2019s a different country than Mexico. They have different problems. \u201cHe believes that bilaterals have always been better. He hates these multilaterals \u2026 he hates large treaties.\u201d Such a move toward separate talks would come at a tense time in US trade relations with the two countries. The Trump administration said on Thursday it was moving ahead with tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, ending a two-month exemption and setting the stage for a possible trade war. In a television appearance on Sunday, Kudlow called the trade frictions with Canada a \u201cfamily quarrel\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The British economy is showing signs of having come through the worst of its recent slowdown triggered by bad weather, after the dominant services sector expanded more quickly than expected. Despite the better news from the latest business survey by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), the key barometer for the largest sector in the economy revealed mounting fears over Brexit. The latest snapshot from the Markit/Cips UK Services PMI showed activity in the sector, which includes banks, restaurants and hotels, recovered to a three-month high in May. However, firms responding to the survey said business volumes had continued to rise at a relatively subdued rate, citing Brexit as a key reason for the slow growth. The Cips group director, Duncan Brock, said: \u201cIt felt as though the sector was losing its lifeblood this month as Brexit worries continued to claw away at confidence.\u201d The reading on the PMI, where anything above 50 indicates expansion, rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 a month earlier, beating economists\u2019 expectations for a modest rise to 53. Showing greater strength for the economy than previously feared, the increase will put pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates, potentially from as early as August. The pound reflected that optimism, rising two-thirds of a cent to $1.3275. Threadneedle Street delayed an increase for borrowing costs last month after the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d blew the economy off course, preferring to wait and see if businesses and consumers would get back to spending and selling goods as usual. Service providers in the latest PMI survey cited a catch-up from the snow-related disruption of the first three months of the year, alongside sustained growth of incoming new work. However, the latest increase in overall new work was still one of the weakest seen since the summer of 2016, straight after the EU referendum. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cWith the forward-looking indicators suggesting that the economy could relapse, a rate rise is by no means assured.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK government has cleared the way for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy Sky on the condition it sells Sky News to another organisation. It also approved a rival bid for the British broadcaster from US media giant Comcast, setting up a multibillion-pound bidding war. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at \u00a318.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at \u00a322bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He also indicated he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer, who will guarantee its independence and fund it for 10 years, in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul\u2019s family over the UK news business. Disney has already offered to buy Sky News in order to clear competition concerns as part of its broader bid for many of Murdoch\u2019s media assets. Hancock suggested this offer is likely to meet his standards and would allow Murdoch\u2019s bid to be approved later this month, meaning a bidding war for Sky is \u201con the horizon\u201d. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox said Hancock\u2019s statement meant it was \u201cconfident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction\u201d. The deal has left Sky News employees nervous about their futures but in an email to staff channel boss John Ryley noted that both bids contained \u201ccommitments to guarantee the funding and editorial independence of Sky News\u201d. \u201cI will update as and when there are further developments but in the meantime, all we can do is to continue the great job we\u2019ve been doing and concentrate on what we do best which is making the best news content for mobile, television and radio,\u201d he said. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, said Sky News has \u201calways been a beacon for independent and rigorous journalism\u201d and said his priority is \u201censuring Sky News thrives going forward\u201d. He warned that if Sky News is sold to Disney \u2013 and Disney\u2019s bid for overall control of Fox is unsuccessful \u2013 it would leave the 24-hour news channel \u201cisolated from Sky and owned by a foreign company with few news interests in the UK\u201d. The takeover bids are part of a complex web of global media deals, with giant companies competing to buy smaller businesses in the hope of securing their long-term future in the face of challenges from streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix. The Competition and Markets Authority provisionally blocked Fox\u2019s takeover bid in January due to fears it would raise competition concerns and was therefore not in the public interest. Fox has since been attempting to address the concerns by tabling a series of remedies. Murdoch\u2019s last attempt to take full control of Sky was abandoned in 2011, amid the phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World newspaper. Even if Murdoch\u2019s takeover is successful this time around it is unlikely the 87-year-old will retain control of Sky in the long term, as he is looking to sell most of his broadcast and film assets. Disney has already tabled a \u00a339bn offer to buy assets including Fox\u2019s TV production unit, the 20th Century Fox film studio, and its stake in Sky. To raise the odds further, Comcast recently announced it is planning to outbid Disney for the same Fox assets, as part of its battle with Disney to control the future of the media industry. Under both deals Murdoch would be left owning a much smaller Fox business which would control a TV network and news channels including the rightwing Fox News, in addition to Dow Jones which runs the Wall Street Journal and publisher HarperCollins. In the UK he would be left with his News UK business, which owns the Sun and the Times newspapers.",

    "webTitle": "Hammond defends RBS shares sale after \u00a32bn loss to taxpayers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government\u2019s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a \u00a32.1bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company\u2019s shares for \u00a32.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank \u2013 bailed out by a Labour government during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Shares in RBS closed down 5.3% at 266p on Tuesday. Hammond said: \u201cThis sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.\u201d Ministers believe there is no realistic prospect of the share price of RBS \u2013 much-reduced in size since the bailout \u2013 reaching 502p any time soon and that the cash raised from reducing its stake from just over 70% to 62.4% could be more usefully spent elsewhere. The government is planning to announce extra cash for the NHS ahead of the 70th anniversary of its creation next month and Hammond was under pressure to raise funds. The settling of a case brought against RBS by the US Department of Justice over the mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities removed the last big barrier to the sale \u2013 scheduled to be the first of a series expected to raise \u00a33bn a year for the exchequer over the next five years. Labour\u2019s shadow city minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: \u201cWhy did the Treasury sell RBS shares when the bank\u2019s fundamentals are finally improving after the US fine settlement? Taxpayers, as major shareholders, deserve to know.\u201d Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: \u201cWhy sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.\u201d Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. That was estimated to be 625p a share when George Osborne sold the first tranche of shares in RBS in 2015 but has now risen to 700p a share. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each at a loss of \u00a31.9bn according to the NAO, which concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said: \u201cI am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to restart the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focused on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.\u201d John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price \u2013 obviously, that is what everyone would like to do \u2013 but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sales of plug-in hybrid cars soared by nearly three-quarters year on year in May, dramatically outstripping the 3.4% overall growth in new car registrations. Nearly 4,000 plug-in hybrids, which typically run for about 30 miles on a battery before a combustion engine kicks in, were bought last month, up from 2,301 in May 2017. Registrations of purely battery-powered cars, such as the Nissan Leaf, were up by nearly a fifth, to 1,099. The numbers are still a small fraction of the total 192,649 cars bought in the month but all electrified vehicles combined, including hybrids such as the Toyota Prius, took a record market share of 5.8%. However, drivers\u2019 appetite for diesel cars continues to wane in the face of environmental and tax concerns, despite the industry maintaining on Tuesday that for many drivers they are the \u201cright choice economically and environmentally\u201d. Diesel registrations plunged by nearly a quarter, to 62,260. The market share of diesels this year so far stands at 32.8%, compared with 44.1% in 2017. Total new car sales growth was modest, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The trade body notedthere had been an 8.5% decline in the previous May as sales were hit by vehicle excise duty changes and uncertainty ahead of the general election. So far this year, total sales are down by 6.8%. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cMay\u2019s growth, albeit on the back of large declines last year, is encouraging and suggests the market is now starting to return to a more natural running rate.\u201d The trade body for car dealers said the continued performance of electrified vehicles presented \u201can opportunity for franchised dealers to be leaders in this growing segment of the market\u201d. James Fairclough, CEO at AA Cars, said: \u201cThe popularity of hybrids and plug-ins continues to grow at the expense of diesel cars, on the back of ongoing policy changes and the related negative press around the impact of diesel cars on the environment.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2018. An earlier version said that hybrid plug ins run for about 50 miles on a battery before a combustion engine kicks in. That figure is more like 30 miles.",

      "bodyText": "The GMB union makes a fair point about pay at the top of the privately owned English water industry. When a few individuals can collect almost \u00a32.5m a year for running local monopolies, remuneration committees have spent too much time looking at consultants\u2019 spreadsheets and too little employing common sense. Yes, these businesses are large, important and must spend serious sums on new infrastructure every year. Yet a regional water company is also running a public service in which the price of the product is set by the regulator and customers cannot choose a different supplier. Those factors call for restraint, or at least a more direct tie between incentive pay and the level of service that is provided. Even the environment secretary, Michael Gove, made a similar point in an exchange of letters with Jonson Cox, the chairman of regulator Ofwat, earlier this year. We await the companies\u2019 response in their business plans for next year but don\u2019t hold your breath if you\u2019re expecting radical reform. To pick on Liv Garfield, chief executive of Severn Trent, only about a third of her annual bonus last year of \u00a3616,000 related directly to customers\u2019 experience. Some of the profit-related measures involved hitting targets where benefits are shared with customers, it could be argued, but her LTIP plan, which paid her \u00a3975,000 last year, looks as purely financial as any other FTSE 100 company\u2019s. As the nationalisation debate heats up, pay has become a blind spot for water companies. The likes of Thames, Yorkshire and Anglian are dismantling their Cayman Islands subsidiaries to try to defuse the charge of financial engineering. Some of the worst offenders are also reducing their debt levels, partly under pressure from Ofwat and partly because they recognise the mood has turned against extreme financial leverage. But boardroom rewards, unless the companies are about to surprise us, remain stuck at levels that are a gift to the nationalisation lobby. Shareholders and owners, unless they wish to continue to present Labour\u2019s front-bench with an open goal, ought to wake up. As it is, Labour\u2019s nationalisation plan is gloriously vague since the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, hasn\u2019t yet explained which model of public ownership he prefers (there are many to choose from) or how he would tackle investors\u2019 (including pension funds\u2019 and employees\u2019) legal claims for compensation if he attempts nationalisation at less than market value. Nor is it possible to tell if Labour\u2019s boast that bills would fall after nationalisation by \u00a3100 per household is just achieved by shoving the difference into general taxation. The GMB, note, also ignored such detailed questions as it launched its campaign for public ownership of the English water industry. It is simpler, from where it stands, to point to excesses in the boardroom, on which (almost) everyone can agree. The water companies, if they want to prepare properly for a nationalisation debate that is not going away, need to shape up on pay and stop offering such a soft target. Why couldn\u2019t the Treasury wait a while for RBS sale? Here we go, then, the big sale of Royal Bank of Scotland has begun, or rather re-started, since a small slice went in 2015. Some 925m shares, of 7.7% of the total, will be sold overnight and the state\u2019s stake will be cut to 62.4%. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has got one thing right: he has ignored any thought of mounting a flashy sale of shares to retail investors complete with loyalty bonuses. His predecessor, George Osborne, was tempted by that idea when he was disposing of shares in Lloyds Banking Group, but eventually thought better of it. Quite right too: the Treasury\u2019s sole job is to get the best possible price for the public purse, which inevitably means selling to City institutions in a competitive market process. The Treasury\u2019s timing, though, looks odd. Banks\u2019 share prices across Europe have been upset by the political confusion in Italy. Even RBS\u2019 finance director, Ewen Stevenson, said last week that now is probably not the \u201coptimum\u201d time for the government to start selling stock. Indeed so. RBS was within pennies of 300p a fortnight ago, which would have been a neat hurdle to clear, but closed last night at 280.4p. Perfect timing is impossible, of course, and the break-even price in any case is about 500p. But the Treasury, advised by UK Government Investments, could still have waited a few weeks to see if the Italian influence on the bank stocks fades fully. The government wants to get on with the job \u2013 but, really, where was the harm in waiting a fortnight?",

Lisa Osofsky, who has dual US and British nationality, has prosecuted more than 100 cases for the US government during a 30-year career. Osofsky will take up the SFO role in September. She has been working in the private sector for more than a decade, with spells at the business intelligence group Control Risks, the investment bank Goldman Sachs and most recently the financial crime consultancy Exiger. Osofsky worked on the monitoring of HSBC, after the bank signed a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice and was forced to pay a record $1.9bn (\u00a31.2bn) to settle allegations it allowed terrorists to move money around the financial system. She is said by a colleague to be \u201cclassic silk glove, iron fist\u201d and an expert on cases of money laundering. News of the appointment, which was widely expected, comes after the SFO said last month that its funding would rise by around 50% this year, helping it to take on bigger cases. However, questions over its future have lingered and Osofsky\u2019s appointment drew a guarded welcome from white-collar crime lawyers, some of whom had interpreted previous comments as an endorsement of Theresa May\u2019s plan to roll the SFO into a broader National Crime Agency (NCA). Louise Hodges, the head of criminal litigation at the law firm Kingsley Napley, said: \u201cThis is a novel appointment for the SFO. Lisa Osofsky is not one of the usual establishment faces, so will bring new insight and fresh thinking to the organisation, which has just celebrated its 30 year anniversary. \u201cHer prosecution experience in the US signals someone with a pedigree as a tough prosecutor but also someone from a jurisdiction where dialogue with defence lawyers and deferred prosecution agreements are intrinsic to the system.\u201d Robert Amaee, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, added: \u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that Lisa\u2019s appointment cements the continuing strengthening of the relationship between the SFO and the US white collar law enforcement agencies. We are certain to see more SFO enforcement in coordination and cooperation with its US counterparts. \u201cShe\u2019s also recently put to rest speculation that she intends to oversee the merger of the SFO into the NCA. She\u2019s been unambiguous in her support of an SFO, independent from but closely coordinated with the NCA \u2013 that could herald quite a powerful combination of intelligence and expertise.\u201d The SFO\u2019s last previous permanent director, David Green, ended a six-year stint in April, when the agency\u2019s chief operating officer, Mark Thompson, became interim director until a new director started.",

      "bodyText": "Retailers had one of their best months in recent years in May as warm weather and the royal wedding tempted consumers back into the shops. In the latest sign that growth has picked up after a grim first three months of 2018, the health check of high street spending from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG reported total sales up by 4.1%. A separate report from Barclaycard found that consumer spending grew by just over 5% in May, its fastest in more than a year. However, amid evidence that the construction sector is being hit by the spate of high street store closures, the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, warned that the outlook for retailers remained tough. Almost 6,000 shops closed in 2017 \u2013 the highest since the economy was emerging from the deep recession caused by the financial crisis of 2008-09 \u2013 and well-known brands including Marks &amp; Spencer, Mothercare and House of Fraser are planning further closures this year. \u201cRetail sales in May saw their highest growth since January 2014 as better weather and the bank holiday effect led shoppers to buy from garden furniture and summer fashion ranges; recovering some of the ground lost in April,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cFood sales also stood out, with the best single month\u2019s performance since July 2013.\u201d Over the latest three months \u2013 a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 sales growth weakened by 1.2%. Spending earlier in the year was affected by the squeeze on consumer spending and the unexpectedly severe weather caused by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d. Dickinson said: \u201cDespite this more positive set of sales results, the retail environment remains extremely challenging, with trend growth still very low by historical standards.\u201d Paul Martin, KPMG\u2019s UK head of retail, said: \u201cTwo bank holiday weekends, a royal wedding and of course sunnier spells will have been the main drivers behind the apparent rebound, with both online and high street sales thankfully up overall.\u201d While the construction industry continued to stage a modest recovery in May after bad weather earlier in 2018, reduced demand from struggling retailers was one reason cited in the latest IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers survey for the fourth decline in new orders in five months. The reading on the IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers\u2019 index remained steady at 52.5 points in May, against economists\u2019 forecasts for a slight decline in activity from the previous month. Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, cautioned that a renewed drop in new work \u201chinted that the recovery could prove short-lived\u201d. Barclaycard said the good weather in May had encouraged consumers to buy in-store rather than online. Non-essential expenditure was up by 4.6%, its highest level of growth in more than a year, with garden centres, clothes shops and pubs all doing well. Spending on experiences such as music festivals and sporting events would remain strong over the coming months, the company said.",

      "bodyText": "A pioneering project in north-west England will turn air into liquid for energy storage to help electricity grids cope with a growing amount of wind and solar power. The world\u2019s first full-scale \u201cliquid air\u201d plant is based on a technology that advocates say is cheaper and able to provide power for longer periods than lithium-ion batteries. The demonstration scheme next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, uses excess or off-peak electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it to a liquid state to be stored inside large metal tanks. Pumping and heating is used later to turn it back to a gas, which is released to turn a turbine, generating electricity at times of need \u2013 but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. While relatively small at 5 megawatts (MW) compared to 50MW lithium-ion battery facilities being built by firms such as EDF Energy, Highview Power said the technology could be scaled up to hundreds of megawatts. Gareth Brett, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the technology could timeshift energy across the day, with the firm buying electricity when cheap and releasing it when prices are higher. \u201cIf you only want to store energy for an hour, lithium-ion is fine but the reality is what people are looking to do is store excess renewable power and release it at peak times, which is usually four hours or more,\u201d he said. Brett admitted the liquid air process is less efficient than storing electricity in batteries but pointed out that the storage does not degrade over time, as lithium-ion cells do. Highview Power is already exploring sites for a much larger, 50MW storage facility and pitches the fact it can be located anywhere as one of its selling points. The firm has opened a US office and is also eyeing export opportunities in mainland Europe and Australia. The 690-square metre Bury facility officially opens on Tuesday, funded with \u00a38m of government money. However, Brett said the technology was ready for commercialisation and could succeed with subsidy, and the firm has raised \u00a325m of private investment for more projects. Large-scale energy storage is seen as increasingly vital to help the National Grid and local energy networks cope with the fast-growing levels of renewables, whose output varies depending on the amount of wind and sunshine.",
