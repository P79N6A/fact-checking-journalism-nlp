      "bodyText": "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) should be stripped of its powers to fine and ban individuals for wrongdoing, according to a report by MPs that calls on new chancellor Philip Hammond to commission an independent review into whether an alternative investigatory body should be set up. The Treasury select committee said a new enforcement function should be set up outside the FCA and the Bank of England. Such a move would address the issues raised by the report into the collapse of HBOS, which was published in November 2015. That report laid the blame for HBOS\u2019s collapse on its former bosses but also questioned why only one former executive faced sanctions. The select committee\u2019s report said: \u201cThe current system, whereby the same organisation both supervises, applies and prosecutes the law is outdated and can be construed as unfair. By moving enforcement away from supervision, it can focus independently on undertaking its key functions: interrogating evidence and assessing whether a regulatory breach has been committed\u201d. In calling for a separate enforcement body to be set up, the Treasury select committee is repeating a suggestion in 2013 by the parliamentary commission on banking standards that was rejected by the then chancellor, George Osborne. Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, said: \u201cA separate body would bolster the perception of the enforcement function\u2019s independence, and provide the regulators with greater clarity over their objectives. The case for separation merits serious re-examination. The Treasury should appoint an independent person to undertake a review\u201d. The regulator at the time of the HBOS collapse was the Financial Services Authority \u2013 now split between the FCA and the Bank under changes brought in by the 2010 coalition government. The Treasury select committee said the ultimate responsibility for the \u201comission and failures\u201d that led to an investigation into one former HBOS executive lay with the then FSA chief executive, Sir Hector Sants. Sants, it had emerged at the time of the November 2015 report, had wanted to pursue enforcement action and had not been told there were grounds to investigate executives other than Peter Cummings. Sants declined to comment. Tyrie said the new regulators were an opportunity to \u201cexhibit greater vigilance and energy if they are to win public confidence, which has on occasion been lacking\u201d. He added that the FCA was still \u201cwork in progress\u201d. The Treasury said it would respond formally at a later date. \u201cThe shortcomings that led to the failure of HBOS in 2008 prove that the government was absolutely right to overhaul our system of financial regulation,\u201d a Treasury spokesperson said. \u201cOur reforms directly address the regulatory failings identified in this report,\u201d the Treasury spokesperson said. The FCA said separating its enforcement division would \u201cpotentially lessen our ability to be an effective regulator and impact our ability to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of the UK financial system\u201d. The Treasury committee said that in the event of another bank failure, the public should not have to wait so long \u2013 seven years \u2013 for a report into what went wrong. It also criticised the accounting body, the Financial Reporting Council, for \u201ca lack of curiosity\u201d in not investigating the auditing of HBOS sooner. The FRC announced an investigation last month.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has instructed lawyers to demand an immediate apology from Frank Field, one of the senior MPs who led an inquiry into the failure of BHS. The billionaire retail tycoon launched a fightback on Monday, hours after he was heavily criticised in a report by two House of Commons committees, one of which is chaired by Field. The report by MPs triggered calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. It found the former owner of the chain had \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both\u201d. All BHS stores will close by the end of August after the department store group went into administration in April leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green had sold BHS for \u00a31 just over a year earlier to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt. After the report was published Field went on to make several even more critical comments on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, without the protection of parliamentary privilege afforded by the report. Field alleged Green was the principal character in the collapse of BHS and \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d, saying he was somebody \u201cwho behaves like Napoleon\u201d, plundered BHS, and must now pay out to fund the pensions hole left behind. Lawyers for Green from City law firm Schillings are challenging the MP\u2019s statements, claiming they are defamatory and false and warning that they must not be repeated. The letter to Field, sent to the Guardian by advisers to Green, reads: \u201cIn that interview you alleged that our client had stolen money, specifically from the BHS and Arcadia pension funds. This statement is highly defamatory and completely false. \u201cOur client has never stolen any money from BHS, Arcadia or the pension funds and you know that. In particular, there is nothing in the recent Report of the Work and Pensions and Business, Innovation and Skills Committees, (the Report) (of which you were one of the Chairs) to support your allegation. \u201cClearly an allegation that our client is a thief is likely to cause him serious harm. Further, in relation to the recent Parliamentary hearings and the Report and allegations made there you were protected by privilege. That does not apply to the interview this morning (or any others you intend to make).\u201d The letter goes on to demand \u201can immediate and fulsome apology in relation to the allegation\u201d and a reply within 24 hours. \u201cThe other remedies to which our client is clearly entitled will very much depend on form and manner of your response and in the meantime, all of our client\u2019s rights are reserved,\u201d it adds. Field himself revealed the existence of the legal letter, telling the BBC that he thought Green\u2019s conduct was \u201cdisplacement therapy\u201d. \u201cInstead of writing a big cheque he is firing off lawyers\u2019 letters. He needs to stop messing around and write a big cheque,\u201d the Labour MP said. A separate statement from Green on the contents of the work and pensions committee report says it is the \u201cpredetermined and inaccurate output of a biased and unfair process\u201d. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, clearly Retail Acquisitions and Mr Chappell were a very bad choice as purchaser on many fronts and I feel badly let down,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, one cannot turn the clock back. The disposal of BHS was made 100% in good faith and I still believe that we provided Retail Acquisitions and Mr Chappell with the appropriate finance ... I am trying to find a solution for the BHS pension and am continuing to work with the regulator to achieve an outcome ... I do not believe that this story is being in any way fairly portrayed.\u201d It also emerged on Monday that Green is threatening legal action against Chappell and the other members of his consortium, Retail Acquisitions. Green alleges that Retail Acquisitions misused BHS funds and that Chappell falsely represented his business credentials. The legal letter, sent by Green\u2019s solicitors at Linklaters, warns Chappell and his associates that they could be sued. Green declined to comment, while Chappell did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Philip Green has instructed lawyers to demand an immediate apology from Frank Field, one of the senior MPs who led an inquiry into the failure of BHS.<br></p> <p>The billionaire retail tycoon launched a fightback on Monday, hours after he was heavily criticised in a report by two House of Commons committees, one of which is chaired by Field. </p> <p>The report by MPs triggered calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. It found the former owner of the chain had \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both\u201d.</p> <p>All BHS stores will close by the end of August after the department store group went into administration in April leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green had sold BHS for \u00a31 just over a year earlier to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell, a serial bankrupt.</p> <p>After the report was published Field went on to make several even more critical comments on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, without the protection of parliamentary privilege afforded by the report. </p> <p>Field alleged Green was the principal character in the collapse of BHS and \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d, saying he was somebody \u201cwho behaves like Napoleon\u201d, plundered BHS, and must now pay out to fund the pensions hole left behind.</p> <p>Lawyers for Green from City law firm Schillings are challenging the MP\u2019s statements, claiming they are defamatory and false and warning that they must not be repeated. The letter to Field, sent to the Guardian by advisers to Green, reads: \u201cIn that interview you alleged that our client had stolen money, specifically from the BHS and Arcadia pension funds. This statement is highly defamatory and completely false.</p> <p>\u201cOur client has never stolen any money from BHS, Arcadia or the pension funds and you know that. In particular, there is nothing in the recent Report of the Work and Pensions and Business, Innovation and Skills Committees, (the Report) (of which you were one of the Chairs) to support your allegation.</p> <p>\u201cClearly an allegation that our client is a thief is likely to cause him serious harm. Further, in relation to the recent Parliamentary hearings and the Report and allegations made there you were protected by privilege. That does not apply to the interview this morning (or any others you intend to make).\u201d</p> <p>The letter goes on to demand \u201can immediate and fulsome apology in relation to the allegation\u201d and a reply within 24 hours. \u201cThe other remedies to which our client is clearly entitled will very much depend on form and manner of your response and in the meantime, all of our client\u2019s rights are reserved,\u201d it adds.</p> <p>Field himself revealed the existence of the legal letter, telling the BBC that he thought Green\u2019s conduct was \u201cdisplacement therapy\u201d. \u201cInstead of writing a big cheque he is firing off lawyers\u2019 letters. He needs to stop messing around and write a big cheque,\u201d the Labour MP said.</p> <p>A separate statement from Green on the contents of the work and pensions committee report says it is the \u201cpredetermined and inaccurate output of a biased and unfair process\u201d. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, clearly Retail Acquisitions and Mr Chappell were a very bad choice as purchaser on many fronts and I feel badly let down,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, one cannot turn the clock back. The disposal of BHS was made 100% in good faith and I still believe that we provided Retail Acquisitions and Mr Chappell with the appropriate finance ... I am trying to find a solution for the BHS pension and am continuing to work with the regulator to achieve an outcome ... I do not believe that this story is being in any way fairly portrayed.\u201d</p> <p>It also emerged on Monday that Green is threatening legal action against Chappell and the other members of his consortium, Retail Acquisitions.</p> <p>Green alleges that Retail Acquisitions misused BHS funds and that Chappell falsely represented his business credentials. The legal letter, sent by Green\u2019s solicitors at Linklaters, warns Chappell and his associates that they could be sued. Green declined to comment, while Chappell did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><br></p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "A major high street bank has paved the way for the introduction of negative interest rates for the first time in Britain by warning customers it may have to charge them to accept deposits. The warning by NatWest was made in a letter changing the terms and conditions for the bank\u2019s 850,000 business customers, which range from self-employed traders, charities and clubs to big corporations. It could mean that an account holder with \u00a31,000 in a NatWest account could see that shrink to \u00a3999 or less the following year as the bank charges a negative rate of interest. In its letter to customers, NatWest said: \u201cGlobal interest rates remain at very low levels and in some markets are currently negative. Dependent on future market conditions, this could result in us charging interest on credit balances.\u201d The taxpayer-owned bank \u2013 whose parent is Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 said it had no plans to make changes to the terms and conditions of personal account holders to allow it to charge negative rates. Interest rates on government and corporate bonds fell steeply in the political turmoil that followed the Brexit vote. The Bank of England is now under intense pressure to cut its already historically low base rate from 0.5% to kickstart the economy, although a move into negative territory is not likely in the short term. NatWest business customers are asking if negative interest rates are legal. They are asking whether they should take their cash out of the accounts and put it under the mattress to maintain its value. One treasurer of a local community council, who received a letter but asked not to be named, said: \u201cCan they do that, is it legal? The letter goes on to say that they \u2018value our relationship with you\u2019, but I may need to review how much I can afford to have a relationship with them!\u201d Another customer, who holds funds for her grandchildren in a business bank account, said: \u201cWill this spread to all high street banks? I can\u2019t access it myself to put it under the mattress.\u201d Other high street banks contacted by the Guardian said they had no plans, for now, to change contracts to allow them to impose negative rates. The prospect of banks levying a charge on deposits rather than paying interest turns traditional banking upside down. \u201cIt is going to make businesses much less keen to hold significant balances in their accounts,\u201d said mortgage and savings expert Ray Boulger. \u201cIf NatWest start doing this, other banks are likely to follow. Eventually personal customers with large balances could be hit, but the banks may decide that is going too far and take the hit themselves.\u201d Negative interest rates could have widespread undesirable effects across the economy. Not only may customers decide to hoard cash rather than deposit it, banks may take excessive risks in lending in order to obtain returns, while pension companies will struggle to meet their liabilities. So-called \u201cvoodoo banking\u201d is already happening in some countries gripped by deflation. The European Central Bank charges other banks 0.4% to deposit cash, while the Swiss National Bank charges domestic banks up to 0.75%. Last week, ABN Amro, a major Dutch bank, told customers that because of \u201cexceptional market conditions\u201d, it may be necessary to charge negative interest rates at some time in the future. After the Brexit vote, interest rates on government bonds \u2013 otherwise known as the \u201cyield\u201d \u2013 dived to record lows. When rates drop below zero, it effectively means people are paying the government to lend money to them. The Bank of England this month chose to hold base rate at 0.5%, but in the City it is widely anticipated that governor Mark Carney will cut the rate to 0.25% on 4 August, as well as introduce other measures to boost the economy. The prospect of negative interest rates has been mooted by individual policymakers but they are not seen as likely for the UK any time soon. In April, Jan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC), floated the possibility of interest rates being cut below zero, meaning companies would pay to deposit their money with banks. His fellow MPC member, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, also raised the prospect of cutting official borrowing costs to zero or perhaps even lower in a speech last September. But governor Mark Carney has appeared to oppose negative interest rates. Questioned by MPs in April, Carney said: \u201cWe think we could move base rate closer to zero but have not said we have an appetite for negative interest rates.\u201d Millions of customers with savings accounts in Britain are already suffering from historically low returns, with many accounts paying close to zero. The Financial Conduct Authority last week named HSBC, First Direct and the Post Office as having easy access accounts that in some circumstances pay no interest. The introduction of negative interest rates on deposits could spark a legal challenge from customers. Shortly before the credit crunch, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society launched a mortgage deal that tracked the main Bank of England lending rate minus 1.01%. When the Bank cut interest rates to 0.5% in 2009, that suggested borrowers would have to pay -0.51%. Instead, C&amp;G cut the rate to 0.01% \u2013 its computers could not handle mortgages at 0% \u2013 but did not actually go negative. Any challenge to negative interest on deposit accounts may cite the example of C&amp;G. But there will be winners if interest rates move to zero or below. Since the Brexit vote, a number of lenders have cut interest rates on mortgage deals, with the biggest change to five- and 10-year fixed-rate deals, now on offer at little more than 2% interest.",

      "bodyText": "The damning parliamentary report into the demise of BHS could have far-reaching consequences for the personalities involved and for British business. The BHS scandal has been described by MPs as the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d, with Sir Philip Green accused of extracting hundreds of millions of pounds from the department store chain. Dominic Chappell, the businessman who bought BHS from Green, was described as \u201cincompetent and self-serving\u201d in the MPs\u2019 report. The fallout from the scandal could lead to a knighthood being removed, criminal proceedings and changes to how companies and pension schemes are regulated. Around 11,000 jobs are at risk after BHS collapsed into administration, with all its 164 stores scheduled to close by the end of August. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until March 2015, when he sold it for \u00a31 to Chappell, a serial bankrupt with no experience of the retail industry. Green and other shareholders extracted \u00a3586m in dividends, rent and management fees during his tenure at BHS, while Chappell and his associates banked at least \u00a317m. Pensions BHS has been left with a pension deficit of \u00a3571m based on the most pessimistic valuation. Green told MPs that problems facing the pension scheme, which has more than 20,000 members, is \u201cresolvable and sortable\u201d. He added: \u201cWe will sort it, we will find a solution.\u201d However, Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, has lost patience with Green\u2019s promises. \u201cHis family took out of BHS and Arcadia a fortune beyond the dreams of avarice, and he\u2019s still to make good his boast of \u2018fixing\u2019 the pension fund,\u201d he said. The Pensions Regulator, which could force Green to pay funds into the pension scheme, met the tycoon at the end of last month. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe met with Sir Philip and his advisers at the end of June. Our discussions are ongoing and we will not be making any further comment.\u201d However, it is understood that a formal proposal is yet to be made to the Pensions Regulator, with Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU complicating matters. The prospect of Brexit has led to yields on government bonds tumbling, potentially adding \u00a3100m to the BHS pension deficit. This is because pension funds hold gilts in their investment portfolios. If Green and the regulator cannot agree a deal the pension scheme will enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), with thousands of other schemes around the country footing the bill through a levy they pay into the PPF. Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood The report by the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee does not make a specific recommendation about the future of Green\u2019s knighthood, but it drops hints. Green was knighted in 2006 by Tony Blair\u2019s government for services to the retail industry. However, the MPs found \u201clittle to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood\u201d. Field also added: \u201cWhat kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?\u201d The Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing Green\u2019s knighthood, with MPs from all parties calling for the tycoon to be stripped of his title. Ultimately, it is the honours forfeiture committee that will consider the case. The committee will then make a recommendation to the prime minister, who will pass it on to the Queen. The future of Green\u2019s knighthood is now likely to hinge on whether he bails out the pension fund. As Field has put it, the billionaire needs to write a \u201cvery large cheque\u201d. Disqualification of directors The collapse of BHS is already being investigated by the Insolvency Service, the Financial Reporting Council and the Serious Fraud Office, which will read the MPs\u2019 report with interest. Chappell is accused of having his \u201chands in the till\u201d at BHS and enjoying lavish rewards as the company collapsed. The other directors of his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, are also accused of exploiting the retailer for their personal gain. The corporate governance of Retail Acquisitions, the owner of BHS, is described as outrageous. This provides the grounds for the Insolvency Service to examine whether Chappell and his associates breached their duties as company directors. A spokesman for the Insolvency Service confirmed that they are examining whether there is grounds to disqualify people as company directors as part of their BHS investigation. Directors in Green\u2019s retail empire could also be disqualified. The MPs were particularly critical of Lord Grabiner, the chairman of Green\u2019s holding company Taveta, whom they accused of happily providing a \u201cveneer of establishment credibility to the group while happily disengaging from the key decisions he had a responsibility to scrutinise\u201d. The performance of Grabiner, who earned \u00a3125,000 for his role, was also described as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and the \u201capogee of weak corporate governance\u201d. The future of BHS No buyer has been found for BHS or its stores, despite talks with Sports Direct and a Portuguese-backed consortium. The administrators plan to close all the company\u2019s 164 stores by 20 August, with around 50 already having shut. BHS still has debts of more than \u00a31.1bn, including the pension deficit, meaning landlords, employees and suppliers will be left out of pocket. The taxpayer also faces a bill of up to \u00a336m from lost VAT, corporation tax, and redundancy pay. Overhaul of business regulation Theresa May wants to reform capitalism and stamp out irresponsible corporate behaviour in the wake of the BHS scandal, according to the prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are planning to shed jobs and put investment on hold after the shock result of the Brexit vote provided the sharpest blow to business confidence since the global economy hit rock bottom in during the great recession more than seven years ago. In a poll of more than 500 companies taken in the two weeks immediately after the 23 June referendum, the CBI said member firms were in cautious mood as they sought to work out what the decision meant for access to Europe\u2019s single market. The employers\u2019 organisation said the \u201ccloud of uncertainty\u201d hanging over industry was causing firms to mothball investment plans and expect recent strong output growth to ease, and to cut staffing levels. With manufacturers taken by surprise by the referendum result, the CBI said the number of firms citing uncertainty about economic and political conditions abroad as a constraint on exports was at its highest since 1983. The gloomier tone to the quarterly industrial trends survey followed a period when manufacturing appeared to be doing better after a difficult start to 2016. The CBI had provided strong backing for the remain side during the referendum campaign, reflecting the views of the majority of its member companies. The findings of the survey were seen by the City as all-but guaranteeing action by the Bank of England to boost the economy when its nine-member monetary policy committee meets next week. A cut in interest rates and the resumption of the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme are seen as likely options. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cManufacturers picked up the pace over the second quarter, with output growing solidly. We\u2019re also seeing encouraging signs of a boost to export competitiveness from a weaker sterling. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over industry, post-Brexit. We see this in weak expectations for new orders, a sharp fall in optimism and a scaling back of investment plans. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important now for the new government to steady the ship with a plan, and a clear timetable, for negotiating the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. This, along with a renewed focus on industrial strategy, will help give firms the confidence they need to grow and create jobs.\u201d Only 5% of the businesses surveyed by the CBI said they were more upbeat about their future prospects than they were three months ago while 52% said they were more pessimistic. The gap of -47% was the biggest since January 2009, a period when global trade and industrial production was declining at its fastest rate since the great depression of the 1930s. Total order books are expected to be flat over the next quarter, although exporters believe they stand get more business because the fall in the value of the pound will make their goods more cost competitive. On the downside, CBI members believe the higher cost of imports will push up their costs. The survey found that firms were planning to cut spending on both new buildings and plant and machinery. In the previous industrial trends survey a balance of 6% of firms said they intended to invest more in buildings and a balance of 17% had plans for new plant and machinery. In the latest survey, these balances had fallen to -23% and -5% respectively. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the sharp drop from +23 points to +6 points in the balance of firms expecting output to rise over the coming three months suggested the sector was on course to contract. He said: \u201cTaken together with last week\u2019s flash manufacturing PMI, the evidence is mounting that the economy has taken a hit from Brexit. But it is still early days and the survey evidence so far could reflect an initial shock factor. We will have to wait a while longer before we get a clearer picture of just how big the immediate impact has been.\u201d",

Publishing pay ratios \u2013 the chief executive\u2019s pay relative to the average employee \u2013 is one of the ideas being suggested by a group of City executives to overhaul the system of boardroom pay. In April, when the group published its interim report, it warned that the current system was not fit for purpose and resulted in a poor alignment of interests between executives, shareholders and the company. Since then, the appointment of Theresa May as prime minister after the vote to leave the European Union has put the issue of executive pay back on the political agenda. During her leadership bid, May spoke of new votes for shareholders on executive pay and putting workers on boards. The group, chaired by Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, has also been exploring ways to move away from a one-size-fits-all model for executive pay. Currently stock-market-listed companies use long-term incentive plans \u2013 also known as Ltips or share awards based on three- or five-year performance \u2013 as bonus schemes. The working party has been discussing whether schemes should be tailored for individual companies. Wilson has previously said the the pay gap between board members and workers had \u201cresulted in widespread scepticism and loss of public confidence\u201d. The move to publish ratios will be welcomed by pay reformers. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said he was setting up a \u201c40 times\u201d club, referring to a specific ratio of executive pay to the wider workforce. Only a handful of FTSE 100 companies fall into this category, which is a much narrower pay gap than in other major listed businesses. Publishing pay ratios was a good discipline Stern said. \u201cIt\u2019s another way of trying to encourage those at the top to [show] greater restraint.\u201d Data published by the High Pay Centre and the Manifest shareholder advisory body last year showed that the ratio of chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014. The average pay for a FTSE 100 chief executive was \u00a35.2m compared with \u00a334,846 for the workforce. Boris Johnson warned about growing inequality when he was mayor of London. In October 2015, he made remarks that appeared to be aimed at Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising company WPP, who at the time had been paid \u00a343m. Speaking to the Conservative party, the new foreign secretary said: \u201cThere are some gigantic self-appointed sequoias that pay themselves 780 times the salary of the little shrublets they employ.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Green under pressure over BHS scandal, as UK business confidence slides \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up for the day. Here\u2019s a brief reminder of the key points. Sir Philip Green is under mounting pressures after a parliamentary report into the collapse of BHS was released. MPS accused him of \u2018systematically\u2019 taking money out of the company, failing to address its pension deficit, and generally acting in a way incompatible with a man with a knighthood for services to retail. Frank Field, who co-chaired the inquiry, raised the stakes by claiming that Green was more egregious than Robert Maxwell, who raided the Mirror Group pension fund more than two decades ago. Field told the Today Programme that: Unlike Maxwell, who was bankrupt when he threw himself off his boat [in 1991], this person [Green] has wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, and he should act. Field also compared Green to Napoleon, saying he ignored advice from colleagues and advisers and is most culpable for the collapse of BHS (which he sold last year). Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, has signalled that she wants to reform capitalism and stamp out irresponsible corporate behaviour after the scandal. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron and Labour leadership candidate Owen Smith have both called for Green to lose his knighthood. Bookmaker Paddy Power reckon Green is odds-on to lose his knighthood by the end of 2017. A petition calling for it to be revoked is attracting hundreds of new signatures per minute (57k and counting...). But Green isn\u2019t the only one under fire. Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS last year, was accused of having his hands in the till by MPs. The Institute of Directors has weighed in, criticising City grandee Lord Grabiner for his failings as chairman to Green\u2019s Arcadia Group. And in other news.... Business optimism in the UK has slumped by the most since 2009, as manufacturers are hit by uncertainty over the EU referendum. The TUC union has urged the government to act immediately, before workers lose their jobs in a wave of Brexit worries. And the main corporate news is that Yahoo\u2019s long decline has ended in a takeover by Verizon: Here\u2019s the rest of the day\u2019s key developments: A BHS worker has lifted the lid on conditions at the retail chain since it fell into administration last month. It\u2019s a pretty depressing tale of plummeting morale, gnawing uncertainty, dwindling stocks and some baffling products emerging from the company\u2019s stores as its decline continues. Here\u2019s a couple of highlights: Friday 17 June The store is much busier than it was a few months go, but the initial buzz that followed BHS falling into administration in April has died down. It\u2019s possible that shoppers have realised that, regardless of the signs hanging from the ceiling and the posters in the windows, everything still costs exactly what it did just under a month ago. I spend a mind-numbingly dull shift folding towels to help maintain the illusion that the place is still a fully functioning department store, rather than a shambolic jumble sale. While there appears to be an abundance of goods, many of our popular lines are almost sold out and the gaps are filled with items of dubious appeal that have been languishing unsold elsewhere in the building for months or even years. Damaged items have started appearing on the shelves, as well as other interesting storeroom discoveries, such as toilet brushes without brushes, handles or lids. These have not proved a big seller. Wednesday 29 June Everything in the lighting department is now for sale at 50% of its actual original value. I spend four hours alone in the menswear department, unpacking boxes of garish shorts and placing them on hangers. It is a new low point. Since the company collapsed, the administrators have cut day-to-day running costs by, among other things, no longer paying the royalty fees required to play music over the shop speakers. The deafening silence somehow makes what is already a fairly depressing atmosphere considerably worse. It was previously possible to gauge, to some extent, the financial health of BHS through the music that was played in its stores. When I first started in late 2007, it was a mix of contemporary chart stuff along with golden oldies. Shortly before the first wave of rumours began circulating that Green was looking to offload the company, the playlist switched to almost entirely forgotten 80s pop songs (Howard Jones, anyone?). I surmised that they were all songs over 30 years old upon which the copyright had probably expired. This continued until Chappell took over. The big-name chart songs returned to the playlist for a while, only to be replaced shortly before we went into administration with amateurish atrocities performed by people who I would imagine describe themselves as \u201csemi-professional musicians\u201d. Now, in the silence, I listen to customers moan that they can\u2019t find anything they want to buy or that everything\u2019s overpriced, while in the same breath saying how sad they are that we\u2019re closing down.... Here\u2019s the full piece: A petition calling for the removal of Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood is gaining support fast. More than 50,000 people have now signed up, almost all today, with around 450 people joining each minute. The petition, hosted by the 38 Degrees campaign site, calls on the Honours Committee to act unless Green returns all the money he made from BHS. Spokesman Luke Ilott of 38 Degrees says: \u201cPhilip Green got rich at the expense of thousands of people working on the shop floor - but now thousands of BHS staff have had their pension pot wiped out and face an uncertain future. \u201cWhen Britain decorates people like Philip Green with awards and honours, it says to the world that they\u2019re someone worthy of respect. This petition shows that thousands of people think raiding thousands of pension pots is not worthy of a knighthood. It\u2019s time the government listened.\u201d Reminder: the MPs who investigated the BHS collapse found \u201clittle to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood\u201d.... Lord Kerslake, who chaired the Honours Forfeiture Committee when it stripped banker Fred Goodwin of his knighthood in 2012, has said Sir Philip\u2019s Green honour is now at risk. Asked about the situation on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One, he said (via PA): \u201cMy personal view is that there is a case to be answered here. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t prejudge the outcome of the process, but I think there is enough on the record now about what has happened in the case of BHS to justify the issue being examined.\u201d A disgraced business chief and his knighthood are soon parted, as we saw with Sir Fred Goodwin after the banking crisis. And Paddy Power, the bookmaker, reckon Sir Philip Green is odds-on to lose his honour within 18 months, following the criticism in today\u2019s report. They also see little chance that the Arcadia chief will put his hand into his pocket to fully cover the pension black hole. Here\u2019s their latest odds: 4/6 To have his knighthood revoked by end of 2017 8/1 To buy a new yacht for over \u00a3100m in 2017 12/1 To sell his yacht, Lionheart, by the end of 2017 12/1 To cover BHS\u2019 \u00a3571million pensions black hole by paying personal funds to PPF by end of 2017 66/1 To be bankrupt by end of 2017 Sir Philip Green isn\u2019t entirely without support today.... The Institute of Directors has singled out Arcadia\u2019s board for particular criticism, for failing to keep Philip Green in hand. Oliver Parry, Head of Corporate Governance at the Institute of Directors, said: Green\u2019s swashbuckling spirit may have helped him build a large retail empire but, once he reached the top, he does not seem to have taken to heart what responsibility for this number of staff, and pensioners, means. \u201cThis made the failure of his board, and the Chairman, Lord Grabiner, all the more disappointing. Non-executive directors are there to rein in the excesses of executives and protect the company\u2019s long-term sustainability, including its reputation. In this light, the board\u2019s lack of oversight of the sale of BHS to Dominic Chappel is staggering. Grabiner is an experienced barrister and a senior City figure. But today\u2019s report is unsparing, saying he was \u201ccomplacent\u201d, and had failed to provide the independent challenge and oversight needed. This slump in UK business confidence is the second piece of worrying economy news since the EU referendum. Last Friday, data firm Markit reported that businesses were suffering falling output and orders, suggesting the economy is shrinking at the fastest rate since 2009. Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit has mapped both surveys onto one graph; it\u2019s pretty worrying: The TUC is alarmed by this morning\u2019s slump in business confidence (details here). General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government needs to take action now, to protect workers from the impact of June\u2019s referendum: \u201cThe TUC has published an action plan to secure jobs and investment. The government must give the go-ahead for a third runway at Heathrow, bring forward major new infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and announce a big expansion in housebuilding.\u201d It\u2019s official.... US telecoms group Verizon has snapped up Yahoo\u2019s internet business for just $4.8bn. It\u2019s the end of a 21-year saga, which once saw Yahoo valued at more than $125bn in 2000 (just before the dot-com bubble spectacularly imploded). CEO Marissa Mayer says he\u2019s planning to say at the company. Her four-year tenure at Yahoo can\u2019t really be described as a success, although turning the one-time Web pioneer around was always a massive task. Labour MP Jon Trickett argues that the BHS scandal goes well beyond Sir Philip Green. (but agrees that he should lose his gong). \u201cThe Select Committee\u2019s damning report shows how Phillip Green extracted millions from BHS over 15 years and then sold it to a bankruptee who went on to receive further millions from the company. \u201cBut a range of well-known accountancy, banking and other companies who had a duty to provide professional independent advice failed to prevent the actions described in the report. \u201cThis left 11,000 loyal hard-working people without a job and a massive pension deficit. No one should be allowed to keep a knighthood after such actions. He must also pay back the millions of pounds to the pension fund. Trickett is pushing for an \u201cimmediate and thorough review\u201d of corporate governance, including professional advisors. Today\u2019s report found that advisers were paraded as an \u201cexpensive badge of legitimacy\u201d for Dominic Chappell\u2019s RAL group, which wouldn\u2019t otherwise have passed muster. Here\u2019s the full quote from Labour\u2019s Owen Smith: \u201cThese reports expose the level of incompetence and corporate irresponsibility at the heart of BHS\u2019s leadership. \u201cSir Philip Green\u2019s greed has costs thousands of people their jobs and put tens of thousands of people\u2019s pensions at risk. Despite this, Sir Philip has shown no contrition for the damage he has done or the suffering he has caused. \u201cThe Tories should take immediate action to hold Sir Philip Green to account, starting with stripping him of his knighthood and making sure he makes a proper contributions to cover the blackhole in the current pension fund.\u201d The BHS scandal rumbles on, with Labour leadership challenger Owen Smith joining the chorus calling for Sir Philip Green to lose that knighthood: The CBI also found that manufacturers are pretty gloomy about prospects over the next few months. New orders expectations are at their lowest in over four years, and more firms expect to cut staff in the next quarter than hire more. Here\u2019s the details: Total new orders are expected to be flat (0%), the lowest balance since January 2012 (-2%). Domestic orders are also anticipated to be broadly flat (+1%) A balance of +10% expect export orders to rise (21% expect an increase, and 11% a fall) 19% of businesses anticipate a rise in output volumes, and 12% a fall, giving a rounded balance of +6% 14% expect employment to increase, and 20% expect it to decline, giving a balance of -6% More here: Manufacturing prospects muted after Brexit \u2013 CBI Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the tumble in UK business confidence: Breaking away from BHS.... a new survey has shown that confidence among UK manufacturers has slumped sharply to a six-year low. The CBIs monthly industrial trends survey found that just 5% of firms are more optimistic about the general business situation than three months ago, but 52% are less optimistic. That gives a balance of -47% -- the lowest figure since January 2009 (the depths of the financial crisis) Firms also reported that export orders have fallen this month, despite the weaker pound. The CBI says: Total order books were broadly the same as in June (-4%, from -2% in June) but export order books deteriorated (-22%, from -14% in June). Rain Newton-Smith, CBI Chief Economist, blamed uncertainty following last month\u2019s referendum: It\u2019s clear that a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over industry, post-Brexit. We see this in weak expectations for new orders, a sharp fall in optimism and a scaling back of investment plans. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important now for the new Government to steady the ship with a plan, and a clear timetable, for negotiating the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. This, along with a renewed focus on industrial strategy, will help give firms the confidence they need to grow and create jobs. BHS\u2019s stores are a pretty depressing place right now, as hopes of a rescue deal continue to fade. These photos from the Wood Green store shows how administrators are cracking on with the closing down process; even putting mannequins up for sale: Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has called on the Cabinet Office to speed up its review into whether Sir Philip Green should be stripped of his knighthood. He argues that Green simply doesn\u2019t deserve to be honoured: \u201cPhilip Green has exploited his way into filling his own pockets. It is clear that he tore off pieces of BHS to fund his lavish lifestyle at the expense of the business and those people who had put their lives into making the company a success. \u201c11,000 people are now significantly worse off because of one man\u2019s greed. \u201cIt cannot be acceptable for him to be sailing around in a \u00a3100m super-yacht while the workers he failed are left at the door to the job centre. It\u2019s time HMRC stepped in to ensure he pays the financial contribution he owes to BHS pensioners. \u201cKnighthoods should be saved for the brave and the brilliant. Philip Green has proved that he is neither of those and should be stripped of his title.\u201d John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, has urged the government to begin the process of removing Sir Philip Green\u2019s knighthood. He argues that prime minister Theresa May must deliver on her pledges to make Britain a fairer country: \u201cIn her first speech as Prime Minister Theresa May stated that her Government would be driven, not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. She must now clearly show that was not just a soundbite by holding Philip Green to account for his actions and announcing the removal of his knighthood.\u201d \u201cHe left a company in dire circumstances and a pension scheme with a massive deficit of over \u00a3400 million. A very privileged few benefitted from BHS and due to their actions thousands will now be worse off through no fault of their own.\u201d \u201cTheresa May must now order the Cabinet Office and the Honours Committee to investigate Philip Green and strip him of his knighthood. The parliamentary report makes clear he is not fit to be a knight of the realm.\u201d One of the many pieces of evidence uncovered by MPs is a handwritten note, outlining BHS\u2019s balance sheet before the sale to Dominic Chappell. Signed by Chappell and Green, it shows that the company would have \u00a394.16m of working capital - just above the minimum needed \u2013 but also faced looming VAT and national insurance (NI) demands: No wonder the Daily Mail dubs it \u201ca real back of an envelope deal\u201d. My colleague Graham Ruddick reckons Green\u2019s knighthood is on the line: Today\u2019s report finds that Philip Green \u201crepeatedly resisted\u201d requests from the BHS pension trustees to put more money into the fund, to prevent it sliding into a deficit. It says: Such contributions were not charitable donations: they were the means of the employer meeting its obligations for deferred pay. Sir Philip had a responsibility to be aware of the growth of the deficit and he was aware of it. That there is a massive deficit is ultimately his responsibility. BHS isn\u2019t the only UK company facing a pensions black hole, unfortunately. Many other schemes are also in deficit, partly due to the massive rally in government bonds since the financial crisis (which drives down the interest rate you get from them). Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at financial services Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s report highlights a wider problem: The report exposes the tensions between shareholder and pension scheme member interests, and poses some important questions about how we manage these tensions for the thousands of other schemes which continue to operate under the shadow of substantial deficits. The immediate future holds some significant threats. The possibility of an economic slowdown and increasing inflation could exacerbate an already unsustainable mismatch between the promises made to some scheme members and the ability of sponsoring employers ever to pay for those promises. There is an urgent need to take a step back and look at how best to meet the competing demands of all the parties involved. This should be an urgent priority for the new Pensions Minister. The government has admitted that more needs to be done to avoid a repeat of the collapse of BHS. A spokesman says: \u201cThis case shows why the Government is determined to tackle corporate irresponsibility and reform capitalism so it works for everyone - not just the privileged few. \u201cToday\u2019s report is very concerning, and the Insolvency Service is now carrying out an accelerated investigation. Job centres are also standing by to provide support and advice to those who were affected. But in the long run we need to do more to prevent this kind of irresponsible and reckless behaviour.\u201d Philip Green is likely to choke on his cornflakes over some of today\u2019s front-page headlines, says retail analyst Nick Bubb: \u201cThe Shaming of Sir Shifty\u201d trumpets the Daily Mail, \u201cSir Philip Green slammed in BHS Report\u201d says CityAM (with a nice photo of a shifty-looking Philip Green), \u201cGreen\u2019s reign at BJHS torn apart by MPs\u201d in the Guardian and \u201cGreen must pay for BHS plunder\u201d says the Telegraph, whilst the Committee\u2019s assertion that Philip Green is \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d is widely repeated. The FT, however, takes a different tack, with the headline \u201cMPs blame Goldman for lending credibility to doomed BHS deal\u201d. The Times highlights that a number of business leaders have criticised Philip Green and, in terms of editorial comment, there are plenty of suggestions that Philip Green should lose his knighthood if he doesn\u2019t make good the BHS pension deficit, eg in the Daily Mail, although there is a thoughtful Business editorial in the Times noting that everybody knew about the good and the bad side of Philip Green back in 2006 when he got his knighthood and that it would be wrong to re-write history. Frank Field agrees that many other people and organisations are also to blame for the demise of BHS. That includes Grant Thornton, Olswang and Goldman Sachs, who were all involved in the fateful sale of BHS to Dominic Chappell in 2015. It also includes City grandee Lord Grabiner who chaired Green\u2019s Arcadia Group. They are also in the dock over the BHS scandal - but \u2018not the same dock\u2019 as Green - for taking the billionaire\u2019s shilling and not speaking out, says Field. The work and pensions committee chair then reiterates his comparison with Robert Maxwell, arguing that: Unlike Maxwell, who was bankrupt when he threw himself off his boat [in 1991], this person [Green] has wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, and he should act. Sir Philip Green is \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d over his handling of the BHS pension black hole, Frank Field MP claims on the Today Programme. Q: What must Green do to sort BHS out? He keeps saying he\u2019s going to sort it out. He needs to get his chequebook out and write a cheque to cover the huge pensions deficit. Field then argues that Green is more culpable than Robert Maxwell, who famously plundered the pensions of his Mirror Group. Field argues that Green is worse than Maxwell, because he could actually fix the pension deficit. Maxwell, I\u2019ve always thought, meant to pay the money back. He was just going all over the place, borrowing money to keep his companies going. When the music stopped, he had no money. Now, the music has stopped [at BHS], and there\u2019s someone there who\u2019s managed to catapult themselves towards the top of the Sunday Times Rich List. This person has huge amounts of money, unlike Robert Maxwell. If he wishes now to make good that pension deficit to those 22,000 pensioners, he could do it. But he keeps talking about it, but not doing it. Q: So he needs to write a cheque for \u00a3571m? At least that much, Field replies. The pension deficit is still growing... so Green needs to ensure that no-one is worse off. UPDATE: Lawyers for Green later issued a letter disputing Field\u2019s statements, saying they were \u201chighly defamatory and completely false. Our client has never stolen any money from BHS, Arcadia or the pension funds.\u201d Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions committee, is laying into Philip Green\u2019s conduct on that Today Programme. Q: How much of this is really down to Philip Green? He took his last dividend in 2004, and BHS was still profitable in 2008 He borrowed billions against BHS and Arcadia, and a large part of that money went through his companies up to Lady Green. He has a huge responsibility here. Field questions Green\u2019s claim that he\u2019d never have sold the company to Dominic Chappell if Goldman Sachs hadn\u2019t vetted him. This was a group of companies that were run by somebody who behaves like Napoleon, who has a collection of people around him who do what he wants. There is no corporate governance, as there would be in a public company. The Financial Times is struck by the criticism of Goldman Sachs in today\u2019s report, for helping Green to sell BHS to Dominic Chappell last year: The FT says: Goldman Sachs has been blamed by MPs for lending a \u201clustre\u201d of credibility to a doomed deal to rescue BHS, the retailer formerly owned by Sir Philip Green which subsequently collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs in one of Britain\u2019s biggest corporate failures. The MPs said the bank had been currying favour with its billionaire client by helping Sir Philip pull off the \u201cotherwise questionable\u201d sale, which it branded the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. The MPs are also unimpressed that Goldman said they only offered \u2018preliminary observations\u2019, while they were actually quite closely involved in the deal. \u201cWe regret that Goldman Sachs underplayed to us the nature and extent of their role. Over in the City, shares in William Hill have surged by 11% after rival bookmaker 888 made a preliminary takeover approach. Dave Gill, national officer at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) trade union, has discussed the report on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. Q: This report must make the grimmest of grim reading for BHS\u2019s workers? It\u2019s a damning report. The consequences of the actions of a handful of people running BHS is now being felt by 11,000 hard working, dedicated and loyal staff. Q: Is there any progress in finding a buyer for BHS? It\u2019s still ongoing. 20 stores closed last Saturday, and 30 are due to close next Saturday. We\u2019re in constant contact with the administrators, and they are still looking for buyers for another 120 stores. Q: Could the mistakes made at BHS be occurring at other UK companies? I hope not, not to the level at BHS. But I hope the government will take this report on board and learn from it. Q: Is it an acceptable quid pro quo if Green comes up with the money to fix the pension black hole and thus keeps his knighthood? Whether he keeps his knighthood or not isn\u2019t relevant from our point of view.... The issue for people who work at BHS now is the pension deficit, and their employment. The BHS scandal has tarnished the reputation of British business, according to Iain Wright, chair of the BIS committee (which co-produced the report). Writing in the Daily Mirror, Wright calls for a shake-up of ethics and accountability to avoid a repeat. Here\u2019s a flavour: Just a few weeks on from his rude, unprofessional and bad-tempered appearance at our inquiry, Sir Philip has been pictured on board his multi-million pound superyacht. Back in Britain, the demise of BHS has left a trail of destruction of job losses, squeezed pensions and uncertain futures for companies reliant on the once great retailer\u2019s supply chain. Sir Philip spent years at the helm of BHS slashing costs and selling assets, while sending handsome dividends offshore and failing to invest sufficiently in the company. He was then able to dump like rubbish the business - and with it his responsibilities to workers and pensioners \u2013 to the twice-bankrupt chancer Dominic Chappell who had no experience of retail. The BHS report is the lead story on many of Britain\u2019s newspapers today: You can read the full parliamentary report into the failure of BHS here: Leadership failures and personal greed led to collapse of BHS Here\u2019s a flavour of its damning verdict: The report documents the systematic plunder of BHS at the cost of the 11,000 jobs and 20,000 people\u2019s pensions now at risk. Sir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and the respective directors, advisers and hangers-on who all got rich or richer are all culpable, with the only losers the ordinary employees and pensioners. The Committees say this is \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d and that the story of BHS begs much wider questions about the gaps in company law and pension regulation that must be addressed. The two Committees will now turn to those question in new inquiries. And turning to the Green family*, the MPs say: The headline figures that Sir Philip bought BHS for \u00a3200 million and sold it 14 years later for \u00a31 cannot disguise the true picture. He did not invest in the company and then unfortunately fail to make it succeed. Sir Philip systematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both. Lady Tina Green is still being paid tens of millions of pounds of tax free repayments on the loan that was engineered to sell BHS from one Green family business to another, and will be for some years to come. * - Lady Tina, Philip\u2019s wife, is the Monaco-based owner of the Green\u2019s Arcadia chain. Labour MP John Mann is leading the calls for Green to lose his knighthood: Another former Labour MP, Chris Mullin, credits the work and pension committee chair Frank Field: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that Sir Philip Green has been eviscerated by MPs over his handling of the BHS retail chain, which collapsed earlier this year. A no-holds-barred report into BHS found that the Green family had systematically taken money out of the chain during their ownership, weakening it and leading to its eventual collapse. Green himself was dubbed the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d -- harking back to Ted Heath\u2019s damning verdict on Tiny Rowland in the 1970s -- with little proof that he deserved his knighthood for retail business acumen. He has been urged to act now to patch up BHS\u2019s pension deficit, estimated at \u00a3571m, or risk being humiliatingly stripped of that gong. Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, summed up the report: \u201c[Green\u2019s] reputation as the king of retail lies in the ruins of BHS. His family took out of BHS and Arcadia a fortune beyond the dreams of avarice and he\u2019s still to make good his boast of \u2018fixing\u2019 the pension fund. What kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?\u201d The work and pensions select committee and the business, innovation and skills (BIS) were also unsparing in their verdict of Dominic Chappell, who bought the chain from Green a year before it folded. He had his \u2018hands in the till\u2019, they say. And they also criticise the City firms who helped engineer that takeover, including Goldman Sachs. The only group who avoided criticism are BHS\u2019s 11,000 staff, and its pensioners, who are now facing uncertainty and financial pain. Here\u2019s the full story: Also coming up today.....

It\u2019s possible that shoppers have realised that, regardless of the signs hanging from the ceiling and the posters in the windows, everything still costs exactly what it did just under a month ago.</p> <p>I spend a mind-numbingly dull shift folding towels to help maintain the illusion that the place is still a fully functioning department store, rather than a shambolic jumble sale. While there appears to be an abundance of goods, many of our popular lines are almost sold out and the gaps are filled with items of dubious appeal that have been languishing unsold elsewhere in the building for months or even years. Damaged items have started appearing on the shelves, as well as other interesting storeroom discoveries, such as toilet brushes without brushes, handles or lids. These have not proved a big seller. <br></p> <h2><strong>Wednesday 29 June</strong></h2> <p>Everything in the lighting department is now for sale at 50% of its actual original value. I spend four hours alone in the menswear department, unpacking boxes of garish shorts and placing them on hangers. It is a new low point.</p> <p>Since the company collapsed, the administrators have cut day-to-day running costs by, among other things, no longer paying the royalty fees required to play music over the shop speakers. The deafening silence somehow makes what is already a fairly depressing atmosphere considerably worse. It was previously possible to gauge, to some extent, the financial health of BHS through the music that was played in its stores. When I first started in late 2007, it was a mix of contemporary chart stuff along with golden oldies. Shortly before the first wave of rumours began circulating that Green was looking to offload the company, the playlist switched to almost entirely forgotten 80s pop songs (Howard Jones, anyone?). I surmised that they were all songs over 30 years old upon which the copyright had probably expired. This continued until Chappell took over.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair is cutting the number of flights it offers from London Stansted and shifting its focus towards growth at airports outside the UK following the surprise Brexit vote in June. The Dublin-based airline said it was rethinking its operations against a backdrop of heightened political and economic uncertainty triggered by the UK\u2019s decision to quit the EU. Stansted is Ryanair\u2019s biggest airport base, with 40 out of a total fleet of 350 aircraft located there. Neil Sorahan, the chief financial officer, said airports in Italy, Spain and Germany would all be targets for growth as it eyes greater expansion outside the UK. Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe will pivot our growth away from UK airports and focus more on growing at our EU airports over the next two years. This winter we will cut capacity and frequency on many London Stansted routes, although no routes will close.\u201d He said air fares were likely to fall until at least the end of 2017 because of the expected economic slowdown in the UK and EU following the result. The budget airline expects fares to fall by 8% over the first half of its financial year, and at least 10-12% in the second half. O\u2019Leary was an active remain campaigner in the run-up to the referendum, and announcing first-quarter results on Monday he described the vote to leave as \u201cboth a surprise and a disappointment\u201d. \u201cUntil some clarity emerges over the next two years about the UK\u2019s long-term political and economic relationships with the EU, we will be unable to predict what effect it will have on our business and regulatory environment, but we have contingency plans in place for all eventualities,\u201d he said. He added that over the longer term, there might be some opportunity for Ryanair if its UK-based competitors were no longer permitted to operate routes from one EU destination to another or were forced to sell their majority ownership of EU-registered airlines. He added: \u201cIf the UK is unable to negotiate access to the single market/open skies it may have implications for our three UK domestic routes and UK nationals on our share register, but these risks are not material and will be manageable.\u201d Pre-tax profit increased by 3% to \u20ac286.5m (\u00a3240m) in the first quarter ending 30 June, while revenue was up 2% at \u20ac1.69bn. Average air fares fell 10% over the period to just under \u20ac40, and the number of passengers carried increased by 11% to 31.2 million. O\u2019Leary said the airline was maintaining its guidance that full-year profits would rise by about 12% to a range of \u20ac1.375bn to \u20ac1.425bn, but he warned that \u201cpost-Brexit there are significant risks to the downside during the remainder of the year\u201d. Ryanair now expects to carry about 117 million customers over the full year, up 10% compared with last year and 1 million more than it previously thought. Shares in the company rose 5.7%. Sorahan said the airline was confident it could boost profits, despite the challenging backdrop for the industry, because it was effective at managing and reducing costs. Ryanair was the latest airline to say the Brexit vote, the recent terrorist attacks and repeated air traffic control strikes \u2013 particularly in France \u2013 had caused disruption to business, resulting in lower fares and almost 1,000 flight cancellations. However, Sorahan said the company was used to dealing with different challenges, including the Sars outbreak, the Icelandic volcano ash cloud, acts of terrorism, and the Brexit vote. Last week, easyJet said it was facing one of the most difficult periods in memory, while German airline Lufthansa said bookings on long-haul routes to Europe had fallen sharply.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green was the principal character in the collapse of BHS and \u201cworse than Robert Maxwell\u201d according to the MP leading the investigation into the retailer\u2019s demise. Laying the blame squarely at Green\u2019s feet, Frank Field said Green was somebody \u201cwho behaves like Napoleon\u201d, plundered BHS, and must now pay out at least \u00a3571m to fund the pensions hole left behind. The MP\u2019s comments followed the publication of a damning report into the collapse of BHS, which said the manner of the retailer\u2019s demise was the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Field, Labour MP and chairman of the work and pensions select committee, said Green\u2019s behaviour had been worse than that of Maxwell, the media tycoon and Daily Mirror owner who died in 1991 after falling from his yacht in the Canary Islands. After his death it emerged Maxwell had taken \u00a3440m from the Mirror Group\u2019s pension funds. \u201cHe\u2019s much worse [than Maxwell],\u201d Field told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought Maxwell meant to pay the money back, he was just going all over the place borrowing money to keep his companies going. When the music stopped he had no money. \u201cSir Philip Green has a huge amount of money \u2013 unlike Robert Maxwell \u2013 if he wishes now to make good the pension deficit to those 22,000 pensioners he could do it. He keeps talking about it, but doesn\u2019t do it. \u201cHe just needs to get his chequebook out and start writing a cheque to cover the huge pension deficit. He has wealth beyond the dreams of avarice and should act.\u201d Field said Green should pay at least \u00a3571m because the deficit was growing. Lawyers for Green later issued a letter disputing Field\u2019s statements saying they were: \u201chighly defamatory and completely false. Our client has never stolen any money from BHS, Arcadia or the pension funds.\u201d Other politicians have called for the prime minister, Theresa May, to take steps to strip Green of his knighthood after the publication of the report. They include Owen Smith, the Labour leadership candidate, Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and John Mann, the Labour MP. Mann said: \u201cA very privileged few benefited from BHS and due to their actions thousands will now be worse off through no fault of their own. \u201cTheresa May must now order the Cabinet Office and the honours committee to investigate Philip Green and strip him of his knighthood. The parliamentary report makes clear he is not fit to be a knight of the realm.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis case shows why the government is determined to tackle corporate irresponsibility and reform capitalism so it works for everyone \u2013 not just the privileged few. \u201cToday\u2019s report is very concerning, and the Insolvency Service is now carrying out an accelerated investigation. Jobcentres are also standing by to provide support and advice to those who were affected. But in the long run we need to do more to prevent this kind of irresponsible and reckless behaviour.\u201d The Institute of Directors said the scandal \u201ccasts a long shadow over British business\u201d. Oliver Parry, the IoD\u2019s head of corporate governance, said: \u201cThe business community will be very worried about the damage this episode will do to public faith in capitalism. Now is the time to take a fresh look at how large private-owned companies are governed. \u201cJust because a company is not listed on the stock market it does not mean there is no public interest in how it is run. The IoD has recommended that the new prime minister launch a review into UK corporate governance. After damning reports into BHS, and last week Sports Direct, there is a pressing need to work out how to raise levels of trust in how British companies are overseen.\u201d Dave Gill, national officer at the shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw, described the report as damning and said Green must honour his previous commitment to sort out the pensions deficit. \u201cPhilip Green quite openly promised to sort the [pensions] deficit out and also to look after the 11,000 loyal employees. That was said five weeks ago \u2026 and we\u2019re still sitting here waiting. He should be held to account to fulfil what he promised. \u201cThe consequences of actions of a handful of people in running BHS is now being felt by 11,000 hard-working, dedicated and loyal staff.\u201d BHS branches have started to close around the country with all shops due to bring down the shutters by the end of August. Gill said he was hopeful, however, that the administrator would be able to find a buyer for the 120 BHS shops. He said BHS workers were concerned about their jobs and pensions and were less interested in whether or not Green should be stripped of his knighthood for his part in the failure of the business.",

He keeps talking about it, but doesn\u2019t do it. </p> <p>\u201cHe just needs to get his chequebook out and start writing a cheque to cover the huge pension deficit. He has wealth beyond the dreams of avarice and should act.\u201d Field said Green should pay at least \u00a3571m because the deficit was growing.</p> <p>Lawyers for Green later issued a letter disputing Field\u2019s statements saying they were: \u201chighly defamatory and completely false. Our client has never stolen any money from BHS, Arcadia or the pension funds.\u201d</p> <p>Other politicians have called for the prime minister, Theresa May, to take steps to strip Green of his knighthood after the publication of the report. They include Owen Smith, the Labour leadership candidate, Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and John Mann, the Labour MP.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79b12daac27e2f3ce746e0786bfe366d68ba97c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79b12daac27e2f3ce746e0786bfe366d68ba97c7/0_0_4204_2523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Maxwell (1923-1991) was owner of the Daily Mirror and Oxford United, among other things, and stole millions from the Mirror Group PLC pension scheme.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Maxwell (1923-1991) was owner of the Daily Mirror and Oxford United, among other things, and stole millions from the Mirror Group PLC pension scheme.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry O'Neill/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mann said: \u201cA very privileged few benefited from BHS and due to their actions thousands will now be worse off through no fault of their own.</p> <p>\u201cTheresa May must now order the Cabinet Office and the honours committee to investigate Philip Green and strip him of his knighthood. The parliamentary report makes clear he is not fit to be a knight of the realm.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis case shows why the government is determined to tackle corporate irresponsibility and reform capitalism so it works for everyone \u2013 not just the privileged few.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s report is very concerning, and the Insolvency Service is now carrying out an accelerated investigation. Jobcentres are also standing by to provide support and advice to those who were affected. But in the long run we need to do more to prevent this kind of irresponsible and reckless behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Directors said the scandal \u201ccasts a long shadow over British business\u201d. Oliver Parry, the IoD\u2019s head of corporate governance, said: \u201cThe business community will be very worried about the damage this episode will do to public faith in capitalism. Now is the time to take a fresh look at how large private-owned companies are governed.</p> <p>\u201cJust because a company is not listed on the stock market it does not mean there is no public interest in how it is run. The IoD has recommended that the new prime minister launch a review into UK corporate governance. After damning reports into BHS, and last week Sports Direct, there is a pressing need to work out how to raise levels of trust in how British companies are overseen.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Gill, national officer at the shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw, described the report as damning and said Green must honour his previous commitment to sort out the pensions deficit.<br></p> <p>\u201cPhilip Green quite openly promised to sort the [pensions] deficit out and also to look after the 11,000 loyal employees. That was said five weeks ago \u2026 and we\u2019re still sitting here waiting. He should be held to account to fulfil what he promised.</p> <p>\u201cThe consequences of actions of a handful of people in running BHS is now being felt by 11,000 hard-working, dedicated and loyal staff.\u201d</p> <p>BHS branches have started to close around the country with all shops <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/23/all-bhs-stores-to-shut-down-by-20-august\">due to bring down the shutters by the end of August</a>. Gill said he was hopeful, however, that the administrator would be able to find a buyer for the 120 BHS shops.</p> <p>He said BHS workers were concerned about their jobs and pensions and were less interested in whether or not Green should be stripped of his knighthood for his part in the failure of the business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thursday 16 June The overnight appearance of brightly coloured \u201cStore Closing\u201d and \u201cEverything Must Go\u201d signs has sent the shoppers of Tunbridge Wells into a frenzy. I\u2019ve been allocated the job of keeping order in the bedding department but it\u2019s proving impracticable. Pillowcases are ripped from their packaging, examined and then discarded in crumpled heaps. Duvet covers are perused and then dumped among piles of cushions. \u201cExcuse me. Do you have these in a white double, fitted?\u201d asks a customer, pointing at a grey, king-sized, flat sheet. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all we have,\u201d I say, attempting a friendly smile, which I realise probably looks more like a grimace. \u201cOh. Are you sure? There\u2019s none out back?\u201d (For a second I wonder whether or not to explain that we keep our stock in the bowels of the building, which can be reached only when our ancient and decrepit elevators are working.) \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, no. The storeroom is practically empty. Sorry,\u201d I reply, trying to soften the grimace. And failing. In the 30 seconds that it has taken me to disappoint her, someone has scattered a dozen garish floral-print bedding sets. I return them to their plastic stand, where they remain for two minutes before being ransacked once again. It\u2019s officially the beginning of the end of BHS, and it\u2019s not a pretty sight. Friday 17 June The store is much busier than it was a few months go, but the initial buzz that followed BHS falling into administration in April has died down. It\u2019s possible that shoppers have realised that, regardless of the signs hanging from the ceiling and the posters in the windows, everything still costs exactly what it did just under a month ago. I spend a mind-numbingly dull shift folding towels to help maintain the illusion that the place is still a fully functioning department store, rather than a shambolic jumble sale. While there appears to be an abundance of goods, many of our popular lines are almost sold out and the gaps are filled with items of dubious appeal that have been languishing unsold elsewhere in the building for months or even years. Damaged items have started appearing on the shelves, as well as other interesting storeroom discoveries, such as toilet brushes without brushes, handles or lids. These have not proved a big seller. I\u2019m able to visit the stockroom, one of the malfunctioning lifts having been fixed. There are bits and pieces of kitchenware and numerous bath mats, but mostly empty shelves and stacks of promotional signs, announcing reductions of progressively higher percentages. I wonder what we\u2019ll have left to sell by the time we finally break out the \u201c80% off\u201d ones. Saturday 18 June I am one of the few members of staff not required to work weekend shifts. However, I message a friend and colleague in the evening, curious to know whether there will be anything left for me to do when I return on Monday. She replies that the vultures, as she calls the hordes who have flocked to the store since everything went belly up, have once again been out in force and that the bedding department has been picked clean. She also informs me that a friend will be going on maternity leave at the end of the week. A wave of sadness sweeps over me, realising that what should have been the start of a temporary absence of 10 to 12 months is now to be a final farewell. With a heavy heart, I spend the rest of the evening online, shopping for a leaving gift and card. Sunday 19 June I begin to contemplate my uncertain future and wonder whether the exceptionally disagreeable fellow that I dealt with eight years ago at the jobcentre still works there and how many hoops you have to jump through these days to get jobseeker\u2019s allowance. My colleagues and I have had to learn to live with months of constant gnawing uncertainty. First we were assured that myriad \u201cwhite knight\u201d bidders were eager to save our jobs. As the weeks passed and deadlines were moved back again and again, it began to seem less and less likely. Throughout this process, it almost felt like a conscious effort was being made to keep us shopfloor workers out of the loop. I started to suspect that our fate had been decided and the constant hints that a buyer may have been found were nothing more than a charade designed to keep our spirits up. When we were eventually told that no such saviour had been found, there was, in some ways, a sense of relief. At least we could start to formulate plans. Monday 20 June My mood is not improved by an article claiming that BHS\u2019s former owner Philip Green has just taken delivery of a \u00a346m private jet while he awaits his new \u00a3100m superyacht. I try to remind myself that money doesn\u2019t buy you happiness (although his millions would certainly take the sting out of being on the brink of joblessness). An excited manager informs me that we\u2019ve taken delivery of more stock. However, these three pallets (a fraction of our old daily deliveries) make little impression on the dwindling homeware department. A large wall that was once home to storage jars, tea towels and oven gloves is now taken up with rows of oversized kitchen rolls from the small food store that we were once promised would help turn our fortunes around. I spend part of the afternoon working alongside the visual merchandiser, a woman in her mid-20s who was once charged with making sure the products were displayed in the most attractive way possible. During the early stages of administration, while she was still doing her utmost to keep the store at its best, I dubbed her \u201cthe turd polisher\u201d. Since liquidation was announced, her meticulous approach has become impossible to maintain. I ask if it\u2019s OK to mix some muted pastel bedding sets with psychedelic ones, knowing she would have once considered this a heinous crime. \u201cYeah, just chuck it anywhere,\u201d she replies with a shrug. Somehow her resignation is at once hilarious and heartbreaking. Tuesday 21 June The question I keep hearing is: \u201cSo when are you actually closing?\u201d Mostly it\u2019s asked by savvy shoppers hoping to work out when we\u2019ll be making all the serious reductions. A few people, however, seem genuinely bothered by the prospect of losing a store they have been visiting their entire lives. Unfortunately I have no answer for them. We\u2019ve simply been told that our services will be required for as long as the store remains open. As we are leaving at the end of our shift, we are handed a letter from the administrators, dated 14 June (news really does travel slowly down the chain of command) telling us that they \u201cenvisage that the store will cease trading at some time in the next 12 weeks\u201d. As if that uncertainty wasn\u2019t bad enough, an article has appeared online claiming that there\u2019s a chance that up to 80 stores might still be \u201csaved\u201d by Mike Ashley of Sports Direct fame/infamy. God help us all if that turns out to be true. I can\u2019t help but wonder why BHS seems to be so irresistible to all these overfed, self-serving clowns. First Green, then Dominic Chappell and now, perhaps, this rambling bullyboy? What kind of terrible crimes could BHS staff have committed in their previous lives to deserve that? Wednesday 22 June There are moments, towards the end of the afternoon, when you would be forgiven for thinking the store had already closed down. There\u2019s barely a customer, and staff members stand around making chitchat. No one seems in the slightest bit interested in keeping this dying show on the road today. If there were an equivalent of Dignitas for department stores, I think we would have all been prepared to make the call today. Thursday 23 June Staff are wilting in the heat. More stock has been delivered: microfleece throws, which arrive already marked down at 50%. Supplies of our most popular all-season items, such as pillows, towels and bed sheets remain unreplenished. A new sign has appeared in the shop\u2019s window declaring \u201cnew stock in store\u201d. Presumably this is an attempt to entice back those people who visited earlier in the week and weren\u2019t tempted by the brushless toilet brushes. On the bright side, nothing more has been heard regarding Mike Ashley\u2019s attempt to \u201csave\u201d us. Friday 24 June It\u2019s the day of the EU referendum result. No one discusses it and I have long since learned not to engage in political conversations at BHS. It seems that this should be a time for celebrating the friendships we\u2019ve formed and remembering the good times, rather than highlighting our differences. Monday 27 June In the evening, many staff attend a recruitment event arranged by Sainsbury\u2019s. The evening turns out to be an uniformative Power Point presentation with uninspiring talks from managers, culminating in us being handed a piece of paper with the url for the Sainsbury\u2019s jobs website. Tuesday 28 June There has still been no official word on when the store is shutting down. The homeware department now has enough beach towels to cover a medium-sized coastal resort, but little else. A few bags of cushions arrive. In a corner of the basement, I discover a stack of posters. On a black background in a bold white font are single numbers, counting down from 9 to 2. Next to those is a pile of signs that read \u201cLast Day Today!\u201d There\u2019s an overwhelmingly depressing atmosphere. Those colleagues who have reasoned that their redundancy pay won\u2019t be worth hanging around for have left already. The general consensus among the staff is that the store will be closed by the end of July. It\u2019s going to be a long month. Wednesday 29 June Everything in the lighting department is now for sale at 50% of its actual original value. I spend four hours alone in the menswear department, unpacking boxes of garish shorts and placing them on hangers. It is a new low point. Since the company collapsed, the administrators have cut day-to-day running costs by, among other things, no longer paying the royalty fees required to play music over the shop speakers. The deafening silence somehow makes what is already a fairly depressing atmosphere considerably worse. It was previously possible to gauge, to some extent, the financial health of BHS through the music that was played in its stores. When I first started in late 2007, it was a mix of contemporary chart stuff along with golden oldies. Shortly before the first wave of rumours began circulating that Green was looking to offload the company, the playlist switched to almost entirely forgotten 80s pop songs (Howard Jones, anyone?). This continued until Chappell took over. The big-name chart songs returned to the playlist for a while, only to be replaced shortly before we went into administration with amateurish atrocities performed by people who I would imagine describe themselves as \u201csemi-professional musicians\u201d. Now, in the silence, I listen to customers moan that they can\u2019t find anything they want to buy or that everything\u2019s overpriced, while in the same breath saying how sad they are that we\u2019re closing down. Thursday 30 June Having been interviewed for a job at the new Wilko store that is due to open practically on BHS\u2019s doorstep next month, I am told, by a slightly dishevelled old man with a frayed tie, that they will not be offering me the post as I didn\u2019t provide sufficiently detailed or enthusiastic answers to such inquiries as: \u201cTell me about a time you really went above and beyond the call of duty to offer excellent customer service.\u201d Friday 1 July I\u2019m increasingly finding myself with nothing to do in the afternoon. At a loose end, I volunteer to help the food store manager, on the grounds that his is the only department receiving stock on a daily basis. I ask him how long it will be until the shelves are empty and he replies that they almost certainly never will be. Green\u2019s BHS Food project has been far from a great success. There are, I\u2019m told, a great many items throughout the store that have been on the shelves ever since it opened, shortly after Chappell\u2019s motley crew took over at the helm of the sinking ship. Our branch is next to a Marks &amp; Spencer, with both a Tesco Metro and a Poundland a minute away. Quite why anyone ever believed that people would abandon those to shop a limited range of budget food in what was once the bathroom accessories section of BHS is anyone\u2019s guess. I recall the evening just over a year ago when we were required to attend a presentation that served both as an introduction to Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions company and a reassurance that, despite BHS having just been sold for \u00a31, these new food stores would ensure a bright future. I never could quite work out if the people making the speeches believed what they were saying any more than I did. Monday 4 July Only today has the chaos really hit with full impact. It feels like someone took the whole place apart and then made a half-arsed attempt to reassemble it from memory before giving up entirely. The bathroom accessories section has been filled with women\u2019s shoes. The second floor, where the women\u2019s shoes would normally be, has a lone pair of mannequin legs, pallets loaded with unused shelves and a magazine stand \u2013 it is to become a giant salesroom for all the fittings that could feasibly find a buyer. To add to the already slightly surreal spectacle, the store manager is in jeans and T-shirt, prying fixtures off the wall with a crowbar. Once home, I watch Chappell\u2019s interview on Newsnight, in which he claims that the \u00a32.6m he pocketed while driving BHS into the dirt was a \u201cdrip [sic] in the ocean\u201d in terms of what was needed to turn the company around. By my reckoning, it\u2019s a \u201cdrip\u201d that would take a shopfloor worker, on a full-time contract, approximately 160 years to earn, if they were willing to put in overtime. He also says that the impending unemployment of 11,000 staff is playing heavy on his mind. My heart bleeds for him. Wednesday 6 July Word comes down from High Command that, contrary to everything that\u2019s been said and done so far, under no circumstances should the contents of the first floor be moved to the ground floor. Word among the staff is that someone may have suddenly remembered that the restaurant up there is reliant on customers being in the vicinity. The upshot is that the store is now still trading over two floors, with randomly placed women\u2019s wear in the homeware department. Thursday 7 July The arrival of more stock is greeted by groans from staff. Finding the motivation to unbox it isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s been a little over a month since we learned that we would all be out of a job, but we\u2019re forced to soldier on at minimum wage to sort out the mess left behind by the greed of others. The only people smiling are those due to start new jobs at Wilko next week. Wednesday 20 July Morale among the staff has reached an all-time low, as we toil through the heatwave. A display wall, now devoid of product and shelving, leads me to reminisce about the day last summer when I was asked to abandon my normal duties and assist a good friend of mine in hanging the rolls of brick-patterned wallpaper that now cover it. Neither of us had hung wallpaper in our lives, and the project soon descended into a messy farce. She and I ended up laughing so hard that I was almost sick. We got that wallpaper up though, and actually did a very fine job of it. There\u2019s never been a shortage of laughter among the staff, and I\u2019ve worked alongside some great people I otherwise would never have met. It\u2019s those memories I\u2019ll be taking with me when they finally lock the doors. Monday 25 July The publication today of a scathing report into the collapse of the company by a Commons select committee doesn\u2019t do much to raise anyone\u2019s spirits. Sadly, a disapproving tut at those whose greed has caused our predicament does nothing to remedy the problems we all face. For those of us still working in the stores, the recent announcement that all BHS branches will cease trading by 20 August is weighing even more heavily on our minds. Even now, with increasingly empty shelves and the shop fixtures themselves up for sale, we are struggling to fully come to terms with the fact that in just four weeks we will all be going our separate ways. The coming months will undoubtedly be a challenging time. Perhaps, for some, the ordeal may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. It\u2019s still hard to walk away from this experience with anything other than a deep sense of pessimism and a total distrust of big business.

These have not proved a big seller.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c715cc80b41d5a46f7fe0b2ac7df0288e60333ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c715cc80b41d5a46f7fe0b2ac7df0288e60333ab/157_0_743_1097/677.jpg\" alt=\"The vultures have been out in force ... nothing left to sell at a north London store.

Photograph: Bryan Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m able to visit the stockroom, one of the malfunctioning lifts having been fixed. There are bits and pieces of kitchenware and numerous bath mats, but mostly empty shelves and stacks of promotional signs, announcing reductions of progressively higher percentages. I wonder what we\u2019ll have left to sell by the time we finally break out the \u201c80% off\u201d ones.</p> <h2><strong>Saturday 18 June</strong></h2> <p>I am one of the few members of staff not required to work weekend shifts. However, I message a friend and colleague in the evening, curious to know whether there will be anything left for me to do when I return on Monday. She replies that the vultures, as she calls the hordes who have flocked to the store since everything went belly up, have once again been out in force and that the bedding department has been picked clean.</p> <p>She also informs me that a friend will be going on maternity leave at the end of the week. A wave of sadness sweeps over me, realising that what should have been the start of a temporary absence of 10 to 12 months is now to be a final farewell. With a heavy heart, I spend the rest of the evening online, shopping for a leaving gift and card.</p> <h2><strong>Sunday 19 June</strong></h2> <p>I begin to contemplate my uncertain future and wonder whether the exceptionally disagreeable fellow that I dealt with eight years ago at the jobcentre still works there and how many hoops you have to jump through these days to get jobseeker\u2019s allowance. My colleagues and I have had to learn to live with months of constant gnawing uncertainty. First we were assured that myriad \u201cwhite knight\u201d bidders were eager to save our jobs. As the weeks passed and deadlines were moved back again and again, it began to seem <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/bhs-collapse-deadline-day-for-white-knights-to-rescue-stricken-retailer-a3244476.html\">less and less likely</a>. Throughout this process, it almost felt like a conscious effort was being made to keep us shopfloor workers out of the loop. I started to suspect that our fate had been decided and the constant hints that a buyer may have been found were nothing more than a charade designed to keep our spirits up. When we were eventually told that no such saviour had been found, there was, in some ways, a sense of relief. At least we could start to formulate plans.</p> <h2><strong>Monday 20 June</strong></h2> <p>My mood is not improved by an article claiming that BHS\u2019s former owner Philip Green has just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/19/sir-philip-green-takes-delivery-of-46m-private-jet-says-media-report\">taken delivery of a \u00a346m private jet</a> while he awaits his <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/sir-philip-green-relaxes-aboard-8442170\">new \u00a3100m superyacht</a>. I try to remind myself that money doesn\u2019t buy you happiness (although his millions would certainly take the sting out of being on the brink of joblessness).</p> <p>An excited manager informs me that we\u2019ve taken delivery of more stock. However, these three pallets (a fraction of our old daily deliveries) make little impression on the dwindling homeware department. A large wall that was once home to storage jars, tea towels and oven gloves is now taken up with rows of oversized kitchen rolls from the small food store that we were once promised would help turn our fortunes around.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ed11ee5bdd042449ef8d82a5d28cd2fd86f47eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ed11ee5bdd042449ef8d82a5d28cd2fd86f47eb/0_50_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My mood isn\u2019t improved as I read that Philip Green has taken delivery of a \u00a346m private jet\u2019 ...

Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images for Topshop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spend part of the afternoon working alongside the visual merchandiser, a woman in her mid-20s who was once charged with making sure the products were displayed in the most attractive way possible. During the early stages of administration, while she was still doing her utmost to keep the store at its best, I dubbed her \u201cthe turd polisher\u201d. Since liquidation was announced, her meticulous approach has become impossible to maintain.</p> <p>I ask if it\u2019s OK to mix some muted pastel bedding sets with psychedelic ones, knowing she would have once considered this a heinous crime. \u201cYeah, just chuck it anywhere,\u201d she replies with a shrug.</p> <p>Somehow her resignation is at once hilarious and heartbreaking.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday 21 June</strong></h2> <p>The question I keep hearing is: \u201cSo when are you actually closing?\u201d Mostly it\u2019s asked by savvy shoppers hoping to work out when we\u2019ll be making all the serious reductions. A few people, however, seem genuinely bothered by the prospect of losing a store they have been visiting their entire lives. Unfortunately I have no answer for them. We\u2019ve simply been told that our services will be required for as long as the store remains open.</p> <p>As we are leaving at the end of our shift, we are handed a letter from the administrators, dated 14 June (news really does travel slowly down the chain of command) telling us that they \u201cenvisage that the store will cease trading at some time in the next 12 weeks\u201d.</p> <p>As if that uncertainty wasn\u2019t bad enough, an article has appeared online claiming that there\u2019s a chance that up to 80 stores might still be \u201csaved\u201d by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sports-direct-founder-mike-ashley-renews-bhs-interest-in-letter-to-administrators-a7079296.html\">Mike Ashley</a> of Sports Direct fame/infamy. God help us all if that turns out to be true. I can\u2019t help but wonder why BHS seems to be so irresistible to all these overfed, self-serving clowns. First Green, then Dominic Chappell and now, perhaps, this rambling bullyboy? What kind of terrible crimes could BHS staff have committed in their previous lives to deserve that?</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday 22 June</strong></h2> <p>There are moments, towards the end of the afternoon, when you would be forgiven for thinking the store had already closed down. There\u2019s barely a customer, and staff members stand around making chitchat. No one seems in the slightest bit interested in keeping this dying show on the road today. If there were an equivalent of Dignitas for department stores, I think we would have all been prepared to make the call today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"847c2980eaec676128f6050010ac3a0097983704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/847c2980eaec676128f6050010ac3a0097983704/0_0_3553_2254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I can\u2019t help but wonder why BHS seems so irresistible to all these overfed, self-serving clowns\u2019 ...

More stock has been delivered: microfleece throws, which arrive already marked down at 50%. Supplies of our most popular all-season items, such as pillows, towels and bed sheets remain unreplenished. A new sign has appeared in the shop\u2019s window declaring \u201cnew stock in store\u201d. Presumably this is an attempt to entice back those people who visited earlier in the week and weren\u2019t tempted by the brushless toilet brushes.</p> <p>On the bright side, nothing more has been heard regarding Mike Ashley\u2019s attempt to \u201csave\u201d us.</p> <h2><strong>Friday 24 June</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s the day of the EU referendum result. No one discusses it and I have long since learned not to engage in political conversations at BHS. It seems that this should be a time for celebrating the friendships we\u2019ve formed and remembering the good times, rather than highlighting our differences.</p> <h2><strong>Monday 27 June</strong></h2> <p>In the evening, many staff attend a recruitment event arranged by Sainsbury\u2019s. The evening turns out to be an uniformative Power Point presentation with uninspiring talks from managers, culminating in us being handed a piece of paper with the url for the Sainsbury\u2019s jobs website.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday 28 June</strong></h2> <p>There has still been no official word on when the store is shutting down. The homeware department now has enough beach towels to cover a medium-sized coastal resort, but little else. A few bags of cushions arrive. In a corner of the basement, I discover a stack of posters. On a black background in a bold white font are single numbers, counting down from 9 to 2. Next to those is a pile of signs that read \u201cLast Day Today!\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an overwhelmingly depressing atmosphere. Those colleagues who have reasoned that their redundancy pay won\u2019t be worth hanging around for have left already. The general consensus among the staff is that the store will be closed by the end of July. It\u2019s going to be a long month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"031632188a226356532325350c97a99b5fcbdb08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/031632188a226356532325350c97a99b5fcbdb08/374_251_4364_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The homeware department now has enough beach towels to cover a medium-size coastal resort.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The homeware department now has enough beach towels to cover a medium-size coastal resort.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday 29 June</strong></h2> <p>Everything in the lighting department is now for sale at 50% of its actual original value. I spend four hours alone in the menswear department, unpacking boxes of garish shorts and placing them on hangers. It is a new low point.</p> <p>Since the company collapsed, the administrators have cut day-to-day running costs by, among other things, no longer paying the royalty fees required to play music over the shop speakers. The deafening silence somehow makes what is already a fairly depressing atmosphere considerably worse. It was previously possible to gauge, to some extent, the financial health of BHS through the music that was played in its stores. When I first started in late 2007, it was a mix of contemporary chart stuff along with golden oldies. Shortly before the first wave of rumours began circulating that Green was looking to offload the company, the playlist switched to almost entirely forgotten 80s pop songs (Howard Jones, anyone?). This continued until Chappell took over. The big-name chart songs returned to the playlist for a while, only to be replaced shortly before we went into administration with amateurish atrocities performed by people who I would imagine describe themselves as \u201csemi-professional musicians\u201d.</p> <p>Now, in the silence, I listen to customers moan that they can\u2019t find anything they want to buy or that everything\u2019s overpriced, while in the same breath saying how sad they are that we\u2019re closing down.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday 30 June</strong></h2> <p>Having been interviewed for a job at the new Wilko store that is due to open practically on BHS\u2019s doorstep next month, I am told, by a slightly dishevelled old man with a frayed tie, that they will not be offering me the post as I didn\u2019t provide sufficiently detailed or enthusiastic answers to such inquiries as: \u201cTell me about a time you really went above and beyond the call of duty to offer excellent customer service.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Friday 1 July</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m increasingly finding myself with nothing to do in the afternoon. At a loose end, I volunteer to help the food store manager, on the grounds that his is the only department receiving stock on a daily basis. I ask him how long it will be until the shelves are empty and he replies that they almost certainly never will be. Green\u2019s BHS Food project has been far from a great success. There are, I\u2019m told, a great many items throughout the store that have been on the shelves ever since it opened, shortly after Chappell\u2019s motley crew took over at the helm of the sinking ship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"085daf0d2fb04c37f70df18e8a32160ca4050e1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/085daf0d2fb04c37f70df18e8a32160ca4050e1a/0_149_5503_3301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shopping at the BHS Kensington branch in 1978.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping at the BHS Kensington branch in 1978. Photograph: Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our branch is next to a Marks &amp; Spencer, with both a Tesco Metro and a Poundland a minute away. Quite why anyone ever believed that people would abandon those to shop a limited range of budget food in what was once the bathroom accessories section of BHS is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p>I recall the evening just over a year ago when we were required to attend a presentation that served both as an introduction to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/over-a-third-of-proceeds-from-84m-bhs-loan-went-to-four-directors\">Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions company</a> and a reassurance that, despite BHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/sir-philip-green-sells-off-lossmaking-bhs\">having just been sold for \u00a31</a>, these new food stores would ensure a bright future. I never could quite work out if the people making the speeches believed what they were saying any more than I did.</p> <h2><strong>Monday 4 July</strong></h2> <p>Only today has the chaos really hit with full impact. It feels like someone took the whole place apart and then made a half-arsed attempt to reassemble it from memory before giving up entirely. The bathroom accessories section has been filled with women\u2019s shoes. The second floor, where the women\u2019s shoes would normally be, has a lone pair of mannequin legs, pallets loaded with unused shelves and a magazine stand \u2013 it is to become a giant salesroom for all the fittings that could feasibly find a buyer.</p> <p>To add to the already slightly surreal spectacle, the store manager is in jeans and T-shirt, prying fixtures off the wall with a crowbar.</p> <p>Once home, I watch Chappell\u2019s interview on Newsnight, in which he claims that the \u00a32.6m he pocketed while driving BHS into the dirt was a \u201cdrip [sic] in the ocean\u201d in terms of what was needed to turn the company around. By my reckoning, it\u2019s a \u201cdrip\u201d that would take a shopfloor worker, on a full-time contract, approximately 160 years to earn, if they were willing to put in overtime. He also says that the impending unemployment of 11,000 staff is playing heavy on his mind. My heart bleeds for him.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2><strong>Wednesday 6 July</strong></h2> <p>Word comes down from High Command that, contrary to everything that\u2019s been said and done so far, under no circumstances should the contents of the first floor be moved to the ground floor. Word among the staff is that someone may have suddenly remembered that the restaurant up there is reliant on customers being in the vicinity. The upshot is that the store is now still trading over two floors, with randomly placed women\u2019s wear in the homeware department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5bfa9dcc2d2a2ed85528a9b0aaccc4873d454e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bfa9dcc2d2a2ed85528a9b0aaccc4873d454e75/98_0_945_764/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s hard to walk away from this experience with anything other than a total distrust of big business\u2019 ...

Finding the motivation to unbox it isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s been a little over a month since we learned that we would all be out of a job, but we\u2019re forced to soldier on at minimum wage to sort out the mess left behind by the greed of others. The only people smiling are those due to start new jobs at Wilko next week.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday 20 July</strong></h2> <p>Morale among the staff has reached an all-time low, as we toil through the heatwave. A display wall, now devoid of product and shelving, leads me to reminisce about the day last summer when I was asked to abandon my normal duties and assist a good friend of mine in hanging the rolls of brick-patterned wallpaper that now cover it. Neither of us had hung wallpaper in our lives, and the project soon descended into a messy farce. She and I ended up laughing so hard that I was almost sick. We got that wallpaper up though, and actually did a very fine job of it. There\u2019s never been a shortage of laughter among the staff, and I\u2019ve worked alongside some great people I otherwise would never have met. It\u2019s those memories I\u2019ll be taking with me when they finally lock the doors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/30/boredom-scavenging-stifling-heat-final-days-of-bhs-philip-green\">Boredom, scavenging and stifling heat: the final days of BHS</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Monday 25 July</strong></h2> <p>The publication today of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">a scathing report into the collapse of the company by a Commons select committee</a> doesn\u2019t do much to raise anyone\u2019s spirits. Sadly, a disapproving tut at those whose greed has caused our predicament does nothing to remedy the problems we all face. For those of us still working in the stores, the recent announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/23/all-bhs-stores-to-shut-down-by-20-august\">all BHS branches will cease trading by 20 August</a> is weighing even more heavily on our minds.</p> <p>Even now, with increasingly empty shelves and the shop fixtures themselves up for sale, we are struggling to fully come to terms with the fact that in just four weeks we will all be going our separate ways. The coming months will undoubtedly be a challenging time. Perhaps, for some, the ordeal may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. It\u2019s still hard to walk away from this experience with anything other than a deep sense of pessimism and a total distrust of big business.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on Tuesday 30 August to feature the name of the writer.

Hang on a minute, I thought more people were shopping at Aldi and Lidl these days? Oh, yes, we\u2019ve started to do most of our shopping at discount supermarkets. But the trick is not to live near them. Lloyds claims that living near an Aldi will push your house price up by just \u00a31,333. That\u2019s a bargain. But it means you\u2019ll be forced to live among a bunch of Aldi shoppers. Ugh, imagine. But you shop at Aldi! Shh, don\u2019t tell anyone. I take Waitrose bags and fill them with tinned potatoes and frozen mince. My neighbours must never know my shame. Never! God, being middle class sounds exhausting. You have no idea. I don\u2019t live near a Waitrose. Is there any way I can boost the price of my house? You could always try to mimic the Waitrose effect by slathering your house in taramasalata. That might work. Is that regular Waitrose taramasalata or Essential Waitrose taramasalata? Fine. You get two Essential Waitrose jokes. But that\u2019s it. Do say: \u201cSell your house if you live near a Waitrose.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cNot because it\u2019s worth more money, but because your neighbours are unbearable.\u201d",

Lloyds bank has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/24/living-near-waitrose-could-add-38831-to-your-house-price-survey/\">claimed</a> that properties located near a branch of Waitrose cost an average of \u00a3425,428, while houses further away cost an average of \u00a3386,763. That\u2019s a \u00a340,000 difference.</p> <p><strong>Wow. Spend all that money at Waitrose and you\u2019d be able to buy, what, three loaves of bread?</strong> Yes, yes, Waitrose is expensive, we get it.</p> <p><strong>Hang on a minute, I thought </strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11342283/Half-of-UK-households-are-now-shopping-at-Aldi-or-Lidl.html\"><strong>more people were shopping at Aldi and Lidl these days</strong></a><strong>?</strong> Oh, yes, we\u2019ve started to do most of our shopping at discount supermarkets. But the trick is not to live near them. Lloyds claims that living near an Aldi will push your house price up by just \u00a31,333.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s a bargain</strong>. But it means you\u2019ll be forced to live among a bunch of Aldi shoppers. Ugh, imagine.</p> <p><strong>But you shop at Aldi!</strong> Shh, don\u2019t tell anyone. I take Waitrose bags and fill them with tinned potatoes and frozen mince. My neighbours must never know my shame. Never!</p> <p><strong>God, being middle class sounds exhausting.</strong> You have no idea.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t live near a Waitrose. Is there any way I can boost the price of my house?</strong> You could always try to mimic the Waitrose effect by slathering your house in taramasalata. That might work.</p> <p><strong>Is that regular Waitrose taramasalata or Essential Waitrose taramasalata? </strong>Fine. You get two Essential Waitrose jokes. But that\u2019s it.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cSell your house if you live near a Waitrose.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cNot because it\u2019s worth more money, but because your neighbours are unbearable.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Africa\u2019s digital transformation would be nothing without the tens of thousands of people who have invested, and continue to invest, energy into propelling it forward. They are the leading lights driving change in infrastructure, mobile connectivity, online activism, e-commerce and financial services. Some are opening up digital cultural spaces or working to bring in investment for tech startups. As part of the Guardian\u2019s focus on technology in Africa we\u2019ve listed 10 individuals who\u2019ve been pioneers in the transformation from Tanzania to Tunisia, with the three of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s big tech hitters \u2013 South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya \u2013 particularly well represented. And in a bid to look forward we asked each of the 10 pioneers to predict the next development in Africa\u2019s digital transformation and to each nominate an emerging talent to watch. Jason Njoku, Nigeria: \u2018We\u2019ve got everything to play for, but it won\u2019t be easy\u2019 The British-Nigerian entrepreneur founded iROKOtv which hosts the most extensive online catalogue of Nollywood content in the world. Nicknamed the Netflix of Africa, iROKOtv is one of the continent\u2019s biggest internet TV providers and has raised over $35m in international investment. He says Africa\u2019s digital transformation is ahead of us. By my calculations, we haven\u2019t even really started, we\u2019re still building, we\u2019re still scaling. Everything is to play for \u2013 the majority of Africa\u2019s potential digital population aren\u2019t properly online yet, but it\u2019s not going to be an easy ride. We need homegrown investors to get behind the tech sector and understand the opportunities that are under our noses. He nominates Fikayo Ogundipe, co-founder of ToLet.com.ng which has completely reshaped Nigeria\u2019s property market, starting with Lagos. Buying, selling and renting houses in the city isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted but Fikayo and his team have painstakingly researched the market, pouring their findings into a website to help consumers navigate the process. But Fikayo is not building the Foxtons of Nigeria, he\u2019s building a Nigerian company for Nigerians, that tackles the problems encountered by Nigerians in the Nigerian property market. Lina Ben Mhenni, Tunisia: \u2018Digital action must be combined with real world action\u2019 Author of the blog A Tunisian Girl, Lina Ben Mhenni rose to prominence during the Tunisian revolution in 2011, as she documented the Tunisian uprising and violence at the hands of the security forces. Mhenni was one of the few Tunisian cyber activists who blogged under her real name while President Zine Ben Ali was still in office. Her blog was turned into a book and she was later a favourite for the Nobel peace prize. She says After Ben Ali fled Tunisia, people all around the world focused on the role of the internet in his departure. Some talked about a Facebook or internet revolution. But this ignored the sacrifices of the people who took to the streets and demonstrated, often against live fire. No one can deny the importance of the internet and social networks \u2013 when a regime imposes a media blackout, they can be used to both inform and mobilise people. But some have overestimated its role. Action in the digital world must be combined with actions in the real world. She nominates Rahma Sghaier a young leader who is using ICT to bring change to Tunisia, Rahma blogs on the YaLa platform, commenting on politics and advocating for international peace. Her main mission is to support young Tunisians to write, create photo essays and videos and explore their talents. She also promotes citizen journalism through blogging and vlogging and wants to train young girls in how to make videos. Ory Okolloh, Kenya: \u2018We\u2019ve reached the important stage of African-led technology that\u2019s not over-hyped\u2019 Ory Okolloh is an activist, lawyer, blogger and technology commentator. She helped to create Ushahidi, and mapping platform that crowd-sourced incidents of violence after Kenya\u2019s disputed 2007 election. The site has since been used to map crisis everywhere from Haiti to Gaza. Okolloh was previously Google\u2019s policy manager for Africa and now works with the Omidyar Network. In 2014 she was featured in Time magazine\u2019s top 100 list of the world\u2019s most influential people. She says What\u2019s next? To borrow a phrase from founders of mobile money providers Paystack we must \u201cdo the difficult things differently\u201d. We are maturing from the \u201clook how amazing Africans can code\u201d to a phase of solid African-built-and-led technology: companies tackling real problems or without much hype. This is an important stage because it\u2019s how we get to a sustainable digital Africa. She nominates Billikiss Adebiyi-Abiola, co-founder of recycling company Wecyclers. Why? I\u2019ve long spoken against the tendency to embrace tech as a solution to the myriad of problems facing Africa as an end in itself, rather than a means to an end. Bilikiss turns this on its head. At the heart of her work is solving a problem that previously seemed intractable: creating livelihoods and leveraging technology to improve how we live in our cities. She\u2019s also a fantastic entrepreneur. *Okolloh is commenting in a personal capacity Nii Quaynor, Ghana: \u2018The internet improved development by making communication more efficient\u2019 The computer scientist and engineer is a pioneer of internet development and expansion on the continent. He was the first African to be elected to the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the global non-profit body that coordinates databases across the internet and is often referred to as the \u201cfather of the internet in Africa\u201d. He says The internet has already improved development by making communication more efficient in Africa, but the next steps are to look at how we improve digital currency transactions like Bitcoin. Citizens currently rely on companies to act as the go-between when transferring money, but when they are able to transfer money directly between peers then development will be further improved. He nominates Ashifi Gogo, the CEO and founder of Sproxil, a company that uses mobile phones to fight counterfeiting in developing country markets. The product allows consumers to check if their products are genuine with a free text message. Gogo came up with the idea after witnessing how damaging counterfeit medicines were for developing countries. Now, customers can check their pills in one simple step. The technology is also being used verify other products from cars to electrical goods. Mbwana Alliy, Tanzania: \u2018Drones are the next big thing for Africa\u2019 Mbwana Alliy is the founder and managing partner of Savannah Fund for tech startups in Africa, specialising in $25,000-$500,000 seed investments. As of this year, Alliy has invested in 22 companies across six African countries \u2013 Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe Nigeria and Ghana \u2013 and has generated over 200 full-time jobs and raised more than $20m. He says Drones are the next big thing and the possibilities go way beyond delivery. Drones can help farmers understand their land better, they can help with mapping, with construction and mining, even market research. They are becoming available to the masses with prices starting as low as $300. Drones may well bring the most exciting potential to marry the real and vast physical challenges of Africa with the digital revolution. He nominates South African telecommunications entrepreneur Alan Knott-Craig for all the work that he is doing to improve internet access through mobiles and public wifi. Anyone who is spreading affordable internet access \u2013 not under a corporate umbrella \u2013 deserves a lot of respect. Without air, you can\u2019t breathe and without reliable and affordable internet, we\u2019re doomed in Africa tech. Jepchumba, South Africa and Kenya: \u2018Our digital transformation will be seen through the content we create\u2019 A digital artist and founder of the African Digital Art project, that provides an online space to display the work of African artists using technology in their work, and a space for digital artists to connect. She recently received a Creative Disturbance Fellowship, and has been listed by Forbes as one of the 20 Youngest Power Women in Africa. She says With the explosion of mobile and access to new and faster devices, we have become an internet-consuming culture, hungry for digital content created in Africa. The next frontier will be the exploration of our stories and collective culture: stories that will help us explore political instability, immigration, security, racism, religion and spiritualism. Our digital transformation will be seen through the content we create. She nominates Tegan Bristow, a Johannesburg-based interactive media arts and lecturer at the Digital Arts Division of the Wits School of the Arts. A behind-the-scenes champion of African culture and technology. She was also involved in Africa\u2019s first digital innovation festival, Fak\u2019ugesi, in South Africa. A true pioneer in the development of digital art. Opeyemi Awoyemi, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Olalekan Olude, Nigeria: \u2018We\u2019ll see transformations to our lives in ways we cannot yet expect\u2019 The idea for Jobberman, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest jobs site was conceived in the student dorm room of its cofounders, Opeyemi Awoyemi, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Olalekan Olude, in 2009. Seven years on and the site is now used by over 45,000 companies and is valued at millions of dollars. They say Africa will see transformations that touch the fundamental aspects of our lives in ways we cannot yet expect, or have not yet experienced, all made possible by the ubiquitous presence of the mobile phone on a continent with limited infrastructure. They nominate Solar electricity provider Txtlight, which wants to bring light to the 90 million Nigerians who currently live off grid. They provide home solar panels linked to indoor storage units and the Lumos service that provides a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d option , letting people purchase electricity by text message. Hilda Moraa, Kenya: \u2018Financial technology is set to grow and grow\u2019 Hilda Moraa is known for her work as the founder and CEO of Weza Tele Ltd. A Kenyan startup that offers supply chain, payroll and distribution solutions for businesses and a company that sold for over $1m in 2015. Moraa has since become a director at PesaZetu, a mobile lending marketplace. She says The financial technology space is set to grow and grow. Nearly 80% of adults in Africa do not have access to formal or semi-formal banking services \u2013 the majority of the continent is still unbanked. The failure of three Kenyan banks in the past year has made mobile money more attractive as the Uber effect forces the banks that remain to think about how their services work online. She nominates Wangechi Mwangi, CEO of Valuraha a company that is trying to foster a new generation of African investors. The company, which Mwangi founded as a student in Nairobi, runs investment clubs in schools where students learn about personal finance and practice investing in a virtual trading platform, a platform recently opened up to the public via a low-cost subscription. Last year she won the Global Social Impact Award at the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards. Mteto Nyati, South Africa: \u2018Entertainment-on-the-go is gaining traction\u2019 Mteto Nyati has been CEO of MTN South Africa, the country\u2019s second largest telecommunications provider, since July 2015. He previously worked at MTN South Africa\u2019s parent MTN Group, and at Microsoft and IBM. He says Africa has already demonstrated leadership in innovation in the mobile ecosystem. We have seen a surge in e-commerce and we expect this momentum to continue as affordable sub-$50 smartphones are introduced to the market. Entertainment-on-the-go is also gaining traction and customers now demand TV viewing that is not dictated by broadcasters, but by their viewing requirements. He nominates Founded in Cape Town in 2013, Hepstar are trying to transform the insurance market by making policies more freely available online. It assists its partners, including airlines and online travel agencies, to maximise revenue from the sales of insurance providing \u201cplug-and-play\u201d options for websites to help customers sign up quickly and efficiently. It\u2019s an industry worth billions. Funke Opeke, Nigeria: \u2018Submarine cables and satellites connect us, but mobile networks are congested\u2019 Funke Opeke is the CEO of MainOne, which was responsible for bringing broadband connectivity to Nigeria, and other west African countries, via a 7,000km undersea fibre optic cable from Portugal. The company now provides wholesale internet capacity to eight countries across the region. She says Submarine cables and satellites mean that Africa has more than adequate connectivity. Mobile penetration is high, 60%, of and more than 50% of those users have access to the internet. However the quality of the service is poor \u2013 limited infrastructure on the ground leads to congested mobile networks. For digital services to become pervasive citizens need affordable access to the internet and businesses need to provide continent-specific services that address low incomes and limitations on infrastructure. She nominates Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of Andela, a global talent website that trains developers and connects them with employers. The company recruits the brightest on the continent and helps them grow into the next generation of global technology leaders. Over the past two years, the company has trained over 200 tech talents.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A key economic policy adviser to the federal government has said the Trans-Pacific Partnership has provisions of \u201cquestionable benefit\u201d \u2013 including an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clause allowing foreign corporations to sue the Australian government if they think the government has introduced or changed laws that hurt their commercial interests. The Productivity Commission made the comment in its annual trade and assistance review, released on Monday. The review quantifies the level of assistance governments give to Australian industry and this year criticises regional adjustment programs that have followed the exit of the carmakers, and also the Turnbull government\u2019s big defence procurement spend rolled out in the countdown to the recent federal election. On the TPP the commission says it is uncertain whether the US will sign the controversial pact before the presidential election in November 2016. While noting that, the commission says the TPP contains provisions of questionable benefit. \u201cThese include term of copyright and the investor state dispute settlement elements.\u201d The commissioner, Paul Lindwall, warned the success in defending a recent landmark ISDS case relating to tobacco plain packaging entailed reported legal costs of about $50m. The tobacco giant Philip Morris used an ISDS provision in the Hong Kong-Australia bilateral investment treaty, signed in 1993, in an effort to sue the Australian government over the plain packaging laws implemented by the Gillard government in 2012. The case dragged on for years before an international tribunal ruled in Australia\u2019s favour, saying Philip Morris Asia\u2019s claim was an abuse of process. \u201cAs it was resolved on a technicality, and costs are apparently yet to be recovered, this success should not be taken as an indication that ISDS is essentially harmless,\u201d Lindwall said Monday. The TPP is a US-led trade deal spearheaded by the Obama administration that includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. The Turnbull government remains a strong supporter of the TPP despite the political backlash to the agreement in many countries. The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has declared recently he remains cautiously optimistic about the fate of the TPP despite the apparent opposition to it from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, who recently described the trade pact as a \u201crape of our country\u201d. In the event the TPP makes it through the political controversy that has been generated domestically in the US courtesy of the presidential primary season, the Turnbull government faces a similar trade liberalisation backlash in the 45th parliament. Labor has firmed its opposition to ISDS clauses. The opposition recently promised to review three of the major free-trade agreements signed by the Abbott and Turnbull governments \u2013 the Korean FTA, the China FTA and the TPP \u2013 in the hope of removing their ISDS clauses. Labor says it will not accept ISDS clauses in new trade pacts. If existing ISDS clauses can\u2019t be removed, then Labor\u2019s position is stronger safeguards should be imposed on existing agreements to make it harder for corporations to sue the government. As well as having to deal with Labor\u2019s reservations, two key Senate balance-of-power players in the new parliament \u2013 the Nick Xenophon Team and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation \u2013 are anti-free trade. The Productivity Commission in its latest review of industry assistance also calls for the Turnbull government to review regional adjustment packages delivered in response to the closure of car manufacturing in Victoria and South Australia, and slow growth in Tasmania. \u201cThese schemes appear to involve very high subsidy rates to some individual companies,\u201d Lindwall said. \u201cGovernments naturally want to help large groups of people who find themselves suddenly out of work due to the collapse of a major industry in the area. But it is difficult to find effective evaluation of whether this assistance is meeting its stated objectives, be that helping people transition to new careers or regional diversification.\u201d The commission also criticises the Turnbull government\u2019s big defence spend, which was rolled out in the lead-up to the recent election to help shore up the Liberal party\u2019s fortunes in South Australia against a political incursion by the NXT. \u201cPaying more for local builds, without sufficient strategic defence and spillover benefits to offset the additional cost, diverts productive resources (labour, capital and land) away from relatively more efficient (less assisted) uses,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt can also create a permanent expectation of more such high-cost work, as the recent heavily promoted \u2018valley of death\u2019 in naval ship building exemplifies. Such distortion detracts from Australia\u2019s capacity to maximise economic and social wellbeing from the community\u2019s resources. \u201cThe recent decision to build the new submarines locally at a reported 30% cost premium, and a preference for using local steel, provides an illustrative example of how a local cost premium can deliver a very high rate of effective assistance for the defence contractor and the firms providing the major steel inputs.\u201d The commission says close attention to future evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the revised defence industry support program is \u201cparamount\u201d.",

A damning report published on Monday after weeks of evidence from former executives and advisers says the \u201ctragedy\u201d of BHS was the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d and raises questions about how the governance of private companies and their pension funds should be regulated.

Green\u2019s business reputation is torn apart in the report put together by MPs on the work and pensions select committee and the business, innovation and skills (BIS) committee, who concluded there was \u201clittle to support the reputation for retail business acumen for which he received his knighthood\u201d. Their conclusions are likely to add to pressure for Green to make good the pension shortfall or be stripped of the honour which the Cabinet Office on Friday confirmed was being reviewed. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cIf Philip Green won\u2019t do the right thing by the members of the BHS pension fund then he should have his knighthood removed. And if he says he can\u2019t afford it then he should sell up his extra yacht.\u201d Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee, said: \u201c[Green\u2019s] reputation as the king of retail lies in the ruins of BHS. His family took out of BHS and Arcadia a fortune beyond the dreams of avarice and he\u2019s still to make good his boast of \u2018fixing\u2019 the pension fund. What kind of man is it who can count his fortune in billions but does not know what decent behaviour is?\u201d MPs said Green had \u201csystematically extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from BHS, paying very little tax and fantastically enriching himself and his family, leaving the company and its pension fund weakened to the point of the inevitable collapse of both.\u201d Green was found to hold prime responsibility for the pensions black hole after years of refusing to provide sufficient funding, despite pleas from the fund\u2019s independent trustees. The report urges Green to bring about a swift resolution to the financing of the BHS pension fund by making \u201ca large financial contribution\u201d. \u201cHe has a moral duty to act, a duty which he acknowledges. We still do not doubt that Sir Philip has heartfelt affection for BHS. To an extent it created him; it could also bring him down,\u201d MPs said. Green last week set out a robust defence of his stewardship of BHS, claiming he put \u00a3421m into the group during his 15 years at the helm. But MPs found the demise of BHS was the result of \u201ca series of bad business decisions and personal greed\u201d. \u201cSir Philip Green, Dominic Chappell and the respective directors, advisers and hangers-on who all got rich or richer are all culpable, with the only losers the ordinary employees and pensioners,\u201d their report concludes. MPs said Chappell had put no money into BHS and \u201chad his hands in the till\u201d, personally taking \u00a34.1m from the ailing company in 13 months of ownership including a \u00a31.5m interest free loan, secured against his father\u2019s house. Iain Wright, the BIS committee chair, said: \u201cBHS\u2019s demise has created many losers, particularly the 11,000 staff facing the loss of their jobs and the 20,000 pensioners facing significant reductions to their pensions. The actions of people in this sorry and tragic saga have left a stain on the reputation of business which reputable and honourable people in enterprise and commerce will find appalling.\u201d The committees said they would support investigations by the Financial Reporting Council, the Pensions Regulator, the Insolvency Service and the Serious Fraud Office. The Pensions Regulator said its \u201canti-avoidance\u201d investigation was continuing and it expected to have made significant progress by the end of this year. \u201cDiscussions are ongoing with various parties,\u201d said Lesley Titcomb, its chief executive. MPs plan to launch two new investigations that will examine regulation of the corporate governance of private companies and whether there should be more proactive regulation of pension funds. \u201cSome of the failures which allowed this to happen are not unique to BHS. Its lessons merit broader consideration of the framework in which companies operate,\u201d the report says. Their plans are likely to be supported by Theresa May, who has pledged \u201cto make our economy work for everyone by getting tough on irresponsible behaviour in big business\u201d. Weak corporate governance at Green\u2019s Taveta group, which was run as a \u201cpersonal fiefdom by a single dominant individual\u201d, according to MPs, meant there was little independent oversight or challenge to decisions. They suggested Green had acted to conceal the true state of the BHS pension fund\u2019s problems from Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions group and said his account of talks to sell BHS to a convicted fraudster, Paul Sutton, did not tally with that of his former adviser Robin Saunders. The eventual sale of BHS to Chappell \u2013 a former bankrupt and business associate of Sutton who had failed to meet Taveta\u2019s own hurdles in terms of providing equity, working capital and a credible retail frontman \u2013 went ahead without Taveta\u2019s chairman, Lord Grabiner, even knowing about the deal. Grabiner, a high-profile corporate lawyer, was criticised for having a \u201cremarkably docile attitude\u201d and representing the \u201capogee of weak corporate governance\u201d. \u201cHe was content to provide a veneer of establishment credibility to the group while happily disengaging from the key decisions he had a responsibility to scrutinise. For this deplorable performance he received a considerable salary,\u201d MPs said. Under Green\u2019s control, BHS struggled to cope with tough conditions on the high street as he failed to invest sufficiently in stores or reinvent the business. MPs said the early rise in profits under his leadership was the result of cost cutting and asset sales and that paying out substantial dividends, mainly to Green\u2019s wife Tina, who lived in the tax haven of Monaco, had weakened the ability of the business to keep up with its competitors and tackle its rising pension deficit. They noted that companies controlled by Tina Green and registered in the tax havens of either Jersey or the British Virgin Islands continued to make millions of pounds from a loan which was used to help sell the business from one of the group\u2019s entities to another. Last year, she earned \u00a38.3m, or 8% interest, on the \u00a3200m loan to Taveta made in 2009 on top of a \u00a320m per year loan repayment. As BHS\u2019s pension fund deficit soared, Green decided to offload the business rather than answer the Pensions Regulator\u2019s questions about the money extracted from the business. As Chappell struggled to come up with the finance necessary to finalise the buyout of BHS, MPs said Green had attempted to make good those inadequacies to facilitate the sale. \u201cHe was both sides of the deal,\u201d their report concluded. They said that contrary to evidence from Green\u2019s lieutenant Paul Budge to MPs that Chappell was a new bidder who \u201cstarted from a clean sheet of paper\u201d, it was clear that he had picked up the plans of Sutton \u201cwith the full knowledge of Arcadia board members\u201d. While Green insisted in his evidence to MPs that BHS was offloaded with a healthy balance sheet, they concluded there was \u201csimply not enough cash in BHS to give it a realistic chance of medium term survival\u201d. Having gained control of BHS, Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions also suffered from \u201cfeeble\u201d corporate governance and its board was peopled with friend\u2019s and family of the former bankrupt. Under their stewardship, Retail Acquisitions charged \u00a311m to BHS in the form of salaries and fees while a string of directors jumped ship or failed to fulfil their responsibilities despite \u201cprofiting handsomely\u201d from their positions.",
