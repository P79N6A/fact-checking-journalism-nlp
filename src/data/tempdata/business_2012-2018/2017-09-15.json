      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing exporters have \u201choarded\u201d the gains from last year\u2019s fall in sterling by putting up prices rather than increasing output and sales. The Office for National Statistics said exporters could have allowed their prices to decline in line with the fall in the pound, making their products more attractive to foreign buyers, but chose to boost their profits instead. Illustrating the uncertainty following the Brexit vote, which has made exporters nervous about expanding production, analysis by the ONS shows that UK companies increased export prices by 12.7% year on year in the months after the referendum in response to a 16.9% fall in the exchange rate. The figures will disappoint Brexit campaigners who have urged exporters to make the most of the fall in sterling by expanding production and increasing employment. The ONS said export volumes improved last year, despite exporters\u2019 price increases, due to the improving global trade situation. But the rise in exports was matched by an increase in imports, offsetting the benefits of higher prices. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cExporters have responded to the pound\u2019s depreciation by raising their sterling prices, with the result that their profits have surged but their goods haven\u2019t become much more competitive. \u201cAlthough export volumes have increased, so too have imports; both have been boosted by a rebound in world trade, rather than sterling\u2019s plunge. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, exporters have hoarded cash \u2013 understandably, given Brexit uncertainty \u2013 rather than reinvested their bumper profits or dispensed it to shareholders. As a result, sterling\u2019s depreciation has hit consumers hard but it has done little to help the economy rebalance.\u201d Large businesses were quick to increase prices in response to the fall in sterling, with small and medium-sized businesses following the same policy. ONS analysts said it was difficult to estimate the impact of higher import prices on profits without a more detailed study of the cost of raw materials used to manufacture goods. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, landed himself in hot water after he accused firms of being too \u201cfat and lazy\u201d to expand exports beyond Europe and their existing customers. After the Brexit vote, he said it was the duty of exporters to use the currency\u2019s revaluation to expand output. \u201cWhat is the point of us reshaping global trade, what is the point of us going out and looking for new markets for the United Kingdom, if we don\u2019t have the exporters to fill those markets?\u201d This year the prime minister, Theresa May, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and several senior cabinet members have joined a succession of trade missions. May recently visited Japan to prepare the ground for a free trade deal with the world\u2019s third largest economy. Hammond\u2019s most recent trade mission was to India, where he talked to businesses about expanding links across the Indian subcontinent. Fox\u2019s deputy, Mark Garnier, said last year: \u201cThe government has put trade at the heart of its agenda with the creation of the Department for International Trade and we are working hard to help UK companies take advantage of the global demand for British goods and services.\u201d It will also be seen as a missed opportunity after a rise in sterling over recent months in response to speculation that UK interest rates will increase before the end of the year. A speech by one of the Bank of England\u2019s longstanding advocates of low interest rates indicating that a hike is imminent sent the pound to fresh highs for the year. Gertjan Vlieghe, in comments that largely echoed the Bank\u2019s message a day earlier, suggested it could raise rates as soon as its next meeting on 2 November. Britain continues to suffer from a large trade deficit in manufactured goods despite the fall in the pound and rise in exports, largely as a result of the rise in imports. The most recent trade figures show that UK exporters have struggled to win contracts in new markets beyond the European Union\u2019s border. Official figures for July showed the UK\u2019s deficit in the trade in goods with non-EU countries widened by \u00a32.4bn while exports to the EU grew to cut the trade gap by \u00a31.3bn. In the three months to July, compared to the previous quarter, the total trade in goods deficit increased by \u00a31.1bn to \u00a334.4bn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prospect of the first interest rate rise in a decade has sent the pound to its highest level since the day after the Brexit vote and put debt-laden consumers on notice of higher borrowing costs. The rally in the pound against the dollar provided some relief for Briton\u2019s travelling abroad and comes amid heightened expectations that the Bank of England could increase rates as soon as November. This would signal an end to nearly a decade of historically low interest rates. The Bank began cutting rates as the economy went into recession following the financial crisis, falling to 0.5% in March 2009. The rate remained at that level until a further cut to 0.25% in August last year following the Brexit vote. The last time there was a rise was July 2007, meaning a generation of borrowers have yet to experience a rise in their borrowing costs. But even though expectations of a rise drove the pound higher, to $1.36, it remains almost 10% lower than on the day the polls closed on 23 Junelast year, the day of the EU referendum. The pound had slumped to 30-year lows after the referendum \u2013 sliding to $1.20 in January \u2013 making US trips more expensive for UK holidaymakers. The pound\u2019s rally was prompted by remarks from a member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), who had previously been regarded as one of the most dovish and most wary of a rate rise. Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the MPC, said: \u201cUntil recently, I thought the appropriate response of monetary policy was to be patient, given modest growth and subdued underlying inflationary pressure. But the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when [the] bank rate may need to rise.\u201d In a speech to economists in London, Vlieghe said his mood was moving towards a change in policy because of the low employment rate and a potential increase in wages in the coming months, which have put more pressure on inflation. Figures released this week showed inflation had risen to 2.9% in August. He also warned Brexit could have a more negative impact on the economy than expected, which might force policymakers to reverse any interest rate decision. \u201cBut for now, it seems the net effect of the many underlying forces acting on the UK economy is that slack is continually being eroded and wage pressure is gently building. \u201cIf these data trends of reducing slack, rising pay pressure, strengthening household spending and robust global growth continue, the appropriate time for a rise in bank rate might be as early as in the coming months.\u201d Vlieghe, who joined the MPC in September 2015, also hinted that any change in rates might eventually be greater than the quarter point cut after the EU referendum. His remarks echoed the sentiment of Thursday\u2019s announcement from the MPC that rates were being held at 0.25% but that a rise was coming, although there was scepticism from some economists about the rationale behind any rise. Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: \u201cThe possibility of a November or February hike is real, we think. That said, we cannot understand why the Bank would want to hike rates just as currency effects on inflation are about to fade, while domestic price pressure is non-existent.\u201d They added that the Bank \u201cseems to be panicking about the inflation peak rather than looking ahead to the likely sharp drop next year\u201d. Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan, pointed to Vlieghe\u2019s \u201cpositive spin on what is still a significant disappointment in the wage data\u201d. Figures released this week showed average earnings increased by 2.1% in the three months to July. Economists said the Bank had been having difficulty communicating its view on interest rates, which in 2014 led MPs to accuse its governor, Mark Carney, of behaving like an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d by giving mixed messages as to when rates might move. Economists at Barclays said they expect a rate rise in November: \u201cWe believe the MPC is ready to take the risk of a hike, even faced with disappointing data, as it has boxed itself into a corner.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Angela Merkel addressed the Frankfurt motor show, it was not to a backdrop of revving engines but an exhibition of noiseless electric Golfs, South Korean hybrids and Japanese fuel-cell cars. The silence should have pleased the chancellor, who in the wake of the VW emissions scandal has hinted at a possible ban on sales of the diesel cars for which German manufacturers are renowned. German cities plagued by air pollution, including Munich, home of BMW, are mulling over the banning of diesels from their centres. Internationally, the UK and France recently promised to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, while carmakers including Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover have raced to pledge electrification of their future models. The summer of love for battery cars prompted newspaper editorials heralding the end of the internal combustion engine. One bank even forecast that all new car sales in Europe would be electric within two decades. Meanwhile, diesel car values have plummeted. So it should perhaps come as no surprise that electric cars have taken centre stage at the Frankfurt motor show, which opens to the public on Saturday. BMW is showing off a new version of its popular i3 battery-powered car and new battery-powered Minis. Rival Mercedes-Benz has introduced a futuristic concept electric car, the EQA, which has pride of place at the centre of its hall, and the company\u2019s chief executive promised all models from 2022 will be electrified to some degree. France\u2019s Renault unveiled a concept electric car that could double as a backup battery for the home. Japan\u2019s Honda launched a boxy battery-powered concept car, the Urban EV, which European motorists will be able to buy in 2019. \u201cThis is not some vision of the distant future,\u201d said the Honda chief executive, Takahiro Hachigo, as he also pledged that all the company\u2019s new models in Europe would soon be either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or fully electric. South Korean challenger Hyundai said more than half the models it sells in Europe by 2020 will be battery-powered. So is the internal combustion engine\u2019s century-long reign coming to an end? The carmakers here do not seriously believe that, despite the rhetoric and the prominence of battery models. \u201cThat\u2019s just hype,\u201d said BMW\u2019s Robert Irlinger, of the notion that conventional engines were dead. Irlinger, who heads the firm\u2019s \u201ci\u201d electric division, expects electric models to make up only 15%-20% of the firm\u2019s sales by 2025. \u201cThere is a change and we are really starting with electrified cars, but we do not hide our normal cars,\u201d he said, adding that the company was putting a \u201chuge amount of money\u201d into the development of battery-powered cars. One Mercedes-Benz executive said that with \u20ac10bn committed to work on electric vehicles it was, if anything, overinvesting in the technology compared with its peers. \u201cIt\u2019s something that might be overhyped,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Schenck, the company\u2019s head of e-drive integration, of the suggestion petrol and diesel cars were finished. \u201cWe\u2019re intent to go on with diesel \u2026 it is a good technology for [cutting] carbon emissions.\u201d A ban on diesels entering German cities would, he said, be a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d. Indeed, the European car manufacturers\u2019 association argues that diesel is still the only serious way to meet future EU carbon targets, despite concerns over air quality. Dieter Zetsche, the president of the ACEA, said: \u201cAny rash move away from this technology [diesel] would make it harder to meet the [European] commission\u2019s [carbon] targets.\u201d With electric and plug-in hybrid cars making up just 1.2% of new car sales in Europe today, he called for a reality check on how big a contribution they could make to carbon cuts. \u201cWhen it comes to market uptake of electric vehicles we have to look at the reality. The reality is the market uptake of these vehicles remains low. It\u2019s not due to a lack of availability: all ACEA members are expanding their portfolios of electric vehicles, you can see proof of that on display here,\u201d said Zetsche. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the immediate death of the combustion engine,\u201d said Joe Bakaj, vice-president of product development at Ford of Europe, which sees more efficient diesel as the most cost-effective way to cut carbon emissions in the short term. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a strong pull [from customers] on battery electric vehicles. There\u2019s a lot of talk, a lot of hype, but there aren\u2019t a lot of customer numbers.\u201d He blames their limited driving range, upfront price and a shortage of charging points as reasons why. The issue of the limited charging point infrastructure is cited by many carmakers at Frankfurt as a barrier to electric car takeup. Steven Armstrong, Ford\u2019s president in Europe, said investment was needed in ageing infrastructure. \u201cThis is particularly true of the challenge facing our efforts to scale up the operation of electric vehicles in cities where we already have a strained energy grid,\u201d he said, announcing a joint venture with Aldi, Daimler and Porsche to fit fast-charging points along Europe\u2019s motorways. Chargepoint, a North American charging firm entering the UK market, points out that most electric cars are topped up at home or work. Moreover, because take-up of the cars will be gradual, so can the roll-out of chargers. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fully build all the infrastructure before you sell the first car,\u201d said Pasquale Romano, the company\u2019s chief executive. But while electric models have taken pride of place on many of the carmakers\u2019 displays in Frankfurt this week, they are still hugely outnumbered by petrol and diesel vehicles. The big launch for Toyota, the Japanese carmaker synonymous with hybrids, was a Land Cruiser with a choice of a huge petrol or diesel engine. Nonetheless, most manufacturers agree that the endgame in the long-term is probably electric. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a plan B, this is plan A: we go electric,\u201d said Schenck at Mercedes-Benz. \u201cWhat is sure is electric vehicles will increase dramatically. We feel the tipping point has been reached,\u201d said Guillaume Berthier, chief of sales and marketing for electric vehicles at Renault, which has seen a 40% increase in battery electric vehicles this year. And there are plenty of reasons an electric switch might come sooner than many think: a higher oil price, changes in taxation and, most worrying for the European motor industry, the diesel exclusion zones being mulled in many European cities. \u201cThat,\u201d said Bakaj, \u201ccould change things very quickly.\u201d Electric cars to buy today FULLY ELECTRIC Nissan Leaf \u00a316,680 (plus battery leasing), 155-mile range The Leaf is a small family car that has been around long enough that used ones can be bought for less than \u00a37,000. Alternatively you could wait until next year for the new version, which has a longer, 255-mile range. BMW i3 \u00a328,570, 125 miles This head-turning model is a large part of the reason BMW has sold more than 150,000 electric cars in Europe. If the range puts you off, there\u2019s the option of a version with a small petrol engine with extends its reach to 206 miles. Renault Zoe \u00a314,245 (plus battery leasing), 250 miles Cheap and cheerful, the Zoe also has a battery capable of rivalling some Teslas, though its supermini size won\u2019t be big enough for everyone. HYBRIDS Toyota Prius plug-in \u00a329,195 A halfway house between petrol and electric cars, the plug-in version of Toyota\u2019s iconic hybrid can travel 39 miles on battery power \u2013 enough for most local journeys and commutes \u2013 with the reassurance of a petrol engine for cross-country trips. Hyundai IONIQ \u00a322,385 (hybrid), \u00a324,995 (electric), \u00a327,495 (plug-in hybrid) South Korean manufacturer Hyundai is the first to offer a model you can buy either as a hybrid \u2013 the lowest level of electrification \u2013 all the way to a plug-in hybrid and through to a 100% electric version. Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV \u00a331,805 This SUV plug-in hybrid runs 33 miles on electricity before its petrol engine kicks in and has been wildly popular, becoming the UK\u2019s best-selling plug-in electric car in recent years.

      "bodyText": "The head of two G4S-run detention centres has been placed on administrative leave after a series of scandals, the Guardian has learned. G4S is believed to have placed Ben Saunders on leave from his role in charge of Brook House and Tinsley House immigration removal centres (IRCs) after an undercover Panorama exposed abuse of detainees there. Officers were seen to mock suicidal detainees and one officer is alleged to have attempted to choke a detainee. A G4S source at managerial level told the Guardian: \u201cSenior managers were called to a meeting yesterday and told Saunders was put on leave\u201d. G4S declined to comment on the report. The news is another unfortunate milestone in a difficult period for G4S, which has faced severe criticism over its management of the two IRCs in the UK. The Guardian revealed this week that both detention centres appeared to make larger profit margins than that agreed with the Home Office. Documents showed profits before tax upwards of 20% whereas the original contract between G4S and the Home Office showed an agreed profit margin of 6.8% G4S said the higher figures did not reflect final profits as they did not take into account company-wide costs and overheads. Last week, the Guardian also revealed that Saunders had been in charge of a children\u2019s prison in 2009-10 when children were maltreated. Like the two IRCs, Medway Secure Training Centre in Kent was then run by G4S, before it gave up its children\u2019s services division after abuse and alleged corruption were exposed by the Guardian investigation and another Panorama undercover operation. The Home Office is under increasing pressure to strip G4S, the largest security firm in the world, of its contract to run the IRCs after the latest revelations of abuse and possible financial irregularities. On Thursday, Peter Neden, regional president for UK and Ireland, and Jerry Petherick, managing director for custody and detention centres, gave evidence before the home affairs select committee about the Brook House scandals. Neden told the committee chair, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, that he was not \u201cat liberty to disclose the profits\u201d. She replied: \u201cThe fact that some very serious allegations have been made about G4S not providing full and accurate information to the Home Office and, also, the fact that this is profit on a service in which there has now been very serious evidence of abuse and mismanagement taking place, means that actually it is not acceptable for you simply to provide no information about the profitability on these contracts.\u201d When Petherick was asked whether he had considered his position, he replied: \u201cYes. I would be an idiot not to \u2026 At the moment, my job is to be the leader. It is my job to take Brook House, and the rest of my business, through this. Of course I have looked at myself; I would be failing in my duty to everyone if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d Cooper concluded: \u201cMr Petherick and Mr Neden, I am afraid that the answers you have given do not suggest that you have any grip on this at all.\u201d The Rev Nathan Ward, former duty director at Brook House and now a Church of England priest, was asked by the select committee whether he was shocked by the Panorama footage of Brook House. He replied: \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised, but shocked at the level of abuse that was going on. I had been raising concerns about practice within G4S since 2001. In particular, I raised concerns to Jerry Petherick upon my resignation.\u201d When questioned about G4S profit margins at the IRCs, Ward said: \u201cI have certainly seen presentations with 30% profit margins put on them.\u201d When Cooper asked if it was plausible that G4S had deliberately given false information to the Home Office about profit margins, Ward replied \u201cCategorically, yes.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is clear from the endless list of complaints and scandals that the Home Office are aware of improper conduct among G4S staff. Yet they stand by as this company continues to employ staff who have run failed institutions. It\u2019s high time the Home Office brought its agents to order, and if things do not improve consider a review into whether G4S should remain a service provider.\u201d When asked whether it was considering pulling out of its contract to run the two IRCs, G4S said: \u201cWe remain committed to running Brook House and Tinsley House immigration removal centres on behalf of the Home Office. The wellbeing of those in our care is our priority.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, let\u2019s take a look at European markets, where the FTSE 100 is still being hammered by the strengthening pound. FTSE 100: -1.1% at 7,216 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.1% at 12,527 France\u2019s CAC: -0.3% at 5,207 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 22,253 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,308 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 381 The main event today was the speech by Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee. Despite having voted yesterday to hold rates at an all-time low of 0.25%, the committee member once considered to be most dovish (in favour of low rates) said rates could rise in the \u201ccoming months\u201d. He also said the MPC was unlikely to stop at one rate rise. Economists and investors are now factoring the first UK rate increase in a decade in November, to coincide with the Bank\u2019s next inflation report. Vlieghe\u2019s comments sent the pound to its highest level against the dollar since 24 June 2016, the day of the Brexit vote result. It touched $1.36, and is currently up 1.4% at $1.3585. That\u2019s it for today, thank you for all your comments. Have a good weekend, and please join us again on Monday. AM Industrial production fell 0.9% in the US in August, disappointing expectations of a 0.1% increase. Production was up 0.4% in July. Manufacturing output was down 0.3%, again worse than the 0.3% increase forecast by economists. It was flat in July. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics says the Fed is unlikely to raise US rates against this year. Industrial production unexpectedly declined, by as much as 0.9% m/m, in August, but the Fed estimates that almost the entire decline was attributable to Hurricane Harvey, which struck late in the month. Fed officials aren\u2019t going to panic about the weakness of retail sales and industrial production in August, since it appears to be mostly storm related. But September could be even worse when Irma is factored in. Furthermore, the Fed won\u2019t want to commit to another rate hike until it is sure that activity is rebounding after the storm disruption. That\u2019s why, even though core consumer prices are showing some resurgence, we now expect the Fed to stand pat on rates for the rest of this year. US markets have opened roughly flat, with investors shrugging off concerns over the latest missile strike by North Korea: Dow Jones: +0.1% at 22,233 S&amp;P 500: -0.03% at 2,495 Nasdaq: -0.04% at 6,427 It looks like Hurricane Harvey did disrupt US retail sales at the end of last month. Roiana Reid, economist at Berenberg bank, explains: US retail sales slipped 0.2% m/m in August, partly due to sluggish vehicle sales in the Houston region where Hurricane Harvey brought activity to a halt. Excluding autos, retail sales advanced 0.2% m/m, helped by higher gas prices that pushed up the value of sales at gasoline stations (+2.5% m/m). As long as consumer confidence and job growth remain favorable, expect retail sales and broader private consumption to be solid in the medium term, but expect near-term volatility from the hurricane effects. Andrew Hunter, US economist at Capital Economics, says that while consumer spending growth may have slowed, the fundamentals for the world\u2019s largest economy look positive. The 0.2% decline in retail sales in August was worse than the consensus expectation and suggests that consumption growth has slowed a little in the third quarter, albeit possibly because of the disruption caused by Hurricane Harvey toward the end of the month. Even so, strong gains in previous months still leave real consumption on track for third-quarter growth of around 2.5%, and the fundamentals point to a renewed acceleration before long. With consumer confidence close to record highs and the labour market continuing to improve, we doubt this is the start of more sustained downturn and expect retail spending to bounce back over the coming months. US retail sales fell by 0.2% in August, the month when Hurricane Harvey hit America. It followed a 0.3% rise in sales in July, and disappointed expectations of a 0.1% rise. Over to Estonia now, where the latest Eurogroup meeting is taking place in Tallinn, and where Greece is topping the agenda. Helena Smith reports from Athens Greece was never meant to top the agenda when eurozone finance ministers met in Tallinn today, but thorny issues that could define progress in prospective bailout negotiations will dominate talks. The issues will range from the very public licensing row with Eldorado Gold - the Canadian mining company that has threatened to halt operations in Greece - to the unseemly spat over the country\u2019s former statistics agency chief, Andreas Georgiou, who has been dragged through the courts accused of inflating debt figures in a row that has incensed international creditors. Athens\u2019 leftist-led government wants upcoming bailout talks to be completed by December so that, in the words of prime minister Alexis Tsipras, Greece can make a \u201cclean exit\u201d from international supervision when its third \u20ac86bn bailout program ends in August 2018. Privatisations will be key to success. On Thursday, Greece took another step towards selling its ailing state assets, finally signing the deal to hand over its train company, TrainOSE, to Italy after four years of negotiation. The rail network was sold to Italy\u2019s state run rail network Ferrovie Dello Stato for many have called a paltry sum of \u20ac45mn. Andrew Goodwin, lead UK economist at Oxford Economics, questions whether the Bank of England is \u201ccrying wolf\u201d or genuinely serious about an imminent rate hike. He\u2019s not convinced they mean it: The early evidence suggests that the MPC\u2019s hawkish shift has had the desired effect and triggered a reappraisal of interest rate expectations by markets. But we are sceptical that the data will evolve in a way that would allow the MPC to actually follow through on its threat to raise interest rates. One reason why we think a near-term rate hike remains unlikely is the enduring softness of wage growth. Though this week\u2019s data saw unemployment hit a 42-year low of 4.3%, wage growth remains anchored at just above 2%. This suggests that concerns about a build-up in underlying inflationary pressures are overblown. Unless we see a decisive acceleration towards 3% [inflation], the MPC will find it hard to justify making a move given the lack of a compelling reason elsewhere. For one, there is unlikely to be a material improvement in the growth outlook for some time to come. And the potential downside risks from Brexit will continue to loom large for the foreseeable future, even if Theresa May adopts a more conciliatory tone in next Friday\u2019s speech. So, as with several other instances in recent years, we think there is a strong chance that the MPC will again be seen to be crying wolf. Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan, says the Bank of England wants to \u201chave its cake and eat it\u201d, and that while the odds of a rate hike in November has increased, some of the data would need to show improvement first. Vlieghe\u2019s views are adding to expectations for a November rate rise. However, an important question is why the BoE didn\u2019t raise rates in September \u2013 without even a tightening in the vote \u2013 if so many of the MPC see such a clear case for raising rates. We see two potential answers to this question: One is the BoE\u2019s communications have previously failed to prepare the market for an imminent rate rise. The BoE may well have been shocked by the market\u2019s dovish reaction to its August Inflation Report, where it essentially warned the curve was too flat \u2013 only to then witness a further flattening. As we have argued, this reaction has made the BoE more agitated, the consequences of which we are now witnessing. Now the market is better prepared for a rate rise, the BoE may feel that it has the green light to deliver in November. A second explanation for the BoE\u2019s policy inaction yesterday is that it still wants to have its cake and eat it \u2013 i.e. effectively generate a some degree of tightening without actually changing rates. One remarkable element of Vlieghe\u2019s speech is his positive spin on what is still a significant disappointment in the wage data ... The odds of a November hike have increased significantly, but there are still some hurdles that the data must clear first. As the Bank of England prepares to push the button on the first interest rate rise since July 2007, homeowners are facing the prospect of an increase in mortgage repayments. But what would the effects be of a rate rise for the average household? Read a handy piece on the subject from my colleague Shane Hickey here. Having touched $1.36 at one point, the pound is currently trading at $1.3584, up 1.4% or almost two cents on the day. Not everyone is convinced by Gertjan Vlieghe\u2019s arguments for why the time is approaching for a rate hike. One of the reasons he gave was the potential for a pick-up in wage growth in the coming months. Bank of England policymaker, Gertjan Vlieghe, has given the pound a further boost during a question and answer session after his speech in London. He said rates would need to rise more than once if the economy develops as expected. That contradicts the idea that for the time being, the Bank\u2019s MPC would be satisfied with a single rate rise, to 0.5% from 0.25%, essentially unwinding their emergency rate cut in August 2016 in response to the Brexit vote. Vlieghe: It\u2019s obviously more than unwinding last August. We are making that judgement over a three-year period, so it will depend on how the data evolves. The pound keeps on rising. It is now up 1.4% at $1.3585, the highest level since 24 June 2016, the day after the EU referendum when the Brexit vote became clear. The pound is at the highest level since the days immediately following the Brexit vote: Sterling is also at a two month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1344 (up 0.9% on the day). The pound\u2019s gain is the FTSE 100 loss. The leading index of UK shares is now down almost 1% or 67 points at 7,227. Markets elsewhere in Europe are roughly flat, but the FTSE is often dragged lower by a stronger pound because companies included in the index tend to be multinationals with a large proportion of earnings taken in countries outside the UK. David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, has this take: The FTSE 100 is the worst performer in Europe thanks to the strong pound again. The British market started off in the red today because of the more hawkish than expected update from the Bank of England yesterday, and the speech from Gertjan Vlieghe, a short time ago, accelerated the move. Mr Vlieghe also hinted at a tighter monetary policy, which pushed the pound higher, and drove the FTSE 100 lower. The FTSE 100 has dropped to its lowest level in over four months, and it is also trading below its 200-day moving average \u2013 which is widely viewed as bearish. The pound has surged 1.1% against the dollar at $1.3543. It is the first time above $1.35 since 27 June 2016, days after the Brexit vote. Those comments from the Bank of England\u2019s MPC member, Gertjan Vlieghe, have convinced traders that the first UK rate rise since June 2007 is coming in November. The MPC had already signalled on Thursday (alongside its policy decision) that it was nearing the time to raise rates, and Vlieghe\u2019s speech has added weight to that. MPC members tend to use speeches as opportunities to clarify the committee\u2019s latest thinking, and signal any shift in policy stance. Here are Vlieghe\u2019s key quotes: Until recently, I thought the appropriate response of monetary policy was to be patient, given modest growth and subdued underlying inflationary pressure. But the evolution of the data is increasingly suggesting that we are approaching the moment when bank rate may need to rise. He said a rise could come \u201cas early as in the coming months\u201d. Rates are currently at an all-time low of 0.25%. Here is our full story on the speech: Gertjan Vlieghe, an external member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, has given the strongest signal yet that interest rates could rise as soon as November. Having voted to hold rates at 0.25% at the August meeting on Thursday, Vlieghe said in a speech in London that rates could rise \u201cas early as in the coming months\u201d. The pound is up 0.8% above $1.35. More soon. Tim Martin, the founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon says companies in the EU will suffer more from Brexit than the pub group will. Martin was a vocal supporter of Brexit, and in his latest comments on the subject alongside Wetherspoon\u2019s annual results, he said EU leaders need to take a \u201cwise-up pill\u201d to grasp the reality of the situation. Most plcs are expected to comment, in their results statements, on the UK\u2019s prospects outside of the EU and on the likely impact on their individual companies. It is my view that the main risk from the current Brexit negotiations is not to Wetherspoon, but to our excellent EU suppliers \u2013 and to EU economies. It is my view that Juncker, Barnier, Selmayr, Verhofstadt and others need to take a wise-up pill in order to avoid causing further economic damage to struggling economies like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy - where youth unemployment, in particular, is at epidemic levels. Wetherspoon also cautioned that the strong start to its new financial year could not be sustained. Read our full story on Martin\u2019s comments and on the results here: European markets are down this morning as another missile launch by North Korea unnerved investors. Having said that, the scale of the losses are modest, suggesting a muted response as markets become more accustomed to escalating events in Pyongyang. FTSE 100: -0.4% at 7,269 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.03% at 12,537 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,221 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.1% at 22,250 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.5% at 10,312 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.2% at 381 Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, has changed his forecast for the timing of the first UK rate rise, following the Bank of England\u2019s hints on Thursday. He now expects the Bank\u2019s MPC to raise rates to 0.5% (from 0.25%) in November, to coincide with the next quarterly inflation report. Previously he was expecting the first hike to come in mid-2018. Clarke says that a rise of 0.25 points would not necessarily be the first of many. Rather, it would unwind the 0.25 point cut from August last year, when the MPC was fearful the Brexit vote would deliver an immediate shock to the economy. We doubt it would be the first of several hikes. Our judgement is that the MPC will use the current backdrop as an opportunity to take back last August\u2019s emergency rate hike now that there is no longer an emergency. We have our doubts that the data will stay sufficiently robust to provoke another hike at the subsequent inflation report meeting in February. Rather, we suspect the committee will await the crucial start of year wage inflation numbers before delivering a second hike at the May-2018 meeting. The pound is currently up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3442. That is the highest since 7 September 2016. Against the euro, the pound is up 0.2% at \u20ac1.1262 - the highest since July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has held on above $1.34 this morning, its highest level in more than a year, after the Bank of England hinted on Thursday that a rise in interest rates might be coming sooner than people think. The hints - which came as the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee held rates at all-time low of 0.25% - prompted some investors and economists to predict a rate rise as soon as November. It would be the first rise in interest rates since July 2007, when the world was blissfully unaware of the massive financial crisis ahead. Also coming up today: At 9.50am, MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe will give a speech at the Society of Business Economists conference in London. Investors and economists will be looking for more clues on whether a rate rise in November is to be expected. MPC speeches are often used by the Bank to clarify messages on what the latest thinking is on policy and often move markets. At 13.30, US retail sales data for August will be published. Investors will be looking for signs of an impact from Hurricane Harvey, and for clues as to whether it makes another rate hike this year from the Federal Reserve more or less likely.",

Though this week\u2019s data saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/13/uk-wage-inflation-jobless-rate-unemployment\">unemployment hit a 42-year low of 4.3%, wage growth remains anchored at just above 2%</a>.

For one, there is unlikely to be a material improvement in the growth outlook for some time to come. And the potential downside risks from Brexit will continue to loom large for the foreseeable future, even if Theresa May adopts a more conciliatory tone in next Friday\u2019s speech.

However, an important question is why the BoE didn\u2019t raise rates in September \u2013 without even a tightening in the vote \u2013 if so many of the MPC see such a clear case for raising rates. We see two potential answers to this question:</p> <p>One is the BoE\u2019s communications have previously failed to prepare the market for an imminent rate rise. The BoE may well have been shocked by the market\u2019s dovish reaction to its August Inflation Report, where it essentially warned the curve was too flat \u2013 only to then witness a further flattening. As we have argued, this reaction has made the BoE more agitated, the consequences of which we are now witnessing. Now the market is better prepared for a rate rise, the BoE may feel that it has the green light to deliver in November.</p> <p>A second explanation for the BoE\u2019s policy inaction yesterday is that it still wants to have its cake and eat it \u2013 i.e. effectively generate a some degree of tightening without actually changing rates. </p> <p>One remarkable element of Vlieghe\u2019s speech is his positive spin on what is still a significant disappointment in the wage data ... The odds of a November hike have increased significantly, but there are still some hurdles that the data must clear first. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bbb118e4b08ea005590863\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-15T11:03:13.761Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the Bank of England prepares to push the button on the first interest rate rise since July 2007, homeowners are facing the prospect of an increase in mortgage repayments.</p> <p>But what would the effects be of a rate rise for the average household? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/08/mortgage-rates-rise-borrowing-costs-bills\">Read a handy piece on the subject from my colleague Shane Hickey here.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bbb075e4b08ea00559085e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-15T10:52:32.489Z\">11.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Having touched $1.36 at one point, the pound is currently trading at $1.3584, up 1.4% or almost two cents on the day.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bba2dae4b08ea005590820\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-15T10:28:16.676Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Not everyone is convinced by Gertjan Vlieghe\u2019s arguments for why the time is approaching for a rate hike. </strong></p> <p>One of the reasons he gave was the potential for a pick-up in wage growth in the coming months.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/908620953780936705\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s a chart of annualised m/m% growth in priv. sec. pay that Vlieghe uses to support his hawkish turn.

      "bodyText": "A member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee has fuelled speculation that interest rates could rise as soon as November. Gertjan Vlieghe put forward the arguments for a rise in rates \u201cas early as in the coming months\u201d in a speech to economists in London. What would a rate rise mean for homeowners? It would mean higher monthly bills for millions of people with variable rate and base rate tracker mortgages. If and when it happens, it would be the first rise in borrowing costs for a decade \u2013many of these people have never seen their monthly repayments increase. Those on fixed-rate mortgage deals would be protected from any increase, but only until the end of their deal\u2019s fixed term. How much higher? The cost of an interest hike will vary per household, depending on the terms of the mortgage, how long it is taken out for, and other factors. The average UK standard variable mortgage rate (SVR) is 4.6%, according to financial data provider Moneyfacts. Someone on that rate with a \u00a3200,000 outstanding mortgage balance and 25 years remaining would pay \u00a328.72 a month extra (a payment of \u00a31,151.77, up from \u00a31,123.05) if the rate goes up by 0.25%, assuming it is on a repayment basis. If there were a series of rate increases, and the rate was to go up by a total of one percentage point (ie, four lots of 0.25%), the extra cost would be \u00a3117.10 a month, or more than \u00a31,400 a year. So what should those with mortgages do? Those on a variable rate should ensure they have a buffer in place so they can cope with an increase to their rate. With fixed-rate mortgage deals the cheapest they have ever been, many would say now is the time to think about remortgaging for a fixed deal, or opting for one of these if you are looking at buying a property. For example, Yorkshire building society has a two-year fix priced at 0.99% until the end of November 2019, for those borrowing no more than 60% of their property\u2019s value. It is deals such as this that may help explain why, as the banking industry trade body UK Finance said this week, the number of people remortgaging is at its highest since 2009. Fixed-rate mortgage deals are a type of product where, arguably, the old \u201cbuy now while stocks last\u201d salesman\u2019s spiel does apply, because talk of interest rate rises is often followed by lenders repricing their fixed deals upwards. What about savers? Savers have suffered years of rockbottom interest rates, and millions will be cheered by news of a likely rise. It is traditionally said that savers outnumber borrowers by around seven to one, and many banks will be keen to be seen to be passing on the full rate rise to these people. The average easy access savings account now pays just 0.4% interest. Two years ago the figure was 0.66%, and five years ago it was 1%. Last month it emerged that cash Isa savings accounts had collapsed in popularity, with a \u00a320bn fall in the amount invested in the space of 12 months \u2013 a fall partly blamed on continuing low interest rates. However, it has not all been bleak in the world of savings. An influx of challenger banks, such as Atom Bank and Wyelands Bank, has resulted in intense competition in the fixed-rate savings bonds market. There are five-year bonds on the market paying 2.5% or more, which is 10 times the current Bank of England base rate.",

In a letter to Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, Alison Brittain, Unite said that the company\u2019s \u201ccommitments and obligations\u201d on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining \u201care not currently being met in any practical sense\u201d. It said: \u201cUnite had high hopes that Whitbread\u2019s membership of the ETI would open the doors to better working conditions and improved union relations in the notoriously anti-union and exploitative UK hospitality industry as the ETI base code, which is founded on the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, includes the right to freedom of association and to bargain collectively. \u201cBut our attempts at meaningful negotiation with the company were ignored. We had sought to secure a union access agreement which would have allowed union officials to meet with workers to the benefits of trade union membership and the company\u2019s own human rights policy.\u201d Whitbread said it was \u201ca leader in responsible sourcing within the hospitality industry\u201d and remained \u201c100% committed to ensuring ethical and sustainable practice across our global supply chain\u201d. \u201cSince we joined the ETI in 2016, we have been subject to false allegations from Unite about our employment practices, specifically around our policy towards union membership, and Unite allege that we do not comply with the ETI base code. This is untrue and the ETI have confirmed that we met our obligations as a foundation stage member,\u201d the company said. Peter McAllister, the executive director of the ETI, said: \u201cLike any new member there is a period where we work through what our expectations are and the company\u2019s priorities, based on supply chain needs and tackling relevant issues. We therefore regret that Whitbread chose to leave ETI so soon after joining. \u201cWe will continue to try to find ways of working with leading companies and unions to support ethical conditions for vulnerable workers in the UK hospitality sector.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The chairman of JD Wetherspoon has warned that the pub chain could be forced to switch to suppliers from outside the EU as a result of Brexit and that the strong start to its new financial year could not be sustained. Urging EU leaders to take a \u201cwise-up pill\u201d, Tim Martin said any move to switch suppliers would not have adverse effects on the UK but be \u201chighly damaging to the economy of the EU\u201d. Martin was an active supporter of the Brexit campaign in the run-up to last year\u2019s referendum and used the chain\u2019s full-year results to offer his latest views on the impact of the UK\u2019s exit from the bloc. \u201cMost plcs are expected to comment, in their results statements, on the UK\u2019s prospects outside of the EU and on the likely impact on their individual companies. It is my view that the main risk from the current Brexit negotiations is not to Wetherspoon, but to our excellent EU suppliers \u2013 and to EU economies,\u201d said Martin, who owns 30% of the company. He hit out against the \u201cunelected oligarchs\u201d with which the UK must negotiate its departure from the EU and said their posturing was encouraging importers such as Wetherspoon to look for alternative suppliers. The chain started out with one pub in Muswell Hill, north London, in 1979 and now has nearly 1,000 outlets. Martin has previously criticised the EU and last year had said he would stop selling drinks brands from other European countries if senior EU leaders maintained a \u201cbullying\u201d approach to Brexit negotiations. In his latest warning, he said any change in suppliers was \u201cunlikely to have adverse effects on the UK economy, as companies will be able to switch to suppliers representing the 93% of the world\u2019s population which is not in the EU, but this evolution will eventually be highly damaging to the economy of the EU\u201d. \u201cWetherspoon is extremely confident that it can switch from EU suppliers, if required, although we would be very reluctant to initiate such actions,\u201d said Martin. He added that EU leaders needed to take a \u201cwise-up pill in order to avoid causing further economic damage to struggling economies like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy \u2013 where youth unemployment, in particular, is at epidemic levels\u201d. \u201cThere seems to be little genuine appetite for a free trade deal from the Brussels bureaucracy, so EU companies are, paradoxically, reliant on the goodwill of UK consumers, who are likely to prefer tariff-free goods in the future from non-EU countries, which are generally in favour of free trade, rather than deals with companies which are subject to the diktat of those who wish to punish the UK,\u201d said Martin. Wetherspoon\u2019s full-year pre-tax profits rose from \u00a380.6m to \u00a3102.8m and Martin said that since the end of the financial year on 30 July, sales had increased by 6.1%. This could not be sustained, he said. \u201cThis is a positive start, but is for a few weeks only \u2013 and is very unlikely to continue for the rest of the year. Comparisons will become more stretching \u2013 and sales, which were very strong in the summer holidays, are likely to return to more modest levels,\u201d he said. To match last year\u2019s profits, sales would need to rise by 3-4%, he said. \u201cWe will provide updates as we progress through the year. We currently anticipate a trading outcome for the current financial year in line with our expectations,\u201d said Martin. JD Wetherspoon shares rose by 7% in early trading.",

      "bodyText": "Qantas boss Alan Joyce has flown close to the top of the Australian executive pay league after nearly doubling his remuneration in the past financial year. Joyce earned a total pay package of $24.6m in the 2016-17 year, the company\u2019s annual report showed on Friday, nearly twice as much as the $12.96m he pocketed in the previous 12 months. Joyce\u2019s huge pay bump reflected a big rise in the company\u2019s share price in the past financial year, the report said, which drove a big increase in the value of his performance-based incentives to $18.5m from $3.16m. His base pay was frozen at $2.1m, while his cash bonus was less than the previous year\u2019s at almost $1.8m, thanks to slightly lower company profits. The balance of the package included nearly $2m in short-term incentives. Leigh Clifford, the company\u2019s chairman, defended the pay award which he said was based on the airline\u2019s \u201cremarkable\u201d turnaround from a $2.8bn loss in 2014 to record profits. \u201cThere is no question that these pay outcomes are high,\u201d Clifford said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s because they reflect the company\u2019s exceptional performance, including our top ranking for total shareholder return among global airline peers and every company on the ASX100.\u201d Clifford said the share price had more than quadrupled in the past three years and the value of executive bonuses, which are mostly paid in Qantas shares, had risen accordingly. Shares that were worth $1.26 when they were awarded in 2014 as part of a three-year-long term incentive plan are now being paid out at $5.72. Three years ago Qantas made a loss of $2.84bn thanks to a bruising battle with Virgin and oil prices well over $100 a barrel. But painful restructuring involving thousands of redundancies and a halving of the price of fuel has seen the carrier transformed, recording its second-highest profit ever in the 2016-17 year. Joyce, who will now vie with the Lowy brothers at Westfield and Macquarie boss Nicholas Moore to be the highest paid executive in a public company, said the restructuring had \u201ccertainly paid off\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is at loggerheads with MPs after refusing to publish a report it commissioned into the way Royal Bank of Scotland treated small business customers. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, has told MPs on the Treasury select committee that publication of information in the report could be a criminal offence under the Financial Services and Marketing Act. In a letter to Nicky Morgan, the conservative MP who chairs the committee, Bailey said publishing the report could also undermine the regulators\u2019 ability to supervise firms because reviews are conducted on the basis that they will remain private. That promise of privacy, he said, meant firms don\u2019t try to withhold information and the watchdog doesn\u2019t have to use its legal powers to force its release. \u201cI am very keen that this situation should continue and that it would not be in the public interest to limit the effectiveness of this process,\u201d Bailey said. The FCA told the bank, which is 70% owned by the taxpayer, to commission the report after allegations were made about the way its business restructuring unit \u2013 the global restructuring group (GRG) \u2013 treated small business customers. Instead of helping to turn them around, businesses said they had been weighed down by debt and fees. Morgan wrote to Bailey to ask for the report, which was completed last year, to be published after it was leaked to the BBC earlier this month. She said the leak strengthened calls for it to be published in full, rather than just the detailed summary the FCA had previously promised to release. \u201cThe report is now in the hands of an unknown number of third parties. If closure is ever to be brought to this long-running issue, parliament and the public need the account ordered by the regulator \u2026 we consider that the public interest in publication in this specific case is overwhelming.\u201d she said. The committee has the power to demand the report, which it could then publish, but it has not resorted to this. RBS attempted to draw a line under the long-running dispute with small businesses last year by putting aside \u00a3400m to pay compensation. This has not, however, dimmed the anger of some of the business who have been complaining for years about GRG\u2019s treatment. Bailey and colleagues will be called next month to give evidence to the new committee, which held its first meeting since the general election on Thursday. They will face questions about the GRG report. A leak inquiry is under way and Bailey said the FCA had asked RBS, the consultancy Promontory Financial Group, which was commissioned to do the report and the accountancy firm Mazars which wrote it, to do the same. Bailey said a detailed summary of the report, known as section 116, will be published and that the FCA has appointed outside lawyers to analyse it. Approval from RBS and Promontory is needed to publish. He hopes to avoid Maxwellisation, the process by which individuals named in reports have an opportunity to comment on any criticism.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Public-interest litigation has been filed in Delhi\u2019s top court asking for a special investigation into claims the Adani Group and other energy companies inflated coal and equipment prices to siphon money from India. In August the Guardian revealed details of a massive fraud investigation into the Adani Group, an Indian conglomerate preparing to build one of the world\u2019s largest coal mines in Australia. According to Indian customs intelligence documents from 2014, the Adani Group was accused of inflating the cost of electricity equipment for two power projects in Maharashtra state using fraudulent invoices. Authorities valued the alleged scam at nearly 15bn rupees (\u00a3177m). Read the pdf here. The Adani Group has been cleared on similar allegations in a separate fraud case that had been valued at about 39bn rupees. The alleged 15bn-rupee scam is still awaiting judgment and Adani has fully denied any wrongdoing. A public interest lawsuit filed this week asked the Delhi high court to order a \u201cthorough\u201d probe into the over-invoicing allegations against the Adani Group and other energy and mining companies. The writ alleges the Adani Group, the Indian company Essar, and several others inflated the price of power equipment and coal \u201cin order to cheat the people and to siphon off funds from public companies\u201d. Subsidiaries of Essar and the Adani Group are among 40 companies who have been accused of using front organisations to increase the price of coal they mined from Indonesia. The total value of the alleged scam has been estimated at 290bn rupees. If the allegations are true, the price inflation would have allowed the companies to move money from their Indian balance sheets into overseas accounts, where the funds would be harder to tax or account for. It would have also led to higher power prices for Indians. The lawsuit accuses the companies of \u201ccheating the shareholders and the tax authorities, in addition to cheating the consumers\u201d. Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan and two Indian legal centres have drafted and funded the litigation, which will now be reviewed by the court. The petition criticised the \u201cshocking\u201d decision by India\u2019s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismiss the complaint against the Adani Group in the 39bn-rupee fraud case. It accused the agency of dealing with crucial evidence \u201cin a casual manner\u201d and said the timing of the decision \u2013 more than three years after the allegations were first levelled, and days after the Guardian\u2019s story \u2013 was \u201cvery curious\u201d. Congress, India\u2019s largest opposition party, has also publicly called for the court to investigate the allegations of invoice inflation against the Adani Group. News of the investigation led to calls in Australia for the Adani Group to be denied a $700m loan to build a railway link between the proposed coal mine and a port on the Queensland coast. The proposed Queensland mine, which would be Australia\u2019s largest, has been the source of years of controversy, lawsuits and protests over its possible environmental impact. Expanding the coal port to accommodate the mine will require dredging an estimated 1.1m cubic metres of spoil near the Great Barrier Reef marine park. Coal from the mine will also produce annual emissions equivalent to those of Malaysia or Austria according to one study. A spokesman for Essar said: \u201cWe strongly and categorically deny the allegation. The company is cooperating with the agency and has already provided necessary clarification.\u201d A spokesman for the Adani Group said that as a listed corporation operating across the world, it observed the highest forms of corporate governance. He said this latest claim was part of a \u201cmindless unsubstantiated witch-hunt\u201d. This story was amended on 15 September. It previously said the writ was filed in India\u2019s supreme court. It was filed in the Delhi high court.",
