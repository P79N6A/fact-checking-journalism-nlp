      "bodyText": "The boss of Royal Bank of Scotland was racing to reassure staff that there would be \"no big announcement\" on job cuts when he announces his strategy for the 81%-taxpayer-owned bank on Thursday. Ross McEwan, who took the helm in October after Stephen Hester quit, is preparing to announce a further refocusing of the once global bank on the UK's high streets, big corporates and small companies. But trade union officials said they were concerned about suggestions that another 30,000 roles were on the line after a similar number had been cut from the workforce since the 2008 bailout. \"Ross McEwan has now told staff that there will be no big announcement on jobs next week,\" said Unite national officer Rob MacGregor. He added: \"According to the CEO, next week's results will be about explaining the bank's ambition to become a great bank for customers.

The shares are still below the 502p average price the taxpayer paid for its stake in the bank in 2008 and 2009 \u2013 a loss of about \u00a313bn. In a note to staff, McEwan warned that speculation about job cuts was to be expected ahead of Thursday's official announcement. \"This type of thing is frustrating and unsettling.

    "webTitle": "Britain's bank bosses to get millions in share payments in bonus cap dodge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The bosses of Britain's biggest banks are on course to be awarded millions of pounds in share payments to circumvent a Brussels-imposed bonus cap \u2013 a move that risks inflaming the toxic row over City pay deals. The new payments would be in addition to bank leaders' basic pay because the EU is limiting bonuses to 100% of salaries \u2013 or 200% if shareholders approve larger payments. The big-four high street banks are consulting shareholders about bonuses for chief executives that hit the 200% limit, alongside discussions on additional share payments so that none of the elite boardroom-level bankers would be worse off as a result of the cap. The initiative threatens to bring further political and public scorn on an industry that suffered yet another reputational blow this month when Barclays increased its bonuses to staff by 10% to \u00a32.4bn, despite reporting a 32% fall in profits. The attempt to outflank pay limits comes as thousands of bank employees face the threat of redundancy. Britain's biggest bank, HSBC, will on Monday become the first high street player to reveal the full details of how it has paid its 200,000 staff by publishing a 500-page annual report which contains the precise sums paid to its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, and other top executives. HSBC is expected to outline its approach to the bonus cap amid speculation that Gulliver stands to receive share awards on top of his \u00a31.2m salary. His counterpart at Barclays, Antony Jenkins, and fellow chief executives at bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, and Royal Bank of Scotland, Ross McEwan, are also likely to receive parcels of shares alongside their salaries in the coming months. The details are still being hammered out with shareholders but it is thought the bankers will need to hold on to the shares for at least three years \u2013 or five in the case of Barclays \u2013 before they can be sold. The plans will be put to investors at annual general meetings in the spring. Among ideas being discussed are monthly or quarterly payments in shares, although investors are expected to demand that the total earning capacity of top bankers will be reduced in return for the additional payments. Bonuses for 2013 are not affected by the cap and RBS is next week expected to pay out bonuses of about \u00a3500m despite reporting losses of \u00a38bn and a huge restructuring of its operations which are 81% owned by the taxpayer. The bonus cap is forcing radical revisions to the way pay deals are structured, moving away from the complex three-pronged structure of salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive plans to schemes that are expected to comprise salaries, share allowances and bonuses. Under their current pay deals, bank bosses have the potential to earn as much as 700% of their salaries in bonuses and their employers have been scrambling to find ways to keep their potential pay deals at such levels following the introduction of the cap on 1 January this year. The government is opposed to the bonus limit and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has said he does not back a \"crude bonus cap\". Andrew Bailey, the head of the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, has warned it could lead to a \u00a3500m rise in fixed salary costs at the big banks. The share awards are an alternative to straightforward rises in salaries but could face scrutiny by the European Banking Authority which is creating the guidelines for how the new regime will operate, when it comes into effect for bonuses paid in a year's time. A review is expected in the second half of 2014. The restrictions on bonuses affect individuals who are regarded as taking and managing risks and, according to the EBA, anyone who earns more than \u20ac750,000 (\u00a3620,000) a year could be included. Barclays has told those staff affected by the cap that they will receive these payments, called role-based allowances, each month alongside their salaries. HSBC, which has previously admitted it might increase salaries, is expected to make quarterly payments of shares to 1,000 of its top staff. On Monday, HSBC bank is also expected to reveal how many of its staff were paid more than \u00a31m \u2013 204 received that sum in 2012. None of the banks would comment.",

The plans will be put to investors at annual general meetings in the spring.</p> <p>Among ideas being discussed are monthly or quarterly payments in shares, although investors are expected to demand that the total earning capacity of top bankers will be reduced in return for the additional payments.</p> <p>Bonuses for 2013 are not affected by the cap and RBS is next week expected to pay out bonuses of about \u00a3500m despite reporting losses of \u00a38bn and a huge restructuring of its operations which are 81% owned by the taxpayer.</p> <p>The bonus cap is forcing radical revisions to the way pay deals are structured, moving away from the complex three-pronged structure of salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive plans to schemes that are expected to comprise salaries, share allowances and bonuses.</p> <p>Under their current pay deals, bank bosses have the potential to earn as much as 700% of their salaries in bonuses and their employers have been scrambling to find ways to keep their potential pay deals at such levels following the introduction of the cap on 1 January this year.</p> <p>The government is opposed to the bonus limit and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/15/world-bank-raises-global-growth-forecast-but-sees-emerging-market-risks-business-live\" title=\"\">he does not back a \"crude bonus cap\"</a>. Andrew Bailey, the head of the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority, has warned it could lead to a \u00a3500m rise in fixed salary costs at the big banks.</p> <p>The share awards are an alternative to straightforward rises in salaries but could face scrutiny by the European Banking Authority which is creating the guidelines for how the new regime will operate, when it comes into effect for bonuses paid in a year's time. A review is expected in the second half of 2014.</p> <p>The restrictions on bonuses affect individuals who are regarded as taking and managing risks and, according to the EBA, anyone <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/europe-banking-regulator-relaxes-bonus-cap\" title=\"\">who earns more than \u20ac750,000 (\u00a3620,000) a year</a> could be included.</p> <p>Barclays has told those staff affected by the cap that they will receive these payments, called role-based allowances, each month alongside their salaries. HSBC, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/05/hsbc-pay-rises-bonus-cap\" title=\"\">which has previously admitted it might increase salaries</a>, is expected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/07/hsbc-staff-shares-bypass-eu-rules-bankers-bonuses\" title=\"\">to make quarterly payments of shares to 1,000 of its top staff</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, HSBC bank is also expected to reveal how many of its staff were paid more than \u00a31m \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/04/hsbc-pay-top-earners\" title=\"\">204 received that sum in 2012</a>.</p> <p>None of the banks would comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tesco boss Philip Clarke is expected to signal next week that the scale of the investment needed to win back disaffected UK shoppers will mean sacrificing the industry-leading levels of profitability that once made the supermarket chain one of Britain's most admired companies. Clarke will update investors and analysts about his turnaround plan on Tuesday. Tesco performed poorly over Christmas and, based on recent market data, has suffered a further deterioration since. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne expects Clarke to use the platform to formally abandon the company's profit margin target of 5.2% \u2013 the highest in the industry \u2013 because it has become a \"straitjacket\" for the retailer which is being squeezed as shoppers either trade up to Waitrose or bargain hunt at Aldi and Lidl. Monteyne said Clarke's strategy was vague and estimated Tesco was still 5% to 6% more expensive than Asda on branded products. Clarke had hinted last month that the profits target could be canned. Many analysts already take that decision as a given; City profit forecasts have been revised downwards with trading profits of \u00a33.3bn predicted for this year compared with \u00a33.5bn in 2012-13. Monteyne said Tuesday's meeting would be used to \"reset\" profit expectations. \"It is definitely a profit reset but, as the company has guided down investor expectations, it is hardly a profit warning,\" he said. He expected Clarke to say Tesco will \"follow the customer and the margins will be what they will be\". After three years at the helm of the UK's largest grocer, Clarke has yet to stop the rot. The UK chain generates the lion's share of the grocer's profits \u2013 \u00a32.3bn last year. Like other grocers, its biggest stores have become millstones as customers increasingly shop on the internet and at local convenience stores. To that end, he has been trying to make Tesco's sprawling Extra stores more attractive by introducing restaurants \u2013 it bought the Giraffe chain for \u00a349m in 2013 \u2013 as well as soft-play areas and even nail bars. \"Tesco is all about the UK,\" said Clive Black, a Shore Capital analyst. \"If it doesn't have a stable position in the UK, it doesn't matter what the rest of the business does. We are very worried about trading momentum in the UK.\" He pointed to recent market data suggesting a decline of as much as 3%. \"We don't think we are at the end of the [profit] downgrade cycle yet.\" The most recent data published by Kantar Wordpanel showed Tesco, Asda and Morrisons all losing ground in a market that recorded its lowest growth for nearly a decade in the 12 weeks to 2 February. While the big supermarkets are struggling to hold on to shoppers, Aldi and Lidl are storming ahead as Britons, squeezed by below-inflation pay rises, continue to shop around to save money. The data showed Tesco on a market share of 29.2% compared with 30% a year ago. Investors are also eager for reassurance that Clarke has a handle on Tesco's sprawling international operation. The wheels have come off in a number of countries, including Turkey, where there have been reports of talks with a potential joint venture partner, Migros. Last year Tesco struck a similar deal in China, putting its stores into a joint venture with the state-backed China Resources Enterprise. Clarke has already pulled the plug on stores in the US and Japan.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The founding father of the national minimum wage has said the system is no longer fit for purpose and must change in order to tackle Britain's low pay problem. Professor Sir George Bain chaired the low pay commission (LPC) when the minimum wage was introduced 15 years ago. For it to last another 15 years it urgently needs updating to tackle new issues in the labour market, he said on Friday. \"The minimum wage has been a clear success but the world has changed in the 15 years since it was introduced. We now know the policy has not caused unemployment, and there is broad political support. But with more than one in five workers in Britain suffering from low pay, it's time to talk about how we strengthen the minimum wage for the years ahead,\" he said. Bain is chairing a review at the Resolution Foundation thinktank of how the minimum wage and the role of the commission that sets it might be strengthened. Politicians from all parties are promising to help people who have been squeezed by pay levels that are failing to cover rising food and fuel bills. George Osborne has suggested that the minimum wage could rise from \u00a36.31 per hour to \u00a37, as the LPC prepares to make its recommendation for the new minimum wage level in the spring. An interim report from the Resolution Foundation on Friday said the policy has had many strengths and lifted many workers out of extreme low pay. However, many employees are starting work on the minimum wage and failing to secure pay rises for years after, as it has become the going rate in some sectors. There are also a large number of workers who are earning barely more than minimum wage because a \"ripple effect\" has failed to transpire, the thinktank's report says. About 1.2 million workers are paid the minimum wage and a further 1.4 million workers earn no more than 50p more. The Resolution Foundation says 5 million workers remain low-paid based on the definition of earning below two-thirds of the typical hourly wage \u2013 which currently means someone earning less than \u00a37.71 is low paid. It sets out possible reforms to the minimum wage and to the LPC's remit for Bain to consider ahead of his final recommendations next month. One suggestion is to broaden the government's work on low pay beyond the minimum wage by setting an explicit ambition to reduce the proportion of workers who are low paid. It also suggests setting the ambition for the level of the minimum wage over a medium-term horizon, compared with the current short-term system of unveiling the latest rate each year in spring and introducing it in the autumn. The commission may also benefit from powers to pressure some employers to go beyond the national minimum when they can afford to, the report added. Bain said: \"Reform of the minimum wage will be hard to get right \u2013 it would be easy to damage a policy that works well. But our discussions suggest there are ways to take a more assertive and ambitious approach while still keeping the flexibility of the current system.\"",

      "body": "<p>The Federal Reserve on Friday <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2008.htm\">released transcripts</a> of the meetings it held in 2008 as the central bank tackled the worst financial crisis in living memory and the US teetered on the edge of another Great Depression.<br></p> <p>The transcripts of 14 scheduled and emergency policy meetings the Fed held cover only official meetings and not the countless telephone calls and unofficial gatherings of senior policy officials and financiers held during the crisis. </p> <p>They give some of the clearest insight yet into how officials tackled the crisis. They also shine more light on the record and personality of Janet Yellen, then chair of the San Francisco Fed and now the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, showing glimpses of humor.</p> <p>Yellen has a reputation for calling the recession ahead of her peers \u2013 one that is borne out in the Fed\u2019s documents. In a January 21 meeting she said \u201cthe risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high, and it is being clearly priced now into not only domestic but also global markets.\u201d</p> <p>On September 16, the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, Yellen showed her lighter side as she gave evidence of an economic slowdown in San Francisco. \u201cEast Bay plastic surgeons and dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures,\u201d she said to laughter. </p> <p>\u201cReservations are no longer necessary at many high-end restaurants. And the Silicon Valley country club, with a $250,000 entrance fee and seven- to eight-year waiting list, has seen the number of would-be new members shrink to a mere 13,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSales of cheap wine are soaring,\u201d Yellen reported to the Fed on March 8, a week before Bear Stearns collapsed.</p> <p>What is consistent in the transcripts is that the Fed appeared to be struggling to grasp the magnitude of the crisis that was unfolding. On 21 January 2008 \u2013 well before Bear Stearns and Lehman fell into trouble \u2013 Fed chairman Ben Bernanke admitted it had already misread the burgeoning financial crisis. \u201cWe were seriously behind the curve in terms of economic growth and the financial situation,\u201d Bernanke told his fellow economists. Two months later, Bear Stearns was near to collapse and was forced to sell itself to JP Morgan in a government-brokered deal. </p> <p>By March, Bernanke had concluded that significant action had to be taken. \u201cWe live in a very special time,\u201d the Fed chairman told colleagues on a 10 March conference call.

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve on Friday released transcripts of the meetings it held in 2008 as the central bank tackled the worst financial crisis in living memory and the US teetered on the edge of another Great Depression. The transcripts of 14 scheduled and emergency policy meetings the Fed held cover only official meetings and not the countless telephone calls and unofficial gatherings of senior policy officials and financiers held during the crisis. They give some of the clearest insight yet into how officials tackled the crisis. They also shine more light on the record and personality of Janet Yellen, then chair of the San Francisco Fed and now the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, showing glimpses of humor. Yellen has a reputation for calling the recession ahead of her peers \u2013 one that is borne out in the Fed\u2019s documents. In a January 21 meeting she said \u201cthe risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high, and it is being clearly priced now into not only domestic but also global markets.\u201d On September 16, the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, Yellen showed her lighter side as she gave evidence of an economic slowdown in San Francisco. \u201cEast Bay plastic surgeons and dentists note that patients are deferring elective procedures,\u201d she said to laughter. \u201cReservations are no longer necessary at many high-end restaurants. And the Silicon Valley country club, with a $250,000 entrance fee and seven- to eight-year waiting list, has seen the number of would-be new members shrink to a mere 13,\u201d she said. \u201cSales of cheap wine are soaring,\u201d Yellen reported to the Fed on March 8, a week before Bear Stearns collapsed. What is consistent in the transcripts is that the Fed appeared to be struggling to grasp the magnitude of the crisis that was unfolding. On 21 January 2008 \u2013 well before Bear Stearns and Lehman fell into trouble \u2013 Fed chairman Ben Bernanke admitted it had already misread the burgeoning financial crisis. \u201cWe were seriously behind the curve in terms of economic growth and the financial situation,\u201d Bernanke told his fellow economists. Two months later, Bear Stearns was near to collapse and was forced to sell itself to JP Morgan in a government-brokered deal. By March, Bernanke had concluded that significant action had to be taken. \u201cWe live in a very special time,\u201d the Fed chairman told colleagues on a 10 March conference call. Bernanke went on to press for the Fed to approve his plans to act as a backstop for Wall Street. By June, things had calmed down slightly, but a sense of menace lingered, particularly around Lehman Brothers, as Bernanke observed: \u201cWith respect to financial markets, I agree certainly that the crisis atmosphere that we saw in March has receded markedly, but I do not yet rule out the possibility of a systemic event. We saw in the inter-meeting period that we have considerable concerns about Lehman Brothers, for example.\u201d Another Fed official cited Lehman\u2019s shaky health after the fall of Bear Stearns and said \u201cthe announcements about Lehman Brothers over the last month highlight that we\u2019re not yet safe.\u201d Yet those concerns did not lead to action, and there is a sense from the conversations that Lehman had created its own problems, which the Fed felt no pressure to solve.

But we\u2019re not out of the woods yet. The global economic recovery is not yet sufficiently strong or broadly based to create enough jobs and to continue lifting people out of poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>While the International Monetary Fund calls for measures to boost growth, the OECD has issued a report on \u201cavoiding the low-growth trap\u201d.</p> <p>Here are some of the key lines - the<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/eco/goingforgrowth.htm\"> full version is available here</a>.<br></p> <p><b>Crisis-hit southern and central European countries have carried reforms, but these \u201cadjustments\u201d have had painful consequences.</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pace of reforms appears to have slowed somewhat but remains on average well above that observed prior to the crisis in most countries. Southern euro area and, to a lesser extent, Central European countries have continued to be particularly active reformers ... Importantly,considerable action has been taken in areas such as labour market regulation, collective bargaining and welfare systems, which in the past have proved particularly difficult to reform. Reforms of pension systems and early retirement schemes, as well as of active labour market programmes, have also ranked highly on the policy agenda in many other countries facing low employment rates.</p> <p>In the countries most severely affected by the crisis, long-overdue labour market reforms hadbecome necessary to restore competitiveness and help narrow external imbalances. However, given the particularly difficult context in which this adjustment has taken place, it has not been without painful consequences for many workers and their families. In order for them to see benefits in the form of improving job opportunities and higher real incomes, labour market reforms must be matched by more vigorous actions to boost product market competition.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Progress in boosting competition has been slow</b>\ufeff.</p> <blockquote> <p>One special feature of this report is to assess the progress countries have made in the past five years in reducing regulatory barriers to competition in product markets. While governments have continued to move towards more competition-friendly regulation, progress has, alas, been modest except for a few cases. In particular, competition in network industries and especially professional services continues to be held back by regulatory barriers to entry. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>China, Germany and Japan need to do more to reform services.</b></p> <blockquote> <p>Pursuing reform in services is all the more important given the high growth and employment potential of these sectors. This is particularly evident in OECD countries such as Germany, Japan \u2013 as part of Abenomics\u2019 third arrow \u2013 and beyond, not least in China. Services are also critical for a country\u2019s competitiveness within global value chains and create over half of value-added in cross-border trade. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>A recent global trade deal in Bali was a step forward, but could yet be undermined by a cats cradle of bilateral deals.</b></p> <blockquote> <p>In this regard, another policy area where ample scope for further progress remains is global trade liberalisation. Prime candidates for substantial gains include reducing the high tariffs on a range of products in emerging-market countries and removing barriers in services sectors and other sensitive areas such as agriculture and government procurement in advanced countries. The recent agreement on trade facilitation reached in Bali is a step in the right direction, and hopefully will give multilateral trade negotiations a new impetus, but its impact risks being undermined by the proliferation of various trade-distorting measures and covert barriers to foreign investment.</p> </blockquote> <p>An interesting footnote: the editorial is signed by<b> Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD\u2019s chief economist and man tipped to be Italy\u2019s next finance minister</b>.<br></p> <p><i>On that I am handing over the blog to Nick Fletcher.

He said that while oil production was only marginally down and prices were steady, Nigeria was nevertheless losing as much as $1bn a month. This was putting at risk the central bank\u2019s ability to defend the naira and shore up foreign reserves.</p> <p>The governor\u2019s allegations have infuriated Mr Jonathan and other members of the government, including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the finance and economy minister, who blame him for making his findings public instead of taking them to a government committee set up to establish where money was going missing.</p> <p>But Nigerian businessmen, analysts and even some government advisers raised alarm at the potential damage that removing the outspoken governor will do to investor confidence given the role he played in establishing Nigeria\u2019s credibility as a frontier market. Nigeria issued its first dollar-denominated bond in 2007 and tapped the market again last year, raising $1bn from international investors.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53075553e4b08a8c5c8a9f00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-21T13:35:07.535Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <b>Guardian\u2019s city editor Jill Treanor</b> on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/feb/21/uk-retail-sales-expected-to-fall-live#block-530714e5e4b07f1a00d4b2c5\">speculation of RBS jobs cuts (9.14am)</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/436848998193070080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Union Unite says that RBS CEO Ross McEwan has told staff today there will be no big job announcement next week</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/436848998193070080\">February 21, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/436849309389434880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>But Unite says seeking clarity on staffing levels at RBS as McEwan prepares to unveil strategy on Thursday</p>&mdash; Jill Treanor (@jilltreanor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jilltreanor/statuses/436849309389434880\">February 21, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-530746d2e4b0e1ed6f381a14\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-21T12:43:04.557Z\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>The UK is likely to hit its deficit targets for 2013-14</b>, according to financial watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Feb-2014-commentary.pdf\">OBR has just given its verdict</a> on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/feb/21/uk-retail-sales-expected-to-fall-live#block-53072955e4b07f1a00d4b2f4\">the latest government borrowing figures (see 10.30)</a>.

This has resulted in a growth in sales, which was further helped by the absence of snow which knocked retailers in early 2013. </p> <p>Looking ahead at the next few months, I expect the outlook to remain positive, with modest growth, as consumers are encouraged by positive economic signs including falling inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics</b> thinks consumer spending still has momentum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Looking ahead, sales should be boosted by continued strong growth in employment, rising confidence and the </p> <p>Meanwhile, January\u2019s public finances were a little weaker than expected. Usually the public finances return to surplus in January as it is a bumper month for corporation and income tax receipts. However, the underlying budget surplus (which excludes the temporary effects of financial interventions and Royal Mail and APF transfers) was just \u00a34.7bn this year, somewhat smaller than the \u00a36bn attained last year. </p> <p>However, we suspect that January\u2019s surplus could be revised bigger in time. The smaller surplus largely reflected a 3.5% annual fall in income tax receipts, which looks particularly odd given the strength of the recovery in the labour market.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, </b>said the figures underscore the fragility of the UK\u2019s recovery.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the recovery is continuing, these figures show that the UK economy is still facing challenges. In spite of the strong growth in the economy over the past year, the underlying surplus is lower than it was a year ago. Tax receipts are also mixed \u2013 while VAT receipts are up, income tax and corporation tax receipts are showing a year-on-year decline. We can expect borrowing for the financial year to be slightly below the OBR\u2019s recent forecast, but the improvement will be smaller than previously anticipated.</p> <p>These figures show that the economic recovery is continuing but remains fragile. The budget deficit is unacceptably high, and must be reduced in the years ahead. Businesses are confident in their ability to drive the recovery, but measures to boost growth are needed in next month\u2019s Budget.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>James Knightley at ING Bank </b>expects rising employment and wage growth to translate into consumer confidence.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UK retail sales for January are a little softer than the market expected, falling 1.5%MoM versus the -1.0% figure expected. However, this has to be viewed in the context of the surge in sales in December (+2.5%) and the very wet weather experienced in January, which will have deterred consumers from venturing to the shops. Indeed, the 3M moving average of the annual growth rate is 3.9%, the strongest reading since December 2004. With consumer confidence on a strong upward path, employment rising and wage growth starting to show some hints of life we look for the household sector to contribute strongly to GDP growth this year.</p> <p>However, this positive story didn\u2019t feed into particularly good public sector finance figures. January normally records a decent surplus due to it being the deadline for income tax payments. However the surplus was only just over half of what was expected (\u00a34.7bn versus consensus of \u00a38.0bn) although there was some downward revisions to previous monthly deficit numbers. This still means that the official predictions for the annual deficit still look achievable, but nothing better.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53072d74e4b0e0e8038daa54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-21T10:47:38.656Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Labour has claimed the latest borrowing figures mean chancellor George Osborne will break <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24339347\">his promise to run consistent budget surpluses from 2015</a>.</strong></p> <p><b>Here is Labour\u2019s </b><b>Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury:</b></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures confirm George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by next year.

Investors ignored signs of weakness to concentrate on yesterday\u2019s positive US factory activity. The FTSE 100 was sparked higher by Vodafone, ahead of its distribution of around \u00a349bn to shareholders following its sale of its stake in joint venture Verizon Wireless for $130bn. The closing scores were: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 25.07 points or 0.37% higher at 6838.06 \u2022 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.4% to 9656.95 \u2022 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.59% higher at 4381.06 \u2022 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.3% to 20,391.90 \u2022 Spain\u2019s Ibex added 0.09% to 10,071.0 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points or 0.23%. Meanwhile, our take on the massive amount of documents released by the US Federal Reserve is here: Fed transcripts from 2008 reveal inner workings as US teetered on the brink And with that it\u2019s time to close up for the week. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan has confirmed he will be the new Italian economy and finance ministers, Reuters is reporting (see earlier). More from Twitter on what is being called the Fed\u2019s document dump: The US Federal Reserve has released transcripts of its meetings in 2008, as the financial crisis began in earnest, with one of the gatherings (16 September) just days after Lehman Brothers collapsed. Among the gems, then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke wanted to establish dollar swap lines with G10 central banks to ease a liquidity crisis. He said: I would like to put on the table a request for authorisation for swap lines. I prefer not to put a limit on it, so I know I\u2019ve got my own bazooka here. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the release of the documents. CNBC says: Even for an entity used to doing heavy lifting when it comes to supporting the U.S. economy, 2008 was a historic year for the Federal Reserve. The central bank was left to grapple with the worst downturn since the Great Depression, and was challenged to come up with innovative tools to get the economy back on its feet. Transcripts from that year\u2019s meeting, released in a massive document dump Friday, show the depths of Fed deliberations as a crisis on Wall Street threatened to tear the global economy apart. The September emergency meeting, which came the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, showed officials grappling with the full scope of the problem and trying to anticipate the landscape ahead. \u201cPersonally, I see the prospects for economic growth in the foreseeable future as quite weak, notwithstanding the second quarter\u2019s strength,\u201d then-Chairman Ben Bernanke said. \u201cI think what we saw in the recent labor reports removes any real doubt that we are in a period that will be designated as an official (National Bureau of Economic Research) recession.\u201d Current Chair Janet Yellen saw things much the same way as she ruminated over the problems in housing and employment. \u201cThe interaction of higher unemployment with the housing and financial markets raises the potential for even worse news\u2014namely, an intensification of the adverse feedback loop we have long worried about and are now experiencing,\u201d she said from her position then as leader of the San Francisco Fed. \u201cIndeed, delinquencies have risen substantially across the spectrum of consumer loans, and credit availability continues to decline.\u201d Interestingly, Yellen advocated for no change in the funds rate, which was at 2 percent then. The Open Market Committee followed that meeting with successive cuts of 50 basis points at two October meetings and another 75 basis points in December. There has been some poor US housing data this week, mainly blamed on the recent severe weather, and here comes some more. Existing home sales fell by a worse than expected 5.1% in January, hitting an 18 month low. Sales fell in the north east, south and midwest, which were hit by snow storms and ice last month. Apart from the weather, mortgage rates have been rising and there has been a shortage of homes available to buy. Teunis Brosens at ING said: The drop in sales was already signalled by the leading pending home sales indicator a few weeks ago. No doubt bad winter weather has played a major role. We reckon that besides bad weather, sales are also facing increasing headwinds from higher mortgage rates. The adaptation to higher rates seems to be an ongoing process, with mortgage applications for house purchases showing a further decline in recent weeks. Applications are now hovering some 15% below levels a year ago. We expect further housing disappointments in the coming two months, it won\u2019t be well into Spring until we can truly disentangle weather effects from more structural changes. The great and the good of the finance world are gathering in Sydney for another G20 get-together. Ahead of this weekend\u2019s meeting of finance ministers, Australia\u2019s federal treasurer Joe Hockey has warned that the global economy is not out of the woods yet. Growth in advanced economies, particularly in the United States and Japan looks to be picking up and the Euro area seems to be resuming growth again. But we\u2019re not out of the woods yet. The global economic recovery is not yet sufficiently strong or broadly based to create enough jobs and to continue lifting people out of poverty. While the International Monetary Fund calls for measures to boost growth, the OECD has issued a report on \u201cavoiding the low-growth trap\u201d. Here are some of the key lines - the full version is available here. Crisis-hit southern and central European countries have carried reforms, but these \u201cadjustments\u201d have had painful consequences. The pace of reforms appears to have slowed somewhat but remains on average well above that observed prior to the crisis in most countries. Southern euro area and, to a lesser extent, Central European countries have continued to be particularly active reformers ... Importantly,considerable action has been taken in areas such as labour market regulation, collective bargaining and welfare systems, which in the past have proved particularly difficult to reform. Reforms of pension systems and early retirement schemes, as well as of active labour market programmes, have also ranked highly on the policy agenda in many other countries facing low employment rates. In the countries most severely affected by the crisis, long-overdue labour market reforms hadbecome necessary to restore competitiveness and help narrow external imbalances. However, given the particularly difficult context in which this adjustment has taken place, it has not been without painful consequences for many workers and their families. In order for them to see benefits in the form of improving job opportunities and higher real incomes, labour market reforms must be matched by more vigorous actions to boost product market competition. Progress in boosting competition has been slow\ufeff. One special feature of this report is to assess the progress countries have made in the past five years in reducing regulatory barriers to competition in product markets. While governments have continued to move towards more competition-friendly regulation, progress has, alas, been modest except for a few cases. In particular, competition in network industries and especially professional services continues to be held back by regulatory barriers to entry. China, Germany and Japan need to do more to reform services. Pursuing reform in services is all the more important given the high growth and employment potential of these sectors. This is particularly evident in OECD countries such as Germany, Japan \u2013 as part of Abenomics\u2019 third arrow \u2013 and beyond, not least in China. Services are also critical for a country\u2019s competitiveness within global value chains and create over half of value-added in cross-border trade. A recent global trade deal in Bali was a step forward, but could yet be undermined by a cats cradle of bilateral deals. In this regard, another policy area where ample scope for further progress remains is global trade liberalisation. Prime candidates for substantial gains include reducing the high tariffs on a range of products in emerging-market countries and removing barriers in services sectors and other sensitive areas such as agriculture and government procurement in advanced countries. The recent agreement on trade facilitation reached in Bali is a step in the right direction, and hopefully will give multilateral trade negotiations a new impetus, but its impact risks being undermined by the proliferation of various trade-distorting measures and covert barriers to foreign investment. An interesting footnote: the editorial is signed by Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD\u2019s chief economist and man tipped to be Italy\u2019s next finance minister. On that I am handing over the blog to Nick Fletcher. Thank you for following so far. Who wants to be governor of Iceland\u2019s central bank? The government has just advertised the position, in an apparent move to take more control of the central bank. The current head of the central bank Mar Gudmundsson has criticised the government\u2019s debt relief plans, leading to speculation in local media that ministers want to dilute his influence. Bloomberg has the story: \u201cIt has been decided to advertise the position of the governor as open for applications,\u201d the [finance] ministry said. \u201cThat is done to give authorities greater flexibility in relation to possible changes to the laws on the central bank.\u201d Gunnar Helgi Kristinsson, a professor in political science at the University of Iceland, said that any moves to stifle the independence of the bank would be a dangerous development. If the government would fire the current governor simply for having the institution carry out its independent role, that would be a step back. The Italian rumour mill is turning quickly... or whatever rumour mills do. The latest from Reuters in Paris is that the OECD\u2019s chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan will be appointed Italy\u2019s next finance minister. Hap tip - mrwicket, who made the call earlier on this blog. A source at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development told the agency: He\u2019s got it, he\u2019ll be the finance minister. Reuters adds that Padoan was an early critic of tough budget cutbacks in the eurozone\u2019s weakest economies as they struggled with excessive debt. A fascinating story is unfolding in Nigeria, where the ousted central bank governor has vowed to take the president to court. On Thursday president Goodluck Jonathan suspended Lamido Sanusi as head of Nigeria\u2019s central bank, following his attacks on the government\u2019s record on tackling rampant corruption. Sanusi, who was due to end his term as governor in June, electrified the country when he said $20bn (\u00a312bn) in oil money had gone missing. The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), accused of failing to pay what it owed to the government, has denied the allegations. The suspension triggered a slump in the value of the Nigerian naira, although the currency has bounced back today, after the central bank intervened to calm markets. Lamido Sanusi has now said he will go to court to challenge his suspension by the president. In an interview with Reuters he said he did not want his old job back, but wanted to establish whether the president\u2019s suspension of him was illegal. Sanusi said I\u2019m trying to get to the heart of collapsing oil revenues. My primary motive ... is that oil prices have not come down, oil output has not come down, oil revenues are crashing and therefore my job as central bank governor in managing the exchange rate and reserves is threatened. The Financial Times also has a good take on the story. The suspension of Mr Sanusi comes days after he submitted detailed evidence to a senate investigating committee about alleged fraud at the state-owned oil company. He said that while oil production was only marginally down and prices were steady, Nigeria was nevertheless losing as much as $1bn a month. This was putting at risk the central bank\u2019s ability to defend the naira and shore up foreign reserves. The governor\u2019s allegations have infuriated Mr Jonathan and other members of the government, including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the finance and economy minister, who blame him for making his findings public instead of taking them to a government committee set up to establish where money was going missing. But Nigerian businessmen, analysts and even some government advisers raised alarm at the potential damage that removing the outspoken governor will do to investor confidence given the role he played in establishing Nigeria\u2019s credibility as a frontier market. Nigeria issued its first dollar-denominated bond in 2007 and tapped the market again last year, raising $1bn from international investors. The Guardian\u2019s city editor Jill Treanor on speculation of RBS jobs cuts (9.14am) The UK is likely to hit its deficit targets for 2013-14, according to financial watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR has just given its verdict on the latest government borrowing figures (see 10.30). It thinks the government will meet its target of borrowing \u00a3111.2 bn in 2013-14, unless something goes wrong in the final two months of the year. From the OBR\u2019s report: Headline public sector net borrowing (PSNB) recorded a surplus of \u00a34.7 billion in January 2014. January is generally the highest month of the year for tax receipts so typically sees a surplus. The surplus was \u00a35.1 billion lower than in January 2013 and significantly lower than market expectations of a surplus of \u00a38.2 billion... Underlying borrowing is now \u00a34.0 billion lower in the first ten months of this year than at the same stage last year (excluding Royal Mail and APF transfers). To meet our December EFO full year forecast of \u00a3111.2 billion, borrowing would have to be \u00a30.4 billion higher than last year in the final two months of 2013-14. This would be a departure from the trend over the year to date. Italy could have a new government this weekend. Prime minister-in-waiting Matteo Renzi is poised to name his cabinet and will meet President Giorgio Napolitano later on Friday, a source in Renzi\u2019s Democratic party has told Italian media. If the government is sworn in this weekend, a confidence vote is likely to follow on Monday. There is talk of a role for centre-right leader Angelino Alfano, but uncertainty still reigns over who will get the economy portfolio. Two names in the frame are the current incumbent Fabrizio Saccomanni, and Graziano Delrio, regional affairs minster in the previous government. The UK housing market continues to motor ahead, despite the usual seasonal sales slowdown in January. Data released by HMRC this morning shows the housing market fell back last month, traditionally a slow month for closing deals. The bigger story is that transactions were up 30% on last year. The chart shows how market took off following the introduction of the Help to Buy mortgage-subsidy scheme in the last budget. Just in... Russia\u2019s economy minister Alexei Ulyukaev has said Russia is undecided on handing over a $2bn bailout payout to Ukraine. According to Russian news agency Itar Tass, he said Russia was waiting for clarity on the next Ukrainian government. So, a mixed bag of UK data this morning. UK retail sales were down by 1.5%, but experts think this is no big deal given the previous month\u2019s bumper number. The UK\u2019s borrowing figures also need to be read with a pinch of salt: the headline number, a \u00a34.7bn surplus, is less good than it appears, coming below expectations in what should have been a strong month for tax receipts. This is what economists had to say. Richard Lowe at Barclays points to the weather factors influencing the data. Retailers across the UK continued to discount in January to entice shoppers searching for the best sale bargains. This has resulted in a growth in sales, which was further helped by the absence of snow which knocked retailers in early 2013. Looking ahead at the next few months, I expect the outlook to remain positive, with modest growth, as consumers are encouraged by positive economic signs including falling inflation. Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics thinks consumer spending still has momentum. Looking ahead, sales should be boosted by continued strong growth in employment, rising confidence and the Meanwhile, January\u2019s public finances were a little weaker than expected. Usually the public finances return to surplus in January as it is a bumper month for corporation and income tax receipts. However, the underlying budget surplus (which excludes the temporary effects of financial interventions and Royal Mail and APF transfers) was just \u00a34.7bn this year, somewhat smaller than the \u00a36bn attained last year. However, we suspect that January\u2019s surplus could be revised bigger in time. The smaller surplus largely reflected a 3.5% annual fall in income tax receipts, which looks particularly odd given the strength of the recovery in the labour market. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the figures underscore the fragility of the UK\u2019s recovery. While the recovery is continuing, these figures show that the UK economy is still facing challenges. In spite of the strong growth in the economy over the past year, the underlying surplus is lower than it was a year ago. Tax receipts are also mixed \u2013 while VAT receipts are up, income tax and corporation tax receipts are showing a year-on-year decline. We can expect borrowing for the financial year to be slightly below the OBR\u2019s recent forecast, but the improvement will be smaller than previously anticipated. These figures show that the economic recovery is continuing but remains fragile. The budget deficit is unacceptably high, and must be reduced in the years ahead. Businesses are confident in their ability to drive the recovery, but measures to boost growth are needed in next month\u2019s Budget. James Knightley at ING Bank expects rising employment and wage growth to translate into consumer confidence. UK retail sales for January are a little softer than the market expected, falling 1.5%MoM versus the -1.0% figure expected. However, this has to be viewed in the context of the surge in sales in December (+2.5%) and the very wet weather experienced in January, which will have deterred consumers from venturing to the shops. Indeed, the 3M moving average of the annual growth rate is 3.9%, the strongest reading since December 2004. With consumer confidence on a strong upward path, employment rising and wage growth starting to show some hints of life we look for the household sector to contribute strongly to GDP growth this year. However, this positive story didn\u2019t feed into particularly good public sector finance figures. January normally records a decent surplus due to it being the deadline for income tax payments. However the surplus was only just over half of what was expected (\u00a34.7bn versus consensus of \u00a38.0bn) although there was some downward revisions to previous monthly deficit numbers. This still means that the official predictions for the annual deficit still look achievable, but nothing better. Labour has claimed the latest borrowing figures mean chancellor George Osborne will break his promise to run consistent budget surpluses from 2015. Here is Labour\u2019s Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury: These figures confirm George Osborne is set to break his promise to balance the books by next year. This is the cost of the three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election. Borrowing is now forecast to be nearly \u00a3200 billion more than planned under this Government simply to pay for the costs of their economic failure. Labour will balance the books, get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament. We will get the deficit down in a fairer way, including by reversing David Cameron\u2019s tax cut for the top one per cent of earners. And we will act to secure a strong and balanced recovery that delivers rising living standards for the many, not just a few at the top. Treasury minister David Gauke has told BBC news that the latest budget figures are not disappointing. He said they were consistent with an estimate given by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility in November. Here is some of the reaction to the surplus that fell short of expectations: Turning to the public finances, we learn that the UK government chalked up a surplus in January. The public finances, excluding bank bailouts, showed a \u00a34.72 bn surplus in January, down from \u00a36.04 bn a year ago. A surplus is still a surplus, but this was smaller than expected, with tax revenues down on last year. Income and wealth tax receipts were down 5.2% on the previous year and corporation tax fell by 6%. Economists had forecast a surplus of \u00a38.15 bn. Read the full ONS report here. Ukraine update France\u2019s foreign minister and others involved in negotiating a way out of Ukraine\u2019s political crisis have urged caution, but markets show no such qualms. In the last hour the cost of Ukraine\u2019s debt insurance has fallen, while government bonds are rising, reflecting investor hopes there will be a deal to end the violence. Here is a snapshot of what analysts are saying about the latest retail sales figures. Veteran retail expert Nick Bubb faults the ONS for its \u201coddly high\u201d growth stats for small businesses. The ONS are more likely to cover smaller independent stores than rival surveys, such as those done by the British Retail Consortium, or consultancy firm BDO. If you are in the business of selling DIY products and furniture, it looks like it has been a good year. All the growth in retail sales has been coming from non-food (clothes, electrical etc) but the biggest growth has been in stores selling household goods. This is how British consumers spent their pennies in January 2014. For every \u00a3 spent: 42 pence was spent in food stores; 41 pence in non-food stores; 6 pence in non-store retailing (i.e catalogues, market stalls); 11 pence in petrol stations. Here is the retail sales data in a handy chart. It shows that in January 2014 the quantity bought in the retail industry fell by 1.5% compared with December 2013. The amount spent decreased by 1.8%. We have just learnt that British consumers cut back - a little - in January 2014, after the pre-Christmas spending rush. The Office for National Statistics has published the latest data on UK retail sales - full report here. Here are a few highlights: Retail sales, excluding fuel, fell 1.5% in January compared to the previous month. In December sales grew 2.5%, far better than expected, so the latest fall is not a surprise, although slightly worse than expected. Sales were 4.3% higher in January 2014, compared to the same time last year, although the effect is skewed by 2013\u2019s heavy snowfall, which kept people out of the shops. The online trend is the same, but even more pronounced: online sales were down 3.3% in Jan compared to Dec, although up 8.9% over the year. Year on year sales in non-food stores were up 8% and 9.8% for shops selling household goods - the largest increase in these stores since July 2007. Breaking news: UK retail sales fell 1.5% in January, the biggest drop since April 2012. A week before Royal Bank of Scotland announces a massive loss, there is a fair amount of speculation over job cuts at the 80% taxpayer-owned bank. The Financial Times reports that 30,000 jobs are to go, while the Daily Telegraph puts the figure at 20,000. The FT figure also includes18,500 jobs that will be transferred as a result of the sale of Citizens, RBS\u2019s US retail and commercial bank. The brunt of the job cuts will be targeted at RBS\u2019s investment bank, which employs 11,000 people. According to the Telegraph, the job losses and business closures mean that RBS staff numbers, which stood at 161,000 at the time of its \u00a346bn bailout in 2008, will fall below 100,000 for the first time since the bank\u2019s 2000 takeover of larger rival NatWest. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said he did not want RBS to be the world\u2019s biggest bank. My aspiration is not to run the world\u2019s biggest bank. My aspiration is to run the best bank in the UK - nothing to do with size. A lot of our costs are old costs related to a big global group that we are not any more. RBS is expected to reveal a loss close to \u00a38 billion for 2013, when it publishes its results next Thursday. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard at the Daily Telegraph has a good take on how unrest in Ukraine is hitting other economies in central and eastern Europe. Russia, already hit by slowing growth of its oil-dependent economy, has the most the lose. Moscow promised a $15bn bailout for Ukraine back in December, but so far only $3bn has been transferred, with $2bn promised earlier this week. The dramatic escalation of Ukraine\u2019s civil conflict and fears of Russian military intervention have sent financial tremors across Eastern Europe, turning the region into the new fulcrum of the emerging market crisis. \u201cThis has suddenly gone from a domestic Ukrainian story into a geopolitical clash,\u201d said Lars Christensen, from Danske Bank. The Russian ruble has fallen to a record low against the euro, with contagion reaching Poland, Hungary and Romania in recent days. \u201cThe moves in Russia are very like the events during the war in Georgia in 2008. Markets are pricing in the risk of Russian intervention,\u201d he said. Regis Chatellier, from Societe Generale, said there is a \u201chigh risk\u201d that Ukraine will be pushed into default on its \u20ac60bn sovereign debt, triggering a credit shock for Russian banks. Sberbank and VTB are both large holders of Ukrainian bonds. Global emerging market bond funds hold 3pc of their portfolio in Ukrainian debt. \u201cThe spillover effect of a Ukrainian default would be significant, but not systemic,\u201d he said. Although Ukraine has seen its credit-worthiness slashed to ribbons by political unrest, the credit ratings agencies are much more bullish about Thailand, which has also seen weeks of violent anti-government protests. On Friday Moody\u2019s reaffirmed the country\u2019s Baa1 rating, despite the ongoing political tension. The rating agency said recent clashes in Bangkok would not affect Thailand\u2019s credit strength to a material degree, citing the country\u2019s favourable government debt structure, prudent monetary and macroeconomic policy and reasonably strong growth outlook. However local bankers are less confident. One told Reuters that the economy was being hurt by the unrest. You can see some sectors already hurt from the political situation. The hospitality, the airline, the leisure and the tourism sectors are suffering now, and this can spread to other sectors. Breaking news on Ukraine\u2019s finances: Ukraine has just cancelled a planned issue of 5-yr Eurobonds worth $2bn. Ukraine had hoped Russia would buy the bonds to help it avoid collapsing into bankruptcy. After Ukraine\u2019s most violent day since recent protest began, the country has seen its credit rating slip deeper into junk territory. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s announced on Friday it was cutting Ukraine\u2019s sovereign rating for the second time in three weeks. In a statement raising doubts about Moscow\u2019s commitment to pay out on a $15bn bailout deal agreed in December that includes bond purchases, loans and cheap gas for Ukraine, S&amp;P said Ukraine did not have enough funding to avoid default. The agency has lowered its long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating on Ukraine by one notch to \u2018CCC\u2019 and given it a negative outlook. The downgrade reflects our view that the political situation in Ukraine has deteriorated substantially. We believe that this raises uncertainty regarding the continued provision of Russian financial support over the course of 2014, and puts the government\u2019s capability to meet debt service at increasing risk. We consider that the future of the current Ukrainian leadership is now more uncertain than at any time since the protests began in November 2013. This morning Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich said he had reached a deal with pro-European opposition leaders, but French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who is involved in the mediation attempt, is urging caution. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The British consumer has been a driving force of the recovery, but is that momentum slipping? The latest retail sales data, due out this morning, is expected to show a shopping slowdown in January after the previous month\u2019s Christmas boom. Last month the Office for National Statistics revealed a 2.6% increase in retail sales for December, a much bigger jump than anyone had expected, and one that is unlikely to be repeated. Economists are forecasting a 1% decline in retail sales for January, but caution that record-breaking wet weather could make the figure lower still. The ONS will also reveal the latest on the public finances. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets forecasts \u201ca rare monthly surplus of \u00a39.5bn on public sector net borrowing\u201d as people rushed to meet the 31 January tax deadline. We are expecting both data sets at 9.30. I will also be taking a further look at the build-up to the G20 finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Australia this weekend. Stay tuned...",

      "bodyText": "It was just after 8am when Euan Sutherland tweeted: \"Day one. I feel very privileged to lead such a great British business. Lots to do. Exciting times ahead.\" That was on 1 May last year and the tall, urbane Scotsman had just become the chief executive of the Co-operative Group, the UK's largest mutual, with an eclectic mix of businesses spanning supermarkets and funeral homes, even farms. He did not send a tweet on day two, perhaps because he had just discovered the state of the Co-op Bank, which was struggling to cope with bad loans in the wake of its merger with the Britannia building society in 2009. The \u00a31.5bn black hole in the accounts that emerged set Sutherland on a desperate six-month battle to prevent the bank collapsing into a taxpayer bailout and led to him axing the chairman, Paul Flowers, who was later filmed apparently buying illegal drugs. With the bank rescue complete \u2013 albeit it is now only 30% owned by the Co-op, which was forced to cede control to bondholders led by aggressive US hedge funds \u2013 the 45-year-old is looking less startled than he did in his early days in the job. He is now fronting a campaign to ask the public what they think the Co-op group should stand for. Sutherland, whose career has involved stints in quick succession at household names including Mars, Superdrug and most recently B&amp;Q, bristles when it is suggested that launching an opinion poll shows his inability to devise a strategy for himself. \"We're listening and then leading. If I was running a plc in the midst of a strategic review I would go to my shareholders and consult. My customers are my shareholders, \" he said. The poll is open to the public rather than just the 8 million members and 15 million customers of the group, which has a presence in every postal district in the UK and a deep heritage, its origins resting with the Rochdale pioneers in 1844. The questionnaire has already ignited a debate about the future of the Co-operative party \u2013 which has been linked with Labour since 1927 and has 32 MPs in parliament, shadow chancellor Ed Balls included \u2013 as it asks whether political donations should continue. Some \u00a3800,000 was handed out in 2012, the bulk of it to the Co-op party. Sutherland refuses to disclose his views on political donations, which have already been cut by 30%. \"I haven't called an end to [political donations], I've just asked the public,\" he said. \"I hope we get a clear answer. Then my commitment is to act. We could cut it off straight away but I don't think that would be particularly helpful to the Co-operative party \u2026 What we are not wanting to do is stress any affiliated parties with this. This is a four-to-five-year turnaround. If we get a clear mandate we will act on this, but we will do it in consultation. My options are completely open.\" His next presentation is on 26 March when the Co-op is due to publish its results for 2013. The numbers will be \"ugly\". There was already a \u00a3559m loss at the half-year stage, which makes the discussion in the poll about what to do with profits somewhat academic. By the day of the results he promises to be able to answer what will happen to the pension and long-term bonuses outstanding to his predecessor, Peter Marks, who spent 45 years at the Co-op until he retired in May, and provide an update on the \u00a331,000 Flowers is being asked to pay back. Sutherland's own pay is not disclosed, although Marks received more than \u00a31m last year. Marks dreamed of turning the Co-op Bank into a fifth force in high street banking by taking over 631 Lloyds Banking Group branches. The deal unravelled just before he left, and his plan to turn the Co-op supermarkets into a fifth force in groceries after its audacious takeover of Somerfield has also been abandoned. Instead, the Co-op now wants to be \"the best local convenience food retailer in the UK\". There will be no online offering initially \u2013 although Sutherland talks about his admiration for Ocado \u2013 while more than 100 new stores will be added while larger ones acquired from Somerfield will be abandoned. Job cuts from the 90,000-strong workforce seem inevitable as he finds another \u00a3300m of the \u00a3500m cost cuts he has set as a target. He looks likely to keep the funeral parlours, the biggest such chain in the UK, and admits the pharmacies are under pressure in the long term and the legal business is likely to incur more losses while it is developed. But the farming operations \u2013 also the biggest in the UK \u2013 look vulnerable. \"The point to understand about farms is people think we have farmland which produces product which comes into our shops. That's not necessarily true. We have lots of land, some of it farmland, some of it not, very little of it produces any product that goes into our shops, less than 2% \u2026 This was an historic period of investments over a long period of time.\" His strategic review will not be unveiled in full until the annual meeting in May, when Peter Kellner, the head of YouGov, will come in person to deliver the results of the online poll. The review by Lord Myners, the former City minister, into how the group should change its current boardroom structure of 20 individuals elected from within the Co-operative movement, is expected in April, as is the first of many reports into what went wrong at the bank \u2013 this one commissioned by the Co-op from Sir Christopher Kelly. Sutherland has already been more radical that he expected to \u2013 going far beyond his first-day gesture of ditching his tie as a signal that the culture would be changing \u2013 and is trying to make the group less hierarchical by setting up \"talk together\" sessions between shop floor staff floor and the new management team. But when asked if the future of the Co-op will be demutualisation he has an immediate one-word answer: \"No.\" \"The absolute point of the Co-op is to be different \u2013 why make it a plc? We've got to keep the voice of the customer on the board, in the business, and do it in the right way.\" He is quick to point to the team he has assembled \u2013 which includes respected City lawyer Alistair Asher and former finance director of Morrisons, Richard Pennycook \u2013 to embark upon the \"transformation\". \"The Co-op is for the masses and not for the few, but my sense is that we've become for the few and not for the wider many.\"",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, George Osborne, will have no room for major tax or spending give-aways in next month's budget after figures showed a smaller than expected tax windfall in January. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK is on course to meet its full-year borrowing targets but left the chancellor with minimal margin for error. showed full-year borrowing is on course to just about meet the Treasury's official forecast. A January surplus of \u00a34.7bn was much lower than the \u00a38.1bn forecast by economists and smaller than the \u00a36bn recorded in the same month last year. The start of the year is typically a bumper month for the public purse thanks to a glut of income tax and corporation tax payments, but last month showed the lowest January surplus in four years. Government coffers were hit by lower receipts from income and wealth taxes despite a broader economic recovery and falling unemployment. Corporation tax receipts were also lower than last year, after a sharp fall in receipts from oil and gas companies due to a decline in North Sea production. Economists described the last set of borrowing figures to be published before the budget on 19 March as disappointing. They said the chancellor now had a limited chance of significantly undershooting the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for \u00a3111.2bn of full-year borrowing, limiting his ability to woo the electorate by announcing big giveaways ahead of the 2015 general election. John Hawksworth, chief economist at accounting group PwC, said: \"This reinforces the message that there is still a long way to go to put the public finances back on a sound footing, and is likely to imply a relatively cautious approach by the chancellor in the budget. \"As he made clear in the autumn statement [in December], there are still many years of fiscal austerity to come and little room for pre-election giveaways.\" Government borrowing totalled \u00a390.7bn in the first 10 months of the 2013-14 fiscal year. Responding to the borrowing figures, Labour said George Osborne was set to break his promise to \"balance the books\" by 2015-16, made when the coalition came to power. \"This is the cost of the three damaging years of flatlining and falling living standards we have seen since the election,\" said Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. January is typically a bumper month for the public purse, as a result of income tax and corporation tax payments. Last month however the government coffers were hit by lower receipts compared with a year earlier, mainly from income and wealth taxes despite broader economic recovery and falling unemployment. Corporation tax receipts were also lower than last year, after a sharp fall in receipts from oil and gas companies amid a decline in North Sea production. A spokesman for the Treasury said: \"The government's long-term economic plan is working. The deficit has fallen by a third. But as today's figures show, the job is not done and the biggest risk to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that is boosting economic security for Britain's hard-working people.\" Andrew Goodwin, a senior economic adviser to economic forecasters the EY Item Club, said the weakness in income tax seemed to reflect very low receipts from self-assessment forms, with payments possibly delayed until February. \"Given that a sizeable chunk of the revenue comes in after the self-assessment deadline, it is quite possible that this weakness will reverse next month, but this does send us into the budget on a somewhat downbeat note,\" he said. There was mixed news for the chancellor in further official data that showed January retail sales fell more than expected on the previous month but were still up on the same period a year ago. Economists said consumer spending was still likely to deliver a sizeable boost to the economy in the first quarter, with the outlook for retail sales benefiting from rising employment and easing inflation. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales fell 1.5% in January compared with December, the biggest drop since April 2012. A slowdown had been expected after a strong Christmas. Retail sales were still up 4.3% on 2013 as analysts said the overall picture was relatively buoyant. \"The underlying trend in the data suggests that a brightening mood among UK households is translating into higher consumer spending,\" said Chris Williamson from data specialists Markit.",

    "webTitle": "WhatsApp: Facebook stock slides then recovers after news of $19bn deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Facebook\u2019s record-breaking $19bn purchase of the messaging service WhatsApp got a mixed reaction from investors on Thursday, as a sharp sell-off was followed by a rally in the social media company\u2019s stock price. Facebook\u2019s shares fell as much as 3.4% in early trading after the announcement of its purchase of the fast-growing and popular but thus far unprofitable WhatsApp. The news reduced Facebook\u2019s market cap by billions. But by the end of the trading day, the shares had bounced back, erasing the earlier losses. Analysts said investors were rattled by the price \u2013 a record for an acquisition by Facebook \u2013 and the fact that the purchase was being made largely in shares, therefore diluting other shareholders. WhatsApp is receiving $4bn in cash, $12bn in Facebook shares and $3bn in restricted stock that its management will receive over the next four years. The purchase comes as tech giants fight to secure a lead in mobile technology \u2013 the fastest-growing segment for customers and advertisers. WhatsApp was reportedly courted by Google last year, and Facebook made the purchase after failing to secure a $3bn deal with the popular messaging service Snapchat last year. Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said: \u201cFacebook\u2019s technology deals are often not hinged on cash flows but more on controlling a competitor that could ultimately pose a great threat to Facebook\u2019s dominance and market value. \u201cIn essence, it\u2019s a paranoid defence play in the spirit of Intel that pursued the same strategy back in the old days to fend off new competitors. But only the paranoid survive right? Investors are not entirely impressed by the acquisition.\u201d The deal is the largest ever made for a venture capital-backed startup, easily outstripping any tech startup purchase, including Microsoft\u2019s $8.5bn acquisition of Skype and Google\u2019s $3bn purchase of the ad firm DoubleClick and its $1.65bn YouTube deal. Before this, Facebook\u2019s largest deal had been its $1bn purchase of the photo-sharing site Instagram. In a note to clients, Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said: \u201cWhile we see strategic merit, the acquisition is difficult to justify on metrics we use to value Facebook. A separate re-assessment of ad revenues for the core business was leading us to raise expectations, but dilution due to WhatsApp partially offsets these changes.\u201d Wieser reduced his rating on the company\u2019s shares from buy to hold. WhatsApp has 450 million users worldwide and is one of the most downloaded apps on several continents. The service allows people to send text and picture messages via the internet for free, avoiding texting charges.

But by the end of the trading day, the shares had bounced back, erasing the earlier losses.</p> <p>Analysts said investors were rattled by the price \u2013 a record for an acquisition by Facebook \u2013 and the fact that the purchase was being made largely in shares, therefore diluting other shareholders. WhatsApp is receiving $4bn in cash, $12bn in Facebook shares and $3bn in restricted stock that its management will receive over the next four years.</p> <p>The purchase comes as tech giants fight to secure a lead in mobile technology \u2013 the fastest-growing segment for customers and advertisers. WhatsApp was reportedly courted by Google last year, and Facebook made the purchase <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/13/snapchat-facebook-buyout-offer-rejected\">after failing to secure a $3bn deal with the popular messaging service Snapchat last year</a>.</p> <p>Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, said: \u201cFacebook\u2019s technology deals are often not hinged on cash flows but more on controlling a competitor that could ultimately pose a great threat to Facebook\u2019s dominance and market value. </p> <p>\u201cIn essence, it\u2019s a paranoid defence play in the spirit of Intel that pursued the same strategy back in the old days to fend off new competitors. But only the paranoid survive right? Investors are not entirely impressed by the acquisition.\u201d</p> <p>The deal is the largest ever made for a venture capital-backed startup, easily outstripping any tech startup purchase, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/10/microsoft-skype-deal-shocks-analysts\">Microsoft\u2019s $8.5bn acquisition of Skype</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/apr/14/googlebuysdou\">Google\u2019s $3bn purchase of the ad firm DoubleClick</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/09/digitalmedia.googlethemedia\">$1.65bn YouTube deal</a>. Before this, Facebook\u2019s largest deal had been its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/09/facebook-buys-instagram-mark-zuckerberg\">$1bn purchase of the photo-sharing site Instagram</a>.</p> <p>In a note to clients, Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said: \u201cWhile we see strategic merit, the acquisition is difficult to justify on metrics we use to value Facebook. A separate re-assessment of ad revenues for the core business was leading us to raise expectations, but dilution due to WhatsApp partially offsets these changes.\u201d </p> <p>Wieser reduced his rating on the company\u2019s shares from buy to hold.</p> <p>WhatsApp has 450 million users worldwide and is one of the most downloaded apps on several continents. The service allows people to send text and picture messages via the internet for free, avoiding texting charges. The service is free for the first year and then asks customers to pay 99\u00a2 a year after that.</p> <p>Weiser said that in order to justify the price Facebook paid, WhatsApp would need to generate around $1bn in annual cash flow by 2018. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, few data-points to support such an assumption were provided by the company, as evidently few are available,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cAs management indicated, it expects WhatsApp to focus on product and users rather than monetization, anyways.
