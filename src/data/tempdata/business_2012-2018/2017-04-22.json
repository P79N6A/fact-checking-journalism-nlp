      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not a boast that will cause brows to furrow in the grand chateaux of Burgundy but \u2013 whisper it quietly \u2013 a handful of English viticulturalists now lay claim to producing a decent pinot noir. While English sparkling wine has gone from being an international joke to winning awards in blind tastings against the finest champagnes, the prospect of a red that could hold its own against competition from abroad has until now seemed a remote one. \u201cWe just do not have the climate to ripen red grapes,\u201d said Adam Lechmere, a wine writer. \u201cWith champagne and sparkling wine, acidity is of the essence, that\u2019s what gives the wine its backbone, its longevity, power and grip \u2013 you don\u2019t need the fruit flavours so much. But to make a red wine without fruit flavours, it comes out as metallic and dull and it doesn\u2019t have the verve. You just can\u2019t do it without the sunshine hours. We have the right climate to ripen a grape to wonderful acidity, but don\u2019t have enough sun to develop the sugars to develop the fruit.\u201d Julia Trustram Eve, marketing director of English Wine Producers, estimates that only about 10% of the wine produced in the 500 vineyards in England and Wales is red. \u201cThe volumes of red wine that we produce are much lower than most other wine regions and as such aren\u2019t that readily available,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are more likely to be available only direct from the producers themselves.\u201d Indeed, neither Tesco \u2013 which started offering a Chinese red wine last week \u2013 nor Sainsbury\u2019s sell any English reds. \u201cThere are some fantastic English reds being produced but, at the moment, these wines are on the pricey side \u2013 understandably as the growing conditions and volume are difficult to manage,\u201d said James Davis, Tesco master of wine. \u201cAs demand for English wine continues to grow, we will keep looking at the options around red varieties, and hopefully, with customers\u2019 increased interest in homegrown wines, we can look to offer our customers a quality English red wine soon.\u201d However, market forces may convince some winemakers to diversify, according to those in the industry. Currently, five million bottles of wine are produced annually in England and Wales, two thirds of which are sparkling. Last week, the industry revealed it planned to double production over five years, most of which will be devoted to sparkling. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much success with sparkling wine, and people planting vines have been picking up on that story and going down that route,\u201d said Sam Linter, chief winemaker at the Bolney wine estate in Sussex, whose pinot noir, a red grape that can thrive in cooler climes, has won silver awards in international competitions. \u201cPeople think there is more money to be made in making a sparkling wine. But I would say there is as much to be had in reds. People are slowly recognising that now.\u201d Linter recalls the reaction when the vineyard turned its attention to producing reds in the mid-90s. \u201cEveryone told me I was completely bonkers,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut we experimented and it took years of hard work to get right.\u201d Like several other vineyards in southern England, Bolney also grows two other varieties of grape used to make red wine \u2013 rondo and dornfelder, both common in German wines. \u201cBut pinot noir is a great variety for the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest to grow (it is prone to rot), but it really likes the climate and soil we have here. It has a real future. It just needs more people planting it. I think in 20 or 30 years\u2019 time you\u2019ll see a lot of pinot planted here. There\u2019s so much potential, more than anything else.\u201d Bolney now produces about 15,000 bottles of pinot a year but plans to increase production to 50,000 by 2021. \u201cWe have all of our pinot under allocation and we know we can sell a huge amount more, there\u2019s such a demand for it,\u201d Linter said. However, Roberto Zanca, head sommelier at Hotel du Vin Cheltenham, said good English reds were still a rare find. \u201cEnglish red wines aren\u2019t as easy to come by as some of the quality English white wines we have on our wine list. However, there are signs this is changing. I recently tasted a fantastic English red \u2013 a pinot noir early from Sixteen Ridges \u2013 and as the UK climate becomes more suitable, it\u2019s easy to see production and demand increasing.\u201d Christopher White, CEO at the Denbies vineyard in Surrey, another pinot evangelist, said the English wine industry was learning where to draw the line. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to become much more honest about what we can grow well here, rather than trying to be all things to all people. We know we\u2019re not going to produce the full-bodied robust reds. We\u2019re producing a style of red that has its own character, and the best pinot noirs are from cooler climates.\u201d At \u00a317.95 \u2013 similar to the price that Bolney charges \u2013 a bottle of Denbies\u2019 pinot noir is at the pricier end of the scale. But White said English pinot was carving out a niche for itself. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t expect customers to pay this if it wasn\u2019t good enough. Our greatest selling point is that it\u2019s English, because people know that is a mark of quality, and it\u2019s distinct, because there\u2019s a lower alcohol content which changes the flavour of the wines \u2013 ours are 11 or 12% instead of the 14 or 15% we see around the world.\u201d While many oenophiles will remain sceptical that a decent pinot can be found anywhere north of Burgundy, White said English reds were now winning awards in international competitions. \u201cIt may not always win the gold, but for an English red this was unheard of years ago \u2013 as it once was for our sparkling wines.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of small businesses hit hardest by the recent changes to business rates in the UK have been dealt a fresh blow after a \u00a3300m relief package promised in the budget was waylaid by the general election. Earlier this year the government came under pressure to take action on business rates after a revaluation of property in Britain hit the owners of shops, restaurants and pubs in parts of the country where property prices had surged. For example, a property boom in the Suffolk coastal town of Southwold forced rateable values up by 152%, with some shop owners saying the hike threatened the viability of their businesses. It was hoped that the support fund would be up and running within weeks. But although the Department for Communities and Local Government has completed the consultation on how best to implement the scheme, a spokesman confirmed it would now fall to the next government to publish their response, resulting in a potential hiatus of several months. Mark Rigby, the chief executive of business rent and rates specialists CVS, said the delay was a serious issue for firms struggling with the impact of the revaluation. \u201cThe relief fund was negotiated and designed to help those shouldering the biggest increases through the revaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the distribution of that relief to now be delayed is an unhappy consequence of the general election and will cause grave concern to small businesses already worried about the burden they are facing.\u201d Business properties are usually revalued every five years but this was delayed by two years as a result of the economic downturn. The last revaluation, which came into effect in 2010, was based on property values from 2008 which explains why some firms have seen a sharp rise in their business rates, which are based on the value of commercial property. According to research by CVS, the average rateable value of shops in England and Wales increased by 8.5% at the start of this month, but the value of shops in Southwold, Blaenavon, Dolwyddelan, Port Isaac, Rhymney, Kenley and Corwen increased by more than 100%. Rigby urged councils \u201cto show restraint\u201d and refrain from enforcing business rates bills against likely recipients of the relief during the period of delay.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When BHS crashed into administration, taking 11,000 jobs along with it a year ago, one employee described the feeling as a \u201cterrible gut-punch\u201d. A year on, the high street is still reeling from the body blow. More than two-thirds of the retailer\u2019s 164 stores are still lying empty and its pensioners have been left worse off, even after former owner Sir Philip Green agreed to pump up to \u00a3363m into supporting the pension scheme. For many long-serving BHS staff, the chain\u2019s failure marked a turning point in their lives from which they are yet to recover financially. And regardless of the passage of time, the stabbing finger of blame is still being pointed at Green who, despite his role in the unravelling of BHS, has clung on to his knighthood. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed about what happened,\u201d says one former employee, who hasn\u2019t yet found a new job. \u201cIt should never have come to that. At store level, we were a group of people that worked well together and worked hard.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe only reason Green couldn\u2019t turn BHS around was because he never invested in it. We had outdated fixtures and fittings, asbestos and outdated lifts that didn\u2019t work because no money was being spent on them. He starved it.\u201d Most BHS staff received very little redundancy pay, even though some had spent decades at the group. This month just over 100 former BHS workers were awarded up to \u00a31m in compensation because proper procedures were not followed when they were let go by the administrators. In the wake of last year\u2019s failure, the Fashion and Textile Children\u2019s Trust (FTCT), a hardship charity once chaired by Charles Dickens, was inundated with requests for help from BHS staff. The trust, founded in 1853 by a group of philanthropic textile merchants, received applications from a record 460 families in the last six months of 2016, with 274 relating to former BHS workers. Its small grants, which start at \u00a3250, are designed to help families meet the cost of essentials like school uniforms or winter clothing. The surge in the number of claims compared with a total of 150 for 2015 as a whole. The FTCT is currently offering its support to Jaeger staff, who are facing an uncertain outlook after the business went under earlier this month. Last week, 209 of its 680 staff were made redundant after administrators announced plans to close 20 of its 46 stores. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in applications,\u201d says FTCT director Anna Pangbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-documented fact that the retail sector is facing challenging times and this is an indication of that.\u201d The fact that Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to its joint lowest level since 1975 belies the experience of thousands of BHS staff, who have struggled to find an equivalent job with a contract and regular hours. The jobless rate may be just 4.7% but official records show the number of people on zero-hours contracts hit a record high of 905,000 in the final three months of 2016. That was an increase of 101,000, or 13%, compared with the same period a year earlier. Last year, research by industry trade body the British Retail Consortium (BRC) identified a \u201clost generation\u201d of predominantly female shop workers who \u2013 as thousands of BHS staff would find out \u2013 risk losing their jobs as structural change chews up the high street. It estimated there were nearly 500,000 retail workers, aged between 26 and 45, many of whom have children and need to work close to their family home, who would find it hard to find alternative jobs. Using the benchmark of those earning less than \u00a38.05 an hour, the BRC says 1.5 million people work in low-paid UK retail jobs. About 70% are female and one in five receive means-tested working age tax credits. Norman Pickavance, chair of the Fabian Society taskforce on the future of retail, says the majority of companies in the sector are trying to save money by moving towards less secure employment models. \u201cThere are more and more zero-hours-type contracts and self employment,\u201d he says. \u201cA year on from the demise of BHS, most retailers are continuing down that route of flexibility but there is a risk to them from Brexit. They have only been able to use these methods because of the abundance of labour and might have to rethink.\u201d For many former BHS staff, Green remains the villain of the piece. In 2015 he sold BHS, complete with a hefty pension deficit of more than \u00a3500m, for \u00a31 to a consortium of investors led by former bankrupt Dominic Chappell, seemingly without a qualm. After a drawn-out negotiation process, Green finally agreed a deal with the Pensions Regulator in February that involves the creation of a new pension scheme, which will be funded by his cash injection. BHS workers will have the option of moving their pension into the new scheme, receiving a lump-sum payment, or remaining in the existing pension scheme, which will enter the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) and see a 10% cut to existing benefits. Lin Macmillan, a BHS pensioner who worked as a manager for the retailer in the 1980s, says she was pleased that Green had put some money into the pension fund but the future for pensioners was still not as good as it could have been. \u201cI think he thinks that because he paid up, he\u2019s exonerated himself but I don\u2019t think anybody who worked in BHS feels any better about him than they did a year ago. He\u2019s still swanning around spending money like it\u2019s going out of fashion. We\u2019ve got to wait a few months before we hear the detail about our pensions.\u201d The BHS drama has played out during a period of massive structural change in the retail sector as established chains adapt their businesses to a world in which 20% of their sales are online. Last week, both Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams announced store closures as their respective new management teams attempt to square the cost of large physical store chains with changing shopper habits. M&amp;S had already warned it planned to close 30 UK stores as it looks to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to selling clothing and last week\u2019s news of the high street veteran\u2019s retreat from prominent locations in places like Portsmouth, Slough, Warrington and Wokingham will be a blow to locals. This trend is writ larger in the US, where analysts are talking about a \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d, as main street veterans like Macy\u2019s and Sears line up to announce major store closure programmes. With American Apparel, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and JCPenney also axing stores, hundreds of American shopping mall outlets are closing for good. The cost in job terms has been stark, with more than 89,000 retail positions eliminated over the last six months. New York-based Global Data analyst Neil Saunders says the US and UK retail markets are not mirror images, with the American woes resulting from the fallout from a belated move by store chiefs to address the threat posed by the internet. \u201cThere is certainly a parallel between BHS and players like Sears and Macy\u2019s,\u201d says Saunders. \u201cAll of them fall into the trap of lacking differentiation and having an offer that is very middle of the road. This doesn\u2019t cut it in today\u2019s cutthroat market, where the consumer has so much choice.\u201d With more than five times more retail square footage per person than the UK, American store chiefs have also got a bigger problem on their hands than their British counterparts. \u201cIn terms of online penetration, the US is where the UK was five or so years ago,\u201d continues Saunders. \u201cWhat we are seeing is large US retailers scrabbling to adjust.\u201d He adds: \u201cGenerally, UK retail is at a much later evolutionary stage than the US. There has already been quite a lot of adjustment in terms of the closure and adaptation of physical space. That said, the sector remains highly pressured which makes further shocks, like the closure of BHS, inevitable.\u201d M&amp;S has almost 1,000 stores in the UK but 304 of them are the large \u201cfull-line\u201d outlets that sell clothing, homeware and food. While locals wring their hands at the prospect of their store closing, City analysts want chief executive Steve Rowe to take more drastic action. Ditto new Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher, who said last week that 10 of its 176 stores could be closed. Local Data Company analyst Matthew Hopkinson says the closures announced by M&amp;S and Debenhams are tinkering at the edges, given that new brands entering the UK market could happily cover the country with 30 stores and a website. \u201cThe number of stores M&amp;S is going to close is peanuts,\u201d says Hopkinson. UK store chiefs are facing tough decisions at a time when trading patterns are being upset by uncertainty surrounding Brexit, with retail sales figures for the first quarter of 2017 showing the biggest drop in purchases in the last seven years. A squeeze on living standards triggered by sterling\u2019s weakness is also pushing up prices. \u201cLooking ahead, productivity is a big issue in the US and the UK,\u201d says Saunders. \u201cProfit margins are under pressure from the constant discounting and price reductions which are needed to cope with stiff competition. On top of this, costs are problematic, thanks to increases in business rates in the UK and minimum wage hikes in both countries. All of this adds up to a perfect storm which means retailers are rethinking and reconfiguring their business models.\u201d Fate of the key players A year on from the collapse of BHS, most of the key protagonists have moved on, although former owner Dominic Chappell still faces possible legal action. Sir Philip Green Green still has his knighthood despite MPs last year demanding that the \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d be stripped of the honour. In a fiery Commons debate Iain Wright, Labour chair of the business select committee, said: \u201cSir Philip received his knighthood for services to retail. However, throughout the course of our inquiry, it became increasingly evident that he wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail at all.\u201d However, the parliamentary vote holds no legal power, and the decision on whether to strip the billionaire of his gong will ultimately be made by the honours forfeiture committee. Dominic Chappell The former Le Mans racing driver bought BHS from Green for just \u00a31 in March 2015. The Pensions Regulator is pursuing legal action against Chappell and his company, Retail Acquisitions Ltd (RAL), for \u00a371m it wants them to stump up for BHS pensioners. RAL had received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. Chappell has pledged to fight back in the courts. Darren Topp The former chief executive of BHS told MPs Chappell had threatened to kill him for challenging him about a \u00a31.5m transfer out of the company.(Chappell has denied this.) In September Topp was appointed chief executive of fashion brand LK Bennett. Michael Hitchcock A former financial consultant at BHS, Hitchcock was scathing of Chappell during the parliamentary inquiry. \u201c I think I was duped,\u201d Hitchcock said when asked about Chappell. He is now working with Topp as chief financial officer at LK Bennett. Michael Sherwood A prominent figure in British banking, Michael Sherwood was co-head of Europe at Goldman Sachs when the bank advised Green on the sale of BHS. the department store chain to Chappell had he not passed an informal vetting by the bank. Appearing before MPs last year, Sherwood insisted that Goldman had \u201cdone a good job of highlighting the risks\u201d of the deal, but would have done \u201csubstantially more\u201d had it been paid. He resigned in November, but insisted BHS had nothing to do with his departure, saying it was \u201cone blip in a 30-year career\u201d. Rupert Neate",

More than two-thirds of the retailer\u2019s 164 stores are still lying empty and its pensioners have been left worse off, even after former owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/philip-green-agrees-pay-363m-bhs-pension-fund\" title=\"\">Sir Philip Green agreed to pump up to \u00a3363m</a> into supporting the pension scheme.</p> <p>For many long-serving BHS staff, the chain\u2019s failure marked a turning point in their lives from which they are yet to recover financially. And regardless of the passage of time, the stabbing finger of blame is still being pointed at Green who, despite his role in the unravelling of BHS, has clung on to his knighthood.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m annoyed about what happened,\u201d says one former employee, who hasn\u2019t yet found a new job. \u201cIt should never have come to that.

We had outdated fixtures and fittings, asbestos and outdated lifts that didn\u2019t work because no money was being spent on them. He starved it.\u201d</p> <p>Most BHS staff received very little redundancy pay, even though some had spent decades at the group.
