The manufacturer, Manganese Bronze, which is due to call in administrators this week, could face an investigation by the Financial Services Authority, or the Insolvency Service, if it is proved directors knew about the problems before informing the stock market in a timely manner. The RMT union, which represents black-cab drivers in London, said it was consulting lawyers about possible legal action to recoup any financial losses from the firm's collapse. The union has called on the London mayor, Boris Johnson, to suspend his scheme to ban any taxi which is more than 15 years old, due to the recall that is leaving fewer cabs on the road.

About 300 jobs at its Coventry plant, which has made the Hackney carriage for more than 100 years, are under threat. The first some drivers heard about the recall was when 18 TX4 vehicles were stopped by Transport for London from taking part in an annual trip to Disneyland Paris for sick children. A spokesman for the Johnson said: \"The mayor's team at Transport for London are in contact with Manganeze Bronze in order to establish the full implications of the company's decision to go into administration for cab drivers in London. \"To help drivers affected by the recent recall of vehicles we have temporarily suspended the requirement to source taxis from inside London, although all taxis operating in the capital will continue to have to meet the 15-year age limit.

It was Dick Olver, chairman of BAE, whose advice to the assembled worthies was to \"lead extraordinary change\". Change is what BAE needs, extraordinarily quickly, thinks the company's largest shareholder. Neil Woodford at Invesco Perpetual wants Olver out, plus the company's senior independent director, Sir Peter Mason. Woodford usually gets his way (just ask David Brennan, departed chief executive of AstraZeneca) and his fund's 13.3% shareholding represents a big obstacle to Olver's ambition of leaving in May 2014 after a decade at the helm. Olver clearly wants to try. BAE's position is that \"the majority of the company's principal shareholders\" are supportive. We'll see if that statement looks robust in, say, a fortnight's time. If it does, Olver may be able to dig in. If not, it's surely game over. Woodford's only wingmen at the moment are Artemis and Henderson. One purpose of their joint letter to the board, it would seem, was to encourage undecided shareholders to make up their minds. Three or four big-name recruits to the cause would probably be enough. Few chairmen can survive if opposition to their presence passes 20%. Olver's main problem is that he can't point to many recent successes. He's been at the helm for eight years but the share price currently stands at 2005 levels, depressed in part by the perception that BAE overpaid when buying United Defense Industries and Armor Holdings in the US. Those deals, and the sale in 2006 of the 20% stake in Airbus, set the company's course towards the US defence industry. But last month's proposal to merge with EADS was a belated embrace of the civilian market and Europe. Strategic confusion or free-thinking opportunism? That's one debate. Another is whether the opportunity ever really existed. The deal collapsed because of politics in Berlin but could have been felled by any number of other hurdles \u2013 not least the opposition of Woodford himself. Add it all up, and Olver's chances of staying until 2014 look about 50-50. Here's a view from an undeclared shareholder: \"The company is at a crossroads.

    "webTitle": "UK wellbeing still 13% below pre-crisis levels", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A mix of deep recession and high inflation has left national wellbeing in Britain more than 13% down on its level before the global financial crisis, according to new government data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the hit to real living standards caused by the worst downturn of the postwar era had been almost double the fall in national output as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). The governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, dropped a broad hint on Tuesday night that the latest growth figures due out on Thursday would show the UK was about to emerge from its double-dip recession. However, data released by the ONS on wellbeing showed that net national income per head (NNI) \u2013 considered to be the best guide to real living standards \u2013 held up in the early stages of the recession but has continued to drop as a result of the squeeze on family budgets from rising prices. The ONS said that NNI per head fell by 13.2% between the first three months of 2008 \u2013 when the economy peaked \u2013 and the second quarter of 2012. Over the same period, GDP per head fell by 7%. The figures indicate that the political battles over the \"squeezed middle\" will continue in the runup to the next election. Even if the data is adjusted to include the welfare state \u2013 especially important in Britain with the NHS \u2013 it still reveals a bleak picture. This figure, known as real household actual income per head, dropped in the second quarter of 2012 by 2.9% below its peak in the third quarter of 2009. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, a shadow Treasury minister, said: \"These figures show how the recovery from the global financial crisis we had two years ago has gone into reverse under this government. Families and pensioners are worse off because of the lack of jobs and growth under David Cameron's failing economic plan.\" According to the study, the decline in living standards has been more pronounced and longer lasting than in the UK's two previous recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s. NNI dropped by around 6% in the slump of the early 1980s, but was back to its pre-recession peak within three years. In the early 1990s, the decline was a more modest 4%, and the lost ground had been recouped in two and a half years. The ONS said the latest recession's longer decline \"was partially a result of unemployment not rising to the same extent as in the previous recession, and historic low interest rates reducing mortgage payments for those on tracker mortgages\". \"In contrast to the recovery from the 1990s recession,\" it said, \"as the economy emerged from the contraction that started in 2008, real household incomes began to fall; a downwards trend that continued to the start of 2012. The cause of this fall was primarily due to an increase in prices, such as fuel, utility bills and food.\" The data release marks a significant shift in the view of how UK economic changes affect people's wellbeing. Since 2008, when a report for the French government by economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi argued that governments should look at people's income and consumption to evaluate their \"wellbeing\" rather than at production to assess progress, countries have begun to use such measures to size up a nation's happiness. As the ONS admits: \"GDP was not designed as a measure of individual or national wellbeing \u2026 Living standards are more closely aligned with net national income (NNI) (the total income available to residents of that country) as GDP can expand at the same time as incomes decrease and vice versa.\" Speaking in Cardiff, King said that despite the \"probable\" increase in GDP it was clear \"that the recovery and rebalancing of the UK economy are proceeding at a slow and uncertain pace. At this stage, it is difficult to know whether some of the recent more positive signs will persist.\" He said the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee would think \"long and hard\" before deciding next month whether to create more electronic money through quantitative easing, the programme under which Threadneedle Street has purchased \u00a3375bn of gilts. \"But should those signs fade, the MPC does stand ready to inject more money into the economy\", King said, adding that there were no shortcuts to the necessary adjustment in the economy towards investment and exports. He dismissed the idea of handing cash to the public in \"helicopter drops\" of money, describing it as a backdoor way of relaxing the government's austerity strategy that risked either uncontrolled inflation or the eventual insolvency of the Bank of England. \"The problems in the world economy mean that we shall have to be patient,\" he said.",

The cause of this fall was primarily due to an increase in prices, such as fuel, utility bills and food.\"</p> <p>The data release marks a significant shift in the view of how UK economic changes affect people's wellbeing.</p> <p>Since 2008, when a <a href=\"http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">report for the French government by economists</a> Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi argued that governments should look at people's income and consumption to evaluate their \"wellbeing\" rather than at production to assess progress, countries have begun to use such measures to size up a nation's happiness.</p> <p>As the ONS admits: \"GDP was not designed as a measure of individual or national wellbeing \u2026 Living standards are more closely aligned with net national income (NNI) (the total income available to residents of that country) as GDP can expand at the same time as incomes decrease and vice versa.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Cardiff, King said that despite the \"probable\" increase in GDP it was clear \"that the recovery and rebalancing of the UK economy are proceeding at a slow and uncertain pace. At this stage, it is difficult to know whether some of the recent more positive signs will persist.\"</p> <p>He said the Bank's nine-strong monetary policy committee would think \"long and hard\" before deciding next month whether to create more electronic money through quantitative easing, the programme under which Threadneedle Street has purchased \u00a3375bn of gilts. \"But should those signs fade, the MPC does stand ready to inject more money into the economy\", King said, adding that there were no shortcuts to the necessary adjustment in the economy towards investment and exports.</p> <p>He dismissed the idea of handing cash to the public in \"helicopter drops\" of money, describing it as a backdoor way of relaxing the government's austerity strategy that risked either uncontrolled inflation or the eventual insolvency of the Bank of England. \"The problems in the world economy mean that we shall have to be patient,\" he said.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Costa Coffee bosses are perhaps wise not to hold their breath in expectation of hordes of tax campaigners, intellectuals and poets patronising its 1,479 cafes in protest at the tax affairs of rival operator Starbucks. Reminiscent of Paris's Left Bank they are not. Nevertheless, the latest YouGov brand preference survey suggests Costa is continuing to show a clean pair of heels to Starbucks in terms of the brand's ranking in the affections of British coffee drinkers. Conducted before last week's scrutiny of Starbucks's UK tax bill, it showed Costa jumping from 28% to 32% in terms of consumer preference in 2012. About half of the gain appeared to be at the expense of Starbucks, now on 23%. The next survey update, conducted at the end of this month, should make for interesting reading. It is no coincidence that Costa's parent group Whitbread has avoided the kind of tax acrobatics which last week provoked such outrage against Starbucks. The business has long resisted the siren calls of financial engineers promising an easy boost to the bottom line \u2013 and to boardroom bonuses. There is nothing overly clever or flashy about Whitbread. And this simple fact, with the benefit of hindsight, explains quite a lot about how the group has found itself a standout success story in Britain's embattled leisure industry. On Tuesday it delivered yet another strong set of results, with half-year revenue bursting through the \u00a31bn mark for the first time, despite a tough trading environment. Three years ago the figure was \u00a3700m. Much of that growth has been generated by new Costas and Premier Inns sprouting up across the UK, and many more overseas. There are 10,000 more British jobs promised from Whitbread over the next three years. Meanwhile, the shares have climbed 25% in the last six months, to more than \u00a323. It is hard to think of another FTSE 100 leisure company investing in its future, and creating British jobs, with such confidence. Come to think of it, these days it is hard to think of another FTSE 100 leisure company full stop. Aside from Intercontinental Hotel Group and Carnival \u2013 both largely focused overseas \u2013 Whitbread is the last remaining leisure group to form part of the blue-chip index. Relegation has been the story for pub groups Punch Taverns, Enterprise Inns, Mitchells &amp; Butlers as well as for bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrokes. Each has struggled, to a greater or lesser degree, with mountainous debts. Wind the clock back a few years and Whitbread too had been under tremendous investor pressure to follow its peers down this ill-advised path. Whether by luck or foresight, it did not. If Whitbread has outperformed its British-listed peers, the contrast with other competitors is even more stark. Starbucks is now mired in controversy about whether or not it has been meaningfully profitable in the UK for the last 14 years. Meanwhile, Premier Inn's closest rival Travelodge, a private equity-backed business, has presided over a calamitous destruction of value and was forced into a rescue deal with landlords last month. Another painful debt restructuring is expected to play out at David Lloyd Leisure, the debt-laden gym and tennis club business acquired by Lloyds Banking Group and property tycoons Richard and Ian Livingstone. It had had conservative borrowings when part of Whitbread. But when five years ago Whitbread received a staggering, debt-fuelled offer for the business of \u00a3925m it had little option but to hand the clubs over to the stewardship of the financial wizards. Even in better times those at the top of Whitbread have never enjoyed anything close to the pay windfalls seen at competitors \u2013 which then went on to fare so poorly. But better builders of long-term shareholder value, in the leisure sector at least, you will struggle to find.",

Reminiscent of Paris's Left Bank they are not.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the latest YouGov brand preference survey suggests Costa is continuing to show a clean pair of heels to Starbucks in terms of the brand's ranking in the affections of British coffee drinkers. Conducted before last week's scrutiny of Starbucks's UK tax bill, it showed Costa jumping from 28% to 32% in terms of consumer preference in 2012. About half of the gain appeared to be at the expense of Starbucks, now on 23%. The next survey update, conducted at the end of this month, should make for interesting reading.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that Costa's parent group Whitbread has avoided the kind of tax acrobatics which last week provoked such <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/21/starbucks-tax-ps-wake-up-smell-coffee?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">outrage against Starbucks</a>. The business has long resisted the siren calls of financial engineers promising an easy boost to the bottom line \u2013 and to boardroom bonuses.</p> <p>There is nothing overly clever or flashy about Whitbread. And this simple fact, with the benefit of hindsight, explains quite a lot about how the group has found itself a standout success story in Britain's embattled leisure industry.

Three years ago the figure was \u00a3700m.</p> <p>Much of that growth has been generated by new Costas and Premier Inns sprouting up across the UK, and many more overseas.

But it's really just less bad, rather than good.</p> <p>The European commission said confidence edged up from -25.9 points in September to -25.6 this month. That's the eurozone figure. In the wider European Union confidence fell from -24 to -24.2. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>October\u2019s marginal rise in consumer confidence followed a marked overall decline through the previous four months and sentiment is still at its second lowest level since May 2009. Furthermore, it follows on from other latest surveys showing drops in business confidence in October in both France and Belgium.</p> <p>The likelihood is therefore that Eurozone consumers will remain extremely careful in their spending in the fourth quarter, and the suspicion is that the single currency area will struggle markedly to avoid further GDP contraction. This would highly likely be a third successive GDP decline as we estimate that GDP fell by around 0.2%-0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter after a drop of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.</p> <p>Certainly, the economic fundamentals currently make up a largely unhealthy cocktail for consumer spending across the eurozone - high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tightening fiscal policy in many countries. Furthermore, Eurozone consumer price inflation moved back up to 2.6% in September and August from 2.4% in July, thereby adding to the squeeze on their purchasing power. On top of this, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis likely remains a serious concern for many consumers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:54:26.214Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a28b58f96784ee2909e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:01:44.413Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Latest from Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the Greek coalition government's meeting continues (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/23/eurozone-crisis-greek-cuts-spanish-bailout#block-50868cc3c0e343ef1abc7f3f\">see 13.25</a>), politicians have been discussing the need to agree the cuts demanded by the Troika (our Athens correspondent <strong>Helena Smith</strong> reports)</p> <p>Development minister <strong>Costis Hadjidakis</strong> set the scene for further painful austerity by predicting:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Winning] the next aid instalment is a national effort that we are doomed to win</p> </blockquote> <p>adding that \u201cLiquidity is key.\u201d</p> <p>But main opposition leader <strong>Alexis Tsipras</strong> said while Greece needed the money \u201cnot one euro will go to the real economy\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, he said, almost all of the \u20ac31.5bn instalment will go to banks which stand to be recapitalised to the tune of \u20ac25bn.</p> <p><em>And with that, my colleague Nick Fletcher will see you home.

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed and, with little progress in the eurozone, disappointing earnings from US corporate giants have been a major influence. And not a good influence at that: \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 85 points lower at 5797.91 (more here) \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 2.11% \u2022 France's Cac has closed 2.2% lower \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is off 1.81% \u2022 Spain's Ibex has lost 1.64% \u2022 The Athens market has fallen 2.29% \u2022 And the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently off 230 points or 1.7% And ahead of the representatives of one region wanting autonomy (Barcelona) taking on another (Celtic) in the Champions League, it's time to draw a curtain on the blog for another day. Back tomorrow and, as usual, thanks for all your comments. And here's another likely cause of disagreement among the EU member states. Ten EU states have given their backing to the financial transaction tax - which would be paid by institutions - which has been welcomed by EU president Jose Manuel Barroso. Proponents say it would raise billions of euros at a time when countries are - obviously - cash strapped. Opponents say it would have a negative effect on jobs and growth. The 10 in favour are France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. No respite for the markets as they head for the close. Here's Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads: An ugly session for equity markets has unfolded today as sellers drove stocks lower on the back of some disappointing corporate earnings released today. With a lack of macro economic data releases the focus has been very much on companies and there were some car crash type profit warnings and well below expectation results which sent investors into risk aversion mode. The sell off was broad based as risk assets got hit hard with commodities and the riskier currencies like the euro all being subjected to a pressing of the sell button. The move today has almost completely wiped out the gains that have been built up over the last week or so and are a stark reminder that markets can have a nasty way of reversing their course and quickly. It has also dawned on investors that the good results in the regional Spanish elections for prime minister Rajoy mean that he may not request a bailout as soon as many had hoped, something that had under pinned the recent gains in stock markets. With several failed attempts at getting above and beyond the near term resistance the bulls\u2019 ability to maintain upward momentum is being called into question. If you were a government who was not keen on one of its regions (let's call it Catalonia, for the sake of argument) seeking independence, and you saw another part of a united kingdom holding a referendum about one of its constituent parts splitting away, what would you say publicly? News in from our correspondent Helena Smith who confirms that Greece's politicial leaders have failed to make headway on the draconian \u20ac13.5bn package of spending cuts the debt-stricken country has been set as a condition for further aid. Fotis Kouvellis, who heads the tripartite government's Democratic Left party, has emerged from more than two hours of talks saying that labour reforms remain the biggest stumbling block. The leftist leader described as \"unacceptable\" the demands being placed on Greece by its \"troika\" of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. \"These demands [for mass layoffs, cuts in severance pay and reduction of the minimum wage] will be of no fiscal benefit for our country ... they will simply feed unemployment and further burden a recession that is already huge,\" he said. \"My position is unchanged. I will not agree to them.\" It appears the talks are now over for the day and it is, as yet, unclear when the leaders will meet again. Aides are now saying that Kouvellis' position makes it very difficult for socialist Pasok party leader Evangelos Venizelos to agree to the reforms. Perhaps surprisingly, given everything that's been happening, it appears that eurozone consumer confidence improved in October, albeit marginally. But it's really just less bad, rather than good. The European commission said confidence edged up from -25.9 points in September to -25.6 this month. That's the eurozone figure. In the wider European Union confidence fell from -24 to -24.2. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: October\u2019s marginal rise in consumer confidence followed a marked overall decline through the previous four months and sentiment is still at its second lowest level since May 2009. Furthermore, it follows on from other latest surveys showing drops in business confidence in October in both France and Belgium. The likelihood is therefore that Eurozone consumers will remain extremely careful in their spending in the fourth quarter, and the suspicion is that the single currency area will struggle markedly to avoid further GDP contraction. This would highly likely be a third successive GDP decline as we estimate that GDP fell by around 0.2%-0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter after a drop of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Certainly, the economic fundamentals currently make up a largely unhealthy cocktail for consumer spending across the eurozone - high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tightening fiscal policy in many countries. Furthermore, Eurozone consumer price inflation moved back up to 2.6% in September and August from 2.4% in July, thereby adding to the squeeze on their purchasing power. On top of this, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis likely remains a serious concern for many consumers. As the Greek coalition government's meeting continues (see 13.25), politicians have been discussing the need to agree the cuts demanded by the Troika (our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports) Development minister Costis Hadjidakis set the scene for further painful austerity by predicting: [Winning] the next aid instalment is a national effort that we are doomed to win adding that \u201cLiquidity is key.\u201d But main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras said while Greece needed the money \u201cnot one euro will go to the real economy\u201d. Instead, he said, almost all of the \u20ac31.5bn instalment will go to banks which stand to be recapitalised to the tune of \u20ac25bn. And with that, my colleague Nick Fletcher will see you home. Cheers all. GW Shares have fallen sharply at the start of trading in New York, as today's stock market sell-off accelerates. Here's the damage: Dow Jones Industrial Average: down 184 points at 13158, - 1.4% FTSE 100: down 79 points at 5803, -1.3% German DAX: down 124 points at 7203, -1.7% French CAC: down 63 points at 3419, -1.8% Spanish IBEX: down 154 points at 7723, - 1.95% Italian FTSE MIB: down 305 points at 15558, -1.92% Recent disappointing corporate results are being blamed -- earlier today DuPont and United Technologies both released results that didn't meet expectations. We've seen several companies miss forecasts in recent days, including Microsoft and Google, leaving investors worried that the US economy is weaker than thought. Greece has received some welcome news today. Three years after triggering the eurozone debt crisis, Greek competitiveness is on the up. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports. Today\u2019s talks may be crucial and the climate nothing if not tense, but they come on a day when Athens has also achieved something of a breakthrough. \u201cFor the first time we have some good news with the World Bank in its annual report referring to the progress Greece has made in rendering its economy more competitive,\u201d said Kostis Hadzidakis, the country\u2019s powerful development minister. \u201cFrom being ranked 100th last year in terms of ease of doing business, Greece has jumped to 78th place, one of the biggest leaps globally,\u201d added the minister following talks with Horst Reichenbach, who heads the special EU taskforce assigned to the country. The World Bank singled out Greece\u2019s progress in doing away with time-consuming bureaucracy required for construction permits and dogged efforts to make business more transparent. Hadzikakis said the plaudits would help lure investors \u2013 which the insolvent nation so desperately needs. But to take advantage of this competitiveness, Greece needs a better functioning banking system: And while we're looking at photos from Athens, here's a snap of Fotis Kouvelis, leader of the Democratic Left party, arriving at parliament for this afternoon's crunch meeting over the Greek cuts package, around an hour ago (see 13.25). At least two different protests have been taking place in Athens today. Students, including some studying art and music, gathered outside the Greek parliament to demonstrate against budget cuts affecting education spending and transport to schools. Here are a few photos: Elsewhere in the capital, another demonstration against changes in the benefits paid to people with disabilities was taking place, protesting against plans to suspend disability pensions and benefits until they are re-evaluated by the Disability Certification Centres (KEPA). Similar demonstrations were held in 36 other cities outside KEPA offices. Over in Athens, the meeting over this afternoon's cuts package has just begun. Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos and finance minister Yannis Stournaras were spied arriving at the parliament building a few minutes ago, our own Helena Smith reports. NET the state-run network says the time for final decisions over the painful package of measures has come.... Here's a clip of WIlliam Hague in Berlin today. William Hague, Britain's foreign secretary, was warned today that the push for closer political and economic union in Europe will not be pushed off course by Britain's push to repatriate powers from Brussels. During Hague's visit to Berlin (see 9.15am), Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said doubters cannot stand in the way of the integration process. Westerwelle said: All are welcome to contribute their ideas. But if anyone does not want to come along or cannot come along, it will not prevent the rest from going on ahead. That goes for travel freedom in the Schengen zone, that goes for the common currency and I believe it also goes for common foreign and security policy. Finland's Europe minister, Alexander Stubb, also urged Britain to join Europe's new banking union, saying: William, please, join the banking union, don't sit on the fence - we need you. Joining the European banking union is certainly not on the UK's agenda. The fear for the City, though, is that its dominant position in the EU financial services marketplace could be undermined. Mats Persson of Open Europe wrote about the issues in this article: Britain and the banking union: not in the euro but run by the euro? Here's a flavour: For Britain \u2013 and other non-eurozone countries \u2013 there are two risks: first, that the eurozone 17 starts to write the rules for all 27 member states, using an inbuilt majority in the EU\u2019s voting system. Not in the euro, but run by the euro, to paraphrase the famous slogan. Secondly, that the ECB imposes requirements on firms to be supervised by eurozone authorities in order to do business in the eurozone, effectively pushing the City of London \u201coffshore\u201d. Back to Greece, where government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou has warned that an agreement must be reached over its \u20ac13.5bn cuts package by the close of play tomorrow. Appearing on Skai TV, Kedikoglou said: We must reach an agreement today or Wednesday. He added that there was no alternative to making the deep spending cuts, job losses and revenue-raising measures in the package: The government's plan is the only realistic rescue plan for the country, there is no other realistic alternative proposal. The meeting between Antonis Samaras, Greece's prime minister, and the two junior leaders of his coalition is due to start in around 45 minutes \u2013 at 3pm Greek time / 1pm BST. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is due to appear before the Bundestag on Wednesday, and J\u00fcrgen Stark, the ECB's former chief economist, has already fired a few warning shots at him. Stark, who quit the ECB in 2011, has cautioned that Draghi will need watertight arguments and solid analysis to defend his Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme against German MPs. In an interview with Handelsblatt (in German), Stark said Draghi will encounter criticism from MPs who fear his promise of unlimited bond-buying is a fiscal programme. Stark also told Reuters that the Bundestag won't be convinced by a breezy assurance from Draghi that OMT comes within the ECB's mandate, adding: The planned bond purchases go beyond the ECB mandate, and Draghi has to come up with more convincing reasons than so far. Stark went on to warn that the ECB risks becoming a \"prisoner of politics\". The full Reuters interview is online here. Shares are down across Europe's major stock markets this morning: FTSE 100: down 41 points at 5841, -0.7% German DAX: down 58 points at 7269, -0.8% French CAC: down 17 points at 3465, - 0.5% Spanish IBEX: down 54 points at 7822, - 0.66% Italian FTSE MIB: down 105 points at 15761, -0.66% A clutch of disappointing corporate results have hit sentiment in the markets \u2013 this morning, Swedish engineering group Alfa Laval posted weaker-than-expected earnings. Moody's decision to downgrade five Spanish regions is also being blamed, according to IG's David Madden, who explains: Stocks are in the red across Europe this morning after rating agency Moody\u2019s downgraded five Spanish regions. The credit rating for the Spanish government remains unchanged at one notch above junk status but this will still put pressure on the Madrid government, because the semi-autonomous regions will need to lean on Madrid even more. The French government may announce an aid package for struggling carmaker Peugeot today. Reports from Paris suggest Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government would underwrite new loans for Peugeot\u2019s financing arm, in return for giving the government and workers groups a place on its board. The French government also wants Peugeot to reverse some of the 8,000 job cuts it announced this summer. Industry minister Arnaud Montebourg told Liberation today that Peugeot should cancel \"hundreds\" of planned job cuts and also pledge not to close French factories. Peugeot had initially rebuffed the French government's criticism over its job cuts plan, insisting that the downsizing was essential. Montebourg's comment suggest that the company's need for aid has given the politicians more influence. Bloomberg has more details. Commerzbank strategist Michael Leister says Spanish bond yields are rising today (see 8.53am) because bond traders see little evidence of an imminent Spanish bailout request. Leister told Reuters this morning: The market is realising that the momentum we had with a lot of events last week will most likely not be followed up by a quick aid request by Spain and that's prompting some profit- taking. We don't expect a sharp correction but a bit of a pullback. The Spanish treasury conducted an auction of short-term debt this morning, raising more money than forecast \u2013 but seeing borrowing costs rise on one type of bond. Here's the details: \u2022 \u20ac3.53bn raised in three and six-month bonds, v target of \u20ac2.5bn-\u20ac3.5bn \u2022 Yield (interest rate on the bond) on 3-month bonds rose to 1.41%, from 1.203% at the previous audience \u2022 Yield on 6-month bonds fell to 2.023%, from 2.213% last time. The bid-to-cover ratios for both bond types rose, showing there were more bids than at the previous auction. So, a mixed picture, but nothing that will alarm Madrid. Conservative Home has published an interesting article about William Hague's warning today that the UK public's unhappiness with Europe is at record levels (see 9.15am). In it, Paul Goodman argues that David Cameron is being dragged \"unwillingly and unhappily\" towards an in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership. If (as seems very plausible), Cameron's bid for powers to be repatriated is rejected, then those pushing for Britain to leave the Union could triumph. Here's a flavour: There are those who would have a poll now, believing that the British people would vote to pull out. And there are those who, like David Davis and Liam Fox, seem to believe that the electorate would vote to stay in - but that this verdict would change were it hammered home to voters that the EU they want, the free trade arrangement for which some of them voted in 1975, is not on offer. The means of driving that message home that they appear to foresee is the rejection of a repatriation of powers package by those other EU countries. This, they seem to think, would swing a referendum from a yes vote to no.... More Spanish gloom: the Bank of Spain has predicted that the country's economy shrank by 0.4% in the third quarter of 2012, matching the decline in the previous three months. That would mean the Spanish economy was 1.7% smaller than a year ago, showing the impact of the eurozone crisis and the country's tough austerity package. Britain's increasingly troubled relationship with the rest of the European Union has come under scrutiny again today, with foreign secretary William Hague warning that public disillusionment has reached new levels. Hague was due to tell an audience in Berlin that the UK is determined to achieve a different relationship with the EU, with many people feeling that \"the EU is something that is done to them\". My colleague Patrick Wintour reported last night that Hague will tell Berlin that: People feel that the EU is a one-way process, a great machine that sucks up decision-making from national parliaments to the European level until everything is decided by the EU. That needs to change. If we cannot show that decision-making can flow back to national parliaments, then the system will become democratically unsustainable. And a photo of Hague speaking in Germany just landed: The timing of Hague's trip to Berlin is interesting, with the UK and Germany at odds over the next EU budget. As we wrote yesterday, David Cameron is insisting that spending is frozen in real terms - leaving him isolated in Europe, with MPs demanding an in-out referendum on Britain's future in the EU. Hague also repeated the UK's demands for the single market to be completed across Europe. But his German counterpart, Guido Westwelle, argued that EU nations must avoid the renationalisation of EU policy. Hague's call for some powers to be repatriated back to national parliaments is at odds with the general mood in Europe, and the push towards closer political union. It all adds to the sense of Britain being left further behind, and possibly dropping out of the pack altogether.... Overnight Moody's cut its credit rating on five Spanish regions, in the latest dent to Spain's economic prospects. Two regions, Extremadura and Andalucia, were pushed into non-investment (or 'junk') status. \u2022 Catalonia: a 2-notch downgrade from Ba1 to Ba3 (the third-highest 'junk' rating) \u2022 Extremadura: a 1-notch downgrade from Baa3 to Ba1 (the highest 'junk' rating) \u2022 Andalucia: a 2-notch downgrade from Baa3 to Ba2 (the second-highest 'junk' rating) \u2022 Castilla-La Mancha: a 1-notch downgrade from Ba2 to Ba3. \u2022 Murcia: a 2-notch downgrade from Ba1 to Ba3. Moody's warned that the regions have suffered deteriorating \"liquidity positions\" in recent months, and that Catalonia, Andalucia and Murcia all face debt repayments before the end of 2012. The move puts more pressure on the central Spanish government's finances, as several regions have already applied for financial help from its bailout funding facility. Spanish sovereign debt has slipped in early trading, pushing up the yield on its 10-year bonds by 3 basis points (or 0.03%) to 5.55%. Hedge funds have been piling into Greek government bonds over the last few months, the Wall Street Journal reports today. Despite the deepening recession, regular public protests, the rise of extremist political parties and ongoing uncertainty over its financial aid programme, some investors have concluded that Greece's sovereign debt is a decent bet. Why? Some 'hedgies' reckon that the risk of a disorderly default has been overplayed, having seen prices of Greek bonds hit extremely low levels earlier this year. The WSJ explains: Greek bonds....represent a rare chance to own debt of a European nation for a pittance. \"You don't get a lot of opportunities like these,\" says Greylock's Hans Humes, noting his portfolio is about 20% Greek debt. Third Point, run by hedge-fund investor Daniel Loeb, has made several hundred million dollars in paper profits after buying Greek government debt in July and August, according to an investor. The firm bought the debt at 17 cents on the euro after it determined Greece was unlikely to leave the euro. Although Greece isn't close to issuing new long-term debt, the involvement of the hedge funds could be valuable. Private investors holding Greek debt may put pressure on Athens and the Troika not to persist with overly tough cutbacks if they believe their money is at risk. Indeed Charles Dallara, head of the IIF (which represented Greece's creditors in March's debt restructuring) warned this month that austerity was driving the country backwards and called for its bailout terms to be relaxed. Today's talks between the Greek coalition leaders are pretty crucial, as Greece is (once again) facing a race against time to achieve the next slice of its bailout package before running out of money. The \u20ac13.5bn cuts package demanded by the Troika (the ECB, the EU and the IMF) needs to be approved by parliament by 12 November. That's the date when eurozone finance ministers meet to decide whether Greece should get its next aid tranche, worth \u20ac31.45bn. Athens cannot afford to miss this deadline \u2013 it is expected to run out of funds by 16 November. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Attention is focused on Greece today, where the leaders of the three parties in its coalition government are meeting in an attempt to finalise the details of its \u20ac13.5bn austerity package. Prime minister Antonis Samaras, Pasok head Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis of Democratic Left must agree the remaining details of the cuts package...and decide when to take it to parliament. Several issues are unresolved despite the weeks of negotiations between Athens and its Troika of lenders. Samaras, Venizelos and Kouvelis must consider the Troika's demands for reforms to employment law, including cutting compensation for sacked workers. Further job cuts are also on the table, as Greek newspapaper Kathimerini reports: The troika has reportedly dropped its demands for the immediate layoffs of 15,000 civil servants but is said to be insisting on the sacking of at least 5,000 public sector workers by the end of the year \u2013 either through a labor reserve scheme or through permanent dismissal \u2013 with another 5,000 to go in the first quarter of 2013. There are also rumours that the two sides may have agreed to lower Greece's privatisation target, to \u20ac10bn by 2016 and \u20ac25bn by 2020. The original goal of raising \u20ac50bn by 2015 now appears to be too much of a stretch. The three leaders are due to meet from 1pm BST, or 3pm EEST. We'll be tracking developments in Athens through the day. Elsewhere today, the waiting game over Spain's possible bailout continues. Last night Moody's downgraded five Spanish regions, further highlighting the country's economic problems. But there's still no sign that Madrid is ready to request financial help....",

Against this background we expect to continue to outperform our competitors and like for like sales growth to be more moderate than the high levels achieved in the first half. </blockquote> <p>The company's shares are down 55p to \u00a322.68 and James Hollins at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Whitbread's first half was marginally behind our estimates and there is no impetus from the trading outlook statement to warrant a 2013 forecast increase. The strong first half top-line performance is unlikely to be replicated in the second six months and we retain our bear stance given our negative view on the group's UK hotels and restaurants returns and limited international hotel growth opportunities. Costa remains an exciting story, but, for superior long-term group growth and returns, we prefer InterContinental. </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/23/mulberry-shares-crash-profits-warning\" title=\"\">profit warning from luxury goods group</a> <strong>Mulberry</strong> indicated the problems were more widespread, and the news hit Burberry shares, down 47p at \u00a311.25. Burberry itself issued a warning on trading in early September.</p> <p>Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities said Mulberry's UK performance was fine, with the difficulties mainly in overseas markets, particularly Asia:</p> <blockquote> We think that these international problems are becoming a developing trend in retail and in general.

      "bodyText": "Worries about economic growth are to the fore again, after a couple of consumer groups warned on the outlook. Whitbread, the Premier Inn, Beefeater and Costa Coffee business, said first half profits had climbed by 11% and revenues by 14%, but chief executive Andy Harrison sounded a note of caution: Our consumer market context continues to be broadly flat. Against this background we expect to continue to outperform our competitors and like for like sales growth to be more moderate than the high levels achieved in the first half. The company's shares are down 55p to \u00a322.68 and James Hollins at Investec said: Whitbread's first half was marginally behind our estimates and there is no impetus from the trading outlook statement to warrant a 2013 forecast increase. The strong first half top-line performance is unlikely to be replicated in the second six months and we retain our bear stance given our negative view on the group's UK hotels and restaurants returns and limited international hotel growth opportunities. Costa remains an exciting story, but, for superior long-term group growth and returns, we prefer InterContinental. A profit warning from luxury goods group Mulberry indicated the problems were more widespread, and the news hit Burberry shares, down 47p at \u00a311.25. Burberry itself issued a warning on trading in early September. Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities said Mulberry's UK performance was fine, with the difficulties mainly in overseas markets, particularly Asia: We think that these international problems are becoming a developing trend in retail and in general. The first inkling of this came from Tesco at their interims (we had to take overseas targets down by 20% earlier in the month). We would emphasise our view that Mulberry trades in a different market to the parts of the retail sector that we cover. However the wider picture will make us keep an eye on developments at Ted Baker and Supergroup in particular, and to a degree Mothercare and Asos. Read-across for Burberry would be negative too. With this negative news, investors were shying away from risk once more, so mining and banking shares were unwanted. Kazakhmys is down 30.5p at 726p as metal prices fall on worries about falling Chinese demand, while Royal Bank of Scotland has fallen 4.5p to 277p.
